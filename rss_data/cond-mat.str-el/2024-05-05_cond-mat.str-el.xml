      <title>Dynamical Freezing in Exactly Solvable Models of Driven Chaotic Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive, non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However, in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals. The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a high-frequency expansion.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineered inhomogeneous quantum chaos in critical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study universal chaotic dynamics of a large class of periodically driven critical systems described by spatially inhomogeneous conformal field theories. By employing an effective curved spacetime approach, we show that the onset of quantum chaotic correlations, captured by the Lyapunov exponent of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), is set by the Hawking temperature of emergent Floquet horizons. Furthermore, scrambling of quantum information is shown to be strongly inhomogeneous, leading to transitions from chaotic to non-chaotic regimes by tuning driving parameters. We finally use our framework to propose a concrete protocol to simulate and measure OTOCs in quantum simulators, by designing an efficient stroboscopic backward time evolution.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation induced piezomagnetism in local moment altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently discovered that, depending on their symmetries, collinear antiferromagnets may break spin degeneracy in momentum space, even in absence of spin-orbit coupling. Such systems, dubbed altermagnets, have electronic bands with a spin-momentum texture set mainly by the combined crystal-magnetic symmetry. This discovery motivates the question which novel physical properties derive from altermagnetic order. Here we show that one consequence of altermagnetic order is a fluctuation-driven piezomagnetic response. Using the checkerboard Heisenberg hamiltonian as a prototypical localized moment altermagnet, we determine its fluctuation induced piezomagnetic coefficient considering temperature induced transversal spin fluctuations. We establish in addition that magnetic fluctuations induce an anisotropic thermal spin conductivity.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Conducting Boundary Channels in 1T-TaS$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials that transition between metal and insulator, the two opposing states that distinguish all solids, are fascinating because they underlie many mysteries in the physics of the solid state. In 1T-TaS$_{2}$, the metal-insulator transition is linked to a series of metastable states of a chiral charge density wave whose basic nature is still an open question. In this work, we show that pulses of current through these materials create current-carrying boundary channels that distinguish the metallic and insulating states. We demonstrate electrical control of these channels' properties, suggesting their formation could be due to the complex interplay of the formation of domain walls and the viscous flow of electrons. Our findings show that physical boundaries play a key role in the properties of the metastable states of the metal-insulator transition, highlighting new possibilities for in-situ electrical design and active manipulation of electrical components.</description>

      <title>Spiral Spin Liquid Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: No state of matter can be defined categorically by what it is not; yet spin liquids are often conjectured to exist based on the nonexistence of magnetic order as $T \to 0$. An emerging concept designed to circumvent this ambiguity is to categorically identify each spin liquid type by using its spectrum of spontaneous spin noise. Here we introduce such a spectroscopy to spin liquid studies by considering Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$. This is a spin liquid, but whether classical or quantum and in which specific state, are unknown. By enhancing the flux-noise spectrometry techniques introduced for magnetic monopole noise studies, here we measure the time and temperature dependence of spontaneous flux $\varPhi(t,T)$ and thus magnetization $M(t,T)$ of Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$ samples. The resulting power spectral density of magnetization noise $S_M(\omega,T)$ along with its correlation function $C_M(t,T)$, reveal intense spin fluctuations spanning frequencies $0.1\ \mathrm{Hz} \leq \omega/2\pi \leq 50\ \mathrm{kHz}$, and that $S_M(\omega,T)\propto \omega^{-\alpha(T)}$ with $0.84 &lt; \alpha(T) &lt; 1.04$. Predictions for quantum spin liquids yield a frequency-independent spin-noise spectrum, clearly inconsistent with this phenomenology However, when compared to Monte Carlo simulations for a 2D spiral spin liquid state that are accurately parameterized to describe Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$, comprehensive quantitative correspondence with the data including $S_M(\omega,T)$, $C_M(t,T)$ and magnetization variance $\sigma_M^2(T)$ fingerprint the state of Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$ as a spiral spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Fractonic criticality in Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractonic matter can undergo unconventional phase transitions driven by the condensation of particles that move along subdimensional manifolds. We propose that this type of quantum critical point can be realized in a bilayer of crossed Rydberg chains. This system exhibits a transition between a disordered phase and a charge-density-wave phase with subextensive ground state degeneracy. The transition is described by a stack of critical Ising conformal field theories that become decoupled in the low-energy limit due to emergent subsystem symmetries. We discuss the unusual scaling properties and derive anisotropic correlators that provide signatures of subdimensional criticality in a realistic setup.</description>

      <title>Theoretical studies on off-axis phase diagrams and Knight shifts in UTe$_2$ -- Tetra-critical point, d-vector rotation, and multiple phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent remarkable sets of experiments on UTe$_2$: discoveries of the fourth horizontal internal transition line running toward a tetra-critical point (TCP) at $H$=15T, the off-axis high field phases, and abnormally large Knight shift (KS) drop below $T_{\rm c}$ for $H$$\parallel$$a$-magnetic easy axis, we advance further our theoretical work on the field ($H$)-temperature ($T$) phase diagram for $H$$\parallel$$b$-magnetic hard axis which contains a positive sloped $H_{\rm c2}$ departing from TCP. A nonunitary spin-triplet pairing with three components explains these experimental facts simultaneously and consistently by assuming that the underlying normal electron system with a narrow bandwidth characteristic to the Kondo temperature $\sim$60K unsurprisingly breaks the particle-hole symmetry. This causes a special invariant term in Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free energy functional which couples directly with the 5f magnetic system, giving rise to the $T_{\rm c}$ splitting and ultimately to the positive sloped $H_{\rm c2}$ and the horizontal internal transition line connected to TCP. The large KS drop can be understood in terms of this GL invariance whose coefficient is negative and leads to a diamagnetic response where the Cooper pair spin is antiparallel to the applied field direction. The present scenario also accounts for the observed d-vector rotation phenomena and off-axis phase diagrams with extremely high $H_{\rm c2}$$\gtrsim$70T found at angles in between the $b$ and $c$-axes and between the $bc$ plane and $a$-axis, making UTe$_2$ a fertile playground for a topological superconductor.</description>

      <title>Anomalous transport in the quantum East-West kinetically constrained model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a chaotic particle-conserving kinetically constrained model, with a single parameter which allows us to break reflection symmetry. Through extensive numerical simulations we find that the domain wall state shows a variety of dynamical behaviors from localization all the way to ballistic transport, depending on the value of the reflection breaking parameter. Surprisingly, such anomalous behavior is not mirrored in infinite-temperature dynamics, which appear to scale diffusively, in line with expectations for generic interacting models. However, studying the particle density gradient, we show that the lack of reflection symmetry affects infinite-temperature dynamics, resulting in an asymmetric dynamical structure factor. This is in disagreement with normal diffusion and suggests that the model may also exhibit anomalous dynamics at infinite temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we observe low-entangled eigenstates in the spectrum of the model, a telltale sign of quantum many body scars.</description>

      <title>Piezoresistivity as an Order Parameter for Ferroaxial Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in the understanding of the collective behavior of electrons and ions have revealed new types of ferroic orders beyond ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, such as the ferroaxial state. The latter retains only rotational symmetry around a single axis and reflection symmetry with respect to a single mirror plane, both of which are set by an emergent electric toroidal dipole moment. Due to this unusual symmetry-breaking pattern, it has been challenging to directly measure the ferroaxial order parameter, despite the increasing attention this state has drawn. Here, we show that off-diagonal components of the piezoresistivity tensor (i.e., the linear change in resistivity under strain) transform the same way as the ferroaxial moments, providing a direct probe of such order parameters. We identify two new proper ferroaxial materials through a materials database search, and use first-principles calculations to evaluate the piezoconductivity of the double-perovskite CaSnF$_6$, revealing its connection to ferroaxial order and to octahedral rotation modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1909.12126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study structurally-triggered metal-insulator transition in CaCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ by means of local density approximation (LDA) +$U$ and LDA+dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The ferrimagnetic insulating phase is essentially the same within both approaches. While LDA+$U$ describes the metal-insulator transition as a Peierls-like instability driven by Fermi surface nesting in the magnetically ordered phase, LDA+DMFT allows also the site-selective Mott transition without magnetic ordering as well as smooth crossover between the two pictures. We point out similarities and differences to rare-earth nickelates.</description>

      <title>Entanglement negativity between separated regions in quantum critical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15273v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the entanglement between disjoint subregions in quantum critical systems through the lens of the logarithmic negativity. We work with systems in arbitrary dimensions, including conformal field theories and their corresponding lattice Hamiltonians, as well as resonating valence-bond states. At small separations, the logarithmic negativity is big and displays universal behavior, but we show non-perturbatively that it decays faster than any power at large separations. This can already be seen in the minimal setting of single-spin subregions. The corresponding absence of distillable entanglement at large separations generalizes the 1d result, and indicates that quantum critical groundstates do not possess long-range bipartite entanglement, at least for bosons. For systems with fermions, a more suitable definition of the logarithmic negativity exists that takes into account fermion parity, and we show that it decays algebraically. Along the way we obtain general results for the moments of the partially transposed density matrix.</description>

      <title>A Long Exact Sequence in Symmetry Breaking: order parameter constraints, defect anomaly-matching, and higher Berry phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study defects in symmetry breaking phases, such as domain walls, vortices, and hedgehogs. In particular, we focus on the localized gapless excitations which sometimes occur at the cores of these objects. These are topologically protected by an 't Hooft anomaly. We classify different symmetry breaking phases in terms of the anomalies of these defects, and relate them to the anomaly of the broken symmetry by an anomaly-matching formula. We also derive the obstruction to the existence of a symmetry breaking phase with a local defect. We obtain these results using a long exact sequence of groups of invertible field theories, which we call the "symmetry breaking long exact sequence" (SBLES). The mathematical backbone of the SBLES is studied in a companion paper. Our work further develops the theory of higher Berry phase and its bulk-boundary correspondence, and serves as a new computational tool for classifying symmetry protected topological phases.</description>

      <title>Go Green: Selected Configuration Interaction as a More Sustainable Alternative for High Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new distributed implementation of the full configuration interaction (FCI) method has been reported [Gao et al. J. Chem Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 1185]. Thanks to a hybrid parallelization scheme, the authors were able to compute the exact energy of propane (\ce{C3H8}) in the minimal basis STO-3G. This formidable task involves handling an active space of 26 electrons in 23 orbitals or a Hilbert space of \SI{1.3d12} determinants. This is, by far, the largest FCI calculation reported to date. Here, we illustrate how, from a general point of view, selected configuration interaction (SCI) can achieve microhartree accuracy at a fraction of the computational and memory cost, via a sparse exploration of the FCI space. The present SCI calculations are performed with the \textit{Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection made Iteratively} (CIPSI) algorithm, as implemented in a determinant-driven way in the \textsc{quantum package} software. The present study reinforces the common wisdom that among the exponentially large number of determinants in the FCI space, only a tiny fraction of them significantly contribute to the energy. More importantly, it demonstrates the feasibility of achieving comparable accuracy using more reasonable and sustainable computational resources, hence reducing the ever-growing carbon footprint of computational chemistry.</description>

Abstract: We study thermodynamic phase transitions between integrable and chaotic dynamics. We do so by analyzing models that interpolate between the chaotic double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) and the integrable $p$-spin systems, in a limit where they are described by chord diagrams. We develop a path integral formalism by coarse graining over the diagrams, which we use to argue that the system has two distinct phases: one is continuously connected to the chaotic system, and the other to the integrable. They are separated by a line of first order transition that ends at a critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study transitions from chaotic to integrable Hamiltonians in the double scaled SYK and $p$-spin systems. The dynamics of our models is described by chord diagrams with two species. We begin by developing a path integral formalism of coarse graining chord diagrams with a single species of chords, which has the same equations of motion as the bi-local ($G\Sigma$) Liouville action, yet appears otherwise to be different and in particular well defined. We then develop a similar formalism for two types of chords, allowing us to study different types of deformations of double scaled SYK and in particular a deformation by an integrable Hamiltonian. The system has two distinct thermodynamic phases: one is continuously connected to the chaotic SYK Hamiltonian, the other is continuously connected to the integrable Hamiltonian, separated at low temperature by a first order phase transition. We also analyze the phase diagram for generic deformations, which in some cases includes a zero-temperature phase transition.</description>

Their interplay lies at the heart of numerous strongly correlated phenomena including Hubbard model physics and high temperature superconductivity. Such interplay for bosons, on the other hand, is largely unexplored in condensed matter systems. Here we demonstrate a unique realization of the spin-1/2 Bose-Hubbard model through excitons in a semiconducting moir\'e superlattice. We find evidence of a transient in-plane ferromagnetic (FM-$xy$) order of exciton spin - here valley pseudospin - around exciton filling $\nu_{ex}$ = 1, which transitions into a FM-$z$ order both with increasing exciton filling and a small magnetic field of 10 mT. The phase diagram is different from the fermion case and is qualitatively captured by a simple phenomenological model, highlighting the unique consequence of Bose-Einstein statistics. Our study paves the way for engineering exotic phases of matter from spinor bosons, as well as for unconventional devices in optics and quantum information science.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the dramatic effect of non-uniform, discrete electric polarizability in high-T$_{C}$ superconductors on the spatial fluctuations of the short to medium range Coulomb interactions through a real-space semiclassical model. Although this is a general property, we concentrate on the cuprates as parent compounds, in which the charge carriers are primarily concentrated on the O sublattice. The anisotropic effective Cu-O bond polarization caused by charge transfer energy modulation and the O$^{2-}$ atomic polarizability together generate a non-monotonic screened hole-hole Coulomb interaction at short distances that displays a local minimum at the in-plane second nearest neighbor O-O distance solely along the Cu-O bond direction. This is in accordance with the pseudogap phase anisotropy and the short coherence length observed in many high-T$_C$ superconductors.</description>
