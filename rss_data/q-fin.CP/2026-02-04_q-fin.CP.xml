      <title>DiffLOB: Diffusion Models for Counterfactual Generation in Limit Order Books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern generative models for limit order books (LOBs) can reproduce realistic market dynamics, but remain fundamentally passive: they either model what typically happens without accounting for hypothetical future market conditions, or they require interaction with another agent to explore alternative outcomes. This limits their usefulness for stress testing, scenario analysis, and decision-making. We propose \textbf{DiffLOB}, a regime-conditioned \textbf{Diff}usion model for controllable and counterfactual generation of \textbf{LOB} trajectories. DiffLOB explicitly conditions the generative process on future market regimes--including trend, volatility, liquidity, and order-flow imbalance, which enables the model to answer counterfactual queries of the form: ``If the future market regime were X instead of Y, how would the limit order book evolve?'' Our systematic evaluation framework for counterfactual LOB generation consists of three criteria: (1) \textit{Controllable Realism}, measuring how well generated trajectories can reproduce marginal distributions, temporal dependence structure and regime variables; (2) \textit{Counterfactual validity}, testing whether interventions on future regimes induce consistent changes in the generated LOB dynamics; (3) \textit{Counterfactual usefulness}, assessing whether synthetic counterfactual trajectories improve downstream prediction of future market regimes.</description>

      <title>The Innovation Tax: Generative AI Adoption, Productivity Paradox, and Systemic Risk in the U.S. Banking Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the causal impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) adoption on productivity and systemic risk in the U.S. banking sector. Using a novel dataset linking SEC 10-Q filings to Federal Reserve regulatory data for 809 financial institutions over 2018--2025, we employ two complementary identification strategies: Dynamic Spatial Durbin Models (DSDM) to capture network spillovers and Synthetic Difference-in-Differences (SDID) for causal inference using the November 2022 ChatGPT release as an exogenous shock. Our findings reveal a striking ``Productivity Paradox'': while DSDM estimates show that AI-adopting banks are high performers ($\beta &gt; 0$), the causal SDID analysis documents a significant ``Implementation Tax'' -- adopting banks experience a 428-basis-point decline in ROE as they absorb GenAI integration costs. This tax falls disproportionately on smaller institutions, with bottom-quartile banks suffering a 517-basis-point ROE decline compared to 129 basis points for larger banks, suggesting that economies of scale provide significant advantages in AI implementation. Most critically, our DSDM analysis reveals significant positive spillovers ($\theta = 0.161$ for ROA, $p &lt; 0.01$; $\theta = 0.679$ for ROE, $p &lt; 0.05$), with spillovers among large banks reaching $\theta = 3.13$ for ROE, indicating that the U.S. banking system is becoming ``algorithmically coupled.'' This synchronization of AI-driven decision-making creates a new channel for systemic contagion: a technical failure in widely-adopted AI models could trigger correlated shocks across the entire financial network.</description>

      <title>Dual Attainment in Multi-Period Multi-Asset Martingale Optimal Transport and Its Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish dual attainment for the multimarginal, multi-asset martingale optimal transport (MOT) problem, a fundamental question in the mathematical theory of model-independent pricing and hedging in quantitative finance. Our main result proves the existence of dual optimizers under mild regularity and irreducibility conditions, extending previous duality and attainment results from the classical and two-marginal settings to arbitrary numbers of assets and time periods. This theoretical advance provides a rigorous foundation for robust pricing and hedging of complex, path-dependent financial derivatives. To support our analysis, we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the practical solvability of large-scale discrete MOT problems using the state-of-the-art primal-dual linear programming (PDLP) algorithm. In particular, we solve multi-dimensional (or vectorial) MOT instances arising from the robust pricing of worst-of autocallable options, confirming the accuracy and feasibility of our theoretical results. Our work advances the mathematical understanding of MOT and highlights its relevance for robust financial engineering in high-dimensional and model-uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>A Novel approach to portfolio construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based framework for asset selection and portfolio construction, termed the Best-Path Algorithm Sparse Graphical Model (BPASGM). The method extends the Best-Path Algorithm (BPA) by mapping linear and non-linear dependencies among a large set of financial assets into a sparse graphical model satisfying a structural Markov property. Based on this representation, BPASGM performs a dependence-driven screening that removes positively or redundantly connected assets, isolating subsets that are conditionally independent or negatively correlated. This step is designed to enhance diversification and reduce estimation error in high-dimensional portfolio settings. Portfolio optimization is then conducted on the selected subset using standard mean-variance techniques. BPASGM does not aim to improve the theoretical mean-variance optimum under known population parameters, but rather to enhance realized performance in finite samples, where sample-based Markowitz portfolios are highly sensitive to estimation error. Monte Carlo simulations show that BPASGM-based portfolios achieve more stable risk-return profiles, lower realized volatility, and superior risk-adjusted performance compared to standard mean-variance portfolios. Empirical results for U.S. equities, global stock indices, and foreign exchange rates over 1990-2025 confirm these findings and demonstrate a substantial reduction in portfolio cardinality. Overall, BPASGM offers a statistically grounded and computationally efficient framework that integrates sparse graphical modeling with portfolio theory for dependence-aware asset selection.</description>

      <title>Soft-Radial Projection for Constrained End-to-End Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating hard constraints into deep learning is essential for safety-critical systems. Yet existing constructive layers that project predictions onto constraint boundaries face a fundamental bottleneck: gradient saturation. By collapsing exterior points onto lower-dimensional surfaces, standard orthogonal projections induce rank-deficient Jacobians, which nullify gradients orthogonal to active constraints and hinder optimization. We introduce Soft-Radial Projection, a differentiable reparameterization layer that circumvents this issue through a radial mapping from Euclidean space into the interior of the feasible set. This construction guarantees strict feasibility while preserving a full-rank Jacobian almost everywhere, thereby preventing the optimization stalls typical of boundary-based methods. We theoretically prove that the architecture retains the universal approximation property and empirically show improved convergence behavior and solution quality over state-of-the-art optimization- and projection-based baselines.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedups for Derivative Pricing Beyond Black-Scholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores advancements in quantum algorithms for derivative pricing of exotics, a computational pipeline of fundamental importance in quantitative finance. For such cases, the classical Monte Carlo integration procedure provides the state-of-the-art provable, asymptotic performance: polynomial in problem dimension and quadratic in inverse-precision. While quantum algorithms are known to offer quadratic speedups over classical Monte Carlo methods, end-to-end speedups have been proven only in the simplified setting over the Black-Scholes geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model. This paper extends existing frameworks to demonstrate novel quadratic speedups for more practical models, such as the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model and a variant of Heston's stochastic volatility model, utilizing a characteristic of the underlying SDEs which we term fast-forwardability. Additionally, for general models that do not possess the fast-forwardable property, we introduce a quantum Milstein sampler, based on a novel quantum algorithm for sampling L\'evy areas, which enables quantum multi-level Monte Carlo to achieve quadratic speedups for multi-dimensional stochastic processes exhibiting certain correlation types.
  We also present an improved analysis of numerical integration for derivative pricing, leading to substantial reductions in the resource requirements for pricing GBM and CIR models. Furthermore, we investigate the potential for additional reductions using arithmetic-free quantum procedures. Finally, we critique quantum partial differential equation (PDE) solvers as a method for derivative pricing based on amplitude estimation, identifying theoretical barriers that obstruct achieving a quantum speedup through this approach. Our findings significantly advance the understanding of quantum algorithms in derivative pricing, addressing key challenges and open questions in the field.</description>
