      <title>Kinetic Corrections to Heat-flow and Nernst advection for Laser Heated Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced models for approximating the impact of kinetic electron behavior on the transport of thermal energy and magnetic field are investigated. The thermal flux limiter has improved agreement with Vlasov-Fokker-Planck data when a harmonic form is used that adjusts the electron mean free path to account for electron-electron collisions; these results apply to both unmagnetized and magnetized plasmas. Once a magnetic field is incorporated, the mean free path should also be modified using the electron gyroradius. A flux limiter on Nernst advection of magnetic field is also required; a form that limits Nernst by the same fraction as the thermal heat-flow best reproduces kinetic simulations. A flux limiter form for the cross terms (Righi-Leduc and cross-gradient-Nernst) are also suggested. Hohlraum simulations relevant to fusion experiments on the National Ignition Facility are found to be sensitive to all of these details.</description>

      <title>Microscopic characteristics of SF6 partial discharge induced by a floating linear metal particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct current (DC) gas insulated transmission lines (GILs) have been widely used in power transmission, but might be threatened by partial discharge due to the presence of floating impurities (e.g., dust and metal particles) inside the sealed chamber. In this letter, by using a 2D fluid model we characterize the microscopic properties of the partial discharge induced by a floating linear metal particle in SF6 (both the discharge propagation and interaction between space charge and metal particle) under negative high voltage direct current (HVDC) conditions. Due to the strong electronegativity of SF6, the spatiotemporal distributions of the charged species (electrons, positive and negative ions), space charge, and reduced electric field are rather different from those in air. Notably, a negative ion region is observed around the top tip of the metal particle, and it plays an important role in the generation and propagation of primary and secondary streamers in SF6, which may lead to severe motion characteristics of the particle and aliasing of partial discharge signals. Additionally, we analyze the charging process and electric force reversal phenomenon, which may provide a more precise understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the firefly motion previously reported for DC GILs.</description>

      <title>Correlation of the L-mode density limit with edge collisionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "density limit" is one of the fundamental bounds on tokamak operating space, and is commonly estimated via the empirical Greenwald scaling. This limit has garnered renewed interest in recent years as it has become clear that ITER and many tokamak pilot plant concepts must operate near or above the widely-used Greenwald limit to achieve their objectives. Evidence has also grown that the Greenwald scaling - in its remarkable simplicity - may not capture the full complexity of the disruptive density limit. In this study, we assemble a multi-machine database to quantify the effectiveness of the Greenwald limit as a predictor of the L-mode density limit and identify alternative stability metrics. We find that a two-parameter dimensionless boundary in the plasma edge, $\nu_{*\rm, edge}^{\rm limit} = 3.0 \beta_{T,{\rm edge}}^{-0.4}$, achieves significantly higher accuracy (true negative rate of 97.7% at a true positive rate of 95%) than the Greenwald limit (true negative rate 86.1% at a true positive rate of 95%) across a multi-machine dataset including metal- and carbon-wall tokamaks (AUG, C-Mod, DIII-D, and TCV). The collisionality boundary presented here can be applied for density limit avoidance in current devices and in ITER, where it can be measured and responded to in real time.</description>

      <title>Relativistic theory of the viscosity of fluids across the entire energy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Surprisingly, there is no simple analytical theory for the viscosity of relativistic fluids that is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic gases as one of its analytical limits. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement of viscosity, which is a fundamental relativistic effect that has been overlooked so far. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with previous estimates for the QGP-type fluid.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Anomaly Detection Disruption Prediction Starting from First Discharge on Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma disruption presents a significant challenge in tokamak fusion, where it can cause severe damage and economic losses. Current disruption predictors mainly rely on data-driven methods, requiring extensive discharge data for training. However, future tokamaks require disruption prediction from the first shot, posing challenges of data scarcity during the early operation period. In this period disruption prediction aims to support safe exploration of operation range and accumulate necessary data to develop advanced prediction models. Thus, predictors must adapt to evolving plasma environments during this exploration phase. To address these issues, this study proposes a cross-tokamak adaptive deployment method using the Enhanced Convolutional Autoencoder Anomaly Detection (E-CAAD) predictor, enabling disruption prediction from the first shot of new devices. Experimental results indicate the ability of E-CAAD model trained on existing devices to effectively differentiate between disruption precursors and non-disruption samples on new devices, proving the feasibility of model cross-device transfer. Building upon this, adaptive learning from scratch and threshold adaptive adjustment strategies are proposed to achieve model cross-device transfer. The adaptive learning from scratch strategy enables the predictor to use scarce data during the early operation of the new device while rapidly adapting to changes in operation environment. The threshold adaptive adjustment strategy addresses the challenge of selecting warning thresholds on new devices where validation set is lacking, ensuring that the warning thresholds adapt to changes in the operation environment. Finally, experiments transferring the model from J-TEXT to EAST exhibit comparable performance to EAST models trained with ample data, achieving a TPR of 85.88% and a FPR of 6.15%, with a 20ms reserved MGI system reaction time.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Saha's ionization in Rindler spacetime and the equivalence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Gaussian effects of the Saha equation in Rindler space via Tsallis statistics. By considering a system with cylindrical geometry, we deduce the non-Gaussian Saha ionization equation for a partially ionized hydrogen plasma that expands with uniform acceleration. We demonstrate conditions for the validity of the equivalence principle within the realms of both Boltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis statistics. In the non-Gaussian framework, our findings reveal that the effective binding energy exhibits a quadratic dependence on the frame acceleration, in contrast to the linear dependence predicted by Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics. We show that an accelerated observer shall notice a more pronounced effect on the effective binding energy for $a&gt;0$ and a more attenuated one when $a&lt;0$. We also ascertain that an accelerated observer will measure values of $q$ smaller than those measured in the rest frame. Besides, assuming the equivalence principle, we examine the effects of the gravitational field on the photoionization of hydrogen atoms and pair production. We show that both photoionization and pair production are more intensely suppressed in regions with a strong gravitational field in a non-Gaussian context than in the Boltzmann-Gibbs framework. Lastly, constraints on the gravitational field and the electron and positron chemical potentials are derived.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning Based Reduced-Order Models for Plasma Turbulence Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the construction of non-intrusive Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) for plasma turbulence simulations. In particular, we propose using Operator Inference (OpInf) to build low-cost physics-based ROMs from data for such simulations. As a representative example, we focus on the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations used for modeling two-dimensional electrostatic drift-wave turbulence. For a comprehensive perspective of the potential of OpInf to construct accurate ROMs, we consider three setups for the HW equations by varying a key model parameter, namely the adiabaticity coefficient. These setups lead to the formation of complex and nonlinear dynamics, which makes the construction of accurate ROMs of any kind challenging. We generate the training datasets by performing direct numerical simulations of the HW equations and recording the computed state data and outputs the over a time horizon of 100 time units in the turbulent phase. We then use these datasets to construct OpInf ROMs for predictions over 400 additional time units. Our results show that the OpInf ROMs capture the important features of the turbulent dynamics and generalize beyond the training time horizon while reducing the computational effort of the high-fidelity simulation by up to five orders of magnitude. In the broader context of fusion research, this shows that non-intrusive SciML ROMs have the potential to drastically accelerate numerical studies, which can ultimately enable tasks such as the design of optimized fusion devices.</description>
