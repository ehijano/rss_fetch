      <title>Dielectrophoretic response and electro-deformation of soft bioparticles interacting with a metallo-dielectric Janus active particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active (self-propelling) particles have emerged as innovative microscale tools in the field of single cell analysis with the advantages of being untethered, remotely controlled, hybrid powered, with sub-cellular precision. This study investigates the dielectrophoretic (DEP) response and electro-mechanical deformation of cell nuclei interacting with active metallo-dielectric Janus Particles (JPs) under an externally applied electric field. An equivalent droplet two-phase model is employed to simulate the bioparticle, coupling the Navier-Stokes equations with the Phase Field Model to capture fluid motion and interface dynamics. Good qualitative agreement is obtained among experimental, analytical, and numerical results. The findings reveal a nonlinear relationship between nucleus deformation and its surface coverage of the JP with respect to the applied voltage. The overall coverage ratio of the JP dielectric hemisphere increases with voltage as the positive DEP force on the dielectric side strengthens, exhibiting maximum at a certain voltage. The strong correlation between nucleus flexibility and JP surface coverage suggests that the JP coverage ratio could serve as a biomechanical marker for nucleus deformability, providing a novel method for in-situ evaluation of nucleus mechanics.</description>

      <title>Force chain dynamics in a quasi-static granular pile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nature, granular materials fail in abrupt avalanches, earthquakes, and other hazardous events, and also creep over time. Proposed failure mechanisms for these systems are broadly framed as friction-limited. However, mechanical descriptions of friction in granular system vary, including those that consider the non-linear, heterogeneous dynamics of grain-contact forces. In order to study granular controls on failure and creep, we imaged contact forces between quasi-2D photoelastic discs at 15-minute intervals in experiments over weeks- to one-month-long observation periods. In the experiments, the particles are distributed in a slope below the angle of repose with a concomitant establishment of the force-chain network approximately along the principal static stress directions. The discrete force-chain shifts are initially described by an age-weakening Weibull distribution in frequency over time, with the most common clusters of events $&lt;$1000 minutes apart, but there are long quiescent periods that are not well described by the distribution. The post-settling discrete events accompany a longer term strengthening of the localized stresses. We observe that some events may be related to 2$^o$C temperature change, but associated ground motions measured by a seismometer appear to have no correlation with particle displacements or force-chain changes. The results illustrate that local, grain-scale changes in force-chain networks can occur long after a granular pile reaches a mesoscale apparently stable state, sometimes without obvious external forcings or imposed state changes. Such force-chain dynamics may underlie transitions in natural granular systems between large-scale failures and creep events.</description>

      <title>Electroactive differential growth and delayed instability in accelerated healing tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guided by experiments contrasting electrically accelerated recovery with natural healing, this study formulates a model to investigate the importance of electroactive differential growth and morphological changes in tissue repair. It underscores the clinical potential of leveraging electroactive differential growth for improved healing outcomes. The study reveals that voltage stimulation significantly enhances the healing and growth of biological tissues, accelerating the regeneration process across various growth modalities and steering towards isotropic growth conditions that do not favor any specific growth pathways. Enhancing the electroelastic coupling parameters improves the efficacy of bioelectric devices, initiating contraction and fortification of biological tissues in alignment with the electric field. This process facilitates swift cell migration and proliferation, as well as oriented growth of tissue. In instances of strain stiffening at elevated strains, the extreme critical growth ratio aligns with the predictions of neo-Hookean models. Conversely, for tissues experiencing strain stiffening under moderate to very low strain conditions, the strain stiffening effect substantially delays the onset of electroelastic growth instability, ultimately producing a smooth, hyperelastic surface devoid of any unstable morphologies. Our investigation, grounded in nonlinear electroelastic field and perturbation theories, explores how electric fields influence differential growth and instability in biological tissues. We examine the interactions among dimensionless voltage, internal pressure, electroelastic coupling, radius ratio, and strain stiffening, revealing their effects on promoting growth and delaying instability. This framework offers insights into the mechanisms behind electroactive growth and its instabilities, contributing valuable knowledge to the tissue healing.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics converts chiral flagellar rotation into contactless actuation of microdiscs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motile bacteria are a wonder of nature's engineering: microscopic engines that transduce biochemical energy into the work they require to explore their environment. This added energy turns the surrounding fluid into a bath that departs from an equilibrium one. Bacterial baths agitate suspended spheres more vividly than thermal fluctuations and can power microscopic ratchets. A salient requirement to extract work from bacterial baths was the asymmetric shape of the ratchets, designed to rectify the interactions with bacteria. In contrast with past results, here we show that swimming E. coli power the persistent rotation of discs, in absence of asymmetry. Combining state-of-the art nanoprinting, quantitative measurements of the dynamics of individual bacteria, and hydrodynamic modeling, we elucidate the mechanism and show that the counter-rotation of the flagella and the bacterium body lead to a torque dipole and traction onto the disc, and subsequent rotation. Remarkably, the mechanism is independent of the direction or orientation of navigation of bacteria under the disc, hence additive and contactless. Resulting from the interplay of the torque dipole of flagellated bacteria with simple geometric confinement, this hydrodynamic mechanism bridges scales, leveraging the chirality of bacteria nanomotors towards the manipulation of objects at least ten thousand times larger. The study lays the groundwork for novel bio-hybrid micromachines that harness living microorganisms for controlled motion at the microscale. Our findings provide further fundamental insights into bacterial hydrodynamics and open avenues for the development of autonomous, self-powered microdiscs for the study of chiral fluids.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Diffusion in Confined Colloidal Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed confocal microscopy experiments and computer simulations of colloidal suspensions with moderate volume fraction confined between two quasi-parallel, rough walls [A. Villada-Balbuena et al., Soft Matter, 2022, 18, 4699-4714]. Here we investigate many facets of the dynamical properties of the system, such as confined and inhomogeneous diffusion, mean first-passage times and generalized incoherent scattering functions. We observe that the experiment features strong footprints of the confinement in the dynamical properties, such as inhomogeneous diffusion coefficients and non-zero off-diagonal elements in the incoherent scattering function which we can quantitatively model and analyze with computer simulations. This allows us, for example, to systematically investigate the impact of surface roughness. Our comparative study therefore advances the fundamental understanding of the impact of confinement on dynamics in fluids and colloidal suspensions.</description>

      <title>Self-assembly and time-dependent control of active and passive triblock Janus colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations to explore the self-assembly of a two-dimensional model system of triblock Janus colloids as an example of "patchy" colloids forming complex structures. Previous experiments and simulation studies have shown that such systems are capable of forming a two-dimensional Kagome lattice at room temperatures. However, it is well established that the crystallization is strongly hampered by the formation of long-living metastable aggregates. For this reason, recent studies have investigated activity, i.e., self-propulsion of the Janus particles as a mechanism to accelerate the formation of stable Kagome structures [Mallory and Cacciuto, JACS 141, 2500-2507 (2019)] at selected state points. Here we extend, first, the investigations of active Janus colloids for a broader range of densities and temperatures. We also characterize in detail the associated nucleation of Kagome clusters, as well as their structure in the steady state. Second, to make contact to the equilibrium case, we propose a simple activity time protocol where an initially chosen activity is switched off after a finite time. With this protocol, we not only find Kagome structures in a much broader range of densities than in the purely passive case, but also obtain a Kagome crystallization boundary very close to that proposed in earlier Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Critical clusters in liquid crystals: Fractal geometry and conformal invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional domain morphology of twisted nematic liquid crystals during their phase-ordering kinetics [R. A. L. Almeida, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131 (2023) 268101], which is a physical candidate to self-generate critical clusters in the percolation universality class. Here we present experimental evidence that large clusters and their hulls are indeed both fractals with dimensions of the corresponding figures in critical percolation models. The asymptotic decay of a crossing probability, from a region in the vicinity of the origin to the boundary of disks, is described by the Lawler-Schramm-Werner theorem provided that a microscopic length in the original formulation is replaced by the coarsening length of the liquid crystal. Furthermore, the behavior for the winding angle of large loops is, at certain scales, compatible with that of Schramm-Loewner evolution curves with diffusivity $\kappa = 6$. These results show an experimental realization of critical clusters in phase ordering.</description>

      <title>E. coli bacterium tumbling in bulk and close to surfaces: A simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motility is fundamental to the survival and proliferation of microorganisms. The E. coli bacterium propels itself using a bundle of rotating helical flagella. If one flagellum reverses its rotational direction, it leaves the bundle, performs a polymorphic transformation, and the bacterium tumbles. The E. coli bacterium is hydrodynamically attracted to surfaces. This prolongs its residence time, while tumbling facilitates surface detachment. We develop a model of E. coli that uses an extended Kirchhoff rod theory to implement flagellar flexibility as well as different polymorphic conformations and perform hydrodynamic simulations with the method of multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD). To establish a reference case, we determine the distribution of tumble angles in the bulk fluid, which shows good agreement with experiments for a fixed tumble time. Increasing the hook stiffness, narrows the tumble angle distribution and reduces the flagellar dispersion during tumbling. Close to a bounding surface, the tumble angle distribution is shifted to smaller angles, while flagellar dispersion is reduced. Reorientation within the plane favors the forward direction, which might be an explanation for prolonged run times observed in experiments</description>

      <title>Chemotactic aggregation dynamics of micro-swimmers in Brinkman flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study through analysis and simulations of a continuum model the collective chemotactic dynamics of micro-swimmers immersed in viscous Brinkman flows. The Brinkman viscous flow approximates with a resistance or friction term the presence of inert impurities or stationary obstacles immersed in the fluid, an environment that can be regarded as a wet porous medium. Analysis of the linearized system reveals that resistance primarily affects the development of collective swimming instabilities and barely affects chemotactic instabilities. We present a parameter phase space for the distinct types of dynamics we can expect in the case of auto-chemotactic bacteria-like pusher swimmers for varying medium resistance, chemotactic response strength, and hydrodynamic coupling strength values. Simulations of the full nonlinear system show that resistance impacts the collective dynamics for each of these states because it inhibits the hydrodynamic interactions and the emergence of the collective swimmer. Surprisingly, and not expected from the linear analysis predictions, we find that resistance also hampers the chemotactic aggregation of the swimmers because it impedes their ability to navigate efficiently and collectively towards chemical cues and assemble into clusters. We show simulations of the complex system for parameters sets from each of the phase-space regions and quantify the observed behavior. Lastly, we discuss the experimental values of the parameters and discuss possible future experimental realizations of this system.</description>

      <title>Enhancing nanoscale charged colloid crystallization near a metastable liquid binodal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16808v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bottom-up assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered arrays, or superlattices (SLs), is a promising route to design materials with new functionalities, but the degree of control over assembly into functional structures remains challenging. Using electrostatics, rather than density, to tune the interactions between semiconductor NCs, we watch self-assembly proceeding through a metastable liquid phase. We systematically investigate the phase behavior as a function of quench conditions in situ and in real time using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Through quantitative fitting to colloid, liquid, and SL models, we extract the time evolution of each phase and the system phase diagram, which we find to be consistent with short-range attractive interactions. Using the phase diagram's predictive power, we establish control of the self-assembly rate over three orders of magnitude, and identify one- and two-step self-assembly regimes, with only the latter implicating the metastable liquid as an intermediate. Importantly, the presence of the metastable liquid increases SL formation rates relative to the equivalent one-step pathway, and SL order counterintuitively increases with the rate, revealing a highly desirable and generalizable kinetic strategy to promote and enhance ordered assembly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ``Pasta alla Cacio e pepe'' is a traditional Italian dish made with pasta, pecorino cheese, and pepper. Despite its simple ingredient list, achieving the perfect texture and creaminess of the sauce can be challenging. In this study, we systematically explore the phase behavior of Cacio e pepe sauce, focusing on its stability at increasing temperatures for various proportions of cheese, water, and starch. We identify starch concentration as the key factor influencing sauce stability, with direct implications for practical cooking. Specifically, we delineate a regime where starch concentrations below 1\% (relative to cheese mass) lead to the formation of system-wide clumps, a condition determining what we term the ``Mozzarella Phase'' and corresponding to an unpleasant and separated sauce. Additionally, we examine the impact of cheese concentration relative to water at a fixed starch level, observing a lower critical solution temperature that we theoretically rationalized by means of a minimal effective free-energy model. \tcr{We further analyze the effect of a less traditional stabilizer, trisodium citrate, and observe a sharp transition from the Mozzarella Phase to a completely smooth and stable sauce, in contrast to starch-stabilized mixtures, where the transition is more gradual.} Finally, we present a scientifically optimized recipe based on our findings, enabling a consistently flawless execution of this classic dish.</description>

      <title>Transient Chirality in the Gelation of Adhesive Spinner Monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active systems of self-rotating elements inherently exhibit chirality, making them of fundamental interest due to parity violation. Using large-scale hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the gelation of adhesive spinners confined to quasi-2D monolayers at low Reynolds numbers. Unlike the coarsening dynamics of passive colloids, spinner gelation follows a different pathway, displaying structural chirality during the early stages of aggregation. However, this chirality dissipates upon dynamical arrest, resulting in a final gel structure that resembles a conventional colloidal gel. As a result, we find no sign of odd mechanical responses. Nonetheless, the elastic modulus and gelation time remain tunable through spinning activity, providing a new avenue for the bottom-up design of programmable soft materials.</description>

      <title>A collision model for very flexible Cosserat rods and immersed-boundary fluid-structure coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper presents a constraint-based collision model for Cosserat rods, able to handle dynamic or static contact between a large number of highly flexible structures. The model provides the required collision impulses prior to updating the solution of the rods, with the impulses accounted for as external loads. The procedure avoids the need to modify the structure solver itself and circumvents any iteration between the collision model and the solver for the Cosserat rods, maintaining the efficiency of any chosen Cosserat solver. The collision model is adopted from Tschisgale et al. (Arch. Appl. Mech., 2019) and extended towards higher stability, which is found necessary in the case of very flexible rods. Furthermore, the model is supplemented with additional terms that arise when the colliding rods are immersed in a fluid. The latter is accounted for by an immersed-boundary method. A large number of tests are conducted to demonstrate the functionality of the final model.</description>
