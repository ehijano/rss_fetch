      <title>Interpretable Neural Network Quantum States for Solving the Steady States of the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) underpins nonlinear wave phenomena in optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and plasma physics, but computing its excited states remains challenging due to nonlinearity-induced non-orthonormality. Traditional methods like imaginary time evolution work for ground states but fail for excited states. We propose a neural network quantum state (NNQS) approach, parameterizing wavefunctions with neural networks to directly minimize the energy functional, enabling computation of both ground and excited states. By designing compact, interpretable network architectures, we obtain analytical approximation of solutions. We apply the solutions to a case of spatiotemporal chaos in the NLSE, demonstrating its capability to study complex chaotic dynamics. This work establishes NNQS as a tool for bridging machine learning and theoretical studies of chaotic wave systems.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lorenz Attractors in 3D Sinusoidal Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete Lorenz attractors can be found in three-dimensional discrete maps. Discrete Lorenz attractors have similar topology to that of the continuous Lorenz attractor exhibited by the well studied 3D Lorenz system. However, the routes to the formation of discrete Lorenz attractor in 3D maps is different from that of the routes of formation of continuous Lorenz flow attractor. This paper explores the exotic dynamics of a three-dimensional sinusoidal map, highlighting the existence of discrete Lorenz attractors. Through a detailed bifurcation analysis, we discuss various formation pathways involving supercritical and subcritical Neimark-Sacker bifurcations, and homoclinic butterflies towards the formation of discrete Lorenz attractors. Using a two-parameter Lyapunov chart analysis, we systematically illustrate chaotic regions and periodic regions in the parameter space, illustrating diverse attractor topologies, including hyperchaotic and wavy chaotic structures. Furthermore, we investigate spatiotemporal patterns in a ring-star network of coupled sinusoidal maps, revealing diverse spatiotemporal patterns such as chimera states, traveling waves, and synchronization transitions, controlled by coupling strengths of ring and star networks respectively. A key contribution is the application of hyperchaotic signals to secure video encryption, where we apply YOLOv10 for object detection and CNN-based cryptographic key generation. This selective encryption approach ensures enhanced security, high computational efficiency, and robustness against differential attacks.</description>

      <title>Coherence and Transients in Nonlocally Coupled Dissipative Kicked Rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of nonlocally coupled dissipative kicked rotors is rich and complex. In this study, we consider a network of rotors where each interacts equally with a certain range of its neighbors. We focus on the influence of the coupling strength and the coupling range, and show both analytically and numerically the critical transitions in the phase diagram, which include bifurcations of simple spatiotemporal patterns and changes in basin sizes of coherent states with different wavenumbers. We highlight that this diagram is fundamentally different from those found in other coupled systems such as in coupled logistic maps or Lorenz systems. Finally, we show an interesting domain-wall phenomenon in the coupled chaotic rotors, where a super-long transient interface state (partially regular and partially chaotic) is observed and can persist exponentially long as the coupling range increases up to a critical threshold.</description>

      <title>Universality of stochastic control of quantum chaos with measurement and feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum dynamics in the vicinity of an unstable fixed point subjected to stochastic control. The stochastic competition between the system's inherent instability (pushing trajectories away) and engineered control dynamics (drawing them back to the same point) forms the core of probabilistic control in chaotic systems. Recent studies reveal that this interplay underlies a family of measurement- and feedback-driven dynamical quantum phase transitions. To capture its universal features, we consider the inverted harmonic oscillator, a canonical model whose operator amplitudes diverge. Our control scheme, a quantum version of classical attractor dynamics, employs non-unitary evolution via measurements and conditional resets. By combining numerical simulations, a semiclassical Fokker-Planck analysis, and direct spectra of the quantum channel, we map out the control transition and uncover quantum-specific signatures of the underlying dynamics. We demonstrate the universality of our results within the quantum Arnold cat map, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Detecting transitions from steady states to chaos with gamma distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method to identify transitions from steady states to chaos in stochastic models, specifically focusing on the logistic and Ricker equations by leveraging the gamma distribution to describe the underlying population. We begin by showing that when the variance is sufficiently small, the stochastic equations converge to their deterministic counterparts. Our analysis reveals that the stochastic equations exhibit two distinct branches of the intrinsic growth rate, corresponding to alternative stable states characterized by higher and lower growth rates.
  Notably, while the logistic model does not show a transition from a steady state to chaos, the Ricker model undergoes such a transition when the shape parameter of the gamma distribution is small. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the dynamic behavior in biological populations but also provide a robust framework for detecting chaos in complex systems.</description>

      <title>On Chaos in QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we explore the chaotic behavior of non-integrable QFTs and compare them to integrable ones. We choose as prototypes the double sine-Gordon and the sine-Gordon models. We analyze their discrete spectrum determined by a truncation method. We examine the map of the corresponding energy eigenvalues to the eigenvalues of the random matrix theory (RMT) Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). This is done by computing the following properties: (a) The distribution of the adjacent spacings and their ratios (b) Higher order spacings and ratios (c) Pair correlations (d) Spectral form factors and (e) Spectral rigidity. For these properties we determine the differences between the integrable and non-integrable theories and verify that the former admits a Poisson behavior and the latter GOE (apart from the spectral rigidity).</description>
