      <title>Deep LPPLS: Forecasting of temporal critical points in natural, engineering and financial systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model offers a general framework for capturing dynamics and predicting transition points in diverse natural and social systems. In this work, we present two calibration techniques for the LPPLS model using deep learning. First, we introduce the Mono-LPPLS-NN (M-LNN) model; for any given empirical time series, a unique M-LNN model is trained and shown to outperform state-of-the-art techniques in estimating the nonlinear parameters $(t_c, m, \omega)$ of the LPPLS model as evidenced by the comprehensive distribution of parameter errors. Second, we extend the M-LNN model to a more general model architecture, the Poly-LPPLS-NN (P-LNN), which is able to quickly estimate the nonlinear parameters of the LPPLS model for any given time-series of a fixed length, including previously unseen time-series during training. The Poly class of models train on many synthetic LPPLS time-series augmented with various noise structures in a supervised manner. Given enough training examples, the P-LNN models also outperform state-of-the-art techniques for estimating the parameters of the LPPLS model as evidenced by the comprehensive distribution of parameter errors. Additionally, this class of models is shown to substantially reduce the time to obtain parameter estimates. Finally, we present applications to the diagnostic and prediction of two financial bubble peaks (followed by their crash) and of a famous rockslide. These contributions provide a bridge between deep learning and the study of the prediction of transition times in complex time series.</description>

      <title>Multi-task learning for molecular electronic structure approaching coupled-cluster accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) plays an important role in quantum chemistry, providing fast-to-evaluate predictive models for various properties of molecules. However, as most existing ML models for molecular electronic properties use density function theory (DFT) databases as the ground truth in training, their prediction accuracy cannot go beyond the DFT. In this work, we developed a unified ML method for electronic structures of organic molecules using the gold-standard CCSD(T) calculations as training data. Tested on hydrocarbon molecules, our model outperforms the DFT with the widely-used B3LYP functional in both computation costs and prediction accuracy of various quantum chemical properties. We apply the model to aromatic compounds and semiconducting polymers on both ground state and excited state properties, demonstrating its accuracy and generalization capability to complex systems that are hard to calculate using CCSD(T)-level methods.</description>

      <title>Address-Specific Sustainable Accommodation Choice Through Real-World Data Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consumers wish to choose sustainable accommodation for their travels, and in the case of corporations, may be required to do so. Yet accommodation marketplaces provide no meaningful capability for sustainable choice: typically CO2 estimates are provided that are identical for all accommodation of the same type across an entire country. We propose a decision support system that enables real choice of sustainable accommodation. We develop a data-driven address- specific metric called EcoGrade, which integrates government approved datasets and uses interpolation where data is sparse. We validate the metric on 10,000 UK addresses in 10 cities, showing the match of our interpolations to reality is statistically significant. We show how the metric has been embedded into a decision support system for a global accommodation marketplace and tested by real users over several months with positive user feedback. In the EU, forty percent of final energy consumption is from buildings. We need to encourage all building owners to make their accommodation more efficient. The rental sector is one area where change can occur rapidly, as rented accommodation is renovated frequently. We anticipate our decision support system using EcoGrade will encourage this positive change.</description>

      <title>Experiment-informed finite-strain inverse design of spinodal metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spinodal metamaterials, with architectures inspired by natural phase-separation processes, have presented a significant alternative to periodic and symmetric morphologies when designing mechanical metamaterials with extreme performance. While their elastic mechanical properties have been systematically determined, their large-deformation, nonlinear responses have been challenging to predict and design, in part due to limited data sets and the need for complex nonlinear simulations. This work presents a novel physics-enhanced machine learning (ML) and optimization framework tailored to address the challenges of designing intricate spinodal metamaterials with customized mechanical properties in large-deformation scenarios where computational modeling is restrictive and experimental data is sparse. By utilizing large-deformation experimental data directly, this approach facilitates the inverse design of spinodal structures with precise finite-strain mechanical responses. The framework sheds light on instability-induced pattern formation in spinodal metamaterials -- observed experimentally and in selected nonlinear simulations -- leveraging physics-based inductive biases in the form of nonconvex energetic potentials. Altogether, this combined ML, experimental, and computational effort provides a route for efficient and accurate design of complex spinodal metamaterials for large-deformation scenarios where energy absorption and prediction of nonlinear failure mechanisms is essential.</description>
