      <title>Is the type-D NUT C-metric really "missing" from the most general Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It remains a long-standing problem, unsettled for almost two decades in General Relativity (GR) community, ever since Griffiths and Podolsky demonstrated in Ref. [J.B. Griffiths and J. Podolsky, Class. Quant. Grav. 22, 3467 (2005)] that the type-D NUT C-metric seems to be absent from the most general family of the type-D Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski (P-D) solution. However, Astorino [Phys. Rev. D 109, 084038 (2024)] presented a different form of rotating and accelerating black holes and showed that all known four-dimensional type-D accelerating black holes (without the NUT charge) can be recovered via various different limits in a definitive fashion. In particular, he provided, for the first time, the correct expressions for the type-D static accelerating black holes with a nonzero NUT charge, which was previously impossible using the traditional parametrization of the familiar P-D solution. Nevertheless, it still remains elusive that how these two different forms of the four-dimensional rotating and accelerating solutions are related. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by finding the obvious coordinate transformations and parameter identifications between the vacuum metrics after two different parameterizations of the generated solution via the inverse scattering method from the seed metric -- the Rindler vacuum background. We then resolve this ``missing" puzzle by providing another M\"{o}bius transformation and linear combinations of the Killing coordinates, which clearly cast the type-D NUT C-metric into the familiar form of the P-D solution. Additionally, we propose an alternative new routine for the normalization of the obtained metric derived via the inverse scattering method from the vacuum seed solution, which could be potentially useful for the construction of higher-dimensional solutions using the trivial vacuum background as the seed metric.</description>

      <title>Black hole-neutron star binaries with high spins and large mass asymmetries: I. Properties of quasi-equilibrium sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole - neutron star (BHNS) mergers are a promising target of current gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) searches, being the putative origin of ultra-relativistic jets, gamma-ray emission, and r-process nucleosynthesis. However, the possibility of any EM emission accompanying a GW detection crucially depends on the amount of baryonic mass left after the coalescence, i.e. whether the neutron star (NS) undergoes a `tidal disruption' or `plunges' into the black hole (BH) while remaining essentially intact. As the first of a series of two papers, we here report the most systematic investigation to date of quasi-equilibrium sequences of initial data across a range of stellar compactnesses $\mathcal{C}$, mass ratios $q$, BH spins $\chi_{_{\rm
  BH}}$, and equations of state satisfying all present observational constraints. Using an improved version of the elliptic initial-data solver FUKA, we have computed more than $1000$ individual configurations and estimated the onset of mass-shedding or the crossing of the innermost stable circular orbit in terms of the corresponding characteristic orbital angular velocities $\Omega_{_{\rm MS}}$ and $\Omega_{_{\rm
  ISCO}}$ as a function of $\mathcal{C}, q$, and $\chi_{_{\rm BH}}$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the dependence of these frequencies on the BH spin is investigated. In turn, by setting $\Omega_{_{\rm MS}} = \Omega_{_{\rm ISCO}}$ it is possible to determine the separatrix between the `tidal disruption' or `plunge' scenarios as a function of the fundamental parameters of these systems, namely, $q, \mathcal{C}$, and $\chi_{_{\rm BH}}$. Finally, we present a novel analysis of quantities related to the tidal forces in the initial data and discuss their dependence on spin and separation.</description>

      <title>Black hole - neutron star binaries with high spins and large mass asymmetries: II. Properties of dynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) - neutron star (NS) binary mergers are not only strong sources of gravitational waves (GWs), but they are also candidates for joint detections in the GW and electromagnetic (EM) spectra. However, the possible emergence of an EM signal from these binaries is determined by a complex combination of the equation of state (EOS), the BH spin, and the mass ratio. In this second paper in a series, we present a systematic exploration of the possible space of binary parameters in terms of the mass ratio and BH spin so as to construct a complete description of the dynamical processes accompanying a BHNS binary merger. This second work relies not only on the initial data presented in the companion paper I, but also on the predictions via quasi-equilibrium (QE) sequences on the outcome of the binary. In this way, and for the first time, we are able to relate the predictions of QE analyses with the results of accurate general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. In addition to a careful investigation of the evolution of the BH mass and spin as a result of the merger, the total remnant rest-mass of the resulting accretion disk and its properties, and of the corresponding post-merger GW emission, special attention is paid to the conditions that lead to tidal disruption. Leveraging QE calculations, we are able to verify the reliability of stringent predictions about the occurrence or not of a plunge and to measure the `strength' of the tidal disruption when it takes place. Finally, using a novel contraction of the Riemann tensor in a tetrad comoving with the fluid introduced in paper I, we are able to point out the onset of the instability to tidal disruption. This new diagnostic can be employed not only to determine the occurrence of the disruption, but also to characterize it in terms of the binary parameters.</description>

      <title>Non-Canonical Dark Energy Parameter Evolution in a Canonical Quintessence Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study considers the specific case of a flat, minimally coupled to gravity, quintessence cosmology with a dark energy quartic polynomial potential that has the same mathematical form as the Higgs potential. Previous work on this case determined that the scalar field is given by a simple expression of the Lambert W function in terms of the easily observable scale factor. This expression provides analytic equations for the evolution of cosmological dark energy parameters as a function of the scale factor for all points on the Lambert W function principal branch. The Lambert W function is zero at a scale factor of zero that marks the big bang. The evolutionary equations beyond the big bang describe a canonical universe that is similar to {\Lambda}CDM, making it an excellent dynamical template to compare with observational data. The portion of the W function principal before the big bang extends to the infinite pre-bang past. It describes a noncanonical universe with an initially very low mass density that contracts by rolling down the dark energy potential to a singularity, big bang, at the scale factor zero point. This provides a natural origin for the big bang. It also raises the possibility that the universe existed before the big bang and is far older, and that it was once far larger than its current size. The recent increasing interest in the possibility of a dynamical universe instead of {\Lambda}CDM makes the exploration of the nature of such universes particularly relevant.</description>

      <title>Accelerated detector in a superposed spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pursuit of a full-fledged theory of quantum gravity, operational approaches offer insights into quantum-gravitational effects produced by quantum superposition of different spacetimes not diffeomorphic to one another. Recent work applies this approach to superpose cylindrically identified Minkowski spacetimes (i.e. periodic boundary conditions) with different characteristic circumferences, where a two-level detector coupled to a quantum field residing in the spacetime exhibits resonance peaks in response at certain values of the superposed length ratios. Here, we extend this analysis to a superposition of cylindrically identified Rindler spacetimes, considering a two-level detector constantly accelerated in the direction orthogonal to the compact dimension. Similarly to previous work, we find resonance peaks in the detector response at rational ratios of the superposed compactified lengths, which we observe to be accentuated by the acceleration of the detector. Furthermore, for the first time we confirm the detailed balance condition due to acceleration in a superposition of spacetimes, commensurate with the Unruh effect in a single spacetime state. The resonant structure of detector response in the presence of event horizons, for the first time observed in 3+1 dimensions, may offer clues to the nature of black hole entropy in the full theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing inflation and reheating in the framework of a generalized $\mathcal{F}(H)$ Friedmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconstruction of an inflationary universe considering the parametrization of the scalar spectral index as a function of the number of $e-$folds in the framework of a modified Friedmann equation is analyzed. In this context, we examine the possibility of reconstructing the Hubble parameter together with the effective potential considering a modified Friedmann equation specified by $\mathcal{F}(H)\propto \rho$, where $\mathcal{F}(H)$ corresponds to an arbitrary function of the Hubble parameter $H$ and $\rho$ denotes the energy density associated with the matter in the universe. To reconstruct the background variables during the inflationary scenario, we develop a new methodology by expressing the spectral index in terms of the Hubble parameter and its derivatives. Thus, we obtain a general formalism for the reconstruction of the inflation, using the slow roll approximation together with the parametrization of the scalar spectral index as a function of the number of $e-$folds $N$. As specific examples, we consider the simplest attractor $n_s-1=-2/N$ together with different functions $\mathcal{F}(H)$, associated to the modified Friedmann equation, to rebuild the Hubble parameter and the effective potential in terms of the scalar field $\phi$. Additionally, we examine the reheating epoch by considering a constant equation of state parameter, in which we determine the temperature and the number of e-folds during this epoch, using the background variables found during the reconstruction of the different $\mathcal{F}(H)-$models studied. Besides, we constrain the different parameters associated with the reconstructed inflationary $\mathcal{F}(H)-$models during the epochs of inflation and reheating, using current astronomical data from Planck and BICEP/Keck results.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Acceleration from topological considerations III: Lie group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations on the large-scale structure of the universe indicate that the cosmological constant cannot be the definitive answer to the nature of dark energy. Therefore, it is a good time to propose alternatives to understand the late-accelerated expansion of the universe. In this work we study the possibility that the acceleration of space-time is due to the topology of the universe. We assume that the topology of the universe is a principal fiber bundle whose base space is our 4-dimensional spacetime and the fiber is an $N$-dimensional Lie group that evolves with time. For the base space we consider a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime, we find that the base space is currently accelerating for $1 &lt; N$ compact semi-simple Lie groups whose scale-factors are equal and for $1 &lt; N$ non-Abelian Lie groups whose scale-factors are different and as long as its structure constants satisfy some conditions. However when we study the evolution of the density parameters these differ from the evolution within the $\Lambda$CDM model, this led us to think in the possibility of use a different group as fiber in order to obtain the right evolution of the density parameters. We conclude that it is possible that the accelerated expansion of the universe is due to consider a different topology of the universe as a principal fiber bundle.</description>

      <title>Graviscalar quasinormal modes and asymptotic tails of a thick brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the graviscalar quasinormal modes (QNMs) and their asymptotic tail behavior of a thick brane. Considering the scalar perturbations of the thick brane metric, we obtain the main equations of scalar Kaluza-Klein modes. Based on these equations, the frequencies of the scalar QNMs of the thick brane are obtained by the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin, asymptotic iteration, and numerical evolution methods. The results show that the scalar fluctuation of the thick brane has a series of discrete QNMs, similar to the tensor perturbation of the brane. These modes appear as decaying massive scalar particles in four-dimensional spacetime. We also studied in detail the late time tails of these QNMs and found that some modes have slowly decaying oscillatory tails that may be new sources of the gravitational wave backgrounds. Obviously, the QNMs contain the information of the brane and are characteristic modes of the thick brane.</description>

      <title>Signatures from the observed jet power and the radiative efficiency for rotating black holes in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the radiative efficiency and the jet power in the spacetime of the rotating black hole in loop quantum gravity (LQG), which has an extra LQG parameter. It is shown that with the increase of the LQG parameter, the conversion efficiency decreases for the slowly rotating black hole, but increases for the rapidly rotating black hole, the jet power increases for different black hole spins. With the observed data from the well-known sources A0620-00, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, GRS1124-683, GRO J1655-40, and GRS1915+105, we make some constraints on the black hole spin parameter and the LQG parameter. The presence of the LQG parameter broadens the allowed range of the black hole spin parameter for sources A0620-00, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564 and GRO J1655-40. However, for the source GRS 1915+105, there is no overlap between observational constrain parameter regions, which implies that the rotating LQG black hole cannot simultaneously account for the observed jet power and the radiative efficiency as in other black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work continues the research presented in the article [1], where we estimate the Gertsenshtein effect's influence on the long-wavelength part of relic gravitational wave spectrum. Here, the differential equation system for the Gertsenshtein effect in Friedman-LeMaitre-Robertson-Walker universe, derived in [1], is simplified for gravitational waves in the under-horizon regime during radiation dominance epoch. Then, the obtained system is solved analytically. As a result of the solution analysis a conclusion was made about a significant increase of relic GWs with the frequencies $ k\gtrsim 10^{-11}$ Hz for magnetic field strength about 1 nGs. In addition, at the end of the article model dependency of the result is discussed</description>

      <title>Algebraic classification of the gravitational field in general metric-affine geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the algebraic classification of the gravitational field in four-dimensional general metric-affine geometries, thus extending the current results of the literature in the particular framework of Weyl-Cartan geometry by the presence of the traceless nonmetricity tensor. This quantity switches on four of the eleven fundamental parts of the irreducible representation of the curvature tensor under the pseudo-orthogonal group, in such a way that three of them present similar algebraic types as the ones obtained in Weyl-Cartan geometry, whereas the remaining one includes thirty independent components and gives rise to a new algebraic classification. The latter is derived by means of its principal null directions and their levels of alignment, obtaining a total number of sixteen main algebraic types, which can be split into many subtypes. As an immediate application, we determine the algebraic types of the broadest family of static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions with spin, dilation and shear charges in Metric-Affine Gravity.</description>

      <title>Rotating black holes in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We delve into the rotating black hole solutions in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity. Employing an analytical approach, we solve the field equations for scenarios both devoid of matter and in the presence of an electromagnetic field. Consequently, we obtain black hole solutions that extend beyond the Kerr-Newman family. These solutions are characterized not only by mass $M$, electric charge $Q$, and angular momentum $a$, but also by the graviton mass term, which introduces the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the St\"uckelberg charge $S$ into the black hole parameters. Instead of the St\"uckelberg field $\phi^a$, we utilize the matrix $\gamma^2$ to seek solutions. To derive the St\"uckelberg field $\phi^a$ from a given matrix $\gamma^2$ for axisymmetric metrics, one must relax the constraint on the reference metric $f_{ab} = \eta_{ab}$. These solutions potentially serve as candidates for astrophysical black holes.</description>

      <title>Unique Imprint of Black Hole Spin on the Polarization of Near-Horizon Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting information about the gravitational background from black hole images is both important and challenging. In this study, we use a physically motivated plasma model, typically applied to stationary, axisymmetric spacetimes, to demonstrate that in a rotating black hole spacetime, the polarizations of emitted light near the event horizon depend solely on the spacetime geometry, independent of the plasma flow geometry. We confirm that the frame-dragging effect of a rotating black hole governs the observed polarization structure in the near-horizon image. This finding indicates a unique imprint of the black hole spin on the polarization of the near-horizon image. We anticipate that refined observations of near-horizon emissions by the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope will enable us to determine the black hole spin in a straightforward manner.</description>

      <title>What is the nature of GW230529? An exploration of the gravitational lensing hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the 29th of May 2023, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration observed a compact binary coalescence event consistent with a neutron star-black hole merger, though the heavier object of mass 2.5-4.5 $M_\odot$ would fall into the purported lower mass gap. An alternative explanation for apparent observations of events in this mass range has been suggested as strongly gravitationally lensed binary neutron stars. In this scenario, magnification would lead to the source appearing closer and heavier than it really is. Here, we investigate the chances and possible consequences for the GW230529 event to be gravitationally lensed. We find this would require high magnifications and we obtain low rates for observing such an event, with a relative fraction of lensed versus unlensed observed events of $2 \times 10^{-3}$ at most. When comparing the lensed and unlensed hypotheses accounting for the latest rates and population model, we find a 1/58 chance of lensing, disfavoring this option. Moreover, when the magnification is assumed to be strong enough to bring the mass of the heavier binary component below the standard limits on neutron star masses, we find high probability for the lighter object to have a sub-solar mass, making the binary even more exotic than a mass-gap neutron star-black hole system. Even when the secondary is not sub-solar, its tidal deformability would likely be measurable, which is not the case for GW230529. Finally, we do not find evidence for extra lensing signatures such as the arrival of additional lensed images, type-II image dephasing, or microlensing. Therefore, we conclude it is unlikely for GW230529 to be a strongly gravitationally lensed binary neutron star signal.</description>

      <title>Overcharging a nonsingular black hole in general relativity: the nonlinear electrodynamic field effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has showed that, by accounting for the nonlinear electrodynamic field effects on the motion of test charged particles, it is possible to destroy an extremal and near-extremal black hole [Phys.Rev.D 101 (2020) 12, 124067]. Inspired by this perspective, we explore the potential for the destruction of a nonsingular black hole within the framework of general relativity, where gravity couples with nonlinear electrodynamic field. By combining the theory of nonlinear electrodynamics in curved spacetime, we obtain the conserved charges for test charged particles, then investigate the possibility of destroying the event horizon of the Ay\'on--Beato Garc\'\i a (ABG) nonsingular black hole by test charged particle and complex scalar field. We obtain the intervals for the parameter of the particle and scalar field which allow us to destroy the event horizon of an extremal and near-extremal ABG black hole black hole. Due to the nonlinear electrodynamic field effects, both an extremal and near-extremal black hole can be destroyed. Interestingly, we find that the parameter intervals for the test charged particle and the test complex scalar field that can destroy the event horizon of an extremal black hole are identical. Importantly, as the ABG black hole is a nonsingular black hole, our findings remain consistent with the weak cosmic censorship conjecture and might provide a viable approach to observe the internal structure of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and observational constraints on black holes with primary hair in Beyond Horndeski Gravity: Stability and shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We found that, unlike General Relativity, the shift-symmetric subclass of Beyond Horndeski theories provides black holes with primary hair, which are thermodynamically stable and compatible with current Event Horizon Telescope observations for M87* and Sgr A* black holes. We first investigate its thermodynamic properties by studying the influence of the primary hair on the thermodynamic quantities and the local stability, imposing severe constraints in the allowed range of the primary hair values. Then, we analyze the null geodesics near this black hole, demonstrating how the scalar hair influences the shadow diameter, finding that higher values of the primary hair lead to smaller shadow sizes. Additionally, we constrain the scalar hair using the observational data, revealing its sensitivity to the choice of other black hole parameters. To further probe the observational features of the scalar hair, we simulate face-on two-dimensional images of spherically infalling accretion disks, examining how the primary scalar hair affects the black hole's shadow. Finally, we impose all relevant constraints to identify black holes that are both stable and consistent with observational data.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction from a rotating black hole via magnetic reconnection: the plunging bulk plasma and orientation angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconection provides a new avenue to extract energy from a rotating black hole in astrophysical scenarios. There have been many works studying the feasibility of extracting energy via magnetic reconnection in the scheme of magnetohydrodynamics. However, most of them focused on circularly flowing bulk plasma only, and the influence of orientation angle, the angle between flowing direction of bulk plasma and ejection direction of plasmoids, was never carefully considered. In this work, we would like to study the energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in the plunging plasma, and more importantly, we analyze the influence of orientation angle in depth. Actually, we consider the magnetic reconnection occurring in bulk plasma with two kinds of streamlines, one being the circular flow and the other being the plunging flow from the ISCO. We find that the plunging plasma has higher energy-extraction efficiency. Moreover, we notice that it is favorable for energy extraction when the orientation angle is suitably increased if the bulk plasma plunges. We further define a quantity to characterize the energy extraction probability, through which we conclude that the plunging bulk plasma is much more capable in energy extraction than the circularly flowing one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We transcribe into the framework of the {\epsilon}-formalism of Infeld and van der Waerden the world definition of the Weyl tensor for a curved spacetime that occurs in the realm of Einstein-Cartan's theory. The resulting expression shows us that it is not possible to attain any general condition for conformal flatness in such a spacetime even if wave functions for gravitons are eventually taken to vanish identically. A short discussion on the situation concerning the limiting case of general relativity is presented thereafter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a set of special functions called multiple polyexponential integrals, defined as iterated integrals of the exponential integral $\text{Ei}(z)$. These functions arise in certain perturbative expansions of the local solutions of second-order ODEs around an irregular singularity. In particular, their recursive definition describes the asymptotic behavior of these local solutions. To complement the study of the multiple polyexponential integrals on the entire complex plane, we relate them with two other sets of special functions - the undressed and dressed multiple polyexponential functions - which are characterized by their Taylor series expansions around the origin.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the Weyl double copy to five-dimensional spacetime. We show that a special class of five-dimensional type N vacuum solutions admits a special class of degenerate Maxwell field that squares to give the Weyl tensor. The five-dimensional Weyl double copy relation defines a scalar field that satisfies the source-free Klein-Gordon equation on the curved background.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dark Matter on the Spontaneous Scalarization in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter, an important portion of compact objects, can influence different phenomena in neutron stars. The spontaneous scalarization in the scalar-tensor gravity has been proposed for neutron stars. Here, we investigate the spontaneous scalarization in dark matter admixed neutron stars. Applying the dark matter equations of state, we calculate the structure of scalarized neutron stars containing dark matter. The dark matter equations of state are based on observational data from the rotational curves of galaxies and the fermionic self-interacting dark matter. Our results verify that the spontaneous scalarization is affected by the dark matter pressure in neutron stars. Depending on the central density of scalarized dark matter admixed neutron stars, the dark matter pressure alters the central scalar field. The increase of dark matter pressure in low-density scalarized stars amplifies the central scalar field. However, the pressure of dark matter in high-density scalarized stars suppresses the central scalar field. Our calculations confirm that the stars in the merger event GW170817 and in the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1820-30 can be scalarized dark matter admixed neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the retarded Green's function and the greybody factor in asymptotically AdS black holes. Using the connection coefficients of the Heun equation, expressed in terms of the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) free energy of an $SU(2)$ supersymmetric gauge theory with four fundamental hypermultiplets, we derive asymptotic expansions for both the retarded Green's function and the greybody factor in the small horizon limit. Furthermore, we compute the corrections to these asymptotic expansions resulting from the resummation procedure of the instanton part of the NS function.</description>

      <title>A novel family of rotating black hole mimickers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.01105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent opening of gravitational wave astronomy has shifted the debate about black hole mimickers from a purely theoretical arena to a phenomenological one. In this respect, missing a definitive quantum gravity theory, the possibility to have simple, meta-geometries describing in a compact way alternative phenomenologically viable scenarios is potentially very appealing. A recently proposed metric by Simpson and Visser is exactly an example of such meta-geometry describing, for different values of a single parameter, different non-rotating black hole mimickers. Here, we employ the Newman--Janis procedure to construct a rotating generalisation of such geometry. We obtain a stationary, axially symmetric metric that depends on mass, spin and an additional real parameter $\ell$. According to the value of such parameter, the metric may represent a rotating traversable wormhole, a rotating regular black hole with one or two horizons, or three more limiting cases. By studying the internal and external rich structure of such solutions, we show that the obtained metric describes a family of interesting and simple regular geometries providing viable Kerr black hole mimickers for future phenomenological studies.</description>

Abstract: Circular photon orbit and black hole shadow are significantly important issues in physics and astronomy, and a number of breakthroughs have been witnessed in recent years. Conventionally, the stable and unstable circular photon orbits are obtained using the effective potential of test particles moving in black hole spacetime. In this work, a pure geometric approach is developed to calculate these circular photon orbits and black hole shadow radius. Furthermore, it can be proved that our geometric approach is completely equivalent to the conventional approach based on effective potentials of test particles.</description>

Abstract: New form of Fermat's principle for light propagation in arbitrary (i.e. in general neither static nor stationary) gravitational field is proposed. It is based on Herglotz extension of canonical formalism and simple relation between the dynamics described by the Lagrangians homogeneous in velocities and the reduced dynamics on lower-dimensional configuration manifold. This approach is more flexible as it allows to extend immediately the Fermat principle to the case of massive particles and to eliminate any space-time coordinate, not only $x^0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15760v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational lensing of supermassive black holes surrounded by dark matter halo has attracted a great number of interests in recent years. However, many studies employed simplified dark matter density models, which makes it very hard to give a precise prediction on the dark matter effects in real astrophysical galaxies. In this work, to more accurately describe the distribution of dark matter in real astrophysical galaxies, we study the gravitational lensing of black holes in astrophysical dark matter halo models (Beta, Burkert, Brownstein, and Moore). The deflection angle is obtained using a generalized Gibbons-Werner approach. The visual angular positions and the Einstein rings are also calculated by adopting the gravitational lens equation. Specifically, we choose the supermassive black holes in Milky Way Galaxy, Andromeda galaxy (M31), Virgo galaxy (M87), and ESO138-G014 galaxy as examples, including the corresponding fitted value of dark matter halos. The results suggest that the dark matter halo described by the Beta model has non-negligible influences on the gravitational deflection angle and gravitational lensing observations. However, the Burkert, Brownstein, and Moore models have relatively small influences on angular position of images and the Einstein ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in non-minimal coupling Gauss-Bonnet inflationary model in the presence of power-law potentials. We employ a two part coupling function to enhance primordial curvatures at small scales as well as satisfy Planck measurements at the CMB scale. Moreover, our model satisfies the swampland criteria. We find PBHs with different mass scales and demonstrate that PBHs with masses around $\mathcal{O}(10^{-14})M_{\odot}$ can account for almost all of the dark matter in the universe. In addition, we investigate the implications of the reheating stage and show that the PBHs in our model are generated during the radiation-dominated era. Furthermore, we investigate the production of scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs). More interestingly enough is that, for the specific cases $D_{\rm n}$ in our model, the GWs can be considered as a source of PTA signal. %evaluate the idea that the induced GWs propagating concurrently with the PBH production are the source of NANOGrav signal. Also, we conclude that the GWs energy density parameter at the nano-Hz regime can be parameterized as $\Omega_{\rm GW_0} (f) \sim f^{5-\gamma}$, where the obtained $\gamma$ is consistent with the PTA Observations.</description>

Abstract: In this brief note, we pursue the systematic investigation of possible gravitational wave sources in the gigahertz band. We focus on hyperbolic encounters of light black holes and evaluate precisely the expected signal when accounting for the detailed characteristics of haloscope experiments. Considering the GraHal setup as a benchmark, we insist on the correct signal-to-noise ratio expression taking into account the appropriate timescales. The associated maximum distance - of the order of a few hundreds of astronomical units - at which an event can be detected is calculated for optimal, sub-optimal, and general trajectories.</description>

      <title>Strong deflection limit analysis of black hole lensing in inhomogeneous plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates gravitational lensing effects in the presence of plasma in the strong deflection limit, which corresponds to light rays circling around a compact object and forming higher-order images. While previous studies of this case have predominantly focused on the deflection of light in a vacuum or in the presence of a homogeneous plasma, this work introduces an analytical treatment for the influence of a non-uniform plasma. After recalling the exact expression for the deflection angle of photons in a static, asymptotically flat and spherically symmetric spacetime filled with cold non-magnetized plasma, a strong deflection limit analysis is presented. Particular attention is then given to the case of a Schwarzschild spacetime, where the deflection angle of photons for different density profiles of plasma is obtained. Moreover, perturbative results for an arbitrary power-law radial density profile are also presented. These formulae are then applied to the calculation of the positions and magnifications of higher-order images, concluding that the presence of a non-uniform plasma reduces both their angular size and their magnifications, at least within the range of the power-law indices considered. These findings contribute to the understanding of gravitational lensing in the presence of plasma, offering a versatile framework applicable to various asymptotically flat and spherically symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Quantum diffeomorphisms cannot make indefinite causal order definite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of indefinite causal order has seen significant advancements in recent years. While classically the causal order of two timelike separated events A and B is fixed - either A before B or B before A - this is no longer true in quantum theory. There, it is possible to encounter superpositions of causal orders. The quantum switch is one of the most prominent processes with indefinite causal order. While the optical quantum switch has been successfully implemented in experiments, some argue that this merely simulates a process with indefinite causal order and that a superposition of spacetime metrics is required for a true realization. Here, we provide a relativistic definition of causal order, show that it encompasses both the optical and gravitational quantum switch, and does not differentiate between them. Moreover, we show that this notion of causal order is invariant under so-called quantum diffeomorphisms and that it is an operationally meaningful observable in both the general relativistic and quantum mechanical sense. Importantly, this observable does not distinguish between the indefinite causal order implemented in the optical and gravitational quantum switch, thus supporting the thesis that the optical quantum switch is just as much a realization of indefinite causal order as its gravitational counterpart.</description>

      <title>Things that might go bump in the night: Assessing structure in the binary black hole mass spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several features in the mass spectrum of merging binary black holes (BBHs) have been identified using data from the Third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). These features are of particular interest as they may encode the uncertain mechanism of BBH formation. We assess if the features are statistically significant or the result of Poisson noise due to the finite number of observed events. We simulate catalogs of BBHs whose underlying distribution does not have the features of interest, apply the analysis previously performed on GWTC-3, and determine how often such features are spuriously found. We find that one of the features found in GWTC-3, the peak at $\sim35\,M_{\odot}$, cannot be explained by Poisson noise alone: peaks as significant occur in $1.7\%$ of catalogs generated from a featureless population. This peak is therefore likely to be of astrophysical origin. The data is suggestive of an additional significant peak at $\sim10\,M_{\odot}$, though the exact location of this feature is not resolvable with current observations. Additional structure beyond a power law, such as the purported dip at $\sim14\,M_{\odot}$, can be explained by Poisson noise. We also provide a publicly-available package, \texttt{GWMockCat}, that creates simulated catalogs of BBH events with correlated measurement uncertainty and selection effects according to user-specified underlying distributions and detector sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the early universe's equation of state and primordial black hole production with PTA, BBN, and CMB observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array (PTA) data releases showed strong evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave background in the nanohertz band. When the signal is interpreted by a scenario of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), we encounter overproduction of primordial black holes (PBHs). We wonder if varying the equation of state (EoS) of the early Universe can resolve this issue and thereby lead to a consistent interpretation of the PTA data. Analyzing a data combination of PTA, big-bang nucleosynthesis, and cosmic microwave background, we find that an epoch with EoS $w\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ between the end of inflation and the onset of radiation domination can significantly suppress the production of PBHs, leading to alleviation of the PBH-overproduction issue. With the inferred interval $w=0.44_{-0.40}^{+0.52}$ at 95\% confidence level, our scenario can interpret the PTA data just as well as the conventional scenario of SIGWs produced during the radiation domination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the enhancement of the power spectra large enough to produce primordial black holes in models with multiple scalar fields. We present analytic solutions for the perturbations in the case of constant turns without the need for an effective field theory for the first time and clarify the role of the Hubble friction that has been overlooked previously. We derive the criteria for an arbitrary number of fields that can lead to an exponential amplification of the curvature perturbation on subhorizon scales, while leaving the perturbations stable on superhorizon scales. Finally, we apply our results to a three-field generalization of the "ultra-light'' scenario and show how the presence of field-space torsion can yield distinct observables compared to the two-field case.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Accretion-Driven Starquakes in Recycled Millisecond Pulsars using Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recycled millisecond pulsars are susceptible to starquakes as they are continuously accreting matter from their binary companion. A starquake happens when the rotational frequency of the star crosses its breaking frequency. In this study, we perform a model analysis of an accreting neutron star suffering a starquake. We analyze two models: a spherical star with accreting mountains and a deformed star with accreting mountains. We find that as the star crosses the breaking frequency and suffers a starquake there is a sudden change in the continuous gravitational wave signal arriving from them. It is interesting to note that the amplitude of the gravitational wave signals increases suddenly for the spherical star. In contrast, for the deformed star, the amplitude of the continuous gravitational wave signal decreases suddenly. This sudden change in the continuous gravitational wave signal in recycled millisecond pulsars can be a unique signature for such pulsars undergoing a starquake.</description>

      <title>Non-Relativistic Limits of Bosonic and Heterotic Double Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The known stringy non-relativistic (NR) limit of the universal NS-NS sector of supergravity has a finite Lagrangian due to non-trivial cancellations of divergent parts coming from the metric and the $B$-field. We demonstrate that in Double Field Theory (DFT) and generalised geometry these cancellations already happen at the level of the generalised metric, which is convergent in the limit $c \rightarrow \infty$, implying that the NR limit can be imposed before solving the strong constraint. We present the $c$-expansion of the generalised metric, which reproduces the Non-Riemannian formulation of DFT at the (finite) leading order, and the $c$-expansion of the generalised frame, which contains divergences. We also extend this approach to the non-Abelian gauge field of Heterotic DFT assuming a convergent expansion for the O$(D,D+n)$ generalised metric. From this proposal, we derive a novel $c$-expansion for the bosonic part of the heterotic supergravity which is, by construction, compatible with O$(D,D)$-symmetry.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Stealth Bias in LISA observations of Double White Dwarf Binaries due to Tidal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double white dwarfs are important gravitational wave sources for LISA, as they are some of the most numerous compact systems in our universe. Here we consider finite-sized effects due to tidal interactions, as they are expected to have a measurable impact on these systems. Previous studies suggested that tidal effects would allow the individual masses to be measured, but there was a subtle error in those analyses. Using a fully Bayesian analysis we find that while tidal effects do not allow us to constrain the individual masses, they do yield informative lower bounds on the total mass of the system. Including tidal effects is crucial to the accuracy of our estimation of the chirp and total mass. Neglecting tidal effects leads to significant biases towards higher chirp masses, and we see that the lower bound of the total masses is biased towards a higher value as well. For many systems observed by LISA, tidal effects can lead to a "stealth" bias, since only the first derivative of the frequency can be measured. To separate tidal effects from the usual point particle decay we need to be able to measure the change in the second derivative of the frequency cause by the tides. This can only be done for high frequency systems observed with high signal-to-noise. The bias, if not accounted for, can have significant astrophysical implications; for example, it could lead to an incorrect estimation of the population of potential Type IA supernovae progenitors.</description>

      <title>Prospect of Precision Cosmology and Testing General Relativity using Binary Black Holes- Galaxies Cross-correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modified theories of gravity predict deviations from General Relativity (GR) in the propagation of gravitational waves (GW) across cosmological distances. A key prediction is that the GW luminosity distance will vary with redshift, differing from the electromagnetic (EM) luminosity distance due to varying effective Planck mass. We introduce a model-independent, data-driven approach to explore these deviations using multi-messenger observations of dark standard sirens (Binary Black Holes, BBH). By combining GW luminosity distance measurements from dark sirens with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, BBH redshifts inferred from cross-correlation with spectroscopic or photometric galaxy surveys, and sound horizon measurements from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we can make a data-driven test of GR (jointly with the Hubble constant) as a function of redshift. Using the multi-messenger technique with the spectroscopic DESI galaxy survey, we achieve precise measurements of deviations in the effective Planck mass variation with redshift. For the Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope (CEET), the best precision is approximately 3.6\%, and for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK), it is 7.4\% at a redshift of $\rm{z = 0.425}$. Additionally, we can measure the Hubble constant with a precision of about 1.1\% from CEET and 7\% from LVK over five years of observation with a 75\% duty cycle. We also explore the potential of cross-correlation with photometric galaxy surveys from the Rubin Observatory, extending measurements up to a redshift of $\rm{z \sim 2.5}$. This approach can reveal potential deviations from models affecting GW propagation using numerous dark standard sirens in synergy with DESI and the Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Is Lattice Quantum Gravity Asymptotically Safe? Making contact between Causal Dynamical Triangulations and the Functional Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare the effective action of the scale factor obtained from lattice quantum gravity (in the form of Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT)) to the corresponding effective action obtained from the simplest Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) calculation. In this way, we can identify the generic infinite four-volume limit of the lattice theory in the so-called de Sitter phase with the Gaussian fixed-point limit or the IR fixed-point limit obtained by FRG. We also show how to identify a putative UV lattice gravity fixed point. Our Monte Carlo simulations of CDT allow for the existence of such a UV fixed point, although the data precision does not yet provide a proof of its existence. The concept of a correlation length relevant for the lattice gravity fixed points is argued to be different from the concept of correlation lengths encountered in field theories in a fixed spacetime background.</description>
