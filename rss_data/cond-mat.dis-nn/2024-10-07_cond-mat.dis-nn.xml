      <title>Gaussian Level-Set Percolation on Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a solution of the problem of level-set percolation for multivariate Gaussians defined in terms of weighted graph Laplacians on complex networks. It is achieved using a cavity or message passing approach, which allows one to obtain the essential ingredient required for the solution, viz. a self-consistent determination of locally varying percolation probabilities. The cavity solution can be evaluated both for single large instances of locally tree-like graphs, and in the thermodynamic limit of random graphs of finite mean degree in the configuration model class. The critical level $h_c$ of the percolation transition is obtained through the condition that the largest eigenvalue of a weighted version $B$ of a non-backtracking matrix satisfies $\lambda_{\rm max}(B)|_{h_c} =1$. We present level-dependent distributions of local percolation probabilities for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks and and for networks with degree distributions described by power laws. We find that there is a strong correlation between marginal single-node variances of a massless multivariate Gaussian and local percolation probabilities at a given level $h$, which is nearly perfect at negative values $h$, but weakens as $h\nearrow 0$ for the system with power law degree distribution, and generally also for negative values of $h$, if the multivariate Gaussian acquires a non-zero mass. The theoretical analysis simplifies in the case of random regular graphs with uniform edge-weights of the weighted graph Laplacian of the system and uniform mass parameter of the Gaussian field. An asymptotic analysis reveals that for edge-weights $K=K(c)\equiv 1$ the critical percolation threshold $h_c$ decreases to 0, as the degree $c$ of the random regular graph diverges. For $K=K(c)=1/c$, on the other hand, the critical percolation threshold $h_c$ is shown to diverge as $c\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Emergent Matryoshka doll-like point gap in a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a geometric series modulated non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice model, and explore its localization and topological properties. The results show that with the ever-increasing summation terms of the geometric series, multiple mobility edges and non-Hermitian point gaps with high winding number can be induced in the system. The point gap spectrum of the system has a Matryoshka doll-like structure in the complex plane, resulting in a high winding number. In addition, we analyze the limit case of summation of infinite terms. The results show that the mobility edges merge together as only one mobility edge when summation terms are pushed to the limit. Meanwhile, the corresponding point gaps are merged into a ring with winding number equal to one. Through Avila's global theory, we give an analytical expression for mobility edges in the limit of infinite summation, reconfirming that mobility edges and point gaps do merge and will result in a winding number that is indeed equal to one.</description>

      <title>Is the Future of Materials Amorphous? Challenges and Opportunities in Simulations of Amorphous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous solids form an enormous and underutilized class of materials. In order to drive the discovery of new useful amorphous materials further we need to achieve a closer convergence between computational and experimental methods. In this review, we highlight some of the important gaps between computational simulations and experiments, discuss popular state-of-the-art computational techniques such as the Activation Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn) and Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC), and introduce more recent advances: machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) and generative machine learning for simulations of amorphous matter, e.g., the Morphological Autoregressive Protocol (MAP). Examples are drawn from the amorphous silicon and silica literature as well as from molecular glasses. Our outlook stresses the need for new computational methods to extend the time- and length- scales accessible through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Grokking at the Edge of Linear Separability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generalization properties of binary logistic classification in a simplified setting, for which a "memorizing" and "generalizing" solution can always be strictly defined, and elucidate empirically and analytically the mechanism underlying Grokking in its dynamics. We analyze the asymptotic long-time dynamics of logistic classification on a random feature model with a constant label and show that it exhibits Grokking, in the sense of delayed generalization and non-monotonic test loss. We find that Grokking is amplified when classification is applied to training sets which are on the verge of linear separability. Even though a perfect generalizing solution always exists, we prove the implicit bias of the logisitc loss will cause the model to overfit if the training data is linearly separable from the origin. For training sets that are not separable from the origin, the model will always generalize perfectly asymptotically, but overfitting may occur at early stages of training. Importantly, in the vicinity of the transition, that is, for training sets that are almost separable from the origin, the model may overfit for arbitrarily long times before generalizing. We gain more insights by examining a tractable one-dimensional toy model that quantitatively captures the key features of the full model. Finally, we highlight intriguing common properties of our findings with recent literature, suggesting that grokking generally occurs in proximity to the interpolation threshold, reminiscent of critical phenomena often observed in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Spotting structural defects in crystals from the topology of vibrational modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because of the inevitably disordered background, structural defects are not well-defined concepts in amorphous solids. In order to overcome this difficulty, it has been recently proposed that topological defects can be still identified in the pattern of vibrational modes, by looking at the corresponding eigenvector field at low frequency. Moreover, it has been verified that these defects strongly correlate with the location of soft spots in glasses, that are the regions more prone to plastic rearrangements. Here, we show that the topology of vibrational modes predicts the location of structural defects in crystals as well, including the cases of dislocations, disclinations and Eshelby inclusions. Our results suggest that in crystalline solids topological defects in the vibrational modes are directly connected to the well-established structural defects governing plastic deformations and present characteristics very similar to those observed in amorphous solids.</description>

      <title>Kondo Impurities at a Finite Concentration of Impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the Kondo impurity problem - at a finite concentration of impurities. We identify two parameter regimes for the Kondo impurity problem. 1) The single impurity limit, where the concentration of Kondo impurities is so low that the background scattering mechanisms (non-magnetic impurities, Umklapp scattering, etc.) of the metal considered are the dominant conduction electron scattering mechanisms at zero temperature. 2) The dilute impurity system limit, where there is a resistance minimum signifying that the concentration of magnetic impurities is such that they form the dominant form of conduction electron scattering at zero temperature of the metal in question. Most theoretical efforts are currently in regime where a single isolated impurity is considered - regime 1) while most experimental efforts are in regime 2). We present analytical evidence that this explains the well known discrepancy between experiment and theory as to the value of the Kondo temperature. We find that the ratio between the two Kondo temperatures in regime 1) and regime 2) is given by: $\mathcal{R}=\exp\left[\frac{\pi^{2}\rho v_{F}}{2k_{F}^{2}Vol}\right]$ where $\rho$ is the density of states, $v_{F}$ is the fermi velocity, and $k_{F}$ is the Fermi wavevector and $Vol$ is the volume of a unit cell. We note that there is no dependence on the impurity concentration in this ratio so it is possible to define a single Kondo temperature for limit 2) for the dilute Kondo impurity system. In this work wepresent results within the Reed-Newns meanfield approximation and to leading order of the linked cluster expansion.</description>

      <title>Localization transitions in quadratic systems without quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transitions from delocalized to localized eigenstates have been extensively studied in both quadratic and interacting models. The delocalized regime typically exhibits diffusion and quantum chaos, and its properties comply with the random matrix theory (RMT) predictions. However, it is also known that in certain quadratic models, the delocalization in position space is not accompanied by the single-particle quantum chaos. Here, we study the one-dimensional Anderson and Wannier-Stark models that exhibit eigenstate transitions from localization in quasimomentum space (supporting ballistic transport) to localization in position space (with no transport) in a nonstandard thermodynamic limit, which assumes rescaling the model parameters with the system size. We show that the transition point may exhibit an unconventional character of Janus type, i.e., some measures hint at the RMT-like universality emerging at the transition point, while others depart from it. For example, the eigenstate entanglement entropies may exhibit, depending on the bipartition, a volume-law behavior that either approaches the value of Haar-random Gaussian states, or converges to a lower, non-universal value. Our results hint at rich diversity of volume-law eigenstate entanglement entropies in quadratic systems that are not maximally entangled.</description>

      <title>Magnetic instability and spin-glass order beyond the Anderson-Mott transition in interacting power-law random banded matrix fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of quenched disorder, the interplay between local magnetic-moment formation and Anderson localization for electrons at a zero-temperature, metal-insulator transition (MIT) remains a long unresolved problem. Here, we study the emergence of these phenomena in a power-law random banded matrix model of spin-1/2 fermions with repulsive Hubbard interactions. Focusing on the regime of weak interactions, we perform both analytical field theory and numerical self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations. We show that interference-mediated effects strongly enhance the density of states and magnetic fluctuations upon approaching the MIT from the metallic side. These are consistent with results due to Finkel'stein obtained four decades ago. Our numerics further show that local moments nucleate from typical states as we cross the MIT, with a density that grows continuously into the insulating phase. We identify spin-glass order in the insulator by computing the overlap distribution between converged Hartree-Fock mean-field moment profiles. Our results indicate that itinerant interference effects can morph smoothly into moment formation and magnetic frustration within a single model, revealing a common origin for these disparate phenomena.</description>

      <title>Information scrambling and butterfly velocity in quantum spin glass chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make lattice generalization of two well-known zero-dimensional models of quantum spin glass, Sachdev-Ye (SY) and spherical quantum $p$-spin glass model, to one dimension for studying crossovers in non-local scrambling dynamics due to glass transition, complex dynamics, and quantum and thermal fluctuations in paramagnetic (PM) and spin glass (SG) phases. In the SY chain of quantum dots, each described by infinite-range random Heisenberg model of $N$ spin-$S$ $SU(M)$ spins, we obtain the quantum Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ and butterfly velocity $v_B$ as a function of temperature $T$ and the quantum parameter $S$ across the PM-SG phase boundary using a bosonic spinon representation in the large $N,M$ limit. In particular, we extract asymptotic $T$ and $S$ dependence, e.g., power laws, for $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ and $v_B$ in different regions deep inside the phases and near the replica symmetry breaking SG transition. We find the chaos to be non-maximal almost over the entire phase diagram. Very similar results for chaos indicators are found for the $p$-spin glass chain as a function of temperature and a suitable quantum parameter $\Gamma$, with some important qualitative differences. In particular, $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ and $v_B$ exhibit a maximum, coinciding with onset of complex glassy relaxation, above the glass transition as a function of $T$ and $\Gamma$ in the PM phase of the $p$-spin glass model. In contrast, the maximum is only observed as a function of $S$, but not with temperature, in the PM phase of SY model. The maximum originates from enhanced chaos due to maximal complexity in the glassy landscape. Thus, the results in the SY model indicate very different evolution of glassy complexity with quantum and thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we propose a mechanism of an emergent quasi-localized phase in chiral symmetry classes, where wave function along a spatial direction with weak topology is delocalized but exponentially localized along the other directions. The Anderson transition in 2D chiral symmetry classes is induced by the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs of a U(1) phase degree of freedom, while the weak topology endows the pair with the Berry phase. We argue that the Berry phase induces spatial polarizations of the pairs along the topological direction through the quantum interference effect, and the proliferation of the polarized vortex pairs results in the quasi-localized phase.</description>

Abstract: The multifractal critical phase (MCP) fundamentally differs from extended and localized phases, exhibiting delocalized distributions in both position and momentum spaces. The investigation on the MCP has largely focused on one-dimensional quasiperiodic systems. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional (2D) quasiperiodic model with a MCP. We present its phase diagram and investigate the characteristics of the 2D system's MCP in terms of wave packet diffusion and transport based on this model. We further investigate the movement of the phase boundary induced by the introduction of next-nearest-neighbor hopping by calculating the fidelity susceptibility. Finally, we consider how to realize our studied model in superconducting circuits. Our work opens the door to exploring MCP in 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in symmetric random circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry, which serves as a diagnostic tool for symmetry breaking and a proxy for thermalization, has recently been proposed and studied in the context of symmetry restoration for quantum many-body systems undergoing a quench. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration in various symmetric random quantum circuits, particularly focusing on the U(1) symmetry case. In contrast to non-symmetric random circuits where the U(1) symmetry of a small subsystem can always be restored at late times, we reveal that symmetry restoration can fail in U(1)-symmetric circuits for certain weak symmetry-broken initial states in finite-size systems. In the early-time dynamics, we observe an intriguing quantum Mpemba effect implying that symmetry is restored faster when the initial state is more asymmetric. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement asymmetry dynamics for SU(2) and $Z_{2}$ symmetric circuits and identify the presence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect for the corresponding symmetries, respectively. A unified understanding of these results is provided through the lens of quantum thermalization with conserved charges.</description>

We consider out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC) and K-complexity as probe of information scrambling. The OTOC for local spin operators in all directions has a light-cone structure which is ``shell-like''. As the wavefront passes, the OTOC approaches to zero in the long-time limit, showing no signature of scrambling. The introduction of spatial or temporal disorder changes the shape of the light-cone akin to localization of wavefunction. We formulate the K-complexity in system with discrete-time evolution, and show that it grows linearly in discrete-time quantum walk. The presence of disorder modifies this growth to sub-linear. Our study present interesting case to explore many-body phenomenon in discrete-time quantum walk using scrambling.</description>
