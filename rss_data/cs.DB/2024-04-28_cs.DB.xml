      <title>Automated Data Visualization from Natural Language via Large Language Models: An Exploratory Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Natural Language to Visualization (NL2Vis) task aims to transform natural-language descriptions into visual representations for a grounded table, enabling users to gain insights from vast amounts of data. Recently, many deep learning-based approaches have been developed for NL2Vis. Despite the considerable efforts made by these approaches, challenges persist in visualizing data sourced from unseen databases or spanning multiple tables. Taking inspiration from the remarkable generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper conducts an empirical study to evaluate their potential in generating visualizations, and explore the effectiveness of in-context learning prompts for enhancing this task. In particular, we first explore the ways of transforming structured tabular data into sequential text prompts, as to feed them into LLMs and analyze which table content contributes most to the NL2Vis. Our findings suggest that transforming structured tabular data into programs is effective, and it is essential to consider the table schema when formulating prompts. Furthermore, we evaluate two types of LLMs: finetuned models (e.g., T5-Small) and inference-only models (e.g., GPT-3.5), against state-of-the-art methods, using the NL2Vis benchmarks (i.e., nvBench). The experimental results reveal that LLMs outperform baselines, with inference-only models consistently exhibiting performance improvements, at times even surpassing fine-tuned models when provided with certain few-shot demonstrations through in-context learning. Finally, we analyze when the LLMs fail in NL2Vis, and propose to iteratively update the results using strategies such as chain-of-thought, role-playing, and code-interpreter. The experimental results confirm the efficacy of iterative updates and hold great potential for future study.</description>

      <title>Raising the ClaSS of Streaming Time Series Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ubiquitous sensors today emit high frequency streams of numerical measurements that reflect properties of human, animal, industrial, commercial, and natural processes. Shifts in such processes, e.g. caused by external events or internal state changes, manifest as changes in the recorded signals. The task of streaming time series segmentation (STSS) is to partition the stream into consecutive variable-sized segments that correspond to states of the observed processes or entities. The partition operation itself must in performance be able to cope with the input frequency of the signals. We introduce ClaSS, a novel, efficient, and highly accurate algorithm for STSS. ClaSS assesses the homogeneity of potential partitions using self-supervised time series classification and applies statistical tests to detect significant change points (CPs). In our experimental evaluation using two large benchmarks and six real-world data archives, we found ClaSS to be significantly more precise than eight state-of-the-art competitors. Its space and time complexity is independent of segment sizes and linear only in the sliding window size. We also provide ClaSS as a window operator with an average throughput of 1k data points per second for the Apache Flink streaming engine.</description>

      <title>Urban Region Representation Learning with Attentive Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An increasing number of related urban data sources have brought forth novel opportunities for learning urban region representations, i.e., embeddings. The embeddings describe latent features of urban regions and enable discovering similar regions for urban planning applications. Existing methods learn an embedding for a region using every different type of region feature data, and subsequently fuse all learned embeddings of a region to generate a unified region embedding. However, these studies often overlook the significance of the fusion process. The typical fusion methods rely on simple aggregation, such as summation and concatenation, thereby disregarding correlations within the fused region embeddings.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel model named HAFusion. Our model is powered by a dual-feature attentive fusion module named DAFusion, which fuses embeddings from different region features to learn higher-order correlations between the regions as well as between the different types of region features. DAFusion is generic - it can be integrated into existing models to enhance their fusion process. Further, motivated by the effective fusion capability of an attentive module, we propose a hybrid attentive feature learning module named HALearning to enhance the embedding learning from each individual type of region features. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our model HAFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods across three different prediction tasks. Using our learned region embedding leads to consistent and up to 31% improvements in the prediction accuracy.</description>
