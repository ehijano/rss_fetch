      <title>Necessary conditions for the boundedness of fractional operators on variable Lebesgue spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove necessary conditions for the boundedness of fractional operators on the variable Lebesgue spaces. More precisely, we find necessary conditions on an exponent function $\pp$ for a fractional maximal operator $M_\alpha$ or a non-degenerate fractional singular integral operator $T_\alpha$, $0 \leq \alpha &lt; n$, to satisfy weak $(\pp,\qq)$ inequalities or strong $(\pp,\qq)$ inequalities, with $\qq$ being defined pointwise almost everywhere by
  %
  \[ \frac{1}{p(x)} - \frac{1}{q(x)} = \frac{\alpha}{n}. \]
  %
  We first prove preliminary results linking fractional averaging operators and the $K_0^\alpha$ condition, a qualitative condition on $\pp$ related to the norms of characteristic functions of cubes, and show some useful implications of the $K_0^\alpha$ condition. We then show that if $M_\alpha$ satisfies weak $(\pp,\qq)$ inequalities, then $\pp \in K_0^\alpha(\R^n)$. We use this to prove that if $M_\alpha$ satisfies strong $(\pp,\qq)$ inequalities, then $p_-&gt;1$. Finally, we prove a powerful pointwise estimate for $T_\alpha$ that relates $T_\alpha$ to $M_\alpha$ along a carefully chosen family of cubes. This allows us to prove necessary conditions for fractional singular integral operators similar to those for fractional maximal operators.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal polynomials in the normal matrix model with two insertions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight $|z^2+a^2|^{cN}e^{-N|z|^2}$ in the whole complex plane. We obtain strong asymptotics and the limiting normalized zero counting measure (mother body) of the orthogonal polynomials of degree $n$ in the scaling limit $n,N\to \infty$ such that $\frac{n}{N}\to t$. We restrict ourselves to the case $a^2\geq 2c$, $cN$ integer, and $t&lt;t^{*}$ where $t^{*}$ is a constant depending only on $a,c$. Due to this restriction, the mother body is supported on an interval. We also find the two dimensional equilibrium measure (droplet) associated with the eigenvalues in the corresponding normal matrix model.
  Our method relies on the recent result that the planar orthogonal polynomials are a part of a vector of type I multiple orthogonal polynomials, and this enables us to apply the steepest descent method to the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

      <title>Invariant Tori and Periodic Orbits in the FitzHugh-Nagumo System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo system is a $4$-parameter family of $3$D vector field used for modeling neural excitation and nerve impulse propagation. The origin represents a Hopf-zero equilibrium in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system for two classes of parameters. In this paper, we employ recent techniques in averaging theory to investigate, besides periodic solutions, the bifurcation of invariant tori within the aforementioned families. We provide explicit generic conditions for the existence of these tori and analyze their stability properties. Furthermore, we employ the backward differentiation formula to solve the stiff differential equations and provide numerical simulations for each of the mentioned results.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of tiles in finite Abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of periodic tiling (PT) property for finite abelian groups. A group has the PT property if any non-periodic set that tiles the group by translation has a periodic tiling complement. This property extends the scope beyond groups with the Haj\'os property. We classify all cyclic groups having the PT property. Additionally, we construct groups that possess the PT property but without the Haj\'os property. As byproduct, we identify new groups for which the implication ``Tile $\Longrightarrow$ Spectral" holds. For elementary $p$-groups having the PT property, we show that a tile must be a complete set of representatives of the cosets of some subgroup, by analyzing the structure of tiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03171v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper derives a way to express differentiable complex-valued functions as the sum of powers of $(1-e^{\lambda x})$, where $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$, with an explicit formula for the remainder. This formulation is then used to associate an infinite series to $C^\infty$ functions, which is shown to recover the original function under suitable conditions on the remainder. These results are also used to calculate some infinite series involving Stirling Numbers, as well as providing a few examples.</description>

      <title>Algebraic solutions of linear differential equations: an arithmetic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a linear differential equation with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}(x)$, an important question is to know whether its full space of solutions consists of algebraic functions, or at least if one of its specific solutions is algebraic. After presenting motivating examples coming from various branches of mathematics, we advertise in an elementary way a beautiful local-global arithmetic approach to these questions, initiated by Grothendieck in the late sixties. This approach has deep ramifications and leads to the still unsolved Grothendieck-Katz $p$-curvature conjecture.</description>

      <title>Quantitative 2D propagation of smallness and control for 1D heat equations with power growth potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relation between propagation of smallness in the plane and control for heat equations. The former has been proved by Zhu who showed how the value of solutions in some small set propagates to a larger domain. By reviewing his proof, we establish a quantitative version with the explicit dependence of parameters. Using this explicit version, we establish new exact null-controllability results of 1D heat equations with any nonnegative power growth potentials $V\in\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R})$. As a key ingredient, new spectral inequalities are established. The control set $\Omega$ that we consider satisfy \begin{equation*}
  \left|\Omega\cap [x-L\langle x\rangle ^{-s},x+L\langle x\rangle ^{-s}]\right|\ge \gamma^{\langle x\rangle^\tau}2L\langle x\rangle^{-s} \end{equation*} for some $\gamma\in(0,1)$, $L&gt;0$, $\tau,s\ge 0$, and $\langle x\rangle:=(1+|x|^2)^{1 /2} $. In particular, the null-controllability result for the case of thick sets that allow the decay of the density (\textit{i.e.}, $s=0$ and $\tau\ge 0$) is included. These extend the Zhu-Zhuge's results from $\Omega$ being the union of equidistributive open sets to thick sets in the 1-dimensional case, and Su-Sun-Yuan's result from bounded potentials to certain unbounded ones.</description>

      <title>Congruence Classes of Simplex Structures in Finite Field Vector Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem over finite fields. For a graph $G$, two embeddings $p, p': V(G) \to \mathbb{F}_q^d$ of a graph $G$ are congruent if for all edges $(v_i, v_j)$ of $G$ we have that $||p(v_i) - p(v_j)|| = ||p'(v_i) - p'(v_j)||$. What is the infimum of $s$ such that for any subset $E\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $|E| \gtrsim q^s$, $E$ contains a positive proportion of congruence classes of $G$ in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$? Bennett et al. and McDonald used group action methods to prove results in the case of $k$-simplices. The work of Iosevich, Jardine, and McDonald as well as that of Bright et al. have proved results in the case of trees and trees of simplices, utilizing the inductive nature of these graphs.
  Recently, Aksoy, Iosevich, and McDonald combined these two approaches to obtain nontrivial bounds on the "bowtie" graph, two triangles joined at a vertex. Their proof relies on an application of the Hadamard three-lines theorem to pass to a different graph. We develop novel geometric techniques called branch shifting and simplex unbalancing to reduce our analysis of trees of simplices to a much smaller class of simplex structures. This allows us to establish a framework that handles a wide class of graphs exhibiting a combination of rigid and loose behavior. In $\mathbb{F}_q^2$, this approach gives new nontrivial bounds on chains and trees of simplices. In $\mathbb{F}_q^d$, we improve on the results of Bright et al. in many cases and generalize their work to a wider class of simplex trees. We discuss partial progress on how this framework can be extended to more general simplex structures, such as cycles of simplices and structures of simplices glued together along an edge or a face.</description>
