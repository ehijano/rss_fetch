      <title>Low-energy 17O(n,g)18O reaction within the microscopic potential model and its role for the weak r-process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutron radiative capture reaction $^{17}$O(n,$\gamma$)18O plays a pivotal role in both nuclear structure studies and astrophysical nucleosynthesis, particularly in the formation of elements during hydrostatic and explosive stellar environments. We calculated the $^{17}$O(n,$\gamma$)$^{18}$O cross section within the Skyrme Hartree-Fock potential model and analyzed electric dipole E1 transitions to both positive and negative-parity states below the alpha-decay threshold in $^{18}$O. Our cross sections are significantly different from the data available in commonly used libraries. We further investigate the impact of the new calculated cross section on weak r-process nucleosynthesis using large-scale reaction network calculations across a wide range of electron fractions and entropies. Our results show that the $^{17}$O(n, $\gamma$)$^{18}$O reaction rate significantly influences the production of first r-process peak elements, such as strontium, under specific astrophysical conditions. This study highlights the importance of accurate nuclear dat$ for light isotopes in modeling heavy-element synthesis and provides updated reaction rates for future nucleosynthesis simulations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Yield Rate of \textsuperscript{229m}Th via Cascade Decay in Storage Rings and Electron Beam Ion Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy nuclear isomeric state of \textsuperscript{229m}Th provides a unique bridge between nuclear and atomic physics, enabling applications such as nuclear clocks and precision metrology. However, efficient and controllable production of \textsuperscript{229m}Th remains a major experimental challenge. We propose an efficient scheme to produce the $^{229\mathrm{m}}$Th in storage rings (SRs) and electron beam ion traps (EBITs), using a cascade decay pathway. Highly charged ions are excited to higher nuclear states via nuclear excitation by inelastic electron scattering (NEIES) and nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC), followed by radiative or internal conversion cascades that populate the isomer. Our calculations demonstrate that, under typical SRs and EBITs conditions, optimized indirect excitation pathways significantly enhance \textsuperscript{229m}Th production rate. In particular, NEIES can provide an enhancement of up to four orders of magnitude through cascade de-excitation at high energies, while NEEC can contribute an additional enhancement of up to several tens of times. Such a significant increase in the \textsuperscript{229m}Th yield rate would facilitate its application in various nuclear photonics fields, especially in the development of atomic nuclear clocks.</description>

      <title>$f_2(1270)\to\pi+\pi$ as a probe of spin and vorticity in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlation between vorticity and spin alignment in heavy-ion collisions can be probed through polarization measurements of hadrons, whose total spin originates from both constituent-quark spins and orbital angular momentum in the quark-model framework. To motivate such experimental studies, we calculate the general angular distribution of produced pion in $f_2(1270)\to\pi+\pi$ using interaction Lagrangian and helicity formalism and check that both methods yield the same result. The distribution is given as a function of angle between pion and initial quantization axis of $f_2$ and the spin density matrix element of $f_2$. Its diagonal entries and $\rho_{20}$ component were computed assuming local thermal equilibrium and blast wave model for different centrality classes, hence given as a function of azimuthal angle with respect to the impact parameter.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal angular entanglement between decaying particles in ultra-peripheral ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) involving relativistic heavy ions are a unique laboratory to study quantum correlations. The intense electromagnetic fields generate high rates of photonuclear interactions, including events involving multiple photon exchange. Multiple photon exchange can result in the production of multiple vector mesons and/or nuclear excitations. These interactions share a common impact parameter, so the photons have the same linear polarization. The shared polarization entangles the particles, leading to unique quantum correlations. The decays of these vector excitations are sensitive to this polarization, allowing for the study of these correlations.
  This letter will compare classical and quantum calculations of the correlations between these azimuthal directions. The two approaches predict vert different angular correlations. The differences are akin to those seen with polarized photons in tests of Bells inequality. Uniquely, UPC photoproduction can produce final states containing three or more particles, all entangled with the same polarization. These more complex states exhibit additional unique phenomenology, allowing new tests of multi-particle entanglement.</description>

      <title>Excited-state uncertainties in lattice-QCD calculations of multi-hadron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excited-state effects lead to hard-to-quantify systematic uncertainties in lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) spectroscopy calculations when computationally accessible imaginary times are smaller than inverse excitation gaps, as often arises for multi-hadron systems with signal-to-noise problems. Lanczos residual bounds address this by providing two-sided constraints on energies that do not require assumptions beyond Hermiticity, but often give very conservative systematic uncertainty estimates. Here, a more-constraining set of gap bounds is introduced for hadron spectroscopy. These bounds provide tighter constraints whose validity requires an explicit assumption about an energy gap. Exactly solvable lattice field theory correlators are used to test the utility of residual and gap bounds at finite and infinite statistics. Two-sided bounds and other analysis methods are then applied to a high-statistics LQCD calculation of nucleon-nucleon scattering at $m_\pi \sim 800$ MeV. Generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) and Lanczos energy estimators are compatible when applied to the same correlator data, but analyses including different interpolating operators show statistically significant inconsistencies. However, two-sided bounds from all operators are consistent. Under the assumption that the number of energy levels below $N\Delta$ and $\Delta\Delta$ thresholds is the same as for non-interacting nucleons, gap bounds are sufficient to constrain nucleon-nucleon scattering amplitudes at phenomenologically relevant precision. Lanczos methods further reveal that energy-eigenstate estimates from previously studied asymmetric correlators have not converged over accessible imaginary times. Nevertheless, data-driven examples demonstrate why assumptions are required to draw conclusions about the natures of two-nucleon ground states at these masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice QCD has historically produced energy results interpretable as either estimates relying on implicit assumptions about asymptotic behavior or one-sided upper bounds. New Lanczos methods providing two-sided bounds with less-restrictive assumptions are introduced and quantified in a high-statistics calculation with unphysical quark masses. Two-sided bounds without spectral assumptions provide sub-percent constraints on the nucleon mass. Other bounds, which assume all states in a given energy window are resolved, provide meaningful two-sided constraints on nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Elastic and Inelastic Two-particle Scatterings at High Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement produced in transverse momentum by two-particle scattering at high energy. Employing the S-matrix framework for the derivation of reduced density matrices, we formulate the entanglement entropy for an inelastic scattering as well as an elastic one. We display the formulas of the entanglement entropy in terms of two-body cross sections. We also derive the entanglement density as a function of the transverse momentum. As an application, we then focus on both forward elastic ($pn \to pn$) and inelastic ($pn \to np$) channels scattering allowing for a fruitful comparison of the two reactions with the same proton-neutron content. We evaluate the elastic and inelastic entanglement entropy by using known parameterizations of experimental data for neutron-proton reactions. Comparing those entanglement entropies, we observe that the inelastic scattering produces more overall entanglement than the elastic one in the $pn$ sector.</description>

      <title>Heavy quark polarization anisotropy as a novel probe of fireball geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to probe the initial fireball geometry in relativistic heavy-ion collisions using spin polarization. Specifically, we introduce polarization harmonics of open heavy hadrons as a novel observable sensitive to geometric anisotropies. Heavy quarks are produced in early hard scatterings and can acquire spin polarization from the strong, transient electromagnetic fields present at early times. As they propagate through the anisotropic quark-gluon plasma, medium-induced interactions lead to path-length dependent depolarization, imprinting an azimuthally anisotropic polarization pattern. Within the framework of rotational Brownian motion, we show that the resulting polarization harmonics are directly related to the initial spatial eccentricities, thereby establishing heavy-flavor polarization anisotropies as a sensitive and complementary probe of the early-time collision geometry. We present quantitative estimates of the second polarization harmonic associated with the recently observed $D^{*+}$ spin alignment reported by the ALICE Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Analysis of regulator and cutoff artifacts in the phase diagram of the quark-meson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study regulator and cutoff artifacts in the quark-meson model at finite temperature and quark chemical potential within the functional renormalization-group approach using the local potential approximation. To this end, we discuss the concept of renormalization-group consistency in effective models, which necessitates a nontrivial parameter-fixing procedure to enable a meaningful comparison of results obtained with different regulators and cutoffs. We employ a standard range of cutoff values used in phenomenological studies and regulators that differ significantly in their analytic properties as well as in their classification according to the principle of strongest singularity. We find that regulator and cutoff dependences are small at low temperatures and quark chemical potentials. At high temperatures and low quark chemical potentials, significant cutoff artifacts arise, whereas the properties of the regulator affect the dynamics in the regime governed by a chiral phase transition of first order at low temperatures and high quark chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>A Method to Constrain Preferential Emission and Spectator Dynamics in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06977v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Longitudinal particle production in heavy-ion collisions is influenced both by preferential emission from participating nucleons and by the breakup of spectator matter, yet quantifying these effects experimentally remains challenging. We introduce a Pearson correlation between spectator and charged-particle forward-backward asymmetries as an experimental probe of these phenomena. Using Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV simulated with A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model, we validate that this correlator provides a robust, pseudorapidity-differential measure of the influence of preferential emission on the longitudinal structure of particle production. We further demonstrate that the correlation strength is sensitive to fluctuations in spectator number, which in experiments arise from evaporation and fragmentation of the spectator remnants. The proposed observable therefore offers a data-driven handle for constraining models of preferential emission and spectator breakup, thereby improving our understanding of the mechanisms that shape the final-state longitudinal distributions in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a distribution-free and model-agnostic uncertainty-quantification method that provides finite-sample prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage. In this work, for the first time, we apply conformal-prediction to generate uncertainty bands for physical observables in nuclear physics, such as the total cross section and nucleon-nucleon phase shifts. We demonstrate the method's flexibility by considering three scenarios: (i) a pointwise model, where expansion coefficients in chiral effective field theory are treated as random variables; (ii) a Gaussian-process model for the coefficients; and (iii) phase shifts at various energies and partial waves calculated using local interactions from chiral effective field theory. In each case, conformal-prediction intervals are constructed and validated empirically. Our results show that conformal prediction provides reliable and adaptive uncertainty bands even in the presence of non-Gaussian behavior, such as skewness and heavy tails. These findings highlight conformal prediction as a robust and practical framework for quantifying theoretical uncertainties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sign problem in numerical calculations of the QCD Euclidean space path integral of QCD with a chemical potential vanishes if the chemical potential is imaginary. Moreover, calculations of the partition function with imaginary chemical potentials are equivalent to calculations with Lagrange multipliers enforcing the current density. At zero temperature, Lorentz boosts allow one to deduce properties of systems with both number density and current density from properties of systems with a current density alone; this allows both upper and lower bounds to be determined for the equation of state (EOS) in the form of energy density as a function of number density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a global Bayesian analysis of diffractive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production in $\gamma+p$ and $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions using a color glass condensate (CGC) based calculation framework. As past calculations have shown that CGC-based models typically overpredict the $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production in $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions at high center of mass energy, we address the question of whether it is possible to describe coherent and incoherent diffractive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ data from $\gamma+p$ collisions at HERA and the LHC, and from $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions at the LHC simultaneously. Our results indicate that a simultaneous description of $\gamma+p$ and $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ data is challenging, with results improving when an overall $K$-factor -- scaling $\gamma+p$ and $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ cross sections to absorb model uncertainties -- is introduced.</description>

      <title>Impact of new results from the ultraperipheral collision on modeling the proton and neutron emission in photon-induced nuclear processes</title>

Abstract: The ultrarelativistic collisions of heavy ions provide rich spectrum of possibilities to discuss the response of the nucleus to photons. Newly published neutron and proton multiplicities measured in the ALICE experiment in ultraperipheral collisions allow investigating the influence of the electromagnetic fields on colliding nuclei for the $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=5.02~TeV. The theoretical predictions are done within hybrid model including equivalent photon approximations (EPA), GiBUU modeling of pre-equilibrium processes and generation of the exited nuclear remnants, which decay is modeled by statistical approach: GEM2 or GEMINI++. The cross-sections of the mass-charge distributions of nuclear remnants as well as the neutron, proton and other charged particle multiplicities are estimated. We concentrate on production of protons and isotopes coming from the electromagnetic dissociation. Special attention is devoted to emission of a single proton. The cross section for $1p$ emission is very close to maximal available one based on reactions of photon with individual nucleons. Our pre-equilibrium processes explain simultaneously the tail of neutron energy distributions in the nuclear rest frame observed in $\gamma + A$ collisions.</description>

      <title>The Three-Body Limit Cycle: Universal Form for General Regulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Efimov effect, a remarkable realization of discrete scale invariance, emerges in the three-body problem with short-range interactions and is understood as a renormalization group (RG) limit cycle within Short-Range Effective Field Theory (SREFT). While the analytic form of the three-body renormalization relation has been established for a sharp cutoff regulator, its universality for other regulators remains underexplored. In this work, we derive the universal functional form of the three-body renormalization relation for general separable regulators through a detailed analysis of the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian and Faddeev equations. We find that the relation follows from a real M\"{o}bius transformation characterized by three parameters. This universality is verified numerically for various regulators. Although the functional form remains the same, the parameters characterizing the limit cycle exhibit regulator dependence. These findings broaden the class of RG limit cycles in SREFT and offer a more complete understanding of three-body renormalization.</description>

      <title>On pseudo-gauge ambiguity in the distributions of energy density, pressure, and shear force inside the nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10223v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spatial distributions of pressure, energy density, and shear forces inside the nucleon within the two-flavor Skyrme model including vector mesons. This framework has the advantage that nucleon configurations can be stabilized without the Skyrme term. In contrast to the model without vector mesons, however, we realize that the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) becomes pseudo-gauge dependent. We explicitly demonstrate that all these distributions differ between the canonical and Belinfante forms of the EMTs. We identify the pseudo-gauge ambiguity as originating from nonvanishing surface terms associated with spin currents generated by the vector-meson field strength tensors. Furthermore, we show that the pressure and shear-force distributions in the canonical EMT develop singularities at the nucleon center, whereas the corresponding Belinfante distributions remain finite. Finally, we discuss the implications of pseudo-gauge dependence for extracting the confining force and for constructing the equation of state inside the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra and Mott transitions of neutral mesons at finite temperature and magnetic field in frame of three-flavor Polyakov-extended Nambu-Jona-Lasino model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14150</link>

Abstract: Mass spectra and Mott transitions of neutral mesons $K_0,{\bar K}_0,\pi_0,\eta,\eta'$ at finite temperature and magnetic field are investigated in a three-flavor PNJL model. We focus on the effect of gluons, which is simulated by the Polyakov potential, and the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) effect, which is mimicked by using a magnetic field dependent parameter. Mass spectra show similar structure when introducing the gluon and IMC effect. The mass of $K_0\ ({\bar K}_0)$ meson $m_{K_0}=m_{{\bar K}_0}$ is controlled by chiral symmetry breaking and restoration. It increases with temperature in the low temperature region, and shows a mass jump at the Mott transition. Further increasing temperature, $m_{K_0}$ firstly decreases and then increases with temperature. $\pi_0$ meson is not only the pseudo-Goldstone boson of chiral symmetry breaking, but also influenced by the flavor mixing of $\pi_0-\eta-\eta'$. The behavior of $m_{\pi_0}$ is different from $m_{K_0}$ only at high temperature region, which decreases with temperature. $\eta,\eta'$ mesons are affected by both the $U_A(1)$ anomaly and the flavor mixing of $\pi_0-\eta-\eta'$. The mass of $\eta$ meson $m_{\eta}$ decreases with temperature in low temperature region and then shows a jump at its Mott transition. After that $m_{\eta}$ firstly decreases and later increases with temperature. $\eta'$ meson is a resonant state, and its mass $m_{\eta'}$ continuously decreases and then increases with temperature. The mass jumps of $K_0,{\bar K}_0,\pi_0,\eta$ mesons are caused by the dimension reduction of the constituent quarks under external magnetic field. In PNJL model, the Mott transition temperature of $K_0,{\bar K}_0,\pi_0$ mesons ($\eta$ meson) decreases (increases) with magnetic field. The IMC effect leads to no qualitative change to the meson Mott transition temperature but shifts them to the lower values.</description>

      <title>Towards First Detection of the Solar MSW Transition With JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matter-induced neutrino flavor mixing (the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein, or MSW, effect) is a central prediction of the neutrino mixing framework, but it has not been conclusively observed. Direct observation of the energy-dependent MSW transition in the solar electron-neutrino survival probability would solve this, but backgrounds have been prohibitive. We show that our new technique for suppressing muon-induced spallation backgrounds will allow JUNO to measure the MSW transition at $&gt;$4$\sigma$ significance in 10 years. This would strongly support upcoming multi-\$1B next-generation long-baseline experiments and their goals in cementing the neutrino mixing framework.</description>
