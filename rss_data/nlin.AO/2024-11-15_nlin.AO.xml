      <title>The geometry of the deep linear network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article provides an expository account of training dynamics in the Deep Linear Network (DLN) from the perspective of the geometric theory of dynamical systems. Rigorous results by several authors are unified into a thermodynamic framework for deep learning.
  The analysis begins with a characterization of the invariant manifolds and Riemannian geometry in the DLN. This is followed by exact formulas for a Boltzmann entropy, as well as stochastic gradient descent of free energy using a Riemannian Langevin Equation. Several links between the DLN and other areas of mathematics are discussed, along with some open questions.</description>

      <title>Interdependent scaling exponents in the human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the phenomenological renormalization group to resting-state fMRI time series of brain activity in a large population. By recursively coarse-graining the data, we compute scaling exponents for the series variance, log probability of silence, and largest covariance eigenvalue. The exponents clearly exhibit linear interdependencies, which we derive analytically in a mean-field approach. We find a significant correlation of exponent values with the gray matter volume and cognitive performance. Akin to scaling relations near critical points in thermodynamics, our findings suggest scaling interdependencies are intrinsic to brain organization and may also exist in other complex systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of Mind Enhances Collective Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective Intelligence plays a central role in a large variety of fields, from economics and evolutionary theory to neural networks and eusocial insects, and it is also core to much of the work on emergence and self-organisation in complex systems theory. However, in human collective intelligence there is still much more to be understood in the relationship between specific psychological processes at the individual level and the emergence of self-organised structures at the social level. Previously psychological factors have played a relatively minor role in the study of collective intelligence as the principles are often quite general and applicable to humans just as readily as insects or other agents without sophisticated psychologies. In this article we emphasise, with examples from other complex adaptive systems, the broad applicability of collective intelligence principles while the mechanisms and time-scales differ significantly between examples. We contend that flexible collective intelligence in human social settings is improved by our use of a specific cognitive tool: our Theory of Mind. We identify several key characteristics of psychologically mediated collective intelligence and show that the development of a Theory of Mind is a crucial factor distinguishing social collective intelligence from general collective intelligence. We then place these capabilities in the context of the next steps in artificial intelligence embedded in a future that includes an effective human-AI hybrid social ecology.</description>

      <title>Artificial Theory of Mind and Self-Guided Social Organisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the challenges artificial intelligence (AI) faces is how a collection of agents coordinate their behaviour to achieve goals that are not reachable by any single agent. In a recent article by Ozmen et al this was framed as one of six grand challenges: That AI needs to respect human cognitive processes at the human-AI interaction frontier. We suggest that this extends to the AI-AI frontier and that it should also reflect human psychology, as it is the only successful framework we have from which to build out. In this extended abstract we first make the case for collective intelligence in a general setting, drawing on recent work from single neuron complexity in neural networks and ant network adaptability in ant colonies. From there we introduce how species relate to one another in an ecological network via niche selection, niche choice, and niche conformity with the aim of forming an analogy with human social network development as new agents join together and coordinate. From there we show how our social structures are influenced by our neuro-physiology, our psychology, and our language. This emphasises how individual people within a social network influence the structure and performance of that network in complex tasks, and that cognitive faculties such as Theory of Mind play a central role. We finish by discussing the current state of the art in AI and where there is potential for further development of a socially embodied collective artificial intelligence that is capable of guiding its own social structures.</description>
