      <title>Relative cell complexes in closure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13227v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give necessary and sufficient conditions for certain pushouts of topological spaces in the category of Cech's closure spaces to agree with their pushout in the category of topological spaces. We prove that in these two categories, the constructions of cell complexes by a finite sequence of closed cell attachments, which attach arbitrarily many cells at a time, agree. Likewise, the constructions of CW complexes relative to a compactly generated weak Hausdorff space that attach only finitely many cells, also agree. On the other hand, we give examples showing that the constructions of finite-dimensional CW complexes, CW complexes of finite type, and relative CW complexes that attach only finitely many cells, need not agree.</description>

      <title>On Boundaries of $\varepsilon$-neighbourhoods of Planar Sets: Singularities, Global Structure, and Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.13515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry, topological properties and smoothness of the boundaries of closed $\varepsilon$-neighbourhoods $E_\varepsilon = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \, : \, \textrm{dist}(x, E) \leq \varepsilon \}$ of compact planar sets $E \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. We develop a novel technique for analysing the boundary, and use this to obtain a classification of singularities (i.e.~non-smooth points) on $\partial E_\varepsilon$ into eight categories. We show that the set of singularities is either countable or the disjoint union of a countable set and a closed, totally disconnected, nowhere dense set. Furthermore, we characterise, in terms of local geometry, those $\varepsilon$-neighbourhoods whose complement $\overline{\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus E_\varepsilon}$ is a set with positive reach. It is known that for all bounded $E \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the boundary $\partial E_\varepsilon$ is $(d-1)$-rectifiable. Improving on this, we identify a sufficient condition for the boundary to be uniformly rectifiable, and provide an example of a planar $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood that is not Ahlfors regular. In terms of the topological structure, we show that for a compact set $E$ and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ the boundary $\partial E_\varepsilon$ can be expressed as a disjoint union of an at most countably infinite union of Jordan curves and a possibly uncountable, totally disconnected set of singularities. Finally, we show that curvature is defined almost everywhere on the Jordan curve subsets of the boundary.</description>
