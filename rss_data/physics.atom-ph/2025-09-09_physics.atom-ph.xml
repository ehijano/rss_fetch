      <title>Ionization potential and electron affinity of superheavy element 119: relativistic high-order coupled cluster study with QED corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a highly accurate \textit{ab initio} study of the ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) of element 119. Electronic correlation are treated within the relativistic coupled cluster theory including excitations up to quadruples. The Gaunt electron--electron interaction and quantum electrodynamic (QED) corrections are taken into account. The role of high-order correlation effects is analyzed in detail. Our recommended values for the IP and EA are 4.7839(56) eV and 0.6750(71) eV, respectively. These results tighten previous estimates and provide a reference point for future experiments probing periodic-law trends beyond oganesson.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Proposal of a Digital Closed-Loop Thermal Atomic-Beam Interferometer for High-Bandwidth, Wide-Dynamic-Range, and Simultaneous Absolute Acceleration-Rotation Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical proposal and simulation study of a digital closed-loop thermal atomic-beam interferometer offering high bandwidth, wide dynamic range, and simultaneous absolute acceleration and rotation sensing, suitable for inertial navigation applications. The scheme synchronizes phase biasing with momentum-kick reversal through the atomic transit time of the interferometer, extracting four interferometric phases to suppress Raman beam path-length errors, while two-photon detuning feedback maintains a pseudo-inertial frame and eliminates cross-coupling. In simulations with a $170^{\circ} {\rm C}$ $^{85}$Rb beam and an interferometer arm length of 100~mm, the approach achieves sensitivities of $3{\rm \mu m / s^2 / \sqrt{Hz}}$ (velocity random walk) and $15{\rm \mu deg / \sqrt{h}}$ (angular random walk), surpassing state-of-the-art inertial sensors.</description>

      <title>$^{88}$Sr$^{+}$ optical clock with $7.9\times 10^{-19}$ systematic uncertainty and measurement of its absolute frequency with $9.8\times 10^{-17}$ uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a $^{88}$Sr$^{+}$ single-ion optical clock with an estimated fractional systematic uncertainty of $7.9\times 10^{-19}$. The low uncertainty is enabled by small rf losses, a thorough evaluation of the blackbody-radiation temperature, and our recent measurement of the differential polarizability. A detailed uncertainty evaluation is presented. We also report on two absolute frequency measurements: one against a remote cesium fountain clock and one against International Atomic Time (TAI). The former lasted 12 days and resulted in a frequency value of 444779044095485.49(15) Hz. The latter spanned ten months with monthly optical-clock uptimes between 68% and 99% and yielded a frequency value of 444779044095485.373(44) Hz. With a fractional uncertainty of $9.8\times 10^{-17}$, it is, to our knowledge, the most accurate optical frequency measurement reported to date. Both frequency values are in agreement with other recent measurements, providing further evidence that the 2021 CIPM recommended frequency value is too high by 1.6 times its uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced Coulomb explosion of the LiI molecule and of its dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gas-phase sample consisting of lithium iodide, $\mathrm{LiI}$, molecules and their dimer $\mathrm{(LiI)}_2$, are Coulomb exploded by an intense 25 femtosecond laser pulse. In the case of $\mathrm{LiI}$, we focus on the double ionization that creates a pair of $\mathrm{Li}^+$ and $\mathrm{I}^+$ recoil ions. From the kinetic energy distribution of the $\mathrm{Li}^+$ ions, extracted using coincidence filtering, we determine the distribution of internuclear distances $P(R)$ via an ab initio calculated potential energy curve for $\mathrm{LiI}^{2+}$, which accounts for non-Coulombic effects. We find that the center of $P(R)$ is close to the expected internuclear separation based on the three vibrational states of $\mathrm{LiI}$ populated, whereas the width of $P(R)$ exceeds the theoretical value by $\sim$ 55 %. We discuss why Coulomb explosion imaging of this system works well despite $\mathrm{LiI}^{2+}$ possibly fragmenting via multiple potential energy curves. In the case of the dimer, $\mathrm{(LiI)}_2$, we observe kinetic energies and relative emission directions of $\mathrm{Li}^+$, $\mathrm{I}^+$, and $\mathrm{I}^{2+}$ recoil ions consistent with Coulomb explosion of the parallelogram-shaped dimer after removing up to six electrons by the laser pulse.</description>

      <title>3D-printed components for electron-ion trapping: Tests of functionality and ultra-high vacuum compatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the ultra-high vacuum compatibility of a microwave-driven electron trap and an atomic oven (for atomic beam generation) fabricated through 3D printing via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). The trap integrates into a coaxial microwave cavity, enabling stable, narrow-band, high-amplitude oscillations of the electric field at the electrodes. The design also supports simultaneous trapping of ions. The oven performs well in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environments without significant outgassing. In addition to achieving the UHV regime for 3D-printed components, pressure variations and their potential impact on electron-ion trapping experiments were investigated over a month. Our results show that experiments with electrons photodetached from trapped and laser-cooled ions are feasible with the trap and oven manufactured by the L-PBF method. These findings establish a foundation for future experiments in microwave detection and the study of low-energy ion-electron interactions at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Studying magnetic circular vortex dichroism effect for photoionization of Rydberg atoms with vortex photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms, renowned for their exceptional quantum properties, hold significant importance in quantum physics. The photoionization of Rydberg atoms serves as a critical tool for probing their unique characteristics. In this work, we investigate the photoionization dynamics of Rydberg atoms interacting with vortex photons: a class of structured light carrying intrinsic orbital angular momentum. This interaction gives rise to novel quantum phenomena distinct from conventional photoionization processes. Our results reveal that vortex photons exhibit exceptional sensitivity to the magnetic moments of Rydberg atoms, positioning them as a powerful spectroscopic tool for investigating Rydberg magnetism. It is also demonstrated that the initial photon energy must be carefully selected to observe significant experimental results. Furthermore, the photoionization process displays strong angular momentum selectivity, preferentially favoring configurations where the photon total angular momentum and atomic magnetic moment are aligned. This pronounced asymmetry directly manifests the chiral nature of the vortex photon-Rydberg atom interaction.</description>

      <title>Study of the elusive $5s-4f$ level crossing in highly charged osmium with optical transitions suitable for physics beyond the Standard Model searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical transitions of highly charged ions can be very sensitive to hypothetical beyond-the-Standard-Model phenomena. Those near the $5s-4f$ level crossing, where the $5s$ and $4f$ are degenerate are especially promising. We present predictions from atomic theory and measurements of Os$^{15,16,17+}$ at an electron beam ion trap for identification of several transitions suitable for searches for a hypothetical fifth force and possible violations of local Lorentz invariance. The electric quadrupole (E2) transitions of Os$^{16+}$ that were found are especially suitable for frequency metrology due to their small linewidth of 44 ${\mu}$Hz. Our calculations show the need for including enough inner-shell excitations to predict transition rates between configurations, which can otherwise be overestimated. Ultimately, the predicted interconfiguration transitions were too weak to be detected.</description>

      <title>Non-linear cooling and control of a mechanical quantum harmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-linearities are a key feature allowing non-classical control of quantum harmonic oscillators. However, when non-linearities are strong, designing protocols for control is often difficult, placing a barrier to exploiting these properties fully. Here, using a single trapped-ion oscillator operated in the strongly non-linear regime of the atom-light interaction, we show how to generate localized multi (2, 3, 4, and 5)-component Schr\"odinger's cat manifolds using a novel form of non-linear reservoir engineering. We then specifically select Hamiltonians which allow us to perform measurements on these state manifolds. To our knowledge, our work is the first experimental use of such high order non-linear processes for control of non-classical states of a quantum harmonic oscillator, opening up a new toolbox which can be applied to bosonic quantum error correction, computation, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Chern-Simons invariant in quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chern-Simons (CS) invariant is a fundamental topological invariant describing the topological invariance of 3D space based on the Chern-Simons field theory. To date, direct measurement of the CS invariant in a physical system remains elusive. %to be elusive. Here, the CS invariant is experimentally measured by quenching a 2D optical Raman lattice with 1/2 spin in ultracold atoms. With a recently developed Bloch state tomography, we measure the expectation values of three Pauli matrices in 2D quasi-momentum space plus 1D time [(2+1)D], and then respectively extract the Berry curvature and the corresponding Berry connection. By integrating the product of these two quantities, we obtain the CS invariants near $\pm 1$ and 0, which are consistent with theoretical predictions. We also observe transitions among these values, which indicates the change of the topology of the quantum state in (2+1)D quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Collective dissipation engineering of interacting Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineered dissipation is emerging as an alternative tool for quantum state control, enabling high-fidelity preparation, transfer and stabilization, and access to novel phase transitions. We realize a tunable, state-resolved laser-induced loss channel for individual Rydberg atoms, in both non-interacting and strongly correlated settings. This capability allows us to reveal interaction-driven shifts of the exceptional point separating quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno regimes, and to demonstrate interaction-enhanced decay. By exploiting interaction-dependent energy level shifts, we observe a configuration-selective two-body Zeno effect that freezes target spin states. We theoretically show that when this mechanism is extended to many-body chains it allows for the dissipative distillation of unwanted spin configurations. These experimental studies establish a versatile approach for exploring strongly interacting, open quantum spin systems, and opens possible new routines for dissipative preparation of correlated quantum states in Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Learning spatially structured open quantum dynamics with regional-attention transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems with spatial structure and external control is an important challenge in quantum information science. Classical numerical solvers for such systems require integrating coupled master and field equations, which is computationally demanding for simulation and optimization tasks and often precluding real-time use in network-scale simulations or feedback control. We introduce a regional attention-based neural architecture that learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of structured open quantum systems. The model incorporates translational invariance of physical laws as an inductive bias to achieve scalable complexity, and supports conditioning on time-dependent global control parameters. We demonstrate learning on two representative systems: a driven dissipative single qubit and an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memory. The model achieves high predictive fidelity under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution control protocols, and provides substantial acceleration up to three orders of magnitude over numerical solvers. These results demonstrate that the architecture establishes a general surrogate modeling framework for spatially structured open quantum dynamics, with immediate relevance to large-scale quantum network simulation, quantum repeater and protocol design, real-time experimental optimization, and scalable device modeling across diverse light-matter platforms.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Single-Qubit Gates on a Neutral Atom Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present benchmarking results for single-qubit gates implemented on a neutral atom quantum processor using Direct Randomized Benchmarking (DRB) and Gate Set Tomography (GST). The DRB protocol involves preparing stabilizer states, applying $m$ layers of native single-qubit gates, and measuring in the computational basis, providing an efficient error characterization under a stochastic Pauli noise model. GST enables the full, self-consistent reconstruction of quantum processes, including gates, input states, and measurements. Both protocols provide robust to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors estimations of gate performance, offering complementary perspectives on quantum gate fidelity. For single-qubit gates, DRB yields an average fidelity of $99.963 \pm 0.016\%$. The protocol was further applied to a 25-qubit array under global single-qubit control. GST results are consistent with those obtained via DRB. We also introduce a gauge optimization procedure for GST that brings the reconstructed gates, input states, and measurements into a canonical frame, enabling meaningful fidelity comparisons while preserving physical constraints. These constraints of the operators -- such as complete positivity and trace preservation -- are enforced by performing the optimization over the Stiefel manifold. The combined analysis supports the use of complementary benchmarking techniques for characterizing scalable quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of Anomalous Three-Body Loss in a Population Imbalanced Three-Component Fermi Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving precise control of ultracold atomic gases requires a detailed understanding of atom loss mechanisms. Motivated by the anomalous three-body decay in a three-component Fermi gas reported in Ref. [1], this work investigates mechanisms that possibly contribute to the observed loss. The three-body Schr\"odinger equation is solved in the hyperspherical adiabatic representation with pairwise van der Waals interactions, and the $S$-matrix is obtained via the eigenchannel $R$-matrix method to compute recombination rate coefficients $K_3$ and two-body cross sections. At the magnetic field strength where the anomalous decay occurs, $K_3$ is unitary limited, exhibiting the threshold energy scaling $K_3(E)\propto E^{-1}$. Consequently, the thermally averaged $\langle K_3 \rangle$ acquires a temperature dependence. Because the experiment is performed in the degenerate regime, $\langle K_3 \rangle$ also explicitly depends on the per-spin densities through the per-spin Fermi energies $E_{F}^{(i)}\propto n_i^{2/3}$. As the gas is diluted and degeneracy is reduced, $\langle K_3 \rangle$ approaches the non-degenerate value and becomes a function of temperature only. Channel-resolved branching ratios and cross sections are folded into a Monte Carlo cascade simulation of secondary collisions and trap escape. The analysis indicates that typical three-body recombination events remove fewer than three atoms on average, and that the atom losses are primarily due to the ejection of secondary collision products, rather than the initial three-body recombination products. Therefore, a significant fraction of the released binding energy remains in the trapped ensemble as kinetic energy. Retained energy drives evaporative loss, offering a plausible, partial explanation for the anomalous decay.</description>

      <title>Spin hierarchy in van der Waals molecule formation via ultracold three-body recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the product-state distribution of weakly bound diatomic van der Waals molecules via ultracold three-body recombination of bosonic alkali atoms. We find a two-level hierarchy of spin propensity rules at zero magnetic field. The primary propensity rule states that nearly all molecular products conserve the total hyperfine spin of reactant atomic pairs, while molecular products not conserving the total spin are highly suppressed. For the dominant molecular products, there is a secondary propensity to conserve certain spin components of the reactant pair such as the atomic hyperfine spins, or the total electronic or nuclear spins. The second propensity varies across species and depends fundamentally on the interplay between effective electronic exchange and hyperfine interactions. The spin sensitivity of product-state distribution can potentially open up new avenues for controlling state-to-state reaction rates in ultracold three-body recombination.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the effect of pulse shaping in momentum selective atomic Bragg diffraction. We compare temporal square pulses, which produce sidelobes in momentum space, with other shapes which can produce more nearly square momentum distributions. We produce pulses that simultaneously address two sets of velocity classes and demonstrate that we can control the differential phase imprinted on them in a way that is insensitive to laser phase fluctuations. Our work marks a significant step forward in testing Bell inequalities using massive particles entangled in momentum.</description>

      <title>Spin structure of diatomic van der Waals molecules of alkali atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14787v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the spin structure of weakly bound diatomic van der Waals molecules formed by two identical bosonic alkali atoms. Our studies were performed using known Born-Oppenheimer potentials while developing a reduced interaction potential model. Such reduced potential models are currently a key for solving certain classes of few-body problems of atoms as they decrease the numerical burden on the computation. Although the reduced potentials are significantly shallower than actual Born-Oppenheimer potentials, they still capture the main properties of the near-threshold bound states, including their spin structure, and the scattering states over a broad range of magnetic fields. At zero magnetic field, we find that the variation in spin structure across different alkali species originates from the interplay between electronic spin exchange and hyperfine interactions. To characterize this competition we introduce a single parameter, which is a function of the singlet and triplet scattering lengths, the atomic hyperfine splitting constant, and the molecular binding energy. We show that this parameter can be used to classify the spin structure of vdW molecules for each atomic species.</description>

      <title>Ion counting and temperature determination of Coulomb-crystallized laser-cooled ions in traps using convolutional neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coulomb crystals -- ordered structures of cold ions confined in ion traps -- find applications in a variety of research fields. The number and temperature of the ions forming the Coulomb crystals are two key attributes of interest in many trapped-ion experiments. Here, we present a fast and accurate approach to determining these attributes from fluorescence images of the ions based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this approach, we first generate a large number of images of Coulomb crystals with different ion numbers and temperatures using molecular-dynamics simulations and then train CNN models on these images to classify the desired attributes. The classification performance of several common pretrained CNN models was compared in example tasks. We find that for crystals with ion numbers in the range 100--299 and secular temperatures of 5--15 mK, the best-performing model can discern number variations on the level of one ion with an accuracy of 93% and temperature variations by 1 mK with an accuracy of 92%. Since the trained model can be directly integrated into experiments, in-situ determination of these attributes can be realized in a non-invasive fashion, which has the potential to greatly facilitate the analysis and control of trapped ions in real time.</description>

      <title>Robust Atom Interferometry with Super-Gaussian Pulses against Thermal Velocity Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15552v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser frequency fluctuation and atomic thermal motion can lead to errors in pulse duration and detuning in cold atom interferometry, thereby reducing measurement stability and fringe contrast. To address this issue, we investigate the use of super-Gaussian pulses, which are characterized by smooth temporal profiles and centralized energy distribution, in the beam-splitting and reflection stages of an atom interferometer. Through numerical simulations, we compare the performance of rectangular, Gaussian, and 2nd- to 10th-order super-Gaussian pulses subject to deviations in pulse duration and detuning. Our results show that both Gaussian and super-Gaussian pulses offer a significant advantage over traditional rectangular pulses, particularly under thermal conditions where velocity spread is prominent. We find that 4th-order pulses achieving up to a 90\% improvement in contrast over rectangular pulses under realistic conditions, and while their peak performance at very low temperatures is comparable to that of Gaussian pulses, they demonstrate enhanced robustness against combined detuning and pulse-length errors. These findings demonstrate that super-Gaussian pulse shaping is an effective method for enhancing the robustness of atom interferometers against errors induced by thermal motion.</description>

      <title>Accelerating point defect photo-emission calculations with machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework leveraging universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to dramatically accelerate the calculation of photoluminescence (PL) spectra of atomic or molecular emitters with ab initio accuracy. By replacing the costly density functional theory (DFT) computation of phonon modes with much faster MLIP phonon mode calculations, our approach achieves speed improvements exceeding an order of magnitude with minimal precision loss. We benchmark the approach using a dataset comprising ab initio emission spectra of 791 color centers spanning various types of crystal point defects in different charge and magnetic states. The method is also applied to a molecular emitter adsorbed on a hexagonal boron nitride surface. Across all the systems, we find excellent agreement for both the Huang-Rhys factor and the PL lineshapes. This application of universal MLIPs bridges the gap between computational efficiency and spectroscopic fidelity, opening pathways to high-throughput screening of defect-engineered materials. Our work not only demonstrates accelerated calculation of PL spectra with DFT accuracy, but also makes such calculations tractable for more complex materials.</description>
