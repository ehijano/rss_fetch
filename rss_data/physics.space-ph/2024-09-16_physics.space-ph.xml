      <title>The Impact of Solar Radiation on the Martian Upper Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first in-situ measurements of the altitude profile of Martian upper atmospheric density and composition were carried out by the Viking lander missions in 1976. The MAVEN and MOM spacecraft launched in September 2014 with mass spectrometers and solar radiation measuring payloads have vastly expanded this initial database. Using a rare set of near-simultaneous data from these two orbiters, we find that there is either an increasing (e.g., for $CO_2$ and $Ar$) or a decreasing (e.g., for $O$) trend of the density profiles by a factor of 2 between June 1 to June 15, 2018, in the height region of $\sim$150-300 km. A time series analysis of the concurrent in-situ solar EUV spectral flux and the $H^+$ ion velocities of the incident solar wind measured near MAVEN periapsis showed the former going through a decrease of only $\sim$10\% compared to the latter's decrease by a factor of 4 within the same non-solar-flare period of observation. The estimates of standard errors and the use of linear regression analysis for the correlation coefficients between densities and solar radiation components have been carried out. Invoking simple photochemical equilibrium conditions with the dissociation of $CO_2$ (producing $CO$ and $O$) through solar EUV radiation and the solar wind $H^+$ ion impact process, the day-to-day variations of these constituents are estimated. The high and significant anti-correlation between the density variations of $CO_2$ and $O$ due to the dissociation of $CO_2$ by the solar wind particle radiation is clearly demonstrated. The cause for the increasing densities of $Ar$ like that of $CO_2$ during this period is more complex and would likely be governed by the temperature variations due to absorption of solar EUV/charged particle radiation and other interacting dynamical effects.</description>

      <title>GRAPH -- An readout ASIC for large MCP based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a programmable 16 channel, mixed signal, low power readout ASIC, having the project historically named Gigasample Recorder of Analog waveforms from a PHotodetector (GRAPH). It is designed to read large aperture single photon imaging detectors using micro channel plates for charge multiplication, and measuring the detector's response on crossed strips anodes to extrapolate the incoming photon position. Each channel consists of a fast, low power and low noise charge sensitive amplifier, which provides a myriad of coarse and fine programmable options for gain and shaping settings. Further, the amplified signal is recorded using, to our knowledge novel, the Hybrid Universal sampLing Architecture (HULA), a mixed signal double buffer memory, that enables concurrent waveform recording, and selected event digitized data extraction. The sampling frequency is freely adjustable between few~kHz up to 125~MHz, while the chip's internal digital memory holds a history 2048 samples for each channel, with a digital headroom of 12 bits. An optimized region of interest sample-read algorithm allows to extract the information just around the event pulse peak, while selecting the next event, thus substantially reducing the operational dead time. The chip is designed in 130~$n$m TSMC CMOS technology, and its power consumption is around 47~$m$W per channel.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Sequence of Phases Leading to the Formation of the Active Region 13664, with Potential Carrington-like Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recurrent X-class flares from Active Region (AR) 13664 have triggered a severe G5-class geomagnetic storm between May 10 and 11, 2024. The morphology and compactness of this AR closely resemble the active region responsible for the famous Carrington Event of 1859. Although the induced geomagnetic currents produced a value of the Dst index, probably, an order of magnitude weaker than that of the Carrington Event, the characteristics of AR 13664 warrant special attention. Understanding the mechanisms of magnetic field emergence and transformation in the solar atmosphere that lead to the formation of such an extensive, compact and complex AR is crucial. Our analysis of the emerging flux and horizontal motions of the magnetic structures observed in the photosphere reveals the fundamental role of a sequence of emerging bipoles at the same latitude and longitude, followed by converging and shear motions. This temporal order of processes frequently invoked in magnetohydrodynamic models - emergence, converging motions, and shear motions - is critical for the storage of magnetic energy preceding strong solar eruptions that, under the right timing, location and direction conditions, can trigger severe space weather events at Earth.</description>
