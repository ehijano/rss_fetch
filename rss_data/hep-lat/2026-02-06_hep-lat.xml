      <title>Quantum Simulation of Bound and Resonant Doubly-Bottom Tetraquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first quantum-simulation study of bound and resonant doubly-bottom tetraquark states within a QCD-inspired chiral quark model. An effective four-quark Hamiltonian is mapped onto a 16-qubit register, encoding color, spin, and spatial degrees of freedom, and incorporating both meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark configurations with complete color bases. Using a variational quantum eigensolver, we identify bound and resonance states in the low-lying $S$-wave sector. Deeply bound states are found exclusively in the isoscalar $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ channel, dominated by color-singlet meson-meson components with non-negligible hidden-color contributions. The resulting masses and binding energies are consistent with classical chiral quark model predictions, establishing quantum simulation as a viable framework for studying exotic multiquark states beyond the reach of conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Towards $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics on a cold-atom quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold atoms have become a powerful platform for quantum-simulating lattice gauge theories in higher spatial dimensions. However, such realizations have been restricted to the lowest possible truncations of the gauge field, which limit the connections one can make to lattice quantum electrodynamics. Here, we propose a feasible cold-atom quantum simulator of a $(2+1)$-dimensional U$(1)$ lattice gauge theory in a spin $S=1$ truncation, featuring dynamical matter and gauge fields. We derive a mapping of this theory onto a bosonic computational basis, stabilized by an emergent gauge-protection mechanism through quantum Zeno dynamics. The implementation is based on a single-species Bose--Hubbard model realized in a tilted optical superlattice. This approach requires only moderate experimental resources already available in current ultracold-atom platforms. Using infinite matrix product state simulations, we benchmark real-time dynamics under global quenches. The results demonstrate faithful evolution of the target gauge theory and robust preservation of the gauge constraints. Our work significantly advances the experimental prospects for simulating higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories using larger gauge-field truncations.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic polarizabilities of the triplet hadrons in heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic polarizabilities of singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy baryons within the framework of heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory up to $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. We estimate the low-energy constants using the non-relativistic constituent quark model. A striking prediction of our study is the giant electric polarizabilities of the $D^*$ mesons: $\alpha_E(\bar{D}^{*0}) \approx 291.4 \times 10^{-4} \text{fm}^3$ and $\alpha_E(D^{*-}) \approx -0.4-64.4 i \times 10^{-4} \text{fm}^3$. These anomalously large values arise from the near-degenerate mass between $D^*$ and $D \pi$, which are orders of magnitude larger than those of their bottom counterparts. This kinematic coincidence induces a pronounced cusp structure in the chiral loops, reflecting the long-range dynamics of a pion cloud. For doubly heavy baryons, polarizabilities depend strongly on heavy-flavor composition: the $bcq$ system differs markedly from $ccq$ and $bbq$ due to mixing with scalar heavy-diquark states. Using heavy diquark-antiquark symmetry (HDAS), we unify the chiral dynamics of singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy baryons in the heavy-quark limit. The pion-loop contributions dominate the electromagnetic structure of heavy hadrons and provide essential benchmarks for future lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Conformal Limit at Finite Density: Insights from Effective Models and Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss recent results obtained with the application of the medium separation scheme (MSS) in different contexts where a clear violation of the conformal limit for the speed of sound at finite density has been observed in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We analyze several scenarios, including QCD at finite isospin density, two-color QCD, and two-flavor color superconductivity. Whenever possible, we compare our findings with lattice QCD (LQCD) results, showing that the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model combined with the MSS provides a consistent description across different regimes of the QCD phase diagram. Our analysis highlights how effective models, when properly regularized, can capture essential nonperturbative features of dense QCD matter, offering complementary insights to lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Giant bubbles of Fisher zeros in the quantum XY chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an alternative approach based on complex-valued inverse temperature and partition function to probe quantum phases of matter with nontrivial spectra and dynamics. It leverages thermofield dynamics (TFD) to quantitatively characterize quantum and thermal fluctuations, and exploit the correspondence between low-energy excitations and Fisher zeros. Using the quantum XY chain in an external field as a testbed, we show that the oscillatory gap behavior manifests as oscillations in the long-time dynamics of the TFD spectral form factor. We also identify giant bubbles, i.e. large-scale closed lines, of Fisher-zeros near the gapless XX limit. They provide a characteristic energy scale that seems to contradict the predictions of the low energy theory of a featureless Luttinger liquid. We identify this energy scale and relate the motion of these giant bubbles with varying external field to the transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies. The deep connection between Fisher zeros, dynamics, and excitations opens up promising avenues for understanding the unconventional gap behaviors in strongly correlated many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Computational Cost Scaling of Tensor Network Algorithms via Field-Programmable Gate Array Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving the computational efficiency of quantum many-body calculations from a hardware perspective remains a critical challenge. Although field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have recently been exploited to improve the computational scaling of algorithms such as Monte Carlo methods, their application to tensor network algorithms is still at an early stage. In this work, we propose a fine-grained parallel tensor network design based on FPGAs to substantially enhance the computational efficiency of two representative tensor network algorithms: the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) and the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). By employing a quad-tile partitioning strategy to decompose tensor elements and map them onto hardware circuits, our approach effectively translates algorithmic computational complexity into scalable hardware resource utilization, enabling an extremely high degree of parallelism on FPGAs. Compared with conventional CPU-based implementations, our scheme exhibits superior scalability in computation time, reducing the bond-dimension scaling of the computational cost from $O(D_b^3)$ to $O(D_b)$ for iTEBD and from $O(D_b^6)$ to $O(D_b^2)$ for HOTRG. This work provides a theoretical foundation for future hardware implementations of large-scale tensor network computations.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Parity Breaking in Quantum Antiferromagnets on the Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frustration on the triangular lattice has long been a source of intriguing and often debated phases in many-body systems. Although symmetry analysis has been employed, the role of the seemingly trivial parity symmetry has received little attention. In this work, we show that phases induced by frustration are systematically shaped by an implicit rule of thumb associated with spontaneous parity breaking. This principle enables us to anticipate and rationalize the regimes and conditions under which nontrivial phases emerge. For the spin-$S$ antiferromagnetic XXZ model, we demonstrate that a controversial parity-broken phase appears only at intermediate values of $S$. In bilayer systems, enhanced frustration leads to additional phases, such as supersolids, whose properties can be classified by their characteristic parity features. Benefiting from our improved tensor network contraction techniques, we confirm these results through large-scale tensor-network calculations. This study offers an alternative viewpoint and a systematic approach for examining the interplay between spin, symmetry, and frustration in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Improving Ground State Accuracy of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers with Soft-coded Orthogonal Subspace Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to improve the accuracy of ground state estimates in Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms by employing subspace representations with soft-coded orthogonality constraints. As in other subspace-based VQE methods, such as the Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) and Multistate Contracted VQE (MCVQE), once the parameters are optimized to maximize the subspace overlap with the low-energy sector of the Hamiltonian, one diagonalizes the Hamiltonian restricted to the subspace. Unlike these methods, where \emph{hard-coded} orthogonality constraints are enforced at the circuit level among the states spanning the subspace, we consider a subspace representation where orthogonality is \emph{soft-coded} via penalty terms in the cost function. We show that this representation allows for shallower quantum circuits while maintaining high fidelity when compared to single-state (standard VQE) and multi-state (SSVQE or MCVQE) representations, on two benchmark cases: a $3\times 3$ transverse-field Ising model and random realizations of the Edwards--Anderson spin-glass model on a $4\times 4$ lattice.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photoproduction of light and heavy vector mesons: thresholds to very high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A reaction model for $\gamma + p \to V + p$, $V=\rho^0, \phi, J/\psi, \Upsilon$, which exposes the quark-antiquark content of the photon in making the transition $\gamma\to {q} \bar{q} + \mathbb P \to V$, where ${q}$ depends on $V$, and couples the intermediate ${q} \bar{q}$ system to the proton's valence quarks via Pomeron ($\mathbb P$) exchange, is used to deliver a unified description of available data -- both differential and total cross sections -- from near threshold to very high energies, $W$, for all the $V$-mesons. For the $\Upsilon$, this means $10\lesssim W/{\rm GeV} \lesssim 2\,000$. Also provided are predictions for the power-law exponents that are empirically used to characterise the large-$W$ behaviour of the total cross sections and slope parameters characterising the near-threshold differential cross sections. Appealing to notions of vector meson dominance, the latter have been interpreted as vector-meson--proton scattering lengths. The body of results indicate that it is premature to link any $\gamma + p \to V + p$ data with, for instance, in-proton gluon distributions, the quantum chromodynamics trace anomaly, or pentaquark production. Further developments in reaction theory and higher precision data are required before the validity of any such links can be assessed.</description>
