      <title>The Black Hole Idealization Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stephen Hawking's derivation of Hawking radiation relied on one particular spacetime model, that of a star collapsing into a black hole which then remains in existence forever. He then argued that Hawking radiation implies this model should be thrown away in favour of a different model, that of an evaporating black hole. This aspect of Hawking's argument is an example of an idealization that is pervasive in the literature on black hole thermodynamics, but which has not yet been widely discussed by philosophers. The aim of this paper is to clarify the nature of Hawking's idealization, and to show a sense in which it leads to a paradox. After identifying this idealization paradox in classic derivations of Hawking radiation, I go on to show how various research programmes in black hole thermodynamics can be viewed as possible resolutions to the paradox. I give an initial analysis of the prospects for success of these various resolutions, and show how they shed light on both the philosophical foundations of both Hawking radiation on the nature of idealizations in physics.</description>

      <title>Gauge theory is about the geometry of internal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In general relativity, the strong equivalence principle is underpinned by a geometrical interpretation of fields on spacetime: all fields and bodies probe the same geometry. This geometric interpretation implies that the parallel transport of all spacetime tensors and spinors is dictated by a single affine connection. Can something similar be said about gauge theory? Agreed, in gauge theory different symmetry groups rule the interactions of different types of charges, so we cannot expect to find the same kind of universality found in the gravitational case. Nonetheless, the parallel transport of all the fields that are charged under the same symmetry group is dictated by a single 'gauge connection', and they all transform jointly under a gauge transformation. Is this kind of 'restricted universality' as geometrically underpinned as in general relativity? Here I argue that it is. The key difference is that the gauge geometry concerns 'internal', as opposed to 'external', spaces. The gauge symmetry of the standard model is thus understood as merely the automorphism group of an internal geometric structure -- $C^3\otimes C^2\otimes C^1$ endowed with an orientation and canonical inner product -- in the same way as spacetime symmetries (such as Poincare transformations), are understood as the automorphism group of an external geometric structure (respectively, a Minkowski metric). And the Ehresmann connection can then be understood as determining parallelism for this internal geometry.</description>
