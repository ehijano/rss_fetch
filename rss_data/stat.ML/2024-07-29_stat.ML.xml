      <title>Flusion: Integrating multiple data sources for accurate influenza predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last ten years, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has organized an annual influenza forecasting challenge with the motivation that accurate probabilistic forecasts could improve situational awareness and yield more effective public health actions. Starting with the 2021/22 influenza season, the forecasting targets for this challenge have been based on hospital admissions reported in the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) surveillance system. Reporting of influenza hospital admissions through NHSN began within the last few years, and as such only a limited amount of historical data are available for this signal. To produce forecasts in the presence of limited data for the target surveillance system, we augmented these data with two signals that have a longer historical record: 1) ILI+, which estimates the proportion of outpatient doctor visits where the patient has influenza; and 2) rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations at a selected set of healthcare facilities. Our model, Flusion, is an ensemble that combines gradient boosting quantile regression models with a Bayesian autoregressive model. The gradient boosting models were trained on all three data signals, while the autoregressive model was trained on only the target signal; all models were trained jointly on data for multiple locations. Flusion was the top-performing model in the CDC's influenza prediction challenge for the 2023/24 season. In this article we investigate the factors contributing to Flusion's success, and we find that its strong performance was primarily driven by the use of a gradient boosting model that was trained jointly on data from multiple surveillance signals and locations. These results indicate the value of sharing information across locations and surveillance signals, especially when doing so adds to the pool of available training data.</description>

      <title>Bayesian meta learning for trustworthy uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of Bayesian regression with trustworthy uncertainty quantification. We define that the uncertainty quantification is trustworthy if the ground truth can be captured by intervals dependent on the predictive distributions with a pre-specified probability. Furthermore, we propose, Trust-Bayes, a novel optimization framework for Bayesian meta learning which is cognizant of trustworthy uncertainty quantification without explicit assumptions on the prior model/distribution of the functions. We characterize the lower bounds of the probabilities of the ground truth being captured by the specified intervals and analyze the sample complexity with respect to the feasible probability for trustworthy uncertainty quantification. Monte Carlo simulation of a case study using Gaussian process regression is conducted for verification and comparison with the Meta-prior algorithm.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Data Shapley via Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As data plays an increasingly pivotal role in decision-making, the emergence of data markets underscores the growing importance of data valuation. Within the machine learning landscape, Data Shapley stands out as a widely embraced method for data valuation. However, a limitation of Data Shapley is its assumption of a fixed dataset, contrasting with the dynamic nature of real-world applications where data constantly evolves and expands. This paper establishes the relationship between Data Shapley and infinite-order U-statistics and addresses this limitation by quantifying the uncertainty of Data Shapley with changes in data distribution from the perspective of U-statistics. We make statistical inferences on data valuation to obtain confidence intervals for the estimations. We construct two different algorithms to estimate this uncertainty and provide recommendations for their applicable situations. We also conduct a series of experiments on various datasets to verify asymptotic normality and propose a practical trading scenario enabled by this method.</description>

      <title>Piecewise deterministic generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of generative models based on piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), a family of non-diffusive stochastic processes consisting of deterministic motion and random jumps at random times. Similarly to diffusions, such Markov processes admit time reversals that turn out to be PDMPs as well. We apply this observation to three PDMPs considered in the literature: the Zig-Zag process, Bouncy Particle Sampler, and Randomised Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. For these three particular instances, we show that the jump rates and kernels of the corresponding time reversals admit explicit expressions depending on some conditional densities of the PDMP under consideration before and after a jump. Based on these results, we propose efficient training procedures to learn these characteristics and consider methods to approximately simulate the reverse process. Finally, we provide bounds in the total variation distance between the data distribution and the resulting distribution of our model in the case where the base distribution is the standard $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Promising numerical simulations support further investigations into this class of models.</description>

      <title>Generalization bounds for regression and classification on adaptive covering input domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main focus is on the generalization bound, which serves as an upper limit for the generalization error. Our analysis delves into regression and classification tasks separately to ensure a thorough examination. We assume the target function is real-valued and Lipschitz continuous for regression tasks. We use the 2-norm and a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) variant to measure the disparities between predictions and actual values. In the case of classification tasks, we treat the target function as a one-hot classifier, representing a piece-wise constant function, and employ 0/1 loss for error measurement. Our analysis underscores the differing sample complexity required to achieve a concentration inequality of generalization bounds, highlighting the variation in learning efficiency for regression and classification tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalization bounds for regression and classification functions are inversely proportional to a polynomial of the number of parameters in a network, with the degree depending on the hypothesis class and the network architecture. These findings emphasize the advantages of over-parameterized networks and elucidate the conditions for benign overfitting in such systems.</description>

      <title>Making Multi-Axis Gaussian Graphical Models Scalable to Millions of Samples and Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian graphical models can be used to extract conditional dependencies between the features of the dataset. This is often done by making an independence assumption about the samples, but this assumption is rarely satisfied in reality. However, state-of-the-art approaches that avoid this assumption are not scalable, with $O(n^3)$ runtime and $O(n^2)$ space complexity. In this paper, we introduce a method that has $O(n^2)$ runtime and $O(n)$ space complexity, without assuming independence.
  We validate our model on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that our method's accuracy is comparable to that of prior work We demonstrate that our approach can be used on unprecedentedly large datasets, such as a real-world 1,000,000-cell scRNA-seq dataset; this was impossible with previous approaches. Our method maintains the flexibility of prior work, such as the ability to handle multi-modal tensor-variate datasets and the ability to work with data of arbitrary marginal distributions. An additional advantage of our method is that, unlike prior work, our hyperparameters are easily interpretable.</description>

      <title>Emergence in non-neural models: grokking modular arithmetic via average gradient outer product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks trained to solve modular arithmetic tasks exhibit grokking, a phenomenon where the test accuracy starts improving long after the model achieves 100% training accuracy in the training process. It is often taken as an example of "emergence", where model ability manifests sharply through a phase transition. In this work, we show that the phenomenon of grokking is not specific to neural networks nor to gradient descent-based optimization. Specifically, we show that this phenomenon occurs when learning modular arithmetic with Recursive Feature Machines (RFM), an iterative algorithm that uses the Average Gradient Outer Product (AGOP) to enable task-specific feature learning with general machine learning models. When used in conjunction with kernel machines, iterating RFM results in a fast transition from random, near zero, test accuracy to perfect test accuracy. This transition cannot be predicted from the training loss, which is identically zero, nor from the test loss, which remains constant in initial iterations. Instead, as we show, the transition is completely determined by feature learning: RFM gradually learns block-circulant features to solve modular arithmetic. Paralleling the results for RFM, we show that neural networks that solve modular arithmetic also learn block-circulant features. Furthermore, we present theoretical evidence that RFM uses such block-circulant features to implement the Fourier Multiplication Algorithm, which prior work posited as the generalizing solution neural networks learn on these tasks. Our results demonstrate that emergence can result purely from learning task-relevant features and is not specific to neural architectures nor gradient descent-based optimization methods. Furthermore, our work provides more evidence for AGOP as a key mechanism for feature learning in neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Budget allocation of marketplace levers, such as incentives for drivers and promotions for riders, has long been a technical and business challenge at Uber; understanding lever budget changes' impact and estimating cost efficiency to achieve predefined budgets is crucial, with the goal of optimal allocations that maximize business value; we introduce an end-to-end machine learning and optimization procedure to automate budget decision-making for cities, relying on feature store, model training and serving, optimizers, and backtesting; proposing state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) estimator based on S-Learner and a novel tensor B-Spline regression model, we solve high-dimensional optimization with ADMM and primal-dual interior point convex optimization, substantially improving Uber's resource allocation efficiency.</description>

      <title>Boosted generalized normal distributions: Integrating machine learning with operations knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applications of machine learning (ML) techniques to operational settings often face two challenges: i) ML methods mostly provide point predictions whereas many operational problems require distributional information; and ii) They typically do not incorporate the extensive body of knowledge in the operations literature, particularly the theoretical and empirical findings that characterize specific distributions. We introduce a novel and rigorous methodology, the Boosted Generalized Normal Distribution ($b$GND), to address these challenges. The Generalized Normal Distribution (GND) encompasses a wide range of parametric distributions commonly encountered in operations, and $b$GND leverages gradient boosting with tree learners to flexibly estimate the parameters of the GND as functions of covariates. We establish $b$GND's statistical consistency, thereby extending this key property to special cases studied in the ML literature that lacked such guarantees. Using data from a large academic emergency department in the United States, we show that the distributional forecasting of patient wait and service times can be meaningfully improved by leveraging findings from the healthcare operations literature. Specifically, $b$GND performs 6% and 9% better than the distribution-agnostic ML benchmark used to forecast wait and service times respectively. Further analysis suggests that these improvements translate into a 9% increase in patient satisfaction and a 4% reduction in mortality for myocardial infarction patients. Our work underscores the importance of integrating ML with operations knowledge to enhance distributional forecasts.</description>

      <title>A simulation study of cluster search algorithms in data set generated by Gaussian mixture models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the number of clusters is a fundamental issue in data clustering. Several algorithms have been proposed, including centroid-based algorithms using the Euclidean distance and model-based algorithms using a mixture of probability distributions. Among these, greedy algorithms for searching the number of clusters by repeatedly splitting or merging clusters have advantages in terms of computation time for problems with large sample sizes. However, studies comparing these methods in systematic evaluation experiments still need to be included. This study examines centroid- and model-based cluster search algorithms in various cases that Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) can generate. The cases are generated by combining five factors: dimensionality, sample size, the number of clusters, cluster overlap, and covariance type. The results show that some cluster-splitting criteria based on Euclidean distance make unreasonable decisions when clusters overlap. The results also show that model-based algorithms are insensitive to covariance type and cluster overlap compared to the centroid-based method if the sample size is sufficient.

      <title>Approximate learning of parsimonious Bayesian context trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models for categorical sequences typically assume exchangeable or first-order dependent sequence elements. These are common assumptions, for example, in models of computer malware traces and protein sequences. Although such simplifying assumptions lead to computational tractability, these models fail to capture long-range, complex dependence structures that may be harnessed for greater predictive power. To this end, a Bayesian modelling framework is proposed to parsimoniously capture rich dependence structures in categorical sequences, with memory efficiency suitable for real-time processing of data streams. Parsimonious Bayesian context trees are introduced as a form of variable-order Markov model with conjugate prior distributions. The novel framework requires fewer parameters than fixed-order Markov models by dropping redundant dependencies and clustering sequential contexts. Approximate inference on the context tree structure is performed via a computationally efficient model-based agglomerative clustering procedure. The proposed framework is tested on synthetic and real-world data examples, and it outperforms existing sequence models when fitted to real protein sequences and honeypot computer terminal sessions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central question in deep learning is how deep neural networks (DNNs) learn features. DNN layers progressively collapse data into a regular low-dimensional geometry. This collective effect of non-linearity, noise, learning rate, width, depth, and numerous other parameters, has eluded first-principles theories which are built from microscopic neuronal dynamics. Here we present a noise-non-linearity phase diagram that highlights where shallow or deep layers learn features more effectively. We then propose a macroscopic mechanical theory of feature learning that accurately reproduces this phase diagram, offering a clear intuition for why and how some DNNs are ``lazy'' and some are ``active'', and relating the distribution of feature learning over layers with test accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a deep delta hedging framework for options, utilizing neural networks to learn the residuals between the hedging function and the implied Black-Scholes delta. This approach leverages the smoother properties of these residuals, enhancing deep learning performance. Utilizing ten years of daily S&amp;P 500 index option data, our empirical analysis demonstrates that learning the residuals, using the mean squared one-step hedging error as the loss function, significantly improves hedging performance over directly learning the hedging function, often by more than 100%. Adding input features when learning the residuals enhances hedging performance more for puts than calls, with market sentiment being less crucial. Furthermore, learning the residuals with three years of data matches the hedging performance of directly learning with ten years of data, proving that our method demands less data.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery in Linear Models with Unobserved Variables and Measurement Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of unobserved common causes and the presence of measurement error are two of the most limiting challenges in the task of causal structure learning. Ignoring either of the two challenges can lead to detecting spurious causal links among variables of interest. In this paper, we study the problem of causal discovery in systems where these two challenges can be present simultaneously. We consider linear models which include four types of variables: variables that are directly observed, variables that are not directly observed but are measured with error, the corresponding measurements, and variables that are neither observed nor measured. We characterize the extent of identifiability of such model under separability condition (i.e., the matrix indicating the independent exogenous noise terms pertaining to the observed variables is identifiable) together with two versions of faithfulness assumptions and propose a notion of observational equivalence. We provide graphical characterization of the models that are equivalent and present a recovery algorithm that could return models equivalent to the ground truth.</description>

      <title>Leave-One-Out Analysis for Nonconvex Robust Matrix Completion with General Thresholding Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust matrix completion (RMC), where the partially observed entries of an underlying low-rank matrix is corrupted by sparse noise. Existing analysis of the non-convex methods for this problem either requires the explicit but empirically redundant regularization in the algorithm or requires sample splitting in the analysis. In this paper, we consider a simple yet efficient nonconvex method which alternates between a projected gradient step for the low-rank part and a thresholding step for the sparse noise part. Inspired by leave-one out analysis for low rank matrix completion, it is established that the method can achieve linear convergence for a general class of thresholding functions, including for example soft-thresholding and SCAD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first leave-one-out analysis on a nonconvex method for RMC. Additionally, when applying our result to low rank matrix completion, it improves the sampling complexity of existing result for the singular value projection method.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Uncertain Incompleteness for Robust Multimodal Sequential Diagnosis Prediction via Knowledge Distillation and Random Data Erasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present NECHO v2, a novel framework designed to enhance the predictive accuracy of multimodal sequential patient diagnoses under uncertain missing visit sequences, a common challenge in clinical settings. Firstly, we modify NECHO to handle uncertain modality representation dominance under the imperfect data. Next, we develop a systematic knowledge distillation by employing the modified NECHO as both teacher and student. It encompasses a modality-wise contrastive and hierarchical distillation, transformer representation random distillation, along with other distillations to align representations tightly and effectively. We also utilise random erasing on individual data points within sequences during both training and distillation of teacher to lightly simulate scenario with missing visit information to foster effective knowledge transfer. As a result, NECHO v2 verifies itself by showing superiority in multimodal sequential diagnosis prediction on both balanced and imbalanced incomplete settings on multimodal healthcare data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Volterra equations (SVEs) serve as mathematical models for the time evolutions of random systems with memory effects and irregular behaviour. We introduce neural stochastic Volterra equations as a physics-inspired architecture, generalizing the class of neural stochastic differential equations, and provide some theoretical foundation. Numerical experiments on various SVEs, like the disturbed pendulum equation, the generalized Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process and the rough Heston model are presented, comparing the performance of neural SVEs, neural SDEs and Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets).</description>

      <title>Sharp Bounds for Poly-GNNs and the Effect of Graph Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the classification performance of graph neural networks with graph-polynomial features, poly-GNNs, on the problem of semi-supervised node classification. We analyze poly-GNNs under a general contextual stochastic block model (CSBM) by providing a sharp characterization of the rate of separation between classes in their output node representations. A question of interest is whether this rate depends on the depth of the network $k$, i.e., whether deeper networks can achieve a faster separation? We provide a negative answer to this question: for a sufficiently large graph, a depth $k &gt; 1$ poly-GNN exhibits the same rate of separation as a depth $k=1$ counterpart. Our analysis highlights and quantifies the impact of ``graph noise'' in deep GNNs and shows how noise in the graph structure can dominate other sources of signal in the graph, negating any benefit further aggregation provides. Our analysis also reveals subtle differences between even and odd-layered GNNs in how the feature noise propagates.</description>

      <title>Experimenting on Markov Decision Processes with Local Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As service systems grow increasingly complex and dynamic, many interventions become localized, available and taking effect only in specific states. This paper investigates experiments with local treatments on a widely-used class of dynamic models, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Particularly, we focus on utilizing the local structure to improve the inference efficiency of the average treatment effect. We begin by demonstrating the efficiency of classical inference methods, including model-based estimation and temporal difference learning under a fixed policy, as well as classical A/B testing with general treatments. We then introduce a variance reduction technique that exploits the local treatment structure by sharing information for states unaffected by the treatment policy. Our new estimator effectively overcomes the variance lower bound for general treatments while matching the more stringent lower bound incorporating the local treatment structure. Furthermore, our estimator can optimally achieve a linear reduction with the number of test arms for a major part of the variance. Finally, we explore scenarios with perfect knowledge of the control arm and design estimators that further improve inference efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [PhD thesis of FCP.] Nowadays, genetics studies large amounts of very diverse variables. Mathematical statistics has evolved in parallel to its applications, with much recent interest high-dimensional settings. In the genetics of human common disease, a number of relevant problems can be formulated as tests of independence. We show how defining adequate premetric structures on the support spaces of the genetic data allows for novel approaches to such testing. This yields a solid theoretical framework, which reflects the underlying biology, and allows for computationally-efficient implementations. For each problem, we provide mathematical results, simulations and the application to real data.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Agnostic PAC Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PAC learning, dating back to Valiant'84 and Vapnik and Chervonenkis'64,'74, is a classic model for studying supervised learning. In the agnostic setting, we have access to a hypothesis set $\mathcal{H}$ and a training set of labeled samples $(x_1,y_1),\dots,(x_n,y_n) \in \mathcal{X} \times \{-1,1\}$ drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution $\mathcal{D}$. The goal is to produce a classifier $h : \mathcal{X} \to \{-1,1\}$ that is competitive with the hypothesis $h^\star_{\mathcal{D}} \in \mathcal{H}$ having the least probability of mispredicting the label $y$ of a new sample $(x,y)\sim \mathcal{D}$.
  Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) is a natural learning algorithm, where one simply outputs the hypothesis from $\mathcal{H}$ making the fewest mistakes on the training data. This simple algorithm is known to have an optimal error in terms of the VC-dimension of $\mathcal{H}$ and the number of samples $n$.
  In this work, we revisit agnostic PAC learning and first show that ERM is in fact sub-optimal if we treat the performance of the best hypothesis, denoted $\tau:=\Pr_{\mathcal{D}}[h^\star_{\mathcal{D}}(x) \neq y]$, as a parameter. Concretely we show that ERM, and any other proper learning algorithm, is sub-optimal by a $\sqrt{\ln(1/\tau)}$ factor. We then complement this lower bound with the first learning algorithm achieving an optimal error for nearly the full range of $\tau$. Our algorithm introduces several new ideas that we hope may find further applications in learning theory.</description>

      <title>Imputation for prediction: beware of diminishing returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Missing values are prevalent across various fields, posing challenges for training and deploying predictive models. In this context, imputation is a common practice, driven by the hope that accurate imputations will enhance predictions. However, recent theoretical and empirical studies indicate that simple constant imputation can be consistent and competitive. This empirical study aims at clarifying if and when investing in advanced imputation methods yields significantly better predictions. Relating imputation and predictive accuracies across combinations of imputation and predictive models on 20 datasets, we show that imputation accuracy matters less i) when using expressive models, ii) when incorporating missingness indicators as complementary inputs, iii) matters much more for generated linear outcomes than for real-data outcomes. Interestingly, we also show that the use of the missingness indicator is beneficial to the prediction performance, even in MCAR scenarios. Overall, on real-data with powerful models, improving imputation only has a minor effect on prediction performance. Thus, investing in better imputations for improved predictions often offers limited benefits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of online multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) in transfer learning, a scenario where one needs to adapt multiple, heterogeneous source domains towards a target domain that comes in a stream. We introduce a novel approach for the online fit of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), based on the Wasserstein geometry of Gaussian measures. We build upon this method and recent developments in dataset dictionary learning for proposing a novel strategy in online MSDA. Experiments on the challenging Tennessee Eastman Process benchmark demonstrate that our approach is able to adapt \emph{on the fly} to the stream of target domain data. Furthermore, our online GMM serves as a memory, representing the whole stream of data.</description>

      <title>On the Effects of Irrelevant Variables in Treatment Effect Estimation with Deep Disentanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating treatment effects from observational data is paramount in healthcare, education, and economics, but current deep disentanglement-based methods to address selection bias are insufficiently handling irrelevant variables. We demonstrate in experiments that this leads to prediction errors. We disentangle pre-treatment variables with a deep embedding method and explicitly identify and represent irrelevant variables, additionally to instrumental, confounding and adjustment latent factors. To this end, we introduce a reconstruction objective and create an embedding space for irrelevant variables using an attached autoencoder. Instead of relying on serendipitous suppression of irrelevant variables as in previous deep disentanglement approaches, we explicitly force irrelevant variables into this embedding space and employ orthogonalization to prevent irrelevant information from leaking into the latent space representations of the other factors. Our experiments with synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets show that we can better identify irrelevant variables and more precisely predict treatment effects than previous methods, while prediction quality degrades less when additional irrelevant variables are introduced.</description>

      <title>Finite-Sample Guarantees for Best-Response Learning Dynamics in Zero-Sum Matrix Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study best-response type learning dynamics for two player zero-sum matrix games. We consider two settings that are distinguished by the type of information that each player has about the game and their opponent's strategy. The first setting is the full information case, in which each player knows their own and the opponent's payoff matrices and observes the opponent's mixed strategy. The second setting is the minimal information case, where players do not observe the opponent's strategy and are not aware of either of the payoff matrices (instead they only observe their realized payoffs). For this setting, also known as the radically uncoupled case in the learning in games literature, we study a two-timescale learning dynamics that combine smoothed best-response type updates for strategy estimates with a TD-learning update to estimate a local payoff function. For these dynamics, without additional exploration, we provide polynomial-time finite-sample guarantees for convergence to an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>AutoScale: Automatic Prediction of Compute-optimal Data Composition for Training LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To ensure performance on a diverse set of downstream tasks, LLMs are pretrained via data mixtures over different domains. In this work, we demonstrate that the optimal data composition for a fixed compute budget varies depending on the scale of the training data, suggesting that the common practice of empirically determining an optimal composition using small-scale experiments will not yield the optimal data mixtures when scaling up to the final model. To address this challenge, we propose *AutoScale*, an automated tool that finds a compute-optimal data composition for training at any desired target scale. AutoScale first determines the optimal composition at a small scale using a novel bilevel optimization framework, Direct Data Optimization (*DDO*), and then fits a predictor to estimate the optimal composition at larger scales. The predictor's design is inspired by our theoretical analysis of scaling laws related to data composition, which could be of independent interest. In empirical studies with pre-training 774M Decoder-only LMs (GPT-2 Large) on RedPajama dataset, AutoScale decreases validation perplexity at least 25% faster than any baseline with up to 38% speed up compared to without reweighting, achieving the best overall performance across downstream tasks. On pre-training Encoder-only LMs (BERT) with masked language modeling, DDO is shown to decrease loss on all domains while visibly improving average task performance on GLUE benchmark by 8.7% and on large-scale QA dataset (SQuAD) by 5.9% compared with without reweighting. AutoScale speeds up training by up to 28%. Our codes are open-sourced.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the increasing popularity of overparameterized Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) like Neural SDEs, Wang, Blanchet and Glynn recently introduced the generator gradient estimator, a novel unbiased stochastic gradient estimator for SDEs whose computation time remains stable in the number of parameters. In this note, we demonstrate that this estimator is in fact an adjoint state method, an approach which is known to scale with the number of states and not the number of parameters in the case of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). In addition, we show that the generator gradient estimator is a close analogue to the exact Integral Path Algorithm (eIPA) estimator which was introduced by Gupta, Rathinam and Khammash for a class of Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) known as stochastic chemical reactions networks (CRNs).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14233v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision-makers often simultaneously face many related but heterogeneous learning problems. For instance, a large retailer may wish to learn product demand at different stores to solve pricing or inventory problems, making it desirable to learn jointly for stores serving similar customers; alternatively, a hospital network may wish to learn patient risk at different providers to allocate personalized interventions, making it desirable to learn jointly for hospitals serving similar patient populations. Motivated by real datasets, we study a natural setting where the unknown parameter in each learning instance can be decomposed into a shared global parameter plus a sparse instance-specific term. We propose a novel two-stage multitask learning estimator that exploits this structure in a sample-efficient way, using a unique combination of robust statistics (to learn across similar instances) and LASSO regression (to debias the results). Our estimator yields improved sample complexity bounds in the feature dimension $d$ relative to commonly-employed estimators; this improvement is exponential for "data-poor" instances, which benefit the most from multitask learning. We illustrate the utility of these results for online learning by embedding our multitask estimator within simultaneous contextual bandit algorithms. We specify a dynamic calibration of our estimator to appropriately balance the bias-variance tradeoff over time, improving the resulting regret bounds in the context dimension $d$. Finally, we illustrate the value of our approach on synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even though dropout is a popular regularization technique, its theoretical properties are not fully understood. In this paper we study dropout regularization in extended generalized linear models based on double exponential families, for which the dispersion parameter can vary with the features. A theoretical analysis shows that dropout regularization prefers rare but important features in both the mean and dispersion, generalizing an earlier result for conventional generalized linear models. To illustrate, we apply dropout to adaptive smoothing with B-splines, where both the mean and dispersion parameters are modeled flexibly. The important B-spline basis functions can be thought of as rare features, and we confirm in experiments that dropout is an effective form of regularization for mean and dispersion parameters that improves on a penalized maximum likelihood approach with an explicit smoothness penalty. An application to traffic detection data from Berlin further illustrates the benefits of our method.</description>

Abstract: Signatures are iterated path integrals of continuous and discrete-time processes, and their universal nonlinearity linearizes the problem of feature selection in time series data analysis. This paper studies the consistency of signature using Lasso regression, both theoretically and numerically. We establish conditions under which the Lasso regression is consistent both asymptotically and in finite sample. Furthermore, we show that the Lasso regression is more consistent with the It\^o signature for time series and processes that are closer to the Brownian motion and with weaker inter-dimensional correlations, while it is more consistent with the Stratonovich signature for mean-reverting time series and processes. We demonstrate that signature can be applied to learn nonlinear functions and option prices with high accuracy, and the performance depends on properties of the underlying process and the choice of the signature.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Linear Representation Learning from Non-IID Non-Isotropic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A powerful concept behind much of the recent progress in machine learning is the extraction of common features across data from heterogeneous sources or tasks. Intuitively, using all of one's data to learn a common representation function benefits both computational effort and statistical generalization by leaving a smaller number of parameters to fine-tune on a given task. Toward theoretically grounding these merits, we propose a general setting of recovering linear operators $M$ from noisy vector measurements $y = Mx + w$, where the covariates $x$ may be both non-i.i.d. and non-isotropic. We demonstrate that existing isotropy-agnostic representation learning approaches incur biases on the representation update, which causes the scaling of the noise terms to lose favorable dependence on the number of source tasks. This in turn can cause the sample complexity of representation learning to be bottlenecked by the single-task data size. We introduce an adaptation, $\texttt{De-bias &amp; Feature-Whiten}$ ($\texttt{DFW}$), of the popular alternating minimization-descent scheme proposed independently in Collins et al., (2021) and Nayer and Vaswani (2022), and establish linear convergence to the optimal representation with noise level scaling down with the $\textit{total}$ source data size. This leads to generalization bounds on the same order as an oracle empirical risk minimizer. We verify the vital importance of $\texttt{DFW}$ on various numerical simulations. In particular, we show that vanilla alternating-minimization descent fails catastrophically even for iid, but mildly non-isotropic data. Our analysis unifies and generalizes prior work, and provides a flexible framework for a wider range of applications, such as in controls and dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Gradient Flow based on the Sliced Wasserstein Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safeguarding privacy in sensitive training data is paramount, particularly in the context of generative modeling. This can be achieved through either differentially private stochastic gradient descent or a differentially private metric for training models or generators. In this paper, we introduce a novel differentially private generative modeling approach based on a gradient flow in the space of probability measures. To this end, we define the gradient flow of the Gaussian-smoothed Sliced Wasserstein Distance, including the associated stochastic differential equation (SDE). By discretizing and defining a numerical scheme for solving this SDE, we demonstrate the link between smoothing and differential privacy based on a Gaussian mechanism, due to a specific form of the SDE's drift term. We then analyze the differential privacy guarantee of our gradient flow, which accounts for both the smoothing and the Wiener process introduced by the SDE itself. Experiments show that our proposed model can generate higher-fidelity data at a low privacy budget compared to a generator-based model, offering a promising alternative.</description>

      <title>Statistical Test on Diffusion Model-based Generated Images by Selective Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI technology for generating images, such as diffusion models, has advanced rapidly. However, there is no established framework for quantifying the reliability of AI-generated images, which hinders their use in critical decision-making tasks, such as medical image diagnosis. In this study, we propose a method to quantify the reliability of decision-making tasks that rely on images produced by diffusion models within a statistical testing framework. The core concept of our statistical test involves using a selective inference framework, in which the statistical test is conducted under the condition that the images are produced by a trained diffusion model. As a case study, we study a diffusion model-based anomaly detection task for medical images. With our approach, the statistical significance of medical image diagnostic outcomes can be quantified in terms of a p-value, enabling decision-making with a controlled error rate. We demonstrate the theoretical soundness and practical effectiveness of our statistical test through numerical experiments on both synthetic and brain image datasets.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity Gaussian process surrogate modeling for regression problems in physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in surrogate modeling is the limited availability of data due to resource constraints associated with computationally expensive simulations. Multi-fidelity methods provide a solution by chaining models in a hierarchy with increasing fidelity, associated with lower error, but increasing cost. In this paper, we compare different multi-fidelity methods employed in constructing Gaussian process surrogates for regression. Non-linear autoregressive methods in the existing literature are primarily confined to two-fidelity models, and we extend these methods to handle more than two levels of fidelity. Additionally, we propose enhancements for an existing method incorporating delay terms by introducing a structured kernel. We demonstrate the performance of these methods across various academic and real-world scenarios. Our findings reveal that multi-fidelity methods generally have a smaller prediction error for the same computational cost as compared to the single-fidelity method, although their effectiveness varies across different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Flow Perturbation to Accelerate Unbiased Sampling of Boltzmann distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow-based generative models have been employed for sampling the Boltzmann distribution, but their application to high-dimensional systems is hindered by the significant computational cost of obtaining the Jacobian of the flow. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the flow perturbation method, which incorporates optimized stochastic perturbations into the flow. By reweighting trajectories generated by the perturbed flow, our method achieves unbiased sampling of the Boltzmann distribution with orders of magnitude speedup compared to both brute force Jacobian calculations and the Hutchinson estimator. Notably, it accurately sampled the Chignolin protein with all atomic Cartesian coordinates explicitly represented, which, to our best knowledge, is the largest molecule ever Boltzmann sampled in such detail using generative models.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Automotive Supply Chain Shortfalls with Heterogeneous Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operational disruptions can significantly impact companies performance. Ford, with its 37 plants globally, uses 17 billion parts annually to manufacture six million cars and trucks. With up to ten tiers of suppliers between the company and raw materials, any extended disruption in this supply chain can cause substantial financial losses. Therefore, the ability to forecast and identify such disruptions early is crucial for maintaining seamless operations. In this study, we demonstrate how we construct a dataset consisting of many multivariate time series to forecast first-tier supply chain disruptions, utilizing features related to capacity, inventory, utilization, and processing, as outlined in the classical Factory Physics framework. This dataset is technically challenging due to its vast scale of over five hundred thousand time series. Furthermore, these time series, while exhibiting certain similarities, also display heterogeneity within specific subgroups. To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology that integrates an enhanced Attention Sequence to Sequence Deep Learning architecture, using Neural Network Embeddings to model group effects, with a Survival Analysis model. This model is designed to learn intricate heterogeneous data patterns related to operational disruptions. Our model has demonstrated a strong performance, achieving 0.85 precision and 0.8 recall during the Quality Assurance (QA) phase across Ford's five North American plants. Additionally, to address the common criticism of Machine Learning models as black boxes, we show how the SHAP framework can be used to generate feature importance from the model predictions. It offers valuable insights that can lead to actionable strategies and highlights the potential of advanced machine learning for managing and mitigating supply chain risks in the automotive industry.</description>

      <title>Deep NURBS -- Admissible Physics-informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new numerical scheme for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that enables precise and inexpensive solution for partial differential equations (PDEs) in case of arbitrary geometries while strictly enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions. The proposed approach combines admissible NURBS parametrizations required to define the physical domain and the Dirichlet boundary conditions with a PINN solver. The fundamental boundary conditions are automatically satisfied in this novel Deep NURBS framework. We verified our new approach using two-dimensional elliptic PDEs when considering arbitrary geometries, including non-Lipschitz domains. Compared to the classical PINN solver, the Deep NURBS estimator has a remarkably high convergence rate for all the studied problems. Moreover, a desirable accuracy was realized for most of the studied PDEs using only one hidden layer of neural networks. This novel approach is considered to pave the way for more effective solutions for high-dimensional problems by allowing for more realistic physics-informed statistical learning to solve PDE-based variational problems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Audio Recommendations for the Long-Term: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel podcast recommender system deployed at industrial scale. This system successfully optimizes personal listening journeys that unfold over months for hundreds of millions of listeners. In deviating from the pervasive industry practice of optimizing machine learning algorithms for short-term proxy metrics, the system substantially improves long-term performance in A/B tests. The paper offers insights into how our methods cope with attribution, coordination, and measurement challenges that usually hinder such long-term optimization. To contextualize these practical insights within a broader academic framework, we turn to reinforcement learning (RL). Using the language of RL, we formulate a comprehensive model of users' recurring relationships with a recommender system. Then, within this model, we identify our approach as a policy improvement update to a component of the existing recommender system, enhanced by tailored modeling of value functions and user-state representations. Illustrative offline experiments suggest this specialized modeling reduces data requirements by as much as a factor of 120,000 compared to black-box approaches.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Quantum Machine Learning Models Using Quantum Fisher Information Metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalization is the ability of machine learning models to make accurate predictions on new data by learning from training data. However, understanding generalization of quantum machine learning models has been a major challenge. Here, we introduce the data quantum Fisher information metric (DQFIM). It describes the capacity of variational quantum algorithms depending on variational ansatz, training data and their symmetries. We apply the DQFIM to quantify circuit parameters and training data needed to successfully train and generalize. Using the dynamical Lie algebra, we explain how to generalize using a low number of training states. Counter-intuitively, breaking symmetries of the training data can help to improve generalization. Finally, we find that out-of-distribution generalization, where training and testing data are drawn from different data distributions, can be better than using the same distribution. Our work provides a useful framework to explore the power of quantum machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Structural restrictions in local causal discovery: identifying direct causes of a target variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a set of direct causes of a target variable from an observational joint distribution. Learning directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that represent the causal structure is a fundamental problem in science. Several results are known when the full DAG is identifiable from the distribution, such as assuming a nonlinear Gaussian data-generating process. Here, we are only interested in identifying the direct causes of one target variable (local causal structure), not the full DAG. This allows us to relax the identifiability assumptions and develop possibly faster and more robust algorithms. In contrast to the Invariance Causal Prediction framework, we only assume that we observe one environment without any interventions. We discuss different assumptions for the data-generating process of the target variable under which the set of direct causes is identifiable from the distribution. While doing so, we put essentially no assumptions on the variables other than the target variable. In addition to the novel identifiability results, we provide two practical algorithms for estimating the direct causes from a finite random sample and demonstrate their effectiveness on several benchmark and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Adaptive maximization of social welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of repeatedly choosing policies to maximize social welfare. Welfare is a weighted sum of private utility and public revenue. Earlier outcomes inform later policies. Utility is not observed, but indirectly inferred. Response functions are learned through experimentation. We derive a lower bound on regret, and a matching adversarial upper bound for a variant of the Exp3 algorithm. Cumulative regret grows at a rate of $T^{2/3}$. This implies that (i) welfare maximization is harder than the multi-armed bandit problem (with a rate of $T^{1/2}$ for finite policy sets), and (ii) our algorithm achieves the optimal rate. For the stochastic setting, if social welfare is concave, we can achieve a rate of $T^{1/2}$ (for continuous policy sets), using a dyadic search algorithm. We analyze an extension to nonlinear income taxation, and sketch an extension to commodity taxation. We compare our setting to monopoly pricing (which is easier), and price setting for bilateral trade (which is harder).</description>

      <title>A Wasserstein perspective of Vanilla GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The empirical success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) caused an increasing interest in theoretical research. The statistical literature is mainly focused on Wasserstein GANs and generalizations thereof, which especially allow for good dimension reduction properties. Statistical results for Vanilla GANs, the original optimization problem, are still rather limited and require assumptions such as smooth activation functions and equal dimensions of the latent space and the ambient space. To bridge this gap, we draw a connection from Vanilla GANs to the Wasserstein distance. By doing so, existing results for Wasserstein GANs can be extended to Vanilla GANs. In particular, we obtain an oracle inequality for Vanilla GANs in Wasserstein distance. The assumptions of this oracle inequality are designed to be satisfied by network architectures commonly used in practice, such as feedforward ReLU networks. By providing a quantitative result for the approximation of a Lipschitz function by a feedforward ReLU network with bounded H\"older norm, we conclude a rate of convergence for Vanilla GANs as well as Wasserstein GANs as estimators of the unknown probability distribution.</description>

      <title>Generalization Error Bounds for Learning under Censored Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalization error bounds from learning theory provide statistical guarantees on how well an algorithm will perform on previously unseen data. In this paper, we characterize the impacts of data non-IIDness due to censored feedback (a.k.a. selective labeling bias) on such bounds. We first derive an extension of the well-known Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz (DKW) inequality, which characterizes the gap between empirical and theoretical CDFs given IID data, to problems with non-IID data due to censored feedback. We then use this CDF error bound to provide a bound on the generalization error guarantees of a classifier trained on such non-IID data. We show that existing generalization error bounds (which do not account for censored feedback) fail to correctly capture the model's generalization guarantees, verifying the need for our bounds. We further analyze the effectiveness of (pure and bounded) exploration techniques, proposed by recent literature as a way to alleviate censored feedback, on improving our error bounds. Together, our findings illustrate how a decision maker should account for the trade-off between strengthening the generalization guarantees of an algorithm and the costs incurred in data collection when future data availability is limited by censored feedback.</description>

      <title>Node Similarities under Random Projections: Limits and Pathological Cases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random Projections have been widely used to generate embeddings for various graph learning tasks due to their computational efficiency. The majority of applications have been justified through the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma. In this paper, we take a step further and investigate how well dot product and cosine similarity are preserved by random projections when these are applied over the rows of the graph matrix. Our analysis provides new asymptotic and finite-sample results, identifies pathological cases, and tests them with numerical experiments. We specialize our fundamental results to a ranking application by computing the probability of random projections flipping the node ordering induced by their embeddings. We find that, depending on the degree distribution, the method produces especially unreliable embeddings for the dot product, regardless of whether the adjacency or the normalized transition matrix is used. With respect to the statistical noise introduced by random projections, we show that cosine similarity produces remarkably more precise approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic combinatorial semi-bandit problem with unrestricted feedback delays under merit-based fairness constraints. This is motivated by applications such as crowdsourcing, and online advertising, where immediate feedback is not immediately available and fairness among different choices (or arms) is crucial. We consider two types of unrestricted feedback delays: reward-independent delays where the feedback delays are independent of the rewards, and reward-dependent delays where the feedback delays are correlated with the rewards. Furthermore, we introduce merit-based fairness constraints to ensure a fair selection of the arms. We define the reward regret and the fairness regret and present new bandit algorithms to select arms under unrestricted feedback delays based on their merits. We prove that our algorithms all achieve sublinear expected reward regret and expected fairness regret, with a dependence on the quantiles of the delay distribution. We also conduct extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world data and show that our algorithms can fairly select arms with different feedback delays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bandit algorithms hold great promise for improving personalized decision-making but are notoriously sample-hungry. In most health applications, it is infeasible to fit a new bandit for each patient, and observable variables are often insufficient to determine optimal treatments, ruling out applying contextual bandits learned from multiple patients. Latent bandits offer both rapid exploration and personalization beyond what context variables can reveal but require that a latent variable model can be learned consistently. In this work, we propose bandit algorithms based on nonlinear independent component analysis that can be provably identified from observational data to a degree sufficient to infer the optimal action in a new bandit instance consistently. We verify this strategy in simulated data, showing substantial improvement over learning independent multi-armed bandits for every instance.</description>
