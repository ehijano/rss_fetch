      <title>Catching Rats in $H$-minor-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every $H$-minor-free graph that also excludes a $(k \times k)$-grid as a minor has treewidth/branchwidth bounded from above by a function $f(t,k)$ that is linear in $k$ and polynomial in $t := |V(H)|$. Such a result was proven originally by [Demaine &amp; Hajiaghayi, Combinatorica, 2008], where $f$ was indeed linear in $k$. However the dependency in $t$ in this result was non-explicit (and huge). Later, [Kawarabayashi &amp; Kobayashi, JCTB, 2020] showed that this bound can be estimated to be $f(t,k)\in 2^{\mathcal{O}(t\log t)} \cdot k$. Wood recently asked whether $f$ can be pushed further to be polynomial, while maintaining the linearity on $k$. We answer this in a particularly strong sense, by showing that the treewidth/branchwidth of $G$ is in $\mathcal{O}(gk + t^{2304}),$ where $g$ is the Euler genus of $H$. This directly yields $f(t,k)= \mathcal{O}(t^2k + t^{2304})$.
  Our methods build on techniques for branchwidth and on new bounds and insights for the Graph Minor Structure Theorem (GMST) due to [Gorsky, Seweryn &amp; Wiederrecht, 2025, arXiv:2504.02532]. In particular, we prove a variant of the GMST that ensures some helpful properties for the minor relation. We further employ our methods to provide approximation algorithms for the treewidth/branchwidth of $H$-minor-free graphs. In particular, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and every $t$-vertex graph $H$ with Euler genus $g$, we give a $(g + \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the branchwidth of $H$-minor-free graphs running in $2^{\mathsf{poly}(t) / \varepsilon} \cdot \mathsf{poly}(n)$-time. Our algorithms explicitly return either an appropriate branch-decomposition or a grid-minor certifying a negative answer.</description>

      <title>Edge-colouring and orientations: applications to degree-boundedness and $\chi$-boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every $2$-edge-coloured graph with sufficiently large minimum degree contains a monochromatic induced subgraph whose minimum degree remains large.
  As a consequence, we deduce that some classes of graphs are degree-bounded. A class $\mathcal{G}$ is {\it degree-bounded} if, for every integer $s$, there exists $d=d(s)$ such that every graph $G\in \mathcal{G}$ either contains $K_{s,s}$ or has minimum degree at most $d$. We obtain that the following classes are degree-bounded: (i) for every $k$, the graphs $G$ whose edge-set can be $k$-coloured such that no even hole of $G$ is monochromatic; (ii) for every fixed antidirected forest $F$, the graphs admitting an orientation without any induced copy of $F$; (iii) for every $\ell\geq 4$, the graphs admitting an orientation without any induced antidirected cycle of length at least $\ell$.
  For $k=2$, class (i) contains odd-signable graphs. Class (ii) characterises the oriented graphs $H$ such that the class of graphs admitting an orientation without any induced copy of $H$ is degree-bounded. For $\ell=5$, class (iii) contains Burling graphs. In case (i) and case (iii) for $\ell=4$, we further obtain that the classes are polynomially $\chi$-bounded.</description>

      <title>Hall--Littlewood expansions of chromatic quasisymmetric polynomials using linked rook placements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain a Hall--Littlewood expansion of the chromatic quasisymmetric function arising from a natural unit interval order and describe the coefficients in terms of linked rook placements. Applying the Carlsson--Mellit relation between chromatic quasisymmetric functions and unicellular LLT polynomials, we also obtain a combinatorial description for the coefficients of the unicellular LLT polynomials expanded in terms of the modified transformed Hall--Littlewood polynomials.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic non-generic arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A discriminantal hyperplane arrangement B(n,k,A) is constructed from a given (generic) hyperplane arrangement A, which is classified as either very generic or non-very generic depending on the combinatorial structure of B(n,k,A). In particular, A is considered non-very generic if the intersection lattice of B(n,k,A) contains at least one non-very generic intersection -- that is, an intersection that fails to satisfy a specific rank condition established by Athanasiadis in [1]. In this paper, we present arithmetic criteria characterizing non-very generic intersections in discriminantal arrangements and we complete and correct a previous result by Libgober and the third author concerning rank-two intersections in such arrangements.</description>

      <title>Joint equidistributions of mesh patterns 123 and 132 with antipodal shadings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of joint equidistributions of mesh patterns 123 and 132 with the same symmetric shadings was recently initiated by Kitaev and Lv, where 75 of 80 potential joint equidistributions were proven. In this paper, we prove 112 out of 126 potential joint equidistributions of mesh patterns 123 and 132 with the same antipodal shadings. As a byproduct, we present 562 joint equidistribution results for non-symmetric and non-antipodal shadings. To achieve this, we construct bijections, find recurrence relations, and obtain generating functions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the joint distributions of several pairs of mesh patterns are related to the unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind.</description>

      <title>Prime graphical parking functions and strongly recurrent configurations of the Abelian sandpile model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the duality between two discrete dynamical processes: parking functions, and the Abelian sandpile model (ASM). Specifically, we are interested in the extension of classical parking functions, called $G$-parking functions, introduced by Postnikov and Shapiro in 2004. $G$-parking functions are in bijection with recurrent configurations of the ASM on $G$. In this work, we define a notion of prime $G$-parking functions. These are parking functions that are in a sense "indecomposable". Our notion extends the concept of primeness for classical parking functions, as well as the notion of prime $(p,q)$-parking functions introduced by Armon et al. in recent work. We show that from the ASM perspective, prime $G$-parking functions correspond to certain configurations of the ASM, which we call strongly recurrent. We study this new connection on a number of graph families, including wheel graphs, complete graphs, complete multi-partite graphs, and complete split graphs.</description>

      <title>An acyclic $d$-partition of the $r$-uniform complete hypergraph $K_{rd}^{(r)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a $d$-partition $\mathcal{E}_d^{(r)}=(\Omega_1^{(r,d)}, \Omega_2^{(r,d)},\dots, \Omega_d^{(r,d)})$ of the $r$-uniform complete hypergraph $K_{rd}^{(r)}$. We prove that $\mathcal{E}_d^{(r)}$ is homogeneous and that each hypergraph $\Omega_i^{(r,d)}$ is acyclic (i.e. has zero Betti numbers). As an application, we show that the map $det^{S^r}$ is nontrivial for every $r$, which gives a partial answer to a conjecture from [14].</description>

      <title>Relative discrepancy of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $k$-uniform hypergraphs $G$ and $H$ on $n$ vertices with densities $p$ and $q$, their relative discrepancy is defined as $\hbox{disc}(G,H)=\max\big||E(G')\cap E(H')|-pq\binom{n}{k}\big|$, where the maximum ranges over all pairs $G',H'$ with $G'\cong G$, $H'\cong H$, and $V(G')=V(H')$. Let $\hbox{bs}(k)$ denote the smallest integer $m \ge 2$ such that any collection of $m$ $k$-uniform hypergraphs on $n$ vertices with moderate densities contains a pair $G,H$ for which $\hbox{disc}(G,H) = \Omega(n^{(k+1)/2})$.
  In this paper, we answer several questions raised by Bollob\'as and Scott, providing both upper and lower bounds for $\hbox{bs}(k)$. Consequently, we determine the exact value of $\hbox{bs}(k)$ for $2\le k\le 13$, and show $\hbox{bs}(k)=O(k^{0.525})$, substantially improving the previous bound $\hbox{bs}(k)\le k+1$ due to Bollob\'as-Scott. The case $k=2$ recovers a result of Bollob\'as-Scott, which generalises classical theorems of Erd\H{o}s-Spencer, and Erd\H{o}s-Goldberg-Pach-Spencer. The case $k=3$ also follows from the results of Bollob\'as-Scott and Kwan-Sudakov-Tran. Our proof combines linear algebra, Fourier analysis, and extremal hypergraph theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f(n)$ denote the maximum sum of the side lengths of $n$ non-overlapping squares packed inside a unit square. We prove that $f(n^2+1) = n$ for all positive integers $n$ if and only if the sum $\sum_{k\geq 1}(f(k^2+1)-k)$ converges. We also show that if $f(k^2+1) = k$, for infinitely many positive integers then $f(k^2+1) = k$ for all positive integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a combinatorial characterization of the hyperplanes associated with non-singular hermitian varieties ${H}\left(s, q^2\right)$ in the projective space $\mathrm{PG}\left(s,q^2\right)$ where $s\geq3$ and $q&gt;2$. By analyzing the intersection numbers of hyperplanes with points and co-dimension $2$ subspaces, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a hyperplane to be part of the hermitian variety. This approach extends previous characterizations of hermitian varieties based on intersection properties, providing a purely combinatorial method for identifying their hyperplanes.</description>

      <title>MacMahon's Double Vision: Partition Diamonds Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plane partition diamonds were introduced by Andrews, Paule, and Riese (2001) as part of their study of MacMahon's $\Omega$-operator in search for integer partition identities. More recently, Dockery, Jameson, Sellers, and Wilson (2024) extended this concept to $d$-fold partition diamonds and found their generating function in a recursive form. We approach $d$-fold partition diamonds via Stanley's (1972) theory of $P$-partitions and give a closed formula for a bivariate generalization of the Dockery--Jameson--Sellers--Wilson generating function; its main ingredient is the Euler--Mahonian polynomial encoding descent statistics of permutations.</description>

      <title>Ordered set partition posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lattice of partitions of a set and its d-divisible generalization have been much studied for their combinatorial, topological, and respresentation-theoretic properties. An ordered set partition is a set partition where the subsets are listed in a specific order. Ordered set partitions appear in combinatorics, number theory, permutation polytopes, and the study of coinvariant algebras. The ordered set partitions of {1,...,n} can be partially ordered by refinement and then a unique minimal element attached, resulting in a lattice Omega_n. But this lattice has received no attention to our knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to provide the first comprehensive look at Omega_n. In particular, we determine its M\"obius function, show that it admits a recursive atom ordering, and study the action of the symmetric group S_n on associated homology groups, looking in particular at the multiplicity of the trivial representation. We also consider the related posets where every block has size either divisible by some fixed d at least 2, or congruent to 1 modulo d.</description>

      <title>The monomial expansions for modified Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover a family $A$ of sixteen statistics on fillings of any given Young diagram and prove new combinatorial formulas for the modified Macdonald polynomials, that is, $$\tilde{H}_{\lambda}(X;q,t)=\sum_{\sigma\in T(\lambda)}x^{\sigma}q^{maj(\sigma)}t^{\eta(\sigma)}$$ for each statistic $\eta\in A$. Building upon this new formula, we establish four compact formulas for the modified Macdonald polynomials, namely, $$\tilde{H}_{\lambda}(X;q,t)=\sum_{\sigma}d_{\varepsilon}(\sigma)x^{\sigma}q^{maj(\sigma)}t^{\eta(\sigma)}$$ which is summed over all canonical or dual canonical fillings of a Young diagram and $d_{\varepsilon}(\sigma)$ is a product of $t$-multinomials. Finally, the compact formulas enable us to derive four explicit expressions for the monomial expansion of modified Macdonald polynomials, one of which coincides with the formula given by Garbali and Wheeler (2019).</description>

      <title>Experimenting with Permutation Wordle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a game of permutation wordle in which a player attempts to guess a secret permutation of length $n$ in as few guesses as possible. In each round, the guessing player is told which indices of their guessed permutation are correct. How can we optimize the player's strategy? Samuel Kutin and Lawren Smithline (arXiv:2408.00903) propose a strategy called "cyclic shift" in which all incorrect entries are shifted one index to the right in successive guesses, and they conjecture its optimality. We investigate this conjecture by formalizing what a strategy looks like, performing experimental analysis on inductively constructed strategies, and examining the coefficients of an inductive strategy's generating function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the earliest results in extremal graph theory, Mantel's theorem, states that the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is $\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor$. We investigate how this extremal bound is affected when $G$ is additionally required to contain a prescribed graph $\mathbb{P}$ as a subgraph. We establish general upper and lower bounds for this problem, which are tight in the exponent for random triangle-free graphs and graphs generated by the triangle-free process, when the size of $\mathbb{P}$ lies within certain ranges.</description>

      <title>Steiner Systems over Mixed Alphabet and Related Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mixed Steiner system MS$(t,k,Q)$ is a set (code) $C$ of words of weight $k$ over an alphabet $Q$, where not all coordinates of a word have the same alphabet size, each word of weight $t$, over $Q$, has distance $k-t$ from exactly one codeword of $C$, and the minimum distance of the code $2(k-t)+1$. Mixed Steiner systems are constructed from perfect mixed codes, resolvable designs, large set, orthogonal arrays, and a new type of pairs-triples design. Necessary conditions for the existence of mixed Steiner systems are presented and it is proved that there are no large sets of these Steiner systems.</description>

      <title>Further generalization of central sets theorem for partial semigroups and vip systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Central Sets Theorem, a fundamental result in Ramsey theory, is a joint extension of both Hindman's theorem and van der Waerden's theorem. It was originally introduced by H. Furstenberg using methods from topological dynamics. Later, using the algebraic structure of the Stone-$\v{C}$ech compactification $\beta$ S of a semigroup S, N. Hindman and V. Bergelson extended the theorem in 1990. H. Shi and H. Yang established a topological dynamical characterization of central sets in an arbitrary semigroup (S,+), and showed it to be equivalent to the usual algebraic characterization. D. De, N. Hindman, and D. Strauss later proved a stronger version of the Central Sets Theorem for semigroups in 2008. D. Phulara further genaralized the result for commutative semigroups in 2015. Recently in his work, Zhang generalized it further and proved the central sets theorem for uncountably many central sets. We extend the theorem to arbitrary adequate partial semigroups and VIP systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A colored Gaussian graphical model is a linear concentration model in which equalities among the concentrations are specified by a coloring of an underlying graph. Marigliano and Davies conjectured that every linear binomial that appears in the vanishing ideal of an undirected colored cycle corresponds to a graph symmetry. We prove this conjecture for 3,5, and 7 cycles and disprove it for colored cycles of any other length. We construct the counterexamples by proving the fact that the determinant of the concentration matrices of two colored paths can be equal even when they are not identical or reflection of each other. We also explore the potential strengthening of the conjecture and prove a revised version of the conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zarankiewicz problem, a cornerstone problem in extremal graph theory, asks for the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph that does not contain the complete bipartite graph $K_{s,s}$. While the problem remains widely open in the case of general graphs, the past two decades have seen significant progress on this problem for various restricted graph classes -- particularly those arising from geometric settings -- leading to a deeper understanding of their structure.
  In this paper, we develop a new structural tool for addressing Zarankiewicz-type problems. More specifically, we show that for any positive integer $k$, every graph with average degree $d$ either contains an induced $C_4$-free subgraph with average degree at least $k$, or it contains a $d$-vertex subgraph with $\Omega_k(d^2)$ edges. As an application of this dichotomy, we propose a unified approach to a large number of Zarankiewicz-type problems in geometry, obtaining optimal bounds in each case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $\mathcal G = (\mathcal V, \mathcal E)$ is said to satisfy the Neighbour Sum Property if there exists some $f:\mathcal V\to\mathbb R$ such that $f\not\equiv 0$ and it maps every vertex to the sum of the values taken by its neighbours. In this article, we provide an algorithm to check whether a given finite tree satisfies the neighbour sum property. We also find a large class of trees on $n$ vertices that satisfy the property.</description>

      <title>Approximate Itai-Zehavi conjecture for random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A famous conjecture by Itai and Zehavi states that, for every $d$-vertex-connected graph $G$ and every vertex $r$ in $G$, there are $d$ spanning trees of $G$ such that, for every vertex $v$ in $G\setminus \{r\}$, the paths between $r$ and $v$ in different trees are internally vertex-disjoint. We show that with high probability the Itai-Zehavi conjecture holds asymptotically for the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$ when $np= \omega(\log n)$ and for random regular graphs $G(n,d)$ when $d= \omega(\log n)$. Moreover, we essentially confirm the conjecture up to a constant factor for sparser random regular graphs. This answers positively a question of Dragani\'{c} and Krivelevich. Our proof makes use of recent developments on sprinkling techniques in random regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Factorization norms and an inverse theorem for MaxCut</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that Boolean matrices with bounded $\gamma_2$-norm or bounded normalized trace norm must contain a linear-sized all-ones or all-zeros submatrix, verifying a conjecture of Hambardzumyan, Hatami, and Hatami. We also present further structural results about Boolean matrices of bounded $\gamma_2$-norm and discuss applications in communication complexity, operator theory, spectral graph theory, and extremal combinatorics.
  As a key application, we establish an inverse theorem for MaxCut. A celebrated result of Edwards states that every graph $G$ with $m$ edges has a cut of size at least $\frac{m}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{8m+1}-1}{8}$, with equality achieved by complete graphs with an odd number of vertices. To contrast this, we prove that if the MaxCut of $G$ is at most $\frac{m}{2}+O(\sqrt{m})$, then $G$ must contain a clique of size $\Omega(\sqrt{m})$.</description>

      <title>The 3-path-connectivity of the augmented cubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connectivity is a cornerstone concept in graph theory, essential for evaluating the robustness of networks against failures. To better capture fault tolerance in complex systems, researchers have extended classical connectivity notions, one such extension being the $k$-path-connectivity, $\pi_k(G)$, introduced by Hager. Given a connected simple graph $G = (V, E)$ and a subset $D \subseteq V$ with $|D| \geq 2$, a $D$-path is a path that includes all vertices in $D$. A collection of such paths is internally disjoint if they intersect only at the vertices of $D$ and share no edges. The maximum number of internally disjoint $D$-paths in $G$ is denoted $\pi_G(D)$, and the $k$-path-connectivity is defined as $\pi_k(G) = \min \{ \pi_G(D) \mid D \subseteq V(G),\ |D| = k\}$. In this paper, we investigate the 3-path-connectivity of the augmented cube $AQ_n$, a variant of the hypercube known for its enhanced symmetry and fault-tolerant structure. We establish the exact value of $\pi_3(AQ_n)$ and show that: $$
  \pi_3(AQ_n) =
  \begin{cases}
  \frac{3n}{2} - 2, &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is even},
  \frac{3(n - 1)}{2} - 1, &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is odd}.
  \end{cases}

      <title>On Link-irregular labelings of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of link-irregular labelings for graphs, extending the notion of link-irregular graphs through edge labeling with positive integers. A labeling is link-irregular if every vertex has a uniquely labeled subgraph induced by its neighbors. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such labelings and define the link-irregular labeling number $\eta(G)$ as the minimum number of distinct labels required. Our main results include necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of link-irregular labelings. We show that certain families of graphs, such as bipartite graphs, trees, cycles, hypercubes, and complete multipartite graphs, do not admit link-irregular labelings, while complete graphs and wheel graphs do. Specifically, we prove that $\eta(K_n) = 2$ for $n \geq 6$ and $\eta(K_n) = 3$ for $n \in \{3,4,5\}$. For wheel graphs $W_n$, we establish that $\eta(W_n) \approx \sqrt{2n}$ asymptotically. Finally, we prove that for every positive integer $n$, there exists a graph with a link-irregular labeling number exactly $n$, and provide several results on graph operations that preserve labeling numbers.</description>

      <title>Rises for Measuring Local Distributivity in Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributivity is a well-established and extensively studied notion in lattice theory. In the context of data analysis, particularly within Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), lattices are often observed to exhibit a high degree of distributivity. However, no standardized measure exists to quantify this property. In this paper, we introduce the notion of rises in (concept) lattices as a means to assess distributivity. Rises capture how the number of attributes or objects in covering concepts change within the concept lattice. We show that a lattice is distributive if and only if no non-unit rises occur. Furthermore, we relate rises to the classical notion of meet- and join distributivity. We observe that concept lattices from real-world data are to a high degree join-distributive, but much less meet-distributive. We additionally study how join-distributivity manifests on the level of ordered sets.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Learning and Compressing Monophonic Halfspaces in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstract notions of convexity over the vertices of a graph, and corresponding notions of halfspaces, have recently gained attention from the machine learning community. In this work we study monophonic halfspaces, a notion of graph halfspaces defined through closure under induced paths. Our main result is a $2$-satisfiability based decomposition theorem, which allows one to represent monophonic halfspaces as a disjoint union of certain vertex subsets. Using this decomposition, we achieve efficient and (nearly) optimal algorithms for various learning problems, such as teaching, active, and online learning. Most notably, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for empirical risk minimization. Independently of the decomposition theorem, we obtain an efficient, stable, and proper sample compression scheme. This makes monophonic halfspaces efficiently learnable with proper learners and linear error rate $1/\varepsilon$ in the realizable PAC setting. Our results answer open questions from the literature, and show a stark contrast with geodesic halfspaces, for which most of the said learning problems are NP-hard.</description>

      <title>A dichotomy law for certain classes of phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many classes of phylogenetic networks have been proposed in the literature. A feature of many of these classes is that if one restricts a network in the class to a subset of its leaves, then the resulting network may no longer lie within this class. This has implications for their biological applicability, since some species -- which are the leaves of an underlying evolutionary network -- may be missing (e.g., they may have become extinct, or there are no data available for them) or we may simply wish to focus attention on a subset of the species. On the other hand, certain classes of networks are `closed' when we restrict to subsets of leaves, such as (i) the classes of all phylogenetic networks or all phylogenetic trees; (ii) the classes of galled networks, simplicial networks, galled trees; and (iii) the classes of networks that have some parameter that is monotone-under-leaf-subsampling (e.g., the number of reticulations, height, etc) bounded by some fixed value. It is easily shown that a closed subclass of phylogenetic trees is either all trees or a vanishingly small proportion of them (as the number of leaves grows). In this short paper, we explore whether this dichotomy phenomenon holds for other classes of phylogenetic networks, and their subclasses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a combinatorial triangulation of an $n$-gon, we study (a) the space of all possible drawings in the plane such the edges are straight line segments and the boundary has a fixed shape, and (b) the algebraic variety of possibilities for the areas of the triangles in such drawings. We define a generalized notion of triangulation, and we show that the areas of the triangles in a generalized triangulation $\T$ of a square must satisfy a single irreducible homogeneous polynomial relation $p(\T)$ depending only on the combinatorics of $\T$. The invariant $p(\T)$ is called the \emph{Monsky polynomial}; it captures algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial information about $\T$. We give an algorithm that computes a lower bound on the degree of $p(\T)$, and we present several examples in which the algorithm is used to compute the degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ramanujan complexes were defined as high dimensional analogues of the optimal expanders, Ramanujan graphs. They were constructed as quotients of the Euclidean building (also called the affine building and the Bruhat-Tits building) of $\mathrm{PGL}_d(\mathbb{F}_p((y)))$ for any prime $p$ by Lubotzky-Samuels-Vishne. We distinguish the Ramanujan complexes up to large-scale geometry. More precisely, we show that if $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, then the associated Ramanujan complexes do not quasi-isometrically embed into one another. The main tools are the box space rigidity of Khukhro-Valette and the Euclidean building rigidity of Kleiner-Leeb and Fisher-Whyte.</description>

      <title>Simple Approximations for General Spanner Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a graph with n nodes and m edges, independent edge weights and lengths, and arbitrary distance demands for node pairs. The spanner problem asks for a minimum-weight subgraph that satisfies these demands via sufficiently short paths w.r.t. the edge lengths. For multiplicative alpha-spanners (where demands equal alpha times the original distances) and assuming that each edge's weight equals its length, the simple Greedy heuristic by Alth\"ofer et al. (1993) is known to yield strong solutions, both in theory and practice. To obtain guarantees in more general settings, recent approximations typically abandon this simplicity and practicality. Still, so far, there is no known non-trivial approximation algorithm for the spanner problem in its most general form. We provide two surprisingly simple approximations algorithms. In general, our Adapted Greedy achieves the first unconditional approximation ratio of m, which is non-trivial due to the independence of weights and lengths. Crucially, it maintains all size and weight guarantees Greedy is known for, i.e., in the aforementioned multiplicative alpha-spanner scenario and even for additive +beta-spanners. Further, it generalizes some of these size guarantees to derive new weight guarantees. Our second approach, Randomized Rounding, establishes a graph transformation that allows a simple rounding scheme over a standard multicommodity flow LP. It yields an O(n log n)-approximation, assuming integer lengths and polynomially bounded distance demands. The only other known approximation guarantee in this general setting requires several complex subalgorithms and analyses, yet we match it up to a factor of O(n^{1/5-eps}) using standard tools. Further, on bounded-degree graphs, we yield the first O(log n) approximation ratio for constant-bounded distance demands (beyond multiplicative 2-spanners in unit-length graphs).</description>

      <title>A Graph Width Perspective on Partially Ordered Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles I: Treewidth, Pathwidth, and Grid Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path or a Hamiltonian cycle with precedence constraints in the form of a partial order on the vertex set. We show that the path problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete for graphs of pathwidth 4 while the cycle problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete on graphs of pathwidth 5. We complement these results by giving polynomial-time algorithms for graphs of pathwidth 3 and treewidth 2 for Hamiltonian paths as well as pathwidth 4 and treewidth 3 for Hamiltonian cycles. Furthermore, we study the complexity of the path and cycle problems on rectangular grid graphs of bounded height. For these, we show that the path and cycle problems are $\mathsf{NP}$-complete when the height of the grid is greater or equal to 7 and 9, respectively. In the variant where we look for minimum edge-weighted Hamiltonian paths and cycles, the problems are $\mathsf{NP}$-hard for heights 5 and 6, respectively.</description>

      <title>Canonical partial ordering from min-cuts and quantum entanglement in random tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \emph{max-flow min-cut theorem} has been recently used in the theory of random tensor networks in quantum information theory, where it is helpful for computing the behavior of important physical quantities, such as the entanglement entropy. In this paper, we extend the max-flow min-cut theorem to a relation among different \emph{partial orders} on the set of vertices of a network and introduce a new partial order for the vertices based on the \emph{min-cut structure} of the network. We apply the extended max-flow min-cut theorem to random tensor networks and find that the \emph{finite correction} to the entanglement R\'enyi entropy arising from the degeneracy of the min-cuts is given by the number of \emph{order morphisms} from the min-cut partial order to the partial order induced by non-crossing partitions on the symmetric group. Moreover, we show that the number of order morphisms corresponds to moments of a graph-dependent measure which generalizes the free Bessel law in some special cases in free probability theory.</description>

      <title>The Gr\"obner basis for powers of a general linear form in a monomial complete intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study almost complete intersection ideals in a polynomial ring, generated by powers of all the variables together with a power of their sum. Our main result is an explicit description of the reduced Gr\"obner bases for these ideals under any term order. Our approach is primarily combinatorial, focusing on the structure of the initial ideal. We associate a lattice path to each monomial in the vector space basis of an Artinian monomial complete intersection and introduce a reflection operation on these paths, which enables a key counting argument. As a consequence, we provide a new proof that Artinian monomial complete intersections possess the strong Lefschetz property over fields of characteristic zero. Our results also offer new insights into the longstanding problem of classifying the weak Lefschetz property for such intersections in characteristic $p$. Furthermore, we show that the number of Gr\"obner basis elements in each degree is connected to several well-known sequences, including the (generalized) Catalan, Motzkin, and Riordan numbers, and connect these numbers to the study of entanglement detection in spin systems within quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Translating between the representations of an acyclic convex geometry of bounded degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of enumerating the irreducible closed sets of a closure system given by an implicational base. In the context of Horn logic, these correspond to Horn expressions and characteristic models, respectively. To date, the complexity status of this problem is widely open, and it is further known to generalize the notorious hypergraph dualization problem, even in the context of acyclic convex geometries, i.e., closure systems admitting an acyclic implicational base. This paper studies this later class with a focus on the degree, which corresponds to the maximal number of implications in which an element occurs. We show that the problem is tractable for bounded values of this parameter, even when relaxed to the notions of premise- and conclusion-degree. Our algorithms rely on structural properties of acyclic convex geometries and involve various techniques from algorithmic enumeration such as solution graph traversal, saturation techniques, and a sequential approach leveraging from acyclicity. They are shown to perform in incremental-polynomial time for the computation of irreducible closed sets, and in polynomial time for the construction of an implicational base. Finally, we argue that our running times cannot be improved to polynomial delay using the standard framework of flashlight search.</description>

      <title>Hypergraphs with a quarter uniform Tur\'an density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11749v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uniform Tur\'an density $\pi_{1}(F)$ of a $3$-uniform hypergraph $F$ is the supremum over all $d$ for which there is an $F$-free hypergraph with the property that every linearly sized subhypergraph with density at least $d$. Determining $\pi_{1}(F)$ for given hypergraphs $F$ was suggested by Erd\H{o}s and S\'os in 1980s. In particular, they raised the questions of determining $\pi_{1}(K_4^{(3)-})$ and $\pi_{1}(K_4^{(3)})$. The former question was solved recently in [Israel J. Math. 211 (2016), 349-366] and [J. Eur. Math. Soc. 20 (2018), 1139-1159], while the latter is still a major open problem. In addition to $K_4^{(3)-}$, there are very few hypergraphs whose uniform Tur\'an density has been determined.
  In this paper, we give a sufficient condition for $3$-uniform hypergraphs $F$ satisfying $\pi_{1}(F)=1/4$. In particular, currently all known $3$-uniform hypergraphs whose uniform Tur\'an density is $1/4$, such as $K_4^{(3)-}$ and the $3$-uniform hypergraphs $F^{\star}_5$ studied in [arXiv:2211.12747], satisfy this condition. Moreover, we find some intriguing $3$-uniform hypergraphs whose uniform Tur\'an density is also $1/4$.</description>

      <title>Decomposing random regular graphs into stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $k$-star decompositions, that is, partitions of the edge set into disjoint stars with $k$ edges, in the uniformly random $d$-regular graph model $\mathcal{G}_{n,d}$. Using the small subgraph conditioning method, we prove an existence result for such decompositions for all $d,k$ such that $d/2 &lt; k \leq d/2 + \max\{1,\frac{1}{6}\log d\}$. More generally, we give a sufficient existence condition that can be checked numerically for any given values of $d$ and $k$. Complementary negative results are obtained using the independence ratio of random regular graphs. Our results establish an existence threshold for $k$-star decompositions in $\mathcal{G}_{n,d}$ for all $d\leq 100$ and $k &gt; d/2$.
  For smaller values of $k$, the connection between $k$-star decompositions and $\beta$-orientations allows us to apply results of Thomassen (2012) and Lov\'asz, Thomassen, Wu and Zhang (2013). We prove that random $d$-regular graphs satisfy their assumptions with high probability, thus establishing a.a.s. existence of $k$-star decompositions (i) when $2k^2+k\leq d$, and (ii) when $k$ is odd and $k &lt; d/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local $h$-polynomial was introduced by Stanley as a fundamental enumerative invariant of a triangulation $\Delta$ of a simplex. This polynomial is known to have nonnegative and symmetric coefficients and is conjectured to be $\gamma$-positive when $\Delta$ is flag. This paper shows that the local $h$-polynomial has the stronger property of being real-rooted when $\Delta$ is the barycentric subdivision of an arbitrary geometric triangulation $\Gamma$ of the simplex. An analogous result for edgewise subdivisions is proven. The proofs are based on a new combinatorial formula for the local $h$-polynomial of $\Delta$, which is valid when $\Delta$ is any uniform triangulation of $\Gamma$. A combinatorial interpretation of the local $h$-polynomial of the second barycentric subdivision of the simplex is deduced.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ nodes with algebraic connectivity $\lambda_{2}$. The eccentricity of a node is defined as the length of a longest shortest path starting at that node. If $s_\ell$ denotes the number of nodes of eccentricity at most $\ell$, then for $\ell \ge 2$, $$\lambda_{2} \ge \frac{ 4 \, s_\ell }{ (\ell-2+\frac{4}{n}) \, n^2 }.$$ As a corollary, if $d$ denotes the diameter of $G$, then $$\lambda_{2} \ge \frac{ 4 }{ (d-2+\frac{4}{n}) \, n }.$$ It is also shown that $$\lambda_{2} \ge \frac{ s_\ell }{ 1+ \ell \left(e(G^{\ell})-m\right) },$$ where $m$ and $e(G^\ell)$ denote the number of edges in $G$ and in the $\ell$-th power of $ G $, respectively.</description>

      <title>Kernel Partition Regularity Beyond Linearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05542v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A matrix $A$ is called kernel partition regular if, for every finite coloring of the natural numbers $ \mathbb{N} $, there exists a monochromatic solution to the equation $ A\vec{X} = 0 $. In $1933$, Rado characterized such matrices by showing that a matrix is kernel partition regular if and only if it satisfies the so-called column condition. In this article, we investigate polynomial extensions of Rado's theorem. We exhibit several nonlinear systems of equations that are kernel partition regular and demonstrate that satisfying the column condition continues to ensure kernel partition regularity even when the system is augmented with a polynomial term.</description>

      <title>The first Steklov eigenvalue of planar graphs and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08301v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Steklov eigenvalue problem was introduced over a century ago, and its discrete form attracted interest recently. Let $D$ and $\delta \Omega$ be the maximum vertex degree and the set of vertices of degree one in a graph $\mathcal{G}$ respectively. Let $\lambda_2$ be the first (non-trivial) Steklov eigenvalue of $(\mathcal{G}, \delta \Omega)$. In this paper, using the circle packing theorem and conformal mapping, we first show that $\lambda_2 \leq 8D / |\delta \Omega|$ for planar graphs. This can be seen as a discrete analogue of Kokarev's bound, that is, $\lambda_2 &lt; 8\pi / |\partial \Omega|$ for compact surfaces with boundary of genus $0$. Let $B$ and $L$ be the maximum block size and the diameter of a block graph $\mathcal{G}$ respectively. Secondly, we prove that $\lambda_2 \leq 4 (B-1) (D-1)/ |\delta \Omega|$ and $\lambda_2 \leq B/L$ for block graphs, which extend the results on trees by He and Hua. In the end, for trees with fixed leaf number and maximum degree, candidates that achieve the maximum first Steklov eigenvalue are given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A much-studied problem posed by Motzkin asks to determine, given a finite set $D$ of integers, the so-called Motzkin density for $D$, i.e., the supremum of upper densities of sets of integers whose difference set avoids $D$. We study the natural analogue of this problem in compact abelian groups. Using ergodic-theoretic tools, this is shown to be equivalent to the following discrete problem: given a lattice $\Lambda\subset \mathbb{Z}^r$, letting $D$ be the image in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$ of the standard basis, determine the Motzkin density for $D$ in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$. We study in particular the periodicity question: is there a periodic $D$-avoiding set of maximal density in $\mathbb{Z}^r/\Lambda$? The Greenfeld--Tao counterexample to the periodic tiling conjecture implies that the answer can be negative. On the other hand, we prove that the answer is positive in several cases, including the case rank$(\Lambda)=1$ (in which we give a formula for the Motzkin density), the case rank$(\Lambda)=r-1$, and hence also the case $r\leq 3$. It follows that, for up to three missing differences, the Motzkin density in a compact abelian group is always a rational number.</description>

Abstract: An \textit{$(n,m)$-graph} $G$ is a graph having both arcs and edges, and its arcs (resp., edges) are labeled using one of the $n$ (resp., $m$) different symbols. An \textit{$(n,m)$-complete graph} $G$ is an $(n,m)$-graph without loops or multiple edges in its underlying graph such that identifying any pair of vertices results in a loop or parallel adjacencies with distinct labels. We show that a planar $(n,m)$-complete graph cannot have more than $3(2n+m)^2+(2n+m)+1$ vertices, for all $(n,m) \neq (0,1)$ and that the bound is tight. This positively settles a conjecture by Bensmail \textit{et al.}~[Graphs and Combinatorics 2017].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study combinatorial properties of plateaued functions $F \colon \mathbb{F}_p^n \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p^m$. All quadratic functions, bent functions and most known APN functions are plateaued, so many cryptographic primitives rely on plateaued functions as building blocks. The main focus of our study is the interplay of the Walsh transform and linearity of a plateaued function, its differential properties, and their value distributions, i.e., the sizes of image and preimage sets. In particular, we study the special case of ''almost balanced'' plateaued functions, which only have two nonzero preimage set sizes, generalizing for instance all monomial functions. We achieve several direct connections and (non)existence conditions for these functions, showing for instance that plateaued $d$-to-$1$ functions (and thus plateaued monomials) only exist for a very select choice of $d$, and we derive for all these functions their linearity as well as bounds on their differential uniformity. We also specifically study the Walsh transform of plateaued APN functions and their relation to their value distribution.</description>

Abstract: Liu and Ma [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2018] conjectured that every $2$-connected non-bipartite graph with minimum degree at least $k+1$ contains $\lceil k/2\rceil $ cycles with consecutive odd lengths. In particular, they showed that this conjecture holds when $k$ is even. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture for any $k\in \mathbb N$. Moreover, we also improve some previous results about cycles of consecutive lengths.</description>

Abstract: We study the maximal Steklov eigenvalues of trees with given number of boundary vertices and total number of vertices. Trees can be regarded as discrete analogue of Hadamard manifolds, namely simply-connected Riemannian manifolds of non-positive sectional curvature. Let $\sigma_{k,\text{max}}(b, n)$ be the maximal of $k$-th Steklov eigenvalue of trees with $b$ leaves as boundary and $n$ vertices. We determine that $$ \sigma_{2, \text{max}} (b, n) = \begin{cases}
  \frac{2}{n-1}, &amp; b=2, n\geq 3,

  \frac{1}{r+1-\frac{1}{b}}, &amp; b \geq 3, n = br + 2, r \in \mathbb{Z}_+, \end{cases} $$ and we characterize the trees attaining this bound. For $k \geq 3$, we show that $\sigma_{k, \text{max}} (b, n) = 1$. We also give a lower bound on the maximal Steklov eigenvalues of trees with given diameter and total number of vertices. Our work can be regarded as a completion of the work by He--Hua [Upper bounds for the Steklov eigenvalues on trees, Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations (2022)] and Yu--Yu [Monotonicity of Steklov eigenvalues on graphs and applications, Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations (2024)].</description>

      <title>The Gamma-Theta Conjecture holds for planar graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gamma-Theta Conjecture states that if the domination number of a graph is equal to its eternal domination number, then it is also equal to its clique covering number. This conjecture is known to be true for several graph classes, such as outerplanar graphs, subcubic graphs and $C_k$-free graphs, where $k \in \{3,4\}$. In this paper, we prove the Conjecture for the class of planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of (3, 6)-Fullerenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A (3, 6)-fullerene is a cubic planar graph whose faces all have 3 or 6 sides. We give an exact count of the number of (3, 6)-fullerenes for any given number of vertices. We also enumerate (3,6)-fullerenes with mirror symmetry, with 3-fold rotational symmetry, and with both types of symmetry. The counts are given in terms of the prime factorization of the number of vertices, by considering solutions to the quadratic equation $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ modulo the primes in this prime factorization.</description>

Abstract: We show that the shatter function of a semilinear set system on $\mathbb{R}^m$ is asymptotic to a polynomial. This confirms, for the structure $(\mathbb{R}; +, &lt;)$, a conjecture of Chernikov and is a step towards characterizing model-theoretic linearity via shatter functions.</description>

Abstract: The codegree Tur\'an density $\gamma(F)$ of a $k$-graph $F$ is the smallest $\gamma\in[0,1)$ such that every $k$-graph $H$ with $\delta_{k-1}(H)\geq(\gamma+o(1))\vert V(H)\vert$ contains a copy of $F$.

      <description>arXiv:2503.03487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph H and a positive integer n, the planar Turan number of H, denoted by exp(n, H), is the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex H-free planar graph.D.Ghosh, et al.initiated the topic of double stars S_(k,l). Recently Xu et al.[AIMS Mathematics, 2025, 10(1): 1628-1644.] mentioned that exp(n, S_(3,5)) is still unknown.In this paper, we first establish that the planar Turan number S_(3,5) satisfies exp(n, S_(3,5)) &lt;= 23n/8 - 9/2 for all n &gt;= 2. The upper bound is tight for n = 12.</description>

      <title>Extremal Trees With Prescribed Burning Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph burning is motivated by the spread of social influence, and the burning number measures the speed of the spread. Given that the smallest burning number among the spanning trees of a graph determines the burning number of a connected graph, trees are the main objects of investigation in graph burning. Given a prescribed burning number, our study focuses on identifying the corresponding extremal trees with respect to order up to graph homeomorphism. In this work, we propose the concept of admissible sequences over a homeomorphically irreducible tree in addition to developing a general framework. We then determine whether an admissible sequence induces an extremal tree with a specified burning number. Additionally, we obtain some results on the smallest attainable diameter for extremal $n$-spiders with a prescribed burning number.</description>

      <title>Lie-operads and operadic modules from poset cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As observed by Joyal, the cohomology groups of the partition posets are naturally identified with the components of the operad encoding Lie algebras. This connection was explained in terms of operadic Koszul duality by Fresse, and later generalized by Vallette to the setting of decorated partitions. In this article, we set up and study a general formalism which produces a priori operadic structures (operads and operadic modules) on the cohomology of families of posets equipped with some natural recursive structure, that we call "operadic poset species". This framework goes beyond decorated partitions and operadic Koszul duality, and contains the metabelian Lie operad and Kontsevich's operad of trees as two simple instances. In forthcoming work, we will apply our results to the hypertree posets and their connections to post-Lie and pre-Lie algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices, independence number $\alpha(G)$, Lov\'asz theta function $\vartheta(G)$, and Shannon capacity $\Theta(G)$. We define $n_{\ge0}(G)$ to be the minimum number of non-negative eigenvalues taken over all Hermitian weighted adjacency matrices of $G$. It is well known that $\alpha(G) \le \Theta(G) \le \vartheta(G)$ and $\alpha(G) \le n_{\ge0}(G)$.
  Continuing a long line of work, we investigate the relationships between $ \alpha(G) $, $ \vartheta(G) $, $\Theta(G)$, and $ n_{\ge 0}(G) $. We prove a conjecture of Kwan and Wigderson, showing that for every integer $k$, there exists a graph $G$ with $\alpha(G) \leq 2$ and $n_{\ge 0}(G) \ge k$. In addition, we prove that for every integer $k$, there exists a graph $G$ with $\Theta(G) \leq 3$ and $n_{\ge 0}(G) \ge k$. Both results rely on a new observation: if the complement of $G$ contains a good spectral expander, then $n_{\geq 0}(G)$ must be large. We also show that $\vartheta(G)$ can be exponentially larger than $n_{\ge 0}(G)$, improving a recent result of Ihringer.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Sets for Proving Bounds on Rado Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a linear equation $\cal E$ of the form $ax + by = cz$ where $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive integers, the $k$-colour Rado number $R_k({\cal E})$ is the smallest positive integer $n$, if it exists, such that every $k$-colouring of the positive integers $\{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}$ contains a monochromatic solution to $\cal E$. In this paper, we consider $k = 3$ and the linear equations $ax + by = bz$ and $ax + ay = bz$. Using SAT solvers, we compute a number of previously unknown Rado numbers corresponding to these equations. We prove new general bounds on Rado numbers inspired by the satisfying assignments discovered by the SAT solver. Our proofs require extensive case-based analyses that are difficult to check for correctness by hand, so we automate checking the correctness of our proofs via an approach which makes use of a new tool we developed with support for operations on symbolically-defined sets -- e.g., unions or intersections of sets of the form $\{f(1), f(2), \dotsc, f(a)\}$ where $a$ is a symbolic variable and $f$ is a function possibly dependent on $a$. No computer algebra system that we are aware of currently has sufficiently capable support for symbolic sets, leading us to develop a tool supporting symbolic sets using the Python symbolic computation library SymPy coupled with the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver Z3.</description>

Using these transformations, we obtain some sharp bounds on the average Steiner $(k,l)$-eccentricity for trees with some certain conditions, including given nodes, given diameter, given max degree and given leaves, and get the corresponding extremal trees as well.</description>

      <title>Counting edges of different types in a local graph of a Grassmann graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ denote a finite field with $q$ elements. Let $n,k$ denote integers with $n&gt;2k\geq 6$. Let $V$ denote a vector space over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ that has dimension $n$. The vertex set of the Grassmann graph $J_q(n,k)$ consists of the $k$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. Two vertices of $J_q(n,k)$ are adjacent whenever their intersection has dimension $k-1$. Let $\partial$ denote the path-length distance function of $J_q(n,k)$. Pick vertices $x,y$ of $J_q(n,k)$ such that $1&lt;\partial(x,y)&lt;k$. Let $\Gamma(x)$ denote the local graph of $x$ in $J_q(n,k)$. In this paper we define three types of edges in $\Gamma(x)$, namely type $0$, type $+$, and type $-$; for adjacent $w,z\in \Gamma(x)$ such that $\partial(w,y)=\partial(z,y)$, the type of the edge $wz$ depends on the subspaces $w+z,w,z,w\cap z$ and their intersections with $y$. Our general goal is to count the number of edges in $\Gamma(x)$ for each type. Consider a two-vertex stabilizer $\text{Stab}(x,y)$ in $GL(V)$; it is known that the $\text{Stab}(x,y)$-action on $\Gamma(x)$ has five orbits. Pick two orbits $\mathcal{O},\mathcal{N}$ that are not necessarily distinct; for a given $w\in \mathcal{O}$, we find the number of vertices in $z\in \mathcal{N}$ such that the edge $wz$ has (i) type $0$, (ii) type $+$, (iii) type $-$. To find these numbers, we make heavy use of a subalgebra $\mathcal{H}$ of $\text{Mat}_{P}(\mathbb{C})$; the algebra $\mathcal{H}$ contains matrices that are closely related to the five orbits of the $\text{Stab}(x,y)$-action on $\Gamma(x)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07347v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining the minimal genus of a simple finite connected graph. We present an algorithm which, for an arbitrary graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, determines the orientable genus of $G$ in $O(n(4^m/n)^{n/t})$ steps where $t$ is the girth of $G$. This algorithm avoids difficulties that many other genus algorithms have with handling bridge placements which is a well-known issue. The algorithm has a number of useful properties for practical use: it is simple to implement, it outputs the faces of an optimal embedding, and it iteratively narrows both upper and lower bounds. We illustrate the algorithm by determining the genus of the $(3,12)$ cage (which is 17); other graphs are also considered.</description>

Abstract: A toric amplitude is a rational function associated to a simplicial polyhedral fan. The definition is inspired by scattering amplitudes in particle physics. We prove algebraic properties of such amplitudes and study the geometry of their zero loci. These hypersurfaces play the role of Warren's adjoint via a dual volume interpretation. We investigate their Fano schemes and singular loci via the nef cone and toric irrelevant ideal of the fan.</description>

Abstract: For any two partitions $\lambda$ and $\mu$ of a positive integer $N$, let $\chi_{\lambda}(\mu)$ be the value of the irreducible character of the symmetric group $S_{N}$ associated with $\lambda$, evaluated at the conjugacy class of elements whose cycle type is determined by $\mu$. Let $Z(N)$ be the number of zeros in the character table of $S_N$, and $Z_{t}(N)$ be defined as
  $$
  Z_{t}(N):= \#\{(\lambda,\mu): \chi_{\lambda}(\mu) = 0 \; \text{with $\lambda$ a $t$-core}\}.
  $$
  We establish the bound
  $$
  Z(N) \geq \frac{2p(N)^{2}}{1.01e \log N} \left(1+O\left(\frac{1}{\log N}\right)\right)
  $$
  where $p(N)$ denotes the number of partitions of $N$. Also, we give lower bounds for $Z_t(N)$ in different ranges of $t$.</description>

Abstract: When regularity lemmas were first developed in the 1970s, they were described as results that promise a partition of any graph into a ``small'' number of parts, such that the graph looks ``similar'' to a random graph on its edge subsets going between parts. Regularity lemmas have been repeatedly refined and reinterpreted in the years since, and the modern perspective is that they can instead be seen as purely linear-algebraic results about sketching a large, complicated matrix with a smaller, simpler one. These matrix sketches then have a nice interpretation about partitions when applied to the adjacency matrix of a graph.
  In these notes we will develop regularity lemmas from scratch, under the linear-algebraic perspective, and then use the linear-algebraic versions to derive the familiar graph versions. We do not assume any prior knowledge of regularity lemmas, and we recap the relevant linear-algebraic definitions as we go, but some comfort with linear algebra will definitely be helpful to read these notes.</description>

Abstract: A Condorcet winning set addresses the Condorcet paradox by selecting a few candidates--rather than a single winner--such that no unselected alternative is preferred to all of them by a majority of voters. This idea extends to $\alpha$-undominated sets, which ensure the same property for any $\alpha$-fraction of voters and are guaranteed to exist in constant size for any $\alpha$. However, the requirement that an outsider be preferred to every member of the set can be overly restrictive and difficult to justify in many applications. Motivated by this, we introduce a more flexible notion: $(t, \alpha)$-undominated sets. Here, each voter compares an outsider to their $t$-th most preferred member of the set, and the set is undominated if no outsider is preferred by more than an $\alpha$-fraction of voters. This framework subsumes prior definitions, recovering Condorcet winning sets when $(t = 1, \alpha = 1/2)$ and $\alpha$-undominated sets when $t = 1$, and introduces a new, tunable notion of collective acceptability for $t &gt; 1$. We establish three main results:
  1. We prove that a $(t, \alpha)$-undominated set of size $O(t/\alpha)$ exists for all values of $t$ and $\alpha$.
  2. We show that as $t$ becomes large, the minimum size of such a set approaches $t/\alpha$, which is asymptotically optimal.
  3. In the special case $t = 1$, we improve the bound on the size of an $\alpha$-undominated set given by Charikar, Lassota, Ramakrishnan, Vetta, and Wang (STOC 2025). As a consequence, we show that a Condorcet winning set of five candidates exists, improving their bound of six.</description>
