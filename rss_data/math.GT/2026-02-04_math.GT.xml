      <title>Grid Diagrams of Fibered Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid diagrams are special representations of knots in the three-sphere that are used to define a combinatorial version of knot Floer homology. Paolo Ghiggini and Yi Ni showed that knot Floer homology detects fibered knots. Their results imply, in particular, that grid diagrams with a unique grid state whose Alexander grading is maximal only exist for fibered knots. Whether every fibered knot admits such a diagram remains an open question. Here, we investigate the existence of such special grid diagrams for fibered knots. We develop an efficient method for deciding whether a given grid diagram meets the even stricter condition of having a unique grid state that realizes an upper bound for the Alexander function. By implementing this method in a Python package, we find suitable grid diagrams for 5385 of the 5397 fibered prime knots with crossing number at most 13.</description>

      <title>Obstruction theory and the complexity of counting group homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix a finite group $G$. We study the computational complexity of counting problems of the following flavor: given a group $\Gamma$, count the number of homomorphisms $\Gamma \to G$. Our first result establishes that this problem is $\#\mathsf{P}$-hard whenever $G$ is a non-abelian group and $\Gamma$ is provided via a finite presentation. We give several improvements showing that this hardness conclusion continues to hold for restricted $\Gamma$ satisfying various promises. Our second result, in contrast, shows that if $G$ is class 2 nilpotent and $\Gamma = \pi_1(M^3)$ for some input 3-manifold triangulation $M^3$, then there is a polynomial time algorithm. The difference in complexity is explained by the fact that 3-manifolds are close enough to being Eilenberg-MacLane spaces for us to be able to solve the necessary group cohomological obstruction problems efficiently using the given triangulation. A similar polynomial time algorithm for counting maps to finite, class 2 nilpotent $G$ exists when $\Gamma$ is itself a finite group encoded via a multiplication table.</description>

      <title>Parity of $k$-differentials in genus zero and one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we completely determine the spin parity of $k$-differentials with prescribed zero and pole orders on Riemann surfaces of genus zero and one. This result was previously obtained conditionally by the first author and Quentin Gendron assuming the truth of a number-theoretic hypothesis Conjecture A.10. We prove this hypothesis by reformulating it in terms of Jacobi symbols, reducing the proof to a combinatorial identity and standard facts about Jacobi symbols. The proof was obtained by AxiomProver and the system formalized the proof of the combinatorial identity in Lean/Mathlib (see the Appendix).</description>

      <title>Lefschetz fibrations on the Milnor fibers of cusp and simple elliptic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.00749v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the total space of the Milnor fibration associated with any cusp or simple elliptic singularity in complex three variables admits an $S^1$-parametric genus-one Lefschetz fibration structure over the $2$-disk. As a consequence, we demonstrate that the Lawson type foliations on $S^5$ associated with such singularities can be regarded as the pullback of the Reeb foliation on $S^3$. This enables us to provide an alternative proof of a previous result by the third author, which states that every Lawson type foliation admits a leafwise symplectic structure. Also we see that a pair of such Milnor fibers can be glued together along boundary into a closed oriented 4-manifold exactly when the pair corresponds to one of the ten extended strange duality pairs among the cusp singularities. This gluing is compatible with the Lefschetz fibrations and the resultant 4-manifold is diffeomrphic to a K3 surface.</description>

      <title>Link groups of Kishino knot stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any virtual link, a class of new links can be defined called stacks, in which copies of the virtual link are placed on top of one another. The resulting virtual link depends only on the virtual isotopy class of the original link, and the fundamental group of such a link may be used to detect whether the link is nontrivial and whether it is nonclassical in some cases. We show that the groups constructed using this method are sufficient to distinguish all the Kishino knots from the unknot and from one another, as well as calculating their Jones polynomials.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy slopes, boundary slopes and exceptional surgery slopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an upper bound on the distance between a degeneracy slope for a very full essential lamination and a boundary slope of an essential surface embedded in a compact, orientable, irreducible, atoroidal 3-manifold with incompressible torus boundary. There are three applications: (i) We show that a degeneracy slope for a very full essential lamination in the exterior of a prime alternating knot is meridional. This gives an affirmative answer to part of a conjecture posed by Gabai and Kazez. (ii) We obtain two bounds on boundary slopes for a hyperbolic knot in an integral homology sphere, at least one of which always holds: one concerning the denominators of boundary slopes, and the other concerning the differences between boundary slopes. This generalizes a result on Montesinos knots obtained by the author and Mizushima. (iii) We obtain two bounds on exceptional surgery slopes for a hyperbolic knot in an integral homology sphere, at least one of which always holds: one concerning the denominators of such slopes, and the other concerning their range in terms of the genera of the knots. Both are actually conjectured by Gordon and Teragaito to always hold for hyperbolic knots in the 3-sphere.</description>

      <title>On compactifications of the SL(2,C) character varieties of punctured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses some conjectures and questions regarding the absolute and relative compactifications of the $\SL(2,\C)$-character variety of an $n$-punctured Riemann surface without boundary. We study a class of projective compactifications determined by ideal triangulations of the surface and prove explicit results concerning the boundary divisors of these compactifications. Notably, we establish that the boundary divisors are toric varieties and confirm a well-known conjecture asserting that the (dual) boundary complex of any (positive dimensional) relative character variety is a sphere. In a different vein, we enhance and streamline Komyo's compactification method, which utilizes a projective compactification of $\SL(2,\C)$ to compactify the (relative) character varieties. Specifically, we construct a uniform relative compactification over the base space of $\C^n$ and determine its monodromy, addressing a question posed by Simpson.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give criteria for a graph of groups to have finite stature with respect to its collection of vertex groups, in the sense of Huang-Wise. We apply it to the triangle Artin groups that were previously shown to split as a graph of groups. This allows us to deduce residual finiteness, and expands the list of Artin groups known to be residually finite.</description>

      <title>Topological normal generation of big mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A topological group $G$ is topologically normally generated if there exists $g \in G$ such that the normal closure of $g$ is dense in $G$. Let $S$ be a tame, infinite type surface whose mapping class group $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ is generated by a coarsely bounded set (CB generated). We prove that if the end space of $S$ is countable, then $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ is topologically normally generated if and only if $S$ is uniquely self-similar. Moreover, when the end space of $S$ is uncountable, we provide a sufficient condition under which $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ is topologically normally generated. As a consequence, we construct uncountably many examples of surfaces that are not telescoping yet have topologically normally generated mapping class groups. Additionally, we establish the semidirect product structure of $\mathrm{FMap}(S)$, the subgroup of $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ that pointwisely fixes all maximal ends that each is isolated in the set of maximal ends of $S$. This result leads to a proof that the minimum number of topological normal generators of $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ is bounded both above and below by constants that depend only on the topology of $S$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the upper bound grows quadratically with respect to this constant.</description>

      <title>Period matrices and homological quasi-trees on discrete Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study discrete period matrices associated with graphs cellularly embedded on closed surfaces, resembling classical period matrices of Riemann surfaces. Defined via integrals of discrete harmonic 1-forms, these period matrices are known to encode discrete conformal structure in the sense of circle patterns. We obtain a combinatorial interpretation of the discrete period matrix, where its minors are expressed as weighted sums over certain spanning subgraphs, which we call homological quasi-trees. Furthermore, we relate the period matrix to the determinant of the Laplacian for a flat complex line bundle. We derive a combinatorial analogue of the Weil-Petersson potential on the Teichm\"uller space, expressed as a weighted sum over homological quasi-trees. Finally, we study the collection of homological quasi-trees from a (delta-)matroidal perspective. The discrete period matrix plays a role similar to that of the response matrix in circular planar networks, thereby addressing a question posed by Richard Kenyon.</description>
