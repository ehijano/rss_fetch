      <title>The local limit theorem for complex valued sequences: the parabolic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a complete expansion, at any accuracy order, for the iterated convolution of a complex valued integrable sequence in one space dimension. The remainders are estimated sharply with generalized Gaussian bounds. The result applies in probability theory for random walks as well as in numerical analysis for studying the large time behavior of numerical schemes.</description>

      <title>Commutator-free Cayley methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential equations posed on quadratic matrix Lie groups arise in the context of classical mechanics and quantum dynamical systems. Lie group numerical integrators preserve the constants of motions defining the Lie group. Thus, they respect important physical laws of the dynamical system, such as unitarity and energy conservation in the context of quantum dynamical systems, for instance. In this article we develop a high-order commutator free Lie group integrator for non-autonomous differential equations evolving on quadratic Lie groups. Instead of matrix exponentials, which are expensive to evaluate and need to be approximated by appropriate rational functions in order to preserve the Lie group structure, the proposed method is obtained as a composition of Cayley transforms which naturally respect the structure of quadratic Lie groups while being computationally efficient to evaluate. Unlike Cayley-Magnus methods the method is also free from nested matrix commutators.</description>

      <title>Optimal order time discretizations for stochastic semilinear wave equations with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with developing and analyzing two novel implicit temporal discretization methods for the stochastic semilinear wave equations with multiplicative noise. The proposed methods are natural extensions of well-known time-discrete schemes for deterministic wave equations, hence, they are easy to implement. It is proved that both methods are energy-stable. Moreover, the first method is shown to converge with the linear order in the energy norm, while the second method converges with the $\mathcal{O}(\tau^{\frac32})$ order in the $L^2$-norm, which is optimal with respect to the time regularity of the solution to the underlying stochastic PDE. The convergence analyses of both methods, which are different and quite involved, require some novel numerical techniques to overcome difficulties caused by the nonlinear noise term and the interplay between nonlinear drift and diffusion. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the sharpness of the theoretical error estimate results.</description>

      <title>Level-set shape optimization via polytopic discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new level-set shape optimization approach based on polytopic (i.e., polygonal in two and polyhedral in three spatial dimensions) discontinuous Galerkin methods. The approach benefits from the geometric mesh flexibility of polytopic discontinuous Galerkin methods to resolve the zero-level set accurately and efficiently. Additionally, we employ suitable Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin methods to update the level-set function on a fine underlying simplicial mesh. We discuss the construction and implementation of the approach, explaining how to modify shape derivate formulas to compute consistent shape gradient approximations using discontinuous Galerkin methods, and how to recover dG functions into smoother ones. Numerical experiments on unconstrained and PDE-constrained test cases evidence the good properties of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>An Overview on Machine Learning Methods for Partial Differential Equations: from Physics Informed Neural Networks to Deep Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approximation of solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) with numerical algorithms is a central topic in applied mathematics. For many decades, various types of methods for this purpose have been developed and extensively studied. One class of methods which has received a lot of attention in recent years are machine learning-based methods, which typically involve the training of artificial neural networks (ANNs) by means of stochastic gradient descent type optimization methods. While approximation methods for PDEs using ANNs have first been proposed in the 1990s they have only gained wide popularity in the last decade with the rise of deep learning. This article aims to provide an introduction to some of these methods and the mathematical theory on which they are based. We discuss methods such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep BSDE methods and consider several operator learning approaches.</description>

      <title>A tour d'horizon of de Casteljau's work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whilst Paul de Casteljau is now famous for his fundamental algorithm of curve and surface approximation, little is known about his other findings. This article offers an insight into his results in geometry, algebra and number theory.
  Related to geometry, his classical algorithm is reviewed as an index reduction of a polar form. This idea is used to show de Casteljau's algebraic way of smoothing, which long went unnoticed. We will also see an analytic polar form and its use in finding the intersection of two curves. The article summarises unpublished material on metric geometry. It includes theoretical advances, e.g., the 14-point strophoid or a way to link Apollonian circles with confocal conics, and also practical applications such as a recurrence for conjugate mirrors in geometric optics. A view on regular polygons leads to an approximation of their diagonals by golden matrices, a generalisation of the golden ratio.
  Relevant algebraic findings include matrix quaternions (and anti-quaternions) and their link with Lorentz' equations. De Casteljau generalised the Euclidean algorithm and developed an automated method for approximating the roots of a class of polynomial equations. His contributions to number theory not only include aspects on the sum of four squares as in quaternions, but also a view on a particular sum of three cubes. After a review of a complete quadrilateral in a heptagon and its angles, the paper concludes with a summary of de Casteljau's key achievements.
  The article contains a comprehensive bibliography of de Casteljau's works, including previously unpublished material.</description>

      <title>Morley finite element analysis for fourth-order elliptic equations under a semi-regular mesh condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08719v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a precise anisotropic interpolation error estimate for the Morley finite element method (FEM) and apply it to fourth-order elliptic equations. We do not impose the shape-regularity mesh condition in the analysis. Anisotropic meshes can be used for this purpose. The main contributions of this study include providing a new proof of the term consistency. This enables us to obtain an anisotropic consistency error estimate. The core idea of the proof involves using the relationship between the Raviart--Thomas and Morley finite-element spaces. Our results indicate optimal convergence rates and imply that the modified Morley FEM may be effective for errors.</description>

      <title>An Eulerian finite element method for the linearized Navier--Stokes problem in an evolving domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper addresses an error analysis of an Eulerian finite element method used for solving a linearized Navier--Stokes problem in a time-dependent domain. In this study, the domain's evolution is assumed to be known and independent of the solution to the problem at hand. The numerical method employed in the study combines a standard Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF)-type time-stepping procedure with a geometrically unfitted finite element discretization technique. Additionally, Nitsche's method is utilized to enforce the boundary conditions. The paper presents a convergence estimate for several velocity--pressure elements that are inf-sup stable. The estimate demonstrates optimal order convergence in the energy norm for the velocity component and a scaled $L^2(H^1)$-type norm for the pressure component.</description>

      <title>A Note on Randomized Kaczmarz Algorithm for Solving Doubly-Noisy Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale linear systems, $Ax=b$, frequently arise in practice and demand effective iterative solvers. Often, these systems are noisy due to operational errors or faulty data-collection processes. In the past decade, the randomized Kaczmarz (RK) algorithm has been studied extensively as an efficient iterative solver for such systems. However, the convergence study of RK in the noisy regime is limited and considers measurement noise in the right-hand side vector, $b$. Unfortunately, in practice, that is not always the case; the coefficient matrix $A$ can also be noisy. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of RK for {\textit{doubly-noisy} linear systems, i.e., when the coefficient matrix, $A$, has additive or multiplicative noise, and $b$ is also noisy}. In our analyses, the quantity $\tilde R=\| \tilde A^{\dagger} \|^2 \|\tilde A \|_F^2$ influences the convergence of RK, where $\tilde A$ represents a noisy version of $A$. We claim that our analysis is robust and realistically applicable, as we do not require information about the noiseless coefficient matrix, $A$, and considering different conditions on noise, we can control the convergence of RK. {We perform numerical experiments to substantiate our theoretical findings.}</description>

      <title>Local conservation laws of continuous Galerkin method for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations in EMAC form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider local balances of momentum and angular momentum for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. First, we formulate new weak forms of the physical balances (conservation laws) of these quantities, and prove they are equivalent to the usual conservation law formulations. We then show that continuous Galerkin discretizations of the Navier-Stokes equations using the EMAC form of the nonlinearity preserve discrete analogues of the weak form conservation laws, both in the Eulerian formulation and the Lagrangian formulation (which are not equivalent after discretizations). Numerical tests illustrate the new theory.</description>

      <title>Implementation of the Emulator-based Component Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a PyTorch-powered implementation of the emulator-based component analysis used for ill-posed numerical non-linear inverse problems, where an approximate emulator for the forward problem is known. This emulator may be a numerical model, an interpolating function, or a fitting function such as a neural network. With the help of the emulator and a data set, the method seeks dimensionality reduction by projection in the variable space so that maximal variance of the target (response) values of the data is covered. The obtained basis set for projection in the variable space defines a subspace of the greatest response for the outcome of the forward problem. The method allows for the reconstruction of the coordinates in this subspace for an approximate solution to the inverse problem. We present an example of using the code provided as a Python class.</description>

      <title>A path-dependent PDE solver based on signature kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a provably convergent kernel-based solver for path-dependent PDEs (PPDEs). Our numerical scheme leverages signature kernels, a recently introduced class of kernels on path-space. Specifically, we solve an optimal recovery problem by approximating the solution of a PPDE with an element of minimal norm in the signature reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) constrained to satisfy the PPDE at a finite collection of collocation paths. In the linear case, we show that the optimisation has a unique closed-form solution expressed in terms of signature kernel evaluations at the collocation paths. We prove consistency of the proposed scheme, guaranteeing convergence to the PPDE solution as the number of collocation points increases. Finally, several numerical examples are presented, in particular in the context of option pricing under rough volatility. Our numerical scheme constitutes a valid alternative to the ubiquitous Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of quark matter with both external electric field and chiral chemical potential is theoretically and experimentally interesting to consider. In this paper, the case of simultaneous presence of imaginary electric field and chiral chemical potential is investigated using the lattice QCD approach with $N_f=1+1$ dynamical staggered fermions. We find that overall both the imaginary electric field and the chiral chemical potential can exacerbate chiral symmetry breaking, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. However we also find a non-monotonic behavior of chiral condensation at specific electric field strengths and chiral chemical potentials. In addition to this, we find that the behavior of Polyakov loop in the complex plane is not significantly affected by chiral chemical potential in the region of the parameters consider in this paper.</description>

      <title>Constrained or Unconstrained? Neural-Network-Based Equation Discovery from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Throughout many fields, practitioners often rely on differential equations to model systems. Yet, for many applications, the theoretical derivation of such equations and/or accurate resolution of their solutions may be intractable. Instead, recently developed methods, including those based on parameter estimation, operator subset selection, and neural networks, allow for the data-driven discovery of both ordinary and partial differential equations (PDEs), on a spectrum of interpretability. The success of these strategies is often contingent upon the correct identification of representative equations from noisy observations of state variables and, as importantly and intertwined with that, the mathematical strategies utilized to enforce those equations. Specifically, the latter has been commonly addressed via unconstrained optimization strategies. Representing the PDE as a neural network, we propose to discover the PDE by solving a constrained optimization problem and using an intermediate state representation similar to a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The objective function of this constrained optimization problem promotes matching the data, while the constraints require that the PDE is satisfied at several spatial collocation points. We present a penalty method and a widely used trust-region barrier method to solve this constrained optimization problem, and we compare these methods on numerical examples. Our results on the Burgers' and the Korteweg-De Vreis equations demonstrate that the latter constrained method outperforms the penalty method, particularly for higher noise levels or fewer collocation points. For both methods, we solve these discovered neural network PDEs with classical methods, such as finite difference methods, as opposed to PINNs-type methods relying on automatic differentiation. We briefly highlight other small, yet crucial, implementation details.</description>

      <title>On the logarithmic energy of solutions to the polynomial eigenvalue problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the expected logarithmic energy of solutions to the polynomial eigenvalue problem for random matrices. We generalize some known results for the Shub-Smale polynomials, and the spherical ensemble. These two processes are the two extremal particular cases of the polynomial eigenvalue problem, and we prove that the logarithmic energy lies between these two cases.
