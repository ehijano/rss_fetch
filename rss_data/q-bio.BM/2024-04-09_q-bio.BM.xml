      <title>In silico bioactivity prediction of proteins interacting with graphene-based nanomaterials guides rational design of biosensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene based nanomaterials have attracted significant attention for their potentials in biomedical and biotechnology applications in recent years, owing to the outstanding physical and chemical properties. However, the interaction mechanism and impact on biological activity of macro and micro biomolecules still require more concerns and further research in order to enhance their applicability in biosensors, etc. Herein, an integrated method has been developed to predict the protein bioactivity performance when interacting with nanomaterials for protein based biosensor. Molecular dynamics simulation and molecular docking technique were consolidated to investigate several nanomaterials C60 fullerene, single walled carbon nanotube, pristine graphene and graphene oxide, and their effect when interacting with protein. The adsorption behavior, secondary structure changes and protein bioactivity changes were simulated, and the results of protein activity simulation were verified in combination with atomic force spectrum, circular dichroism spectrum fluorescence and electrochemical experiments. The best quantification alignment between bioactivity obtained by simulation and experiment measurements was further explored. The two proteins, RNase A and Exonuclease III, were regarded as analysis model for the proof of concept, and the prediction accuracy of protein bioactivty could reach up to 0.98.</description>

      <title>FABind+: Enhancing Molecular Docking through Improved Pocket Prediction and Pose Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a pivotal process in drug discovery. While traditional techniques rely on extensive sampling and simulation governed by physical principles, these methods are often slow and costly. The advent of deep learning-based approaches has shown significant promise, offering increases in both accuracy and efficiency. Building upon the foundational work of FABind, a model designed with a focus on speed and accuracy, we present FABind+, an enhanced iteration that largely boosts the performance of its predecessor. We identify pocket prediction as a critical bottleneck in molecular docking and propose a novel methodology that significantly refines pocket prediction, thereby streamlining the docking process. Furthermore, we introduce modifications to the docking module to enhance its pose generation capabilities. In an effort to bridge the gap with conventional sampling/generative methods, we incorporate a simple yet effective sampling technique coupled with a confidence model, requiring only minor adjustments to the regression framework of FABind. Experimental results and analysis reveal that FABind+ remarkably outperforms the original FABind, achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance, and delivers insightful modeling strategies. This demonstrates FABind+ represents a substantial step forward in molecular docking and drug discovery. Our code is in https://github.com/QizhiPei/FABind.</description>
