      <title>A Corrected Welch Satterthwaite Equation. And: What You Always Wanted to Know About Kish's Effective Sample but Were Afraid to Ask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a corrected version of the Satterthwaite (1941, 1946) approximation for the degrees of freedom of a weighted sum of independent variance components. The original formula is known to yield biased estimates when component degrees of freedom are small. The correction, derived from exact moment matching, adjusts for the bias by incorporating a factor that accounts for the estimation of fourth moments. We show that Kish's (1965) effective sample size formula emerges as a special case when all variance components are equal, and component degrees of freedom are ignored. Simulation studies demonstrate that the corrected estimator closely matches the expected degrees of freedom even for small component sizes, while the original Satterthwaite estimator exhibits substantial downward bias. Additional applications are discussed, including jackknife variance estimation, multiple imputation total variance, and the Welch test for unequal variances.</description>

      <title>On the non-uniformity of the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The group stage of a sports tournament is often made more appealing by introducing additional constraints in the group draw that promote an attractive and balanced group composition. For example, the number of intra-regional group matches is minimised in several World Cups. However, under such constraints, the traditional draw procedure may become non-uniform, meaning that the feasible allocations of the teams into groups are not equally likely to occur. Our paper quantifies this non-uniformity of the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw for the official draw procedure, as well as for 47 reasonable alternatives implied by all permutations of the four pots and two group labelling policies. We show why simulating with a recursive backtracking algorithm is intractable, and propose a workable implementation using integer programming. The official draw mechanism is found to be optimal based on four measures of non-uniformity. Nonetheless, non-uniformity can be more than halved if the organiser aims to treat the best teams drawn from the first pot equally.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Delivery Delay Duration Prediction via Multi-Task Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate delivery delay prediction is critical for maintaining operational efficiency and customer satisfaction across modern supply chains. Yet the increasing complexity of logistics networks, spanning multimodal transportation, cross-country routing, and pronounced regional variability, makes this prediction task inherently challenging. This paper introduces a multi-task deep learning model for delivery delay duration prediction in the presence of significant imbalanced data, where delayed shipments are rare but operationally consequential. The model embeds high-dimensional shipment features with dedicated embedding layers for tabular data, and then uses a classification-then-regression strategy to predict the delivery delay duration for on-time and delayed shipments. Unlike sequential pipelines, this approach enables end-to-end training, improves the detection of delayed cases, and supports probabilistic forecasting for uncertainty-aware decision making. The proposed approach is evaluated on a large-scale real-world dataset from an industrial partner, comprising more than 10 million historical shipment records across four major source locations with distinct regional characteristics. The proposed model is compared with traditional machine learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a mean absolute error of 0.67-0.91 days for delayed-shipment predictions, outperforming single-step tree-based regression baselines by 41-64% and two-step classify-then-regress tree-based models by 15-35%. These gains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in operational delivery delay forecasting under highly imbalanced and heterogeneous conditions.</description>

      <title>Error-Controlled Borrowing from External Data Using Wasserstein Ambiguity Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating external data can improve the efficiency of clinical trials, but distributional mismatches between current and external populations threaten the validity of inference. While numerous dynamic borrowing methods exist, the calibration of their borrowing parameters relies mainly on ad hoc, simulation-based tuning. To overcome this, we propose BOND (Borrowing under Optimal Nonparametric Distributional robustness), a framework that formalizes data noncommensurability through Wasserstein ambiguity sets centered at the current-trial distribution. By deriving sharp, closed-form bounds on the worst-case mean drift for both continuous and binary outcomes, we construct a distributionally robust, bias-corrected Wald statistic that ensures asymptotic type I error control uniformly over the ambiguity set. Importantly, BOND determines the optimal borrowing strength by maximizing a worst-case power proxy, converting heuristic parameter tuning into a transparent, analytically tractable optimization problem. Furthermore, we demonstrate that many prominent borrowing methods can be reparameterized via an effective borrowing weight, rendering our calibration framework broadly applicable. Simulation studies and a real-world clinical trial application confirm that BOND preserves the nominal size under unmeasured heterogeneity while achieving efficiency gains over standard borrowing methods.</description>

      <title>Sparse Bayesian Deep Functional Learning with Structured Region Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern applications such as ECG monitoring, neuroimaging, wearable sensing, and industrial equipment diagnostics, complex and continuously structured data are ubiquitous, presenting both challenges and opportunities for functional data analysis. However, existing methods face a critical trade-off: conventional functional models are limited by linearity, whereas deep learning approaches lack interpretable region selection for sparse effects. To bridge these gaps, we propose a sparse Bayesian functional deep neural network (sBayFDNN). It learns adaptive functional embeddings through a deep Bayesian architecture to capture complex nonlinear relationships, while a structured prior enables interpretable, region-wise selection of influential domains with quantified uncertainty. Theoretically, we establish rigorous approximation error bounds, posterior consistency, and region selection consistency. These results provide the first theoretical guarantees for a Bayesian deep functional model, ensuring its reliability and statistical rigor. Empirically, comprehensive simulations and real-world studies confirm the effectiveness and superiority of sBayFDNN. Crucially, sBayFDNN excels in recognizing intricate dependencies for accurate predictions and more precisely identifies functionally meaningful regions, capabilities fundamentally beyond existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Detecting Where Effects Occur by Testing Hypotheses in Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental evaluations of public policies often randomize a new intervention within many sites or blocks. After a report of an overall result -- statistically significant or not -- the natural question from a policy maker is: \emph{where} did any effects occur? Standard adjustments for multiple testing provide little power to answer this question. In simulations modeled after a 44-block education trial, the Hommel adjustment -- among the most powerful procedures controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER) -- detects effects in only 11\% of truly non-null blocks. We develop a procedure that tests hypotheses top-down through a tree: test the overall null at the root, then groups of blocks, then individual blocks, stopping any branch where the null is not rejected. In the same 44-block design, this approach detects effects in 44\% of non-null blocks -- roughly four times the detection rate. A stopping rule and valid tests at each node suffice for weak FWER control. We show that the strong-sense FWER depends on how rejection probabilities accumulate along paths through the tree. This yields a diagnostic: when power decays fast enough relative to branching, no adjustment is needed; otherwise, an adaptive $\alpha$-adjustment restores control. We apply the method to 25 MDRC education trials and provide an R package, \texttt{manytestsr}.</description>

      <title>Not Just How Much, But Where: Decomposing Epistemic Uncertainty into Per-Class Contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In safety-critical classification, the cost of failure is often asymmetric, yet Bayesian deep learning summarises epistemic uncertainty with a single scalar, mutual information (MI), that cannot distinguish whether a model's ignorance involves a benign or safety-critical class. We decompose MI into a per-class vector $C_k(x)=\sigma_k^{2}/(2\mu_k)$, with $\mu_k{=}\mathbb{E}[p_k]$ and $\sigma_k^2{=}\mathrm{Var}[p_k]$ across posterior samples. The decomposition follows from a second-order Taylor expansion of the entropy; the $1/\mu_k$ weighting corrects boundary suppression and makes $C_k$ comparable across rare and common classes. By construction $\sum_k C_k \approx \mathrm{MI}$, and a companion skewness diagnostic flags inputs where the approximation degrades. After characterising the axiomatic properties of $C_k$, we validate it on three tasks: (i) selective prediction for diabetic retinopathy, where critical-class $C_k$ reduces selective risk by 34.7\% over MI and 56.2\% over variance baselines; (ii) out-of-distribution detection on clinical and image benchmarks, where $\sum_k C_k$ achieves the highest AUROC and the per-class view exposes asymmetric shifts invisible to MI; and (iii) a controlled label-noise study in which $\sum_k C_k$ shows less sensitivity to injected aleatoric noise than MI under end-to-end Bayesian training, while both metrics degrade under transfer learning. Across all tasks, the quality of the posterior approximation shapes uncertainty at least as strongly as the choice of metric, suggesting that how uncertainty is propagated through the network matters as much as how it is measured.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Perspective for Orientation Determination in Cryo-EM with Application to Structural Heterogeneity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate orientation estimation is a crucial component of 3D molecular structure reconstruction, both in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and in the increasingly popular field of cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). The dominant approach, which involves searching for the orientation that maximizes cross-correlation relative to given templates, is sub-optimal, particularly under low signal-to-noise conditions. In this work, we propose a Bayesian framework for more accurate and flexible orientation estimation, with the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator serving as a key example. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the MMSE estimator consistently outperforms the cross-correlation-based method, especially in challenging low signal-to-noise scenarios, and we provide a theoretical framework that supports these improvements.
  When incorporated into iterative refinement algorithms in the 3D reconstruction pipeline, the MMSE estimator markedly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces model bias, and enhances robustness to the ``Einstein from Noise'' artifact. Crucially, we demonstrate that orientation estimation accuracy has a decisive effect on downstream structural heterogeneity analysis. In particular, integrating the MMSE-based pose estimator into frameworks for continuous heterogeneity recovery yields accuracy improvements approaching those obtained with ground-truth poses, establishing MMSE-based pose estimation as a key enabler of high-fidelity conformational landscape reconstruction. These findings indicate that the proposed Bayesian framework could substantially advance cryo-EM and cryo-ET by enhancing the accuracy, robustness, and reliability of 3D molecular structure reconstruction, thereby facilitating deeper insights into complex biological systems.</description>

      <title>ICE-ID: A Novel Historical Census Dataset for Longitudinal Identity Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce \textbf{ICE-ID}, a benchmark dataset comprising 984,028 records from 16 Icelandic census waves spanning 220 years (1703--1920), with 226,864 expert-curated person identifiers. ICE-ID combines hierarchical geography (farm$\to$parish$\to$district$\to$county), patronymic naming conventions, sparse kinship links (partner, father, mother), and multi-decadal temporal drift -- challenges not captured by standard product-matching or citation datasets. This paper presents an artifact-backed analysis of temporal coverage, missingness, identifier ambiguity, candidate-generation efficiency, and cluster distributions, and situates ICE-ID against classical ER benchmarks (Abt--Buy, Amazon--Google, DBLP--ACM, DBLP--Scholar, Walmart--Amazon, iTunes--Amazon, Beer, Fodors--Zagats). We also define a deployment-faithful temporal OOD protocol and release the dataset, splits, regeneration scripts, analysis artifacts, and a dashboard for interactive exploration. Baseline model comparisons and end-to-end ER results are reported in the companion methods paper.</description>
