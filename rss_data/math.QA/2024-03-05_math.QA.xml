      <title>Quantum symmetry in multigraphs (part II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is a continuation of "Quantum symmetry in multigraphs (part I)". In this article, we give an explicit construction of a non-Bichon type co-action on a multigraph that is, it preserves quantum symmetry of (V,E) in our sense but not always in Bichon's sense. This construction itself is motivated from automorphisms of quantum graphs.</description>

      <title>Twisted restricted conformal blocks of vertex operator algebras II: twisted restricted conformal blocks on totally ramified orbifold curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of twisted restricted conformal blocks on totally ramified orbifold curves and establish the isomorphism between the space of twisted restricted conformal blocks and the space of twisted conformal blocks. In the specific example of a twisted projective line, isomorphisms between the space of $g$-twisted (restricted) conformal block and the space of $g$-twisted (restricted) correlation functions are established. This leads to a more conceptual proof of the $g$-twisted fusion rule theorem in vertex operator algebra theory. Furthermore, by introducing a geometric generalization of Zhu's algebra and its modules, we obtain a general version of the twisted fusion rule theorem.</description>

      <title>Finite Type Invariants of w-Knotted Objects II: Tangles, Foams and the Kashiwara-Vergne Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1955</link>
      <description>arXiv:1405.1955v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the second in a series of papers dedicated to studying w-knots, and more generally, w-knotted objects (w-braids, w-tangles, etc.). These are classes of knotted objects that are wider but weaker than their "usual" counterparts. To get (say) w-knots from usual knots (or u-knots), one has to allow non-planar "virtual" knot diagrams, hence enlarging the the base set of knots. But then one imposes a new relation beyond the ordinary collection of Reidemeister moves, called the "overcrossings commute" relation, making w-knotted objects a bit weaker once again. Satoh studied several classes of w-knotted objects (under the name "weakly-virtual") and has shown them to be closely related to certain classes of knotted surfaces in R4.
  In this article we study finite type invariants of w-tangles and w-trivalent graphs (also referred to as w-tangled foams). Much as the spaces A of chord diagrams for ordinary knotted objects are related to metrized Lie algebras, the spaces Aw of "arrow diagrams" for w-knotted objects are related to not-necessarily-metrized Lie algebras. Many questions concerning w-knotted objects turn out to be equivalent to questions about Lie algebras. Most notably we find that a homomorphic universal finite type invariant of w-foams is essentially the same as a solution of the Kashiwara-Vergne conjecture and much of the Alekseev-Torossian work on Drinfel'd associators and Kashiwara-Vergne can be re-interpreted as a study of w-foams.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck-Verdier duality in categories of bimodules and weak module functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various monoidal categories, including suitable representation categories of vertex operator algebras, admit natural Grothendieck-Verdier duality structures. We recall that such a Grothendieck-Verdier category comes with two tensor products which should be related by distributors obeying pentagon identities. We discuss in which circumstances these distributors are isomorphisms. This is achieved by taking the perspective of module categories over monoidal categories, using in particular the natural weak module functor structure of internal Homs and internal coHoms. As an illustration, we exhibit these concepts concretely in the case of categories of bimodules over associative algebras.</description>
