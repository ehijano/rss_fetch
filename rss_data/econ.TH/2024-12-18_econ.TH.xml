      <title>Obvious manipulations, consistency, and the uniform rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the problem of fully allocating an infinitely divisible commodity among agents whose preferences are single-peaked, we show that the uniform rule is the only allocation rule that satisfies efficiency, the equal division guarantee, consistency, and non-obvious manipulability.</description>

      <title>Raising Bidders' Awareness in Second-Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When bidders bid on complex objects, they might be unaware of characteristics effecting their valuations. We assume that each buyer's valuation is a sum of independent random variables, one for each characteristic. When a bidder is unaware of a characteristic, he omits the random variable from the sum. We study the seller's decision to raise bidders' awareness of characteristics before a second-price auction with entry fees. Optimal entry fees capture an additional unawareness rent due to unaware bidders misperceiving their probability of winning and the price to be paid upon winning. When raising a bidder's individual awareness of a characteristic with positive expected value, the seller faces a trade-off between positive effects on the expected first order statistic and unawareness rents of remaining unaware bidders on one hand and the loss of the unawareness rent from the newly aware bidder on the other. We present characterization results on raising public awareness together with no versus full information. We discuss the winner's curse due to unawareness of characteristics.</description>

      <title>Information, entropy and the paradox of choice: A theoretical framework for understanding choice satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Choice overload occurs when individuals feel overwhelmed by an excessive number of options. Experimental evidence suggests that a larger selection can complicate the decision-making process. Consequently, choice satisfaction may diminish when the costs of making a choice outweigh its benefits, indicating that satisfaction follows an inverted U-shaped relationship with the size of the choice set. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this phenomenon remain underexplored. Here, we present a theoretical framework based on relative entropy and effective information to elucidate the inverted U-shaped relationship between satisfaction and choice set size. We begin by positing that individuals assign a probability distribution to a choice set based on their preferences, characterized by an observed Shannon entropy. We then define a maximum entropy that corresponds to a worst-case scenario where individuals are indifferent among options, leading to equal probabilities for all alternatives. We hypothesized that satisfaction is related to the probability of identifying an ideal choice within the set. By comparing observed entropy to maximum entropy, we derive the effective information of choice probabilities, demonstrating that this metric reflects satisfaction with the options available. For smaller choice sets, individuals can more easily identify their best option, resulting in a sharper probability distribution around the preferred choice and, consequently, minimum entropy, which signifies maximum information and satisfaction. Conversely, in larger choice sets, individuals struggle to compare and evaluate all alternatives, leading to missed opportunities and increased entropy. This smooth probability distribution ultimately reduces choice satisfaction, thereby producing the observed inverted U-shaped trend.</description>

      <title>Marginal Reputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study reputation formation where a long-run player repeatedly observes private signals and takes actions. Short-run players observe the long-run player's past actions but not her past signals. The long-run player can thus develop a reputation for playing a distribution over actions, but not necessarily for playing a particular mapping from signals to actions. Nonetheless, we show that the long-run player can secure her Stackelberg payoff if distinct commitment types are statistically distinguishable and the Stackelberg strategy is confound-defeating. This property holds if and only if the Stackelberg strategy is the unique solution to an optimal transport problem. If the long-run player's payoff is supermodular in one-dimensional signals and actions, she secures the Stackelberg payoff if and only if the Stackelberg strategy is monotone. An application of our results provides a reputational foundation for a class of Bayesian persuasion solutions when the sender has a small lying cost. Our results extend to the case where distinct commitment types may be indistinguishable but the Stackelberg type is salient under the prior.</description>
