      <title>Spectral Multifractality and Emergent Energyscales Across the Many-Body Localisation Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scaling theory of the many-body localisation transition in terms of emergent, characteristic energyscales. The analysis is based on the decomposition of the eigenstates in the basis of trivially localised states, resolved in the energies of the latter, which we refer to as the spectral decomposition of the eigenstates. The characteristic energyscales emerge when the multifractal properties, or lack thereof, of the spectral decomposition are studied at different scales. These characteristic scales correspond to the ones, above which the spectral decompositions exhibit their global behaviour, namely full ergodicity in the ergodic phase and multifractality in the many-body localised phase. On the other hand, at scales below the characteristic ones, the decomposition in the ergodic phase shows finer (multi)fractal structures whereas in the localised phase, the decomposition picks out well-separated, localised resonant peaks. The scaling of these characteristic energyscales across the many-body localisation transition admits a scaling theory consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless type scenario and bears striking resemblances to that of inverse participation ratios of eigenstates.</description>

      <title>The planted directed polymer: inferring a random walk from noisy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the planted directed polymer, in which the path of a random walker is inferred from noisy 'images' accumulated at each timestep. Formulated as a nonlinear problem of Bayesian inference for a hidden Markov model, this problem is a generalization of the directed polymer problem of statistical physics, coinciding with it in the limit of zero signal to noise. For a 1D walker we present numerical investigations and analytical arguments that no phase transition is present. When formulated on a Cayley tree, methods developed for the directed polymer are used to show that there is a transition with decreasing signal to noise where effective inference becomes impossible, meaning that the average fractional overlap between the inferred and true paths falls from one to zero.</description>

      <title>Exact results for the Ising model on a small-world network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-world networks provide an interesting framework for studying the interplay between regular and random graphs, where links are located in a regular and random way, respectively. On one hand, the random links make the model to obey some kind of mean-field behavior. On the other hand, the links of the regular lattice make the system to retain some related non trivial correlations. The coexistence of these two features in general prevent a closed analytical treatment. Here we consider a one-dimensional small-world Ising model and derive analytically its equation of state, critical point, critical behavior, and critical correlations. Despite being one of the simplest small-world models, our exact and intuitive analysis reveals some intriguing properties.</description>

      <title>Two liquid states of distinguishable helium-4: the existence of another non-superfluid frozen by heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that there can exist two liquid states in distinguishable helium-4 ($^4$He) obeying Boltzmann statistics. This is an indication of quantum liquid polyamorphism induced by nuclear quantum effect. For 0.08-3.3 K and 1-500 bar, we extensively conducted the isothermal-isobaric path integral centroid molecular dynamics simulations to explore not only possible states and state diagram but the state characteristics. The distinguishable $^4$He below 25 bar does not freeze down to 0.08 K even though it includes no Bosonic exchange effect and therefore no Bose condensation. One liquid state, low quantum-dispersion liquid (LQDL), is nearly identical to normal liquid He-I of real $^4$He. The other is high quantum-dispersion liquid (HQDL) consisting of atoms with longer quantum wavelength. This is another non-superfluid existing below 0.5 K or the temperatures of LQDL. The HQDL is also a low-entropy and fragile liquid to exhibit, unlike conventional liquids, rather gas-like relaxation of velocity autocorrelation function, while there the atoms diffuse without noticeable contribution from quantum tunneling. The LQDL-HQDL transition is not a thermodynamic phase transition but a continuous crossover accompanied by the change of the expansion factor of quantum wavelength. Freezing of HQDL into the low quantum-dispersion amorphous solid occurs by heating from 0.2 to 0.3 K at 40-50 bar, while this $P$-$T$ condition coincides with the Kim-Chan normal-supersolid phase boundary of real $^4$He. It is suggested that HQDL has relevance to the non-superfluid states of confined subnano-scale $^4$He systems which are semi-Boltzmann-like owing to the suppression of Bosonic correlation.</description>

      <title>Synergy between noisy quantum computers and scalable classical deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of combining the computational power of noisy quantum computers and of classical scalable convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The goal is to accurately predict exact expectation values of parameterized quantum circuits representing the Trotter-decomposed dynamics of quantum Ising models. By incorporating (simulated) noisy expectation values alongside circuit structure information, our CNNs effectively capture the underlying relationships between circuit architecture and output behaviour, enabling predictions for circuits with more qubits than those included in the training set. Notably, thanks to the quantum information, our CNNs succeed even when supervised learning based only on classical descriptors fails. Furthermore, they outperform a popular error mitigation scheme, namely, zero-noise extrapolation, demonstrating that the synergy between quantum and classical computational tools leads to higher accuracy compared with quantum-only or classical-only approaches. By tuning the noise strength, we explore the crossover from a computationally powerful classical CNN assisted by quantum noisy data, towards rather precise quantum computations, further error-mitigated via classical deep learning.</description>

      <title>Localization with non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss a non-Hermitian system described via a one-dimensional single-particle tight-binding model, where the non-Hermiticity is governed by random nearest-neighbour tunnellings, such that the left-to-right and right-to-left hopping strengths are unequal. A physical situation of completely real eigenspectrum arises owing to the Hamiltonian's tridiagonal matrix structure under a simple sign conservation of the product of the conjugate nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms. The off-diagonal disorder leads the non-Hermitian system to a delocalization-localization crossover in finite systems. The emergent nature of the crossover is recognized through a finite-size spectral analysis. The system enters into a localized phase for infinitesimal disorder strength in the thermodynamic limit. We perform a careful scaling analysis of localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy splitting and report the corresponding scaling exponents. Noticeably, in contrast to the diagonal disorder, the density of states (DOS) has a singularity at E=0 in the presence of the off-diagonal disorder and the corresponding wavefunction remains delocalized for any given disorder strength.</description>

      <title>Spectral Form Factors of Topological Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signatures of dynamical quantum phase transitions and chaos can be found in the time evolution of generalized partition functions such as spectral form factors (SFF) and Loschmidt echoes. While a lot of work has focused on the nature of such systems in a variety of strongly interacting quantum theories, in this work, we study their behavior in short-range entangled topological phases, particularly focusing on the role of symmetry-protected topological zero modes. We show, using both analytical and numerical methods, how the existence of such zero modes in any representative system can mask the SFF with large period (akin to generalized Rabi) oscillations, hiding any behavior arising from the bulk of the spectrum. Moreover, in a quenched disordered system, these zero modes fundamentally change the late-time universal behavior reflecting the chaotic signatures of the zero-energy manifold. Our study uncovers the rich physics underlying the interplay of chaotic signatures and topological characteristics in a quantum system.</description>

      <title>Grokking as the Transition from Lazy to Rich Training Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the grokking phenomenon, where the train loss of a neural network decreases much earlier than its test loss, can arise due to a neural network transitioning from lazy training dynamics to a rich, feature learning regime. To illustrate this mechanism, we study the simple setting of vanilla gradient descent on a polynomial regression problem with a two layer neural network which exhibits grokking without regularization in a way that cannot be explained by existing theories. We identify sufficient statistics for the test loss of such a network, and tracking these over training reveals that grokking arises in this setting when the network first attempts to fit a kernel regression solution with its initial features, followed by late-time feature learning where a generalizing solution is identified after train loss is already low. We find that the key determinants of grokking are the rate of feature learning -- which can be controlled precisely by parameters that scale the network output -- and the alignment of the initial features with the target function $y(x)$. We argue this delayed generalization arises when (1) the top eigenvectors of the initial neural tangent kernel and the task labels $y(x)$ are misaligned, but (2) the dataset size is large enough so that it is possible for the network to generalize eventually, but not so large that train loss perfectly tracks test loss at all epochs, and (3) the network begins training in the lazy regime so does not learn features immediately. We conclude with evidence that this transition from lazy (linear model) to rich training (feature learning) can control grokking in more general settings, like on MNIST, one-layer Transformers, and student-teacher networks.</description>

      <title>Glassy word problems: ultraslow relaxation, Hilbert space jamming, and computational complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of local models of dynamics based on ``word problems'' from computer science and group theory, for which we can place rigorous lower bounds on relaxation timescales. These models can be regarded either as random circuit or local Hamiltonian dynamics, and include many familiar examples of constrained dynamics as special cases. The configuration space of these models splits into dynamically disconnected sectors, and for initial states to relax, they must ``work out'' the other states in the sector to which they belong. When this problem has a high time complexity, relaxation is slow. In some of the cases we study, this problem also has high space complexity. When the space complexity is larger than the system size, an unconventional type of jamming transition can occur, whereby a system of a fixed size is not ergodic, but can be made ergodic by appending a large reservoir of sites in a trivial product state. This manifests itself in a new type of Hilbert space fragmentation that we call fragile fragmentation. We present explicit examples where slow relaxation and jamming strongly modify the hydrodynamics of conserved densities. In one example, density modulations of wavevector $q$ exhibit almost no relaxation until times $O(\exp(1/q))$, at which point they abruptly collapse. We also comment on extensions of our results to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Unified understanding of the breakdown of thermal mixing dynamic nuclear polarization: the role of temperature and radical concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal an interplay between temperature and radical concentration necessary to establish thermal mixing (TM) as an efficient dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) mechanism. We conducted DNP experiments by hyperpolarizing widely used DNP samples, i.e., sodium pyruvate-1-$^{13}$C in water/glycerol mixtures at varying nitroxide radical (TEMPOL) concentrations and microwave irradiation frequencies, measuring proton and carbon-13 spin temperatures. Using a cryogen consumption-free prototype-DNP apparatus, we could probe cryogenic temperatures between 1.5 and 6.5 K, i.e., below and above the boiling point of liquid helium. We identify two mechanisms for the breakdown of TM: (i) Anderson type of quantum localization for low radical concentration, or (ii) quantum Zeno localization occurring at high temperature. This observation allowed us to reconcile the recent diverging observations regarding the relevance of TM as a DNP mechanism by proposing a unifying picture and, consequently, to find a trade-off between radical concentration and electron relaxation times, which offers a pathway to improve experimental DNP performance based on TM.</description>

      <title>Neural population geometry and optimal coding of tasks with shared latent structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans and animals can recognize latent structures in their environment and apply this information to efficiently navigate the world. However, it remains unclear what aspects of neural activity contribute to these computational capabilities. Here, we develop an analytical theory linking the geometry of a neural population's activity to the generalization performance of a linear readout on a set of tasks that depend on a common latent structure. We show that four geometric measures of the activity determine performance across tasks. Using this theory, we find that experimentally observed disentangled representations naturally emerge as an optimal solution to the multi-task learning problem. When data is scarce, these optimal neural codes compress less informative latent variables, and when data is abundant, they expand these variables in the state space. We validate our theory using macaque ventral stream recordings. Our results therefore tie population geometry to multi-task learning.</description>
