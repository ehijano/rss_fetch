      <title>Map-level baryonification: Efficient modelling of higher-order correlations in the weak lensing and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-analytic methods can generate baryon-corrected fields from N-body simulations (``baryonification'') and are rapidly becoming a ubiquitous tool in modeling structure formation on non-linear scales. We extend this formalism to consistently model the weak lensing and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) fields directly on the full-sky, with an emphasis on higher-order correlations. We use the auto- and cross- $N$th-order moments, with $N \in \{2, 3, 4\}$, as a summary statistic of the lensing and tSZ fields, and show that our model can jointly fit these statistics measured in IllustrisTNG to within measurement uncertainties, for scales above $\gtrsim 1 {\rm Mpc}$ and across multiple redshifts. The model predictions change only minimally when including additional information from secondary halo properties, such as halo concentration and ellipticity. Each individual moment is dependent on halos of different mass ranges and has different sensitivities to the model parameters. A simulation-based forecast on the ULAGAM simulation suite shows that the combination of all moments, measured from current and upcoming lensing and tSZ surveys, can jointly constrain cosmology and baryons to high precision. The lensing and tSZ field are sensitive to different combinations of the baryonification parameters, with degeneracy directions that are often orthogonal, and the combination of the two fields leads to significantly better constraints on both cosmology and astrophysics. Our pipeline for map-level baryonification is publicly available at https://github.com/DhayaaAnbajagane/Baryonification.</description>

      <title>STAR NRE: Solving supernova selection effects with set-based truncated auto-regressive neural ratio estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accounting for selection effects in supernova type Ia (SN Ia) cosmology is crucial for unbiased cosmological parameter inference -- even more so for the next generation of large, mostly photometric-only surveys. The conventional "bias correction" procedure has a built-in systematic bias towards the fiducial model used to derive it and fails to account for the additional Eddington bias that arises in the presence of significant redshift uncertainty. On the other hand, Bayesian hierarchical models scale poorly with the data set size and require explicit assumptions for the selection function that may be inaccurate or contrived. To address these limitations, we introduce STAR NRE, a simulation-based approach that makes use of a conditioned deep set neural network and combines efficient high-dimensional global inference with subsampling-based truncation in order to scale to very large survey sizes while training on sets with varying cardinality. Applying it to a simplified SN Ia model consisting of standardised brightnesses and redshifts with Gaussian uncertainties and a selection procedure based on the expected LSST sensitivity, we demonstrate precise and unbiased inference of cosmological parameters and the redshift evolution of the volumetric SN Ia rate from ~100 000 mock SNae Ia. Our inference procedure can incorporate arbitrarily complex selection criteria, including transient classification, in the forward simulator and be applied to complex data like light curves. We outline these and other steps aimed at integrating STAR NRE into an end-to-end simulation-based pipeline for the analysis of future photometric-only SN Ia data.</description>

      <title>On the virialization threshold for halo mass functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent study by Euclid collaboration, the halo mass function (HMF) has been fitted with accuracy better than $1\%$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model. Several parameters were introduced and fitted against N-body simulations, assuming the usual linearly extrapolated matter density contrast at the collapse time, $\delta_c$, as a basic threshold for halo formation. As a result, a new function that multiplies $\delta_c$ was introduced, producing an effective threshold that varies both with redshift and mass scale. We show that the redshift evolution of this effective threshold is similar to the one of the linear extrapolated matter density contrast at the virialization time, $\delta_{\rm v}$. Assuming the Euclid HMF as a fiducial model, we refit the Sheth-Tormen (ST) HMF using $\delta_{\rm v}$ as a threshold. This new fit improves the agreement between ST-HMF and the Euclid one with respect to Despali et al. (2016) fit, specially at high masses. Interestingly, the parameters $a$ and $p$ in this refit have values closer to the Press-Schechter limit of the ST-HMF, showing that the use of $\delta_{\rm v}$ can provide semi-analytical HMF less dependent on extra parameters. Moreover, we analyze the consistency of the ST-HMF fitted with $\delta_{\rm v}$ in smooth dark energy models with time-varying equation of state, finding an overall good agreement with the evolution of halo abundances expected from the linear evolution of perturbations and the Euclid HMF extrapolated to these scenarios. These findings suggest that the use $\delta_{\rm v}$ as a basic function to describe the threshold for halo formation can be a good guide when considering extrapolations for models beyond $\Lambda$CDM, which are typically harder to study in simulations.</description>

      <title>Primordial Bounce-Inflation Scenario to Alleviate Cosmological Tensions and Lensing Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We put forward a primordial scenario to alleviate cosmological tensions, i.e. Hubble ($H_0$) tension and $ S_8 $ tension. Based on flat $\Lambda$CDM, the Bounce-Inflation (BI) scenario gives the results that $ H_0 = 68.60^{+0.40}_{-0.45} \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.806 \pm 0.011 $ by using \texttt{Planck 2018} data sets and $ H_0 = 68.96 \pm 0.38 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.797\pm 0.010 $ by using \texttt{Planck 2018} + \texttt{SPT3G} data sets. These reduce the cosmological tensions slightly. We also take an extended $\Lambda$CDM model into account, $\Lambda$CDM (BI)+$A_L$, where $ A_L $ is the gravitational lensing amplitude. The results are $ H_0 = 69.38 \pm 0.49 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.774 \pm 0.014 $ fitted by \texttt{Planck 2018} data sets and $ H_0 = 69.49 \pm 0.45 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.771^{+0.013}_{-0.012} $ fitted by \texttt{Planck 2018} + \texttt{SPT3G} data sets, which reduce the Hubble tension to $\sim 3\sigma $ level and show no $S_8 $ tension. The $A_L \approx 1.1$ is smaller than the result of the inflation scenario with a constraint of \texttt{Planck 2018} data sets. Besides, the spectral index of the bounce-inflation scenario $ n_s $ is about $ 0.98 $, with a trend to the Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of oscillons and transients during preheating after single field inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the single-field model, the preheating process occurs through self-resonance of inflaton field. We study the nonlinear structures generated during preheating in the $\alpha$-attractor models and monodromy models. The potentials have a power law form $\propto\left|\phi\right|^{2n}$ near the origin and a flat region away from bottom, which are consistent with current cosmological observations. The Floquet analysis shows that potential parameters in monodromy model have a significant influence on the region of resonance bands. The analytical oscillons solution for the $\alpha$-attractor T model with parameter $n=1$ is derived using the small amplitude analysis method. Besides we investigate the formation of nonlinear structures, the equation of state and the energy transfer through the (3+1) dimensional lattice simulation. We find that the symmetric T potential and the asymmetric E potential in the $\alpha$-attractor models have similar nonlinear dynamics. And the potential parameter $n$ in monodromy model significantly influences the lifetime of transients, whereas the parameter $q$ exerts minimal impact on the nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>AxionH0graphy: hunting for ultralight dark matter with cosmographic H$_0$ bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If ultralight boson fields exist, then vacuum misalignment populates them with nonzero relic abundance. For a broad range of particle mass $m$ the field condenses into fuzzy cores in massive galaxies. We use numerical simulations to test this idea, extending previous work (Blum and Teodori 2021) and focusing on ultralight dark matter (ULDM) that makes-up a subdominant fraction of the total dark matter density, consistent with observational constraints. Our simulations mimic galactic halos and explore different initial conditions and levels of sophistication in the modeling of the halo potential. For $m\sim10^{-25}$ eV ULDM cores act as approximate internal mass sheets in strong gravitational lensing, and could first be detected as an $H_0$ bias in cosmography: a scenario we dub AxionH0graphy. The mass sheet degeneracy is broken by finite core radius and by the dynamical displacement of cores from the halo center of mass, which introduce imaging distortions and restrict the $H_0$ bias limit of AxionH0graphy to $m\lesssim5\times10^{-25}$ eV. Cosmological simulations are called for to sharpen the predicted connection between the amplitude of ULDM galactic cores and the ULDM cosmological fraction.</description>

      <title>A Double-Sine-Gordon Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A solitonic model of the early universe is introduced by employing the Double-Sine-Gordon (DSG) potential. The model predicts the appropriate number of e-foldings ($N_e$) required for favored inflation and is an advantage for the model in addressing the flatness, horizon, and magnetic monopole problems. Compatibility of the model with observations, including the Planck $2018$ data \cite{Akrami et al. (2020)} and the Planck $2018$ data+BK$18$+BAO \cite{Ade et al. (2021)} paves the way to estimate the model's free parameters. The results generate acceptable and proper values for the spectral index ($n_s$) and the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) in agreement with the Planck $2018$ data \cite{Akrami et al. (2020)} and the Planck $2018$ data+BK$18$+BAO \cite{Ade et al. (2021)}. Correspondingly, a consistent description of the reheating era is obtained, yielding positive reheating number of e-foldings ($N_{\mathrm{reh}}$) and reheating final temperature ($T_{\mathrm{reh}}$) from $10^{-2}$ GeV to $10^{16}$ GeV. Overall, the model seems viable at the inflationary and reheating eras.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first homogeneous release of several thousand Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), all having spectroscopic classification, and spectroscopic redshifts for half the sample. This release, named the "DR2", contains 3628 nearby (z &lt; 0.3) SNe Ia discovered, followed and classified by the Zwicky Transient Facility survey between March 2018 and December 2020. Of these, 3000 have good-to-excellent sampling and 2667 pass standard cosmology light-curve quality cuts. This release is thus the largest SN Ia release to date, increasing by an order of magnitude the number of well characterized low-redshift objects. With the "DR2", we also provide a volume-limited (z &lt; 0.06) sample of nearly a thousand SNe Ia. With such a large, homogeneous and well controlled dataset, we are studying key current questions on SN cosmology, such as the linearity SNe Ia standardization, the SN and host dependencies, the diversity of the SN Ia population, and the accuracy of the current light-curve modeling. These, and more, are studied in detail in a series of articles associated with this release. Alongside the SN Ia parameters, we publish our force-photometry gri-band light curves, 5138 spectra, local and global host properties, observing logs, and a python tool to ease use and access of these data. The photometric accuracy of the "DR2" is not yet suited for cosmological parameter inference, which will follow as "DR2.5" release. We nonetheless demonstrate that the multi-thousand SN Ia Hubble Diagram has a typical 0.15 mag scatter.</description>

      <title>Memory burden effect mimics reheating signatures on SGWB from ultra-low mass PBH domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-low mass primordial black holes (PBH), briefly dominating the expansion of the universe, would leave detectable imprints in the secondary stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Such a scenario leads to a characteristic doubly peaked spectrum of SGWB and strongly depends on the Hawking evaporation of such light PBHs. However, these observable signatures are significantly altered if the memory burden effect during the evaporation of PBHs is taken into account. We show that for the SGWB induced by PBH density fluctuations, the memory burden effects on the Hawking evaporation of ultra-low mass PBHs can mimic the signal arising due to the non-standard reheating epoch before PBH domination. Finally, we point out that this degeneracy can be broken by the simultaneous detection of the first peak in the SGWB, which is typically induced by the inflationary adiabatic perturbations.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Linearized Gravity in Atom Interferometers: a Simplified Computational Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for calculating the leading-order, fully-relativistic contributions to the gravitational phase shift in single-photon atom interferometers within the context of linearized gravity. We show that the atom gradiometer observable, which only depends on the atom interferometer propagation phase, can be written in terms of three distinct contributions: the Doppler phase shift, which accounts for the tidal displacement of atoms along the baseline, the Shapiro phase shift, which accounts for the delay in the arrival time of photons at atom-light interaction points, and the Einstein phase shift, which accounts for the gravitational redshift measured by the atoms. For specific atom gradiometer configurations, we derive the signal and response functions for two physically-motivated scenarios: ($i$) transient gravitational waves in the transverse-traceless gauge and, for the first time, in the proper detector frame, and ($ii$) transient massive objects sourcing weak and slow-varying Newtonian potentials. We find that the Doppler contribution of realistic Newtonian noise sources ($e.g.$, a freight truck or a piece of space debris) at proposed atom gradiometer experiments, such as AION, MAGIS and AEDGE, can exceed the shot noise level and thus affect physics searches if not properly subtracted.</description>

      <title>Interstellar medium gas heating by primordial black holes and dark matter particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Leo T dwarf galaxy has been utilized to investigate the heating of interstellar medium gas by both primordial black holes (PBHs) and dark matter (DM) particles. Previous studies have typically assumed that either PBHs or DM particles are responsible for heating the interstellar medium gas. In contrast, this study considers the simultaneous contribution of both PBHs and DM particles to the heating process.
  If both PBHs and dark photons heat the gas in Leo T, a stringent constraint on the PBH fraction, $f_{\rm PBH}=\rho_{\rm PBH}/\rho_{\rm DM}$ is obtained for $4 \lesssim M_{\rm PBH}/M_\odot \lesssim 10^2$, where $\rho_{\rm PBH}$, $\rho_{\rm DM}$, represent the energy densities of PBHs and DM, respectively, and $M_{\rm PBH}$, and $M_\odot$ denote the masses of PBHs and Sun, respectively. Conversely, if both PBHs and millicharged particles heat the gas, it becomes challenging to impose a more significant constraint on the PBH fraction than previously achieved, due to the very small allowed values of charge parameters within the model.</description>

      <title>The LBT Satellites of Nearby Galaxies Survey (LBT-SONG): The Diffuse Satellite Population of Local Volume Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of the Large Binocular Telescope Satellites Of Nearby Galaxies Survey (LBT-SONG) ``Far Sample,'' including survey completeness estimates. We find 10 satellite candidates in the inner virial regions of 13 star-forming galaxies outside the Local Group. The hosts are at distances between $\sim 5-11$ Mpc and have stellar masses in the little explored range of $\sim 5 \times 10^8 - 5\times 10^{10}~\text{M}_{\odot}$. Among the 10 satellite candidates, 3 are new discoveries in this survey. In this paper, we characterize the properties of 8 low-mass satellite candidates, including the 3 new discoveries but excluding 2 well-studied massive satellites. Of the 8 low-mass dwarfs, optical colors from the LBT imaging and measurements in the ultraviolet with GALEX suggest that 2 show signs of active star formation, and 6 are likely quenched (although some may still have H\textsc{i} gas reservoirs). Notably, we report the discovery of an ultrafaint dwarf candidate, NGC 672 dwD, with $\text{M}_{\text{V}} = -6.6$ and an estimated stellar mass of $5.6 \times 10^4 ~\text{M}_{\odot}$ if its association with the host is confirmed. It is spatially coincident with a weak detection of H\textsc{i}, with $\text{M}_{\text{HI}}/\text{M}_{\text{*}} \sim 1$. If confirmed, it would be the least luminous known ultrafaint satellite to be so gas-rich. The prevalence of quenched satellites in our sample suggests there are environmental effects at work in lower mass hosts that are similar to those at play in Milky Way-size hosts, although the preponderance of H\textsc{i} detections is at odds with the paucity of H\textsc{i} detections in Milky Way satellites. By robustly measuring our survey completeness function, we are able to compare our observational results to predictions from theory, finding good agreement with the Cold Dark Matter galaxy evolution paradigm.</description>

      <title>Dependence of Galaxy Stellar Properties on the Primordial Spin Factor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical discovery that the observable stellar properties of present galaxies retain significant dependences on the primordial density and tidal fields. Analyzing the galaxy catalogs from the IllustrisTNG 300-1 simulations, we first compute the primordial spin factor, $\tau$, defined as the mean degree of misalignments between the principal axes of the initial density and potential hessian tensors at the protogalactic sites. Then, we explore in the framework of Shannon's information theory if and how strongly each of six stellar properties of the present galaxies, namely the stellar sizes, ages, specific star formation rates, optical colors and metallicities, share mutual information with $\tau$, measured at $z=127$. The TNG galaxy samples are deliberately controlled to have no differences in the mass, environmental density and shear distributions and to single out net effects of $\tau$ on each of the galaxy stellar properties. In the higher stellar mass range of $M_{\star}/(h^{-1}\,M_{\odot})\ge 10^{10}$, significant amounts of mutual information with $\tau$ are exhibited by all of the six stellar properties, while in the lower range of $M_{\star}/(h^{-1}\,M_{\odot})&lt; 10^{10}$ only four of the six properties except for the specific star formation rates and colors yield significant signals of $\tau$-dependence. It is also shown that the galaxy stellar sizes, which turn out to be most robustly dependent on $\tau$ regardless of $M_{\star}$, follow a {\it bimodal} Gamma distribution, the physical implication of which is discussed.</description>

      <title>CLOWN: The PASO cloud detection for optimization of automatic optical surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbiting space objects have become in the last decade a major nuisance impacting ground astronomy and orbiting space assets, from observatories to satellites and space stations. In particular with the rise of the satellite population in Low Earth Orbits (LEOs), space objects are becoming an even bigger threat and a strong problem to astronomical observations. To tackle these threats several coordinated surveillance networks composed of dedicated sensors (telescopes, radars and laser ranging facilities) track and survey space objects, from debris to active satellites. As part of the European Space Surveillance \&amp; Tracking (EU-SST) network, Portugal is developing the PAmpilhosa da Serra Space Observatory (PASO), with both radio and optical telescopes dedicated to the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) domain, deployed at a Dark Sky destination. To optimize telescope survey time, we developed {\tt{CLOWN}} (CLOud Watcher at Night), an application interface that automatically monitors clouds in real time. This software can correctly trace clouds positions in the sky, provides accurate pointing information to the observation planning of the optical telescope to avoid cloudy areas. {\tt{CLOWN}} only requires the use of an all-sky camera, which is already a norm in observatories with optical telescopes and can be used with any camera, including those for which no information about its model specification do exist. {\tt{CLOWN}} does not require great computing power and it does not require the installation of additional equipment. {\tt{CLOWN}} results are very promising and confirm that the app can correctly identify clouds in a variety of different conditions and cloud types.</description>

      <title>The Second-Level Preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes two levels of preheating for the inflaton that is non-minimally coupled with gravity. The first level, later named by the quadratic regime, corresponds to the matter-dominated era and is responsible for draining the inflaton's energy density. The second level, which we will call the quartic regime, corresponds to the radiation-dominated era and is responsible for the reheating of the universe. We investigate the behavior of non-renormalizable higher dimension operators in both the quadratic and quartic regimes. In the quadratic regime, the certain order $n$ in the non-renormalizable higher-dimension operator could lead to an efficient preheating. On the other hand, the non-renormalizable higher dimension operators in the quartic regime are extremely inefficient for any order of $n$. In our work, we also introduce a mechanism controlled by the characteristic momentum $\alpha$ to suppress the particle production during preheating. Additionally, we emphasized the significance of the small momentum of the particles produced during preheating for the abundance of primordial black holes. This result favors the efficient preheating in the quadratic regime. Finally, we evaluate two modes of the reheating temperature, which differ based on the preheating efficiency during the quadratic regime.</description>

      <title>Linear polarization of the stochastic gravitational-wave background with pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar-timing collaborations have recently reported evidence for the detection of an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background consistent with one sourced by a population of inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries. However, a certain degree of anisotropy and polarization may be present. Thus, the characterization of the energy density and polarization of the background at different angular scales is important. In this paper, we describe the signatures of linear polarization in the stochastic gravitational-wave background on the timing residuals obtained with pulsar-timing arrays. We expand the linear polarization map in terms of spin-weighted spherical harmonics and recast it into the $E$-mode (parity even) and $B$-mode (parity odd) basis. We provide expressions for the minimum-variance estimators for the coefficients of that expansion and evaluate the smallest detectable signal as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio with which the isotropic GW signal is detected and the number of pulsars in the survey. We evaluate the covariance between the estimators for the spherical-harmonic coefficients of the linear polarization $E$-modes and those for the intensity anisotropy. We also show that there is no covariance between the spherical-harmonic coefficients for the $B$-modes of the linear polarization and those for the circular polarization, even though both have the same parity. Our approach results in simple, elegant, and easily evaluated expressions for the overlap reduction functions for linear polarization.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Hubble Constant through Galaxy Cluster Gas Mass Fractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain Hubble constant ($H_0$) estimates by using two galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurement samples, Type Ia supernovae luminosity distances, and the validity of the cosmic distance duality relation. Notably, the angular diameter distance (ADD) to each galaxy cluster in the samples is determined by combining its gas mass fraction measurement with galaxy clustering observations, more precisely, the $\Omega_b/\Omega_m$ ratio. Such a combination results in a $H_0$ estimate that is independent of a specific cosmological framework. In one of the samples, the gas fraction measurements were calculated in spherical shells at radii near $r_{\rm 2500}$ (44 data points), while in the other (103 data points) the measurements were calculated within $ r_{\rm 500}$. We find $H_0=72.7^{+6.3}_{-5.6}$ km/s/Mpc at 68\% CL for the joint analysis of these data sets. We also investigate the impact on the $H_0$ determination by exploring the precision and number of gas mass fraction data by performing a data Monte Carlo simulation. Our simulations show that future measurements could achieve a precision of up to 5\% for $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Epoch of Reionization sources on the 21-cm bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The morphology of the 21-cm signal emitted by the neutral hydrogen present in the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) depends both on the properties of the sources of ionizing radiation and on the underlying physical processes within the IGM. Variation in the morphology of the IGM 21-cm signal due to the different sources of the EoR is expected to have a significant impact on the 21-cm bispectrum, which is one of the crucial observable statistics that can evaluate the non-Gaussianity present in the signal and which can be estimated from radio interferometric observations of the EoR. Here we present the 21-cm bispectrum for different reionization scenarios assuming different simulated models for the sources of reionization. We also demonstrate how well the 21-cm bispectrum can distinguish between different IGM 21-cm signal morphologies, arising due to the differences in the reionization scenarios, which will help us shed light on the nature of the sources of ionizing photons. Our estimated large-scale bispectrum for all unique $k$-triangle shapes shows a significant difference in the magnitude and sign across different reionization scenarios. Additionally, our focused analysis of bispectrum for a few specific $k$-triangle shapes (e.g. squeezed-limit, linear, and shapes in the vicinity of the squeezed-limit) shows that the large scale 21-cm bispectrum can distinguish between reionization scenarios that show inside-out, outside-in and a combination of inside-out and outside-in morphologies. These results highlight the potential of using the 21-cm bispectrum for constraining different reionization scenarios.</description>

      <title>mochi_class: Modelling Optimisation to Compute Horndeski In class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce mochi_class, an extension of the Einstein-Boltzmann solver hi_class, designed to unlock the full phenomenological potential of Horndeski gravity. This extension allows for general input functions of time without the need for hard-coded parametrisations or covariant Lagrangians. By replacing the traditional $\alpha$-parametrisation with a set of stable basis functions, mochi_class ensures that the resulting effective theories are inherently free from gradient and ghost instabilities. Additionally, mochi_class features a quasi-static approximation implemented at the level of modified metric potentials, enhancing prediction accuracy, especially for models transitioning between a super- and sub-Compton regime. mochi_class can robustly handle a wide range of models without fine-tuning, and introduces a new approximation scheme that activates modifications to the standard cosmology deep in the matter-dominated era. Furthermore, it incorporates viability conditions on the equation of motion for the scalar field fluctuations, aiding in the identification of numerical instabilities. Through comprehensive validation against other Einstein-Boltzmann solvers, mochi_class demonstrates excellent performance and accuracy, broadening the scope of hi_class by facilitating the study of specific modified gravity models and enabling exploration of previously inaccessible regions of the Horndeski landscape. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/mcataneo/mochi_class_public</description>

      <title>Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for Statistical Inference in Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques for statistical inference of parameters in cosmology. Given the importance of compressing the increasingly complex data vectors used in cosmology, we address questions that impact the constraining power achieved, such as: Are currently used methods effectively lossless? Under what conditions do nonlinear methods, typically based on neural nets, outperform linear methods? Through theoretical analysis and experiments with simulated weak lensing data vectors we compare three standard linear methods and neural network based methods. We propose two linear methods that outperform all others while using less computational resources: a variation of the MOPED algorithm we call e-MOPED and an adaptation of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), which is a method new to cosmology but well known in statistics. Both e-MOPED and CCA utilize simulations spanning the full parameter space, and rely on the sensitivity of the data vector to the parameters of interest. The gains we obtain are significant compared to compression methods used in the literature: up to 30% in the Figure of Merit for $\Omega_m$ and $S_8$ in a realistic Simulation Based Inference analysis that includes statistical and systematic errors. We also recommend two modifications that improve the performance of all methods: First, include components in the compressed data vector that may not target the key parameters but still enhance the constraints on due to their correlations. The gain is significant, above 20% in the Figure of Merit. Second, compress Gaussian and non-Gaussian statistics separately -- we include two summary statistics of each type in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Atom Interferometer Tests of Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.13546v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct detection experiments for dark matter are increasingly ruling out large parameter spaces. However, light dark matter models with particle masses $&lt;$ GeV are still largely unconstrained. Here we examine a proposal to use atom interferometers to detect a light dark matter subcomponent at sub-GeV masses. We describe the decoherence and phase shifts caused by dark matter scattering off of one "arm" of an atom interferometer using a generalized dark matter direct detection framework. This allows us to consider multiple channels: nuclear recoils, hidden photon processes, and axion interactions. We apply this framework to several proposed atom interferometer experiments. Because atom interferometers are sensitive to extremely low momentum deposition and their coherent atoms may give them a boost in sensitivity, these experiments will be highly competitive and complementary to other direct detection methods. In particular, atom interferometers are uniquely able to probe a dark matter sub-component with $m_\chi \lesssim 10~\rm{keV}$. We find that, for a mediator mass $m_\phi=10^{-5}m_\chi$, future atom interferometers could close a gap in the existing constraints on nuclear recoils down to $\bar{\sigma}_n \sim 10^{-42}~\rm{cm}^2$ for $m_\chi \sim 10^{-5} - 10^{-1}~\rm{MeV}$ dark matter masses.</description>

Abstract: Cold-atom analog experiments are a promising new tool for studying relativistic vacuum decay, enabling one to empirically probe early-Universe theories in the laboratory. However, existing proposals place stringent requirements on the atomic scattering lengths that are challenging to realize experimentally. Here we eliminate these restrictions and show that any stable mixture between two states of a bosonic isotope can be used as a faithful relativistic analog. This greatly expands the landscape of suitable experiments, and will expedite efforts to study vacuum decay with cold atoms.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves are a unique probe of the early Universe, as the Universe is transparent to gravitational radiation right back to the end of inflation. In this article, we summarise detection prospects and the wide scope of primordial events that could lead to a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background. Any such background would shed light on what lies beyond the Standard Model, sometimes at remarkably high scales. We overview the range of strategies for detecting a stochastic gravitational wave background before delving deep into three major primordial events that can source such a background. Finally, we summarize the landscape of other sources of primordial backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Scintillating low-temperature calorimeters for direct dark matter search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lack of an unambiguous signal for thermally produced dark matter particles in direct detection, indirect detection, and collider searches calls for broadening the search strategies by probing a wider range of dark matter masses with different detection techniques. One of the most common approaches is to search for nuclear recoils induced by dark matter particles scattering off the target material's nuclei. Low-temperature detectors have proven to provide the required performance to probe dark matter masses from 100 MeV/c$^2$ to 100 GeV/c$^2$ via this channel. Using scintillation light as an ancillary channel is a powerful tool for particle identification and background suppression at the keV-recoil energy scale. The CRESST-III experiment, employing scintillating cryogenic detectors with highly sensitive transition edge sensors and multi-target absorber crystals, achieved unprecedented sensitivities to explore sub-GeV dark matter masses. COSINUS, instead, is a new experiment exploiting the phonon-light technique using sodium iodide crystals with the scope to clarify the long-lasting dark matter claim of the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration. This article reviews the principle of scintillating low-temperature calorimeters with emphasis on the benefits and challenges of this technique for direct dark matter searches in light of the current status and future developments.</description>

Abstract: We investigate future singularities originating from the anisotropy in the Universe. We formulate a new class of singularities in the homogeneous and anisotropic universe, comparing them with the known singularities in the homogeneous and isotropic universe. We also discuss the physical consequences of the new singularities. Moreover, we develop a novel reconstruction method for the anisotropic universe by introducing four scalar fields to reconstruct cosmological models in which future singularities appear. We present an explicit example where the anisotropy may grow in the future up to singularity.</description>

Abstract: Measuring accurate long-duration gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) could provide scientifically fruitful knowledge of massive black hole populations and robust tests for general relatively during the LISA mission. However, the immense computational requirements surrounding EMRI data processing and analysis makes their detection and analysis challenging. We further develop and explore a sparse dictionary learning (SDL) algorithm to expeditiously reconstruct EMRI gravitational waveforms lasting as long as 1 year. A suite of year-long EMRI systems are studied to understand the detection and accurate waveform retrieval prospects of the method. We show that full-year EMRIs can be reconstructed within 2 minutes, some with a false alarm rate less than 0.001/yr and with 1.16 day time windows with mismatch as low as 0.06. This provides an encouraging prospect to use the SDL method for long-duration GW searches like that for EMRIs in this study.</description>

      <title>Light Dark Matter Constraints from SuperCDMS HVeV Detectors Operated Underground with an Anticoincidence Event Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08085</link>

Abstract: This article presents constraints on dark-matter-electron interactions obtained from the first underground data-taking campaign with multiple SuperCDMS HVeV detectors operated in the same housing. An exposure of 7.63 g-days is used to set upper limits on the dark-matter-electron scattering cross section for dark matter masses between 0.5 and 1000 MeV/$c^2$, as well as upper limits on dark photon kinetic mixing and axion-like particle axioelectric coupling for masses between 1.2 and 23.3 eV/$c^2$. Compared to an earlier HVeV search, sensitivity was improved as a result of an increased overburden of 225 meters of water equivalent, an anticoincidence event selection, and better pile-up rejection. In the case of dark-matter-electron scattering via a heavy mediator, an improvement by up to a factor of 25 in cross-section sensitivity was achieved.</description>

      <title>CMB Implications of Multi-field Axio-dilaton Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axio-dilaton models are among the simplest scalar-tensor theories that contain the two-derivative interactions that naturally compete at low energies with the two-derivative inter-actions of General Relativity. Such models are well-motivated as the low energy fields arising from string theory compactification. We summarize these motivations and compute their cosmological evolution, in which the dilaton acts as dark energy and its evolution provides a framework for dynamically evolving particle masses. The derivative axion-dilaton couplings play an important role in the success of these cosmologies. We derive the equations for fluctuations needed to study their implications for the CMB anisotropy, matter spectra and structure growth. We use a modified Boltzmann code to study in detail four benchmark parameter choices, including the vanilla Yoga model, and identify couplings that give viable cosmologies, including some with surprisingly large matter-scalar interactions. The axion has negligible potential for most of the cosmologies we consider but we also examine a simplified model for which the axion potential plays a role, using axion-matter couplings motivated by phenomenological screening considerations. We find such choices can also lead to viable cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Galaxy assembly bias in the stellar-to-halo mass relation for red central galaxies from SDSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report evidence of galaxy assembly bias - the correlation between galaxy properties and biased secondary halo properties at fixed halo mass (M$_H$) - in the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) for red central galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. In the M$_H = 10^{11.5}-10^{13.5} h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ range, central galaxy stellar mass (M$_*$) is correlated with the number density of galaxies within $10 h^{-1}$ Mpc ($\delta_{10}$), a common proxy for halo formation time. This galaxy assembly bias signal is also present when M$_H$, M$_*$, and $\delta_{10}$ are substituted with group luminosity, galaxy luminosity, and metrics of the large-scale density field. To associate differences in $\delta_{10}$ with variations in halo formation time, we fitted a model that accounts for (1) errors in the M$_H$ measured by the Tinker 2021, 2022 group catalog and (2) the level of correlation between halo formation time and M$_*$ at fixed M$_H$. Fitting of this model yields that (1) errors in M$_H$ are 0.15 dex and (2) halo formation time and M$_*$ are strongly correlated (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient ~0.85). At fixed M$_H$, variations of ~0.4 dex in M$_*$ are associated with ~1-3 Gyr variations in halo formation time and in galaxy formation time (from stellar population fitting; Oyarz\'un et al. 2022). These results are indicative that halo properties other than M$_H$ can impact central galaxy assembly.</description>
