      <title>Supermaps between channels of any type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermaps between quantum channels (completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps of matrix algebras) were introduced in [Chiribella et al., EPL 83(3) (2008)]. In this work we generalise to supermaps between channels of any type; by channels we mean CPTP maps of finite-dimensional C*-algebras. Channels include POVMs, quantum instruments, classically controlled families of quantum channels, classical channels, quantum multimeters, and more. We show that deterministic supermaps between channels of any type can be realised using simple circuits, recovering the previous realisation theorems of [Chiribella et al., EPL 83(3) (2008)] (for deterministic supermaps between quantum channels) and [Bluhm et al. (2024)] (for deterministic supermaps between quantum multimeters) as special cases. To prove this realisation theorem we use the graphical calculus of the 2-category of finite-dimensional 2-Hilbert spaces; the paper includes an accessible and elementary introduction to this graphical calculus, and no prior knowledge of category theory is expected of the reader.</description>

      <title>Disconnection Rules are Complete for Chemical Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a category theoretical framework capturing two approaches to graph-based models of chemistry: formal reactions and disconnection rules. We model a translation from the latter to the former as a functor, which is faithful, and full up to isomorphism. This allows us to state, as our main result, that the disconnection rules are sound, complete and universal with respect to the reactions. Concretely, this means that every reaction can be decomposed into a sequence of disconnection rules in an essentially unique way. This provides a uniform way to store reaction data, and gives an algorithmic interface between (forward) reaction prediction and (backward) reaction search or retrosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Descent and generation for noncommutative coherent algebras over schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our work investigates a form of descent, in the fppf and h topologies, for generation of triangulated categories obtained from noncommutative coherent algebras over schemes. In addition, also the behaviour of generation with respect to the derived pushforward of proper morphisms is studied. This allows us to exhibit many new examples where the associated bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves admit strong generators. We achieve our main results by combining Matthew's concept of descendability with Stevenson's tensor actions on triangulated categories, allowing us to generalize statements regarding generation into the noncommutative setting. In particular, we establish a noncommutative generalization of Aoki's result to Azumaya algebras over quasi-excellent schemes. Moreover, as a byproduct of the tensor action, we extend Olander's result on countable Rouquier dimension to the noncommutative setting for Azumaya algebras over derived splinters, and we extend a result of Ballard-Iyengar-Lank-Mukhopadhyay-Pollitz regarding strong generation for schemes of prime characteristic to the case of Azumaya algebras.</description>

      <title>Normed modules and the categorification of integrations, series expansions, and differentiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the assignment of norms to $\Lambda$-modules over a finite-dimensional algebra $\Lambda$, resulting in the establishment of normed $\Lambda$-modules. Our primary contribution lies in constructing a new category $\mathscr{N}\!\!or^p$ related to normed modules along with its full subcategory $\mathscr{A}^p$. By examining the objects and morphisms in these categories, we establish a framework for understanding the categorification of integration, series expansions and derivatives. Furthermore, we obtain the Stone--Weierstrass approximation theorem in the sense of $\mathscr{A}^p$.</description>
