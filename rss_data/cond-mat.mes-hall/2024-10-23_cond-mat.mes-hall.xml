      <title>Anyonic Braiding in a Chiral Mach-Zehnder Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional quantum statistics are a signature prediction of fractional quantum Hall states, which have long been elusive in experiments. Here, we present the observation of anyonic interference and exchange phases in a novel co-propagating 'optical-like' Mach-Zehnder Interferometer. This architecture is free of charging and backscattering effects that often plague the widely used Fabry-Perot interferometer, thus exhibiting pristine Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interference without fractional phase slips. We studied the three lowest Jain filling factors, {\nu}=1/3, 2/5, and 3/7, which host quasiparticles with fractional charges e*=e/3, e/5, and e/7, respectively. The observed AB interference patterns, plotted as a function of magnetic field B and modulation-gate voltage, VMG (known as pajamas), exhibited the expected flux periodicities: 3{\Phi}0, 5{\Phi}0, and 7{\Phi}0, with {\Phi}0 being the flux quantum. A small biased top gate (TG) deposited in the center of the interferometer induces local quasiparticles that are spatially isolated from the interfering modes. At non-zero TG voltage VTG, quantized phase slips appear in the AB pajamas approximately with every flux quantum that pierces the effective area below the TG. Moreover, when tuning VTG, at a constant magnetic field, abrupt phase jumps corresponding to adding one localized quasiparticle at a time under the top gate appear in the B-VTG pajamas.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intels efforts to build a practical quantum computer are focused on developing a scalable spin-qubit platform leveraging industrial high-volume semiconductor manufacturing expertise and 300 mm fabrication infrastructure. Here, we provide an overview of the design, fabrication, and demonstration of a new customized quantum test chip, which contains 12-quantum-dot spin-qubit linear arrays, code named Tunnel Falls. These devices are fabricated using immersion and extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV), along with other standard high-volume manufacturing (HVM) processes, as well as production-level process control. We present key device features and fabrication details, as well as qubit characterization results confirming device functionality. These results corroborate our fabrication methods and are a crucial step towards scaling of extensible 2D qubit array schemes.</description>

      <title>Tunable Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect via Crystal Order in Spin-Splitting Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect provides dissipationless chiral channels for spin transport, expected as an outstanding candidate in future low-power quantum computation. The spin-splitting band structure is vital for obtaining QAH effect in topological systems, with ferromagnetism indispensable to manipulate the Chern number. Herein, we challenge this wisdom by proposing tunable QAH effect in spin-splitting antiferromagnets with zero magnetization. Since the spin splitting of these unique magnets originates from the alternate crystal environment, the Chern number can be modulated not only by the conventional magnetic order, but also by the crystal order, opening an additional dimension for tuning QAH effect. Our concept is illustrated based on two-dimensional (2D) MnBi2Te4 (MBT) with even septuple layers (SLs), a typical axion insulator with fully magnetic compensation. By interlayer rotation and translation operations, sublattices of MBT with opposite magnetizations are no longer connected by inversion or mirror symmetries, leading to the transition to the QAH insulator. The flexible stacking of 2D materials enables the reversible Chern number by crystal design. Our work fundamentally reveals the crystal-order-dependent QAH effect in spin-splitting antiferromagnets, which would advance QAH effect-based devices towards high controllability, integration density and operation speed.</description>

      <title>Interband contributions to nonlinear transport in semiconductor nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is a crucial ingredient for many potential applications of quantum devices, such as the use of semiconductor nanostructures for quantum computing. It is known that nonlinear conductivities are sensitive to the strength and type of SOI, however, many calculations of nonlinear transport coefficients are based on the semiclassical Boltzmann theory and make simplifying assumptions about scattering effects due to disorder. In this paper we develop and employ a microscopic theory based on the Keldysh formalism that goes beyond simple semiclassical approximations. This approach, for instance, naturally takes into account the effects of interband transitions, Berry curvature, and allows for a more precise treatment of impurity scattering. As a test of this formalism, we consider the nonlinear transport properties in an effective two-band model of one-dimensional nanowires (1DNWs) and two-dimensional hole gases (2DHGs) in the presence of a magnetic field causing Zeeman splittings of the spin states.. We find that the small energy scales in nanostructures mean that interband contributions can be relevant, especially in the dirty limit, and therefore could modify qualitative features found using a purely semiclassical approach. Nonetheless, we find that different types of SOI (linear or cubic) still result in remarkably pronounced different in-plane field angle dependences, which survive even when interband effects are relevant. Our results provide a detailed understanding of when interband effects become important for nonlinear transport and can serve as the basis for a microscopic description to predict other nonlinear transport effects in materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Wave function forms of interlayer excitons in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically solve the electron-hole relative wave function of interlayer excitons in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides, taking into account the screening effects from both the constituent transition metal dichalcogenides layers and the surrounding dielectric environment. We find that the wave function of the 1s ground state is close to the gaussian form, rather than the well-known exponential decay form of the two-dimensional hydrogen model. Meanwhile, the 2s state has an energy $E_{2s}$ significantly higher than $E_{2p}$ of the 2p state, but becomes close to $E_{3d}$ of the 3d state with $E_{2s}-E_{2p} \approx E_{3d}-E_{2p} \approx E_{2p}-E_{1s}$ under a large interlayer separation and weak environmental screening. Under general conditions, the solved 1s, 2p and 3d wave functions can be fit nearly perfectly by simple analytic forms which smoothly cross from gaussian to exponential decay. These analytic forms can facilitate the accurate evaluation of various exciton quantities for device applications.</description>

      <title>Modulation of charge and spin circular currents in a ring-wire hybrid setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into the charge and spin circular currents in a mesoscopic hybrid system, with a particular focus on the intricate interplay between the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) potential, Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux, chemical potential ($\mu$), and antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering. The proposed quantum system comprises a composite structure of an AF ring coupled to an AAH chain. Utilizing a tight-binding model and operator method to calculate charge and spin circular currents, we uncover a range of intriguing phenomena. An interesting finding is that while the antiferromagnetic ring alone does not exhibit spin channel separation due to the symmetry between the up and down spin sub-Hamiltonians, the introduction of a dangling bond or chain can break this symmetry, leading to a spin separation effect. The AAH potential in the chain disrupts energy level symmetry, significantly impacting transport behavior. The charge circular current exhibits periodic oscillations with the AB flux, and its polarity changes with variations in $\mu$. The AAH phase affects the charge current through the shifting of energy levels. Furthermore, the spin current displays oscillatory behavior as the AAH potential strength changes, with peaks emerging due to interference phenomena caused by disorder-induced localization. A possible experimental realization of our proposed quantum setup is also discussed, for the sake of completeness. This work may provide important insights into the complex physics of charge and spin transport in various hybrid mesoscopic systems, offering promising avenues for future research and technological applications.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory for a minimal oscillator model of exciton-plasmon coupling in hybrids of 2d semiconductors and metal nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The common model to describe exciton-plasmon interaction phenomenologically is the coupled oscillator model. Originally developed for atomic systems rather than solid-state matter, this model treats both excitons and plasmons as single harmonic oscillators coupled via a constant which can be fitted to experiments. In this work, we present a modified coupled oscillator model specifically designed for exciton-plasmon interactions in hybrids composed of two-dimensional excitons, such as in a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers and metal nanoparticles while maintaining the simplicity of the commonly applied coupled oscillator models. Our approach is based on a microscopic perspective and Maxwell's equations, allowing to analytically derive an effective exciton-plasmon coupling constant. Our findings highlight the importance of the spatial dispersion, i.e., the delocalized nature of TMDC excitons, necessitating the distinction between bright and momentum-dark excitons. Both types of excitons occur at different resonance energies and exhibit a qualitatively different coupling with localized plasmons. We find a strong coupling between the plasmon and momentum-dark excitons, while a weakly coupled bright exciton manifests as an additional, third peak in the spectrum. Consequently, we propose a realistic modeling of the primary spectral features in experiments incorporating three harmonic oscillator equations instead of the conventional two. However, we also shed light on the limitations of the three coupled oscillator model in describing the line shape of extinction and scattering cross section spectra.</description>

      <title>Industrially fabricated single-electron quantum dots in Si/Si-Ge heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports the compatibility of heterostructure-based spin qubit devices with industrial CMOS technology. It features Si/Si-Ge quantum dot devices fabricated using Infineon's 200 mm production line within a restricted thermal budget. The devices exhibit state-of-the-art charge sensing, charge noise and valley splitting characteristics, showing that industrial fabrication is not harming the heterostructure quality. These measured parameters are all correlated to spin qubit coherence and qubit gate fidelity. We describe the single electron device layout, design and its fabrication process using electron beam lithography. The incorporated standard 90 nm back-end of line flow for gate-layer independent contacting and wiring can be scaled up to multiple wiring layers for scalable quantum computing architectures. In addition, we present millikelvin characterization results. Our work exemplifies the potential of industrial fabrication methods to harness the inherent CMOS-compatibility of the Si/Si-Ge material system, despite being restricted to a reduced thermal budget. It paves the way for advanced quantum processor architectures with high yield and device quality.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Manipulation of Non-Hermitian Skin Effect through Frequency in Topolectrical Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most fascinating phenomena in non-Hermitian systems is the extensive accumulation of the bulk eigenstates under open-boundary conditions which is known as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NSHE). Here, we propose a switchable NHSE in a topolectrical (TE) set-up which can be turned on or off simply by varying the driving frequency without any modification to the physical circuit. Specifically, we consider a coupled system consisting of two non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson chains where each node of one chain is connected to neighboring node of the other chain via resistive couplings with opposite signs for the two coupling directions. Interestingly, the NHSE is switched on only if the driving frequency is greater than a certain critical frequency. Conversely, the NHSE in the coupled system is switched off when the frequency falls below the critical value, even though the individual uncoupled chains still exhibit the NHSE. This frequency-controlled NHSE may pave the way for many possible applications including non-Hermitian sensors where the driving frequency can manipulate the current and voltage localization.</description>

      <title>Automatic Extraction and Compensation of P-Bit Device Variations in Large Array Utilizing Boltzmann Machine Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic Bit (P-Bit) device serves as the core hardware for implementing Ising computation. However, the severe intrinsic variations of stochastic P-Bit devices hinder the large-scale expansion of the P-Bit array, significantly limiting the practical usage of Ising computation. In this work, a behavioral model which attributes P-Bit variations to two parameters {\alpha} and {\Delta}V is proposed. Then the weight compensation method is introduced, which can mitigate {\alpha} and {\Delta}V of P-Bits device variations by rederiving the weight matrix, enabling them to compute as ideal identical PBits without the need for weights retraining. Accurately extracting the {\alpha} and {\Delta}V simultaneously from a large P-Bit array which is prerequisite for the weight compensation method is a crucial and challenging task. To solve this obstacle, we present the novel automatic variation extraction algorithm which can extract device variations of each P-Bit in a large array based on Boltzmann machine learning. In order for the accurate extraction of variations from an extendable P-Bit array, an Ising Hamiltonian based on 3D ferromagnetic model is constructed, achieving precise and scalable array variation extraction. The proposed Automatic Extraction and Compensation algorithm is utilized to solve both 16-city traveling salesman problem(TSP) and 21-bit integer factorization on a large P-Bit array with variation, demonstrating its accuracy, transferability, and scalability.</description>

      <title>Production of Ultra-Thin and High-Quality Nanosheet Networks via Layer-by-Layer Assembly at Liquid-Liquid Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solution-processable 2D materials are promising candidates for a range of printed electronics applications. Yet maximising their potential requires solution-phase processing of nanosheets into high-quality networks with carrier mobility ({\mu}Net) as close as possible to that of individual nanosheets ({\mu}NS). In practise, the presence of inter-nanosheet junctions generally limits electronic conduction, such that the ratio of junction resistance (RJ) to nanosheet resistance (RNS), determines the network mobility via . Hence, achieving RJ/RNS&lt;1 is a crucial step for implementation of 2D materials in printed electronics applications. In this work, we utilise an advanced liquid-interface deposition process to maximise nanosheet alignment and network uniformity, thus reducing RJ. We demonstrate the approach using graphene and MoS2 as model materials, achieving low RJ/RNS values of 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. The resultant graphene networks show a high conductivity of {\sigma}Net = 5 \times 104 S/m while our semiconducting MoS2 networks demonstrate record mobility of {\mu}Net = 30 cm2/Vs, both at extremely low network thickness (tNet &lt;10 nm). Finally, we show that the deposition process is compatible with non-layered quasi-2D materials such as silver nanosheets (AgNS), achieving network conductivity close to bulk silver for networks &lt;100 nm thick. We believe this work is the first to report nanosheet networks with RJ/RNS&lt;1 and serves to guide future work in 2D materials-based printed electronics.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the non-Abelian property of Andreev bound states in inhomogeneous Majorana nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian braiding is a key property of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) that can be utilized for topological quantum computation. However, the presence of trivial Andreev bound states (ABSs) in topological superconductors can hinder the non-Abelian braiding of MZMs. We systematically investigate the braiding properties of ABSs induced by various inhomogeneous potentials in nanowires and quantify the main obstacles to non-Abelian braiding. We find that if a trivial ABSs is present at zero energy with a tiny energy fluctuation, their non-Abelian braiding property can be sustained for a longer braiding time cost, since the undesired dynamic phase is suppressed. Under certain conditions, the non-Abelian braiding of ABSs can even surpass that of MZMs in realistic systems, suggesting that ABSs might also be suitable for topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Majorana-metal transition in a disordered superconductor: percolation in a landscape of topological domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most superconductors are thermal insulators. A disordered chiral \textit{p}-wave superconductor, however, can make a transition to a thermal metal phase. Because heat is then transported by Majorana fermions, this phase is referred to as a Majorana metal. Here we present numerical evidence that the mechanism for the phase transition with increasing electrostatic disorder is the percolation of boundaries separating domains of different Chern number. We construct the network of domain walls using the spectral localizer as a ``topological landscape function'', and obtain the thermal metal--insulator phase diagram from the percolation transition.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Thomson's model with multiply charged superfluid helium nanodroplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study superfluid helium droplets multiply charged with ions. When stable, the charges are found to reside in equilibrium close to the droplet surface, thus representing a physical realization of Thomson's model. We find the minimum radius of the helium droplet that can host a given number of ions using a model whose physical ingredients are the solvation energy of the cations, calculated within the He-DFT approach, and their mutual Coulomb repulsion energy. Our model goes beyond the often used liquid drop model, where charges are smeared out either within the droplet or on its surface, and which neglects the solid-like helium shell around the ions. We find that below a threshold droplet radius R_0, the total energy of the system becomes higher than that of the separated system of the pristine helium droplet and the charges embedded in their solvation microcluster ("snowball"). However, the ions are still kept within the droplet by the presence of energy barriers which hinder Coulomb explosion. A further reduction of the droplet radius below a value R_expl eventually results in the disappearance of such barrier, leading to Coulomb explosion. Surprisingly, our results are rather insensitive to the ion atomic species. This makes room to discuss them in the context of intrinsic multicharged helium droplets, where the charges are triatomic He3+ ions. Our calculated values for R_expl display the correct scaling with the number of cations compared to available experimental results, at variance with other estimates for the critical radii.</description>

      <title>Nanothermodynamics: There's plenty of room on the inside</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanothermodynamics provides the theoretical foundation for understanding stable distributions of statistically independent subsystems inside larger systems. In this review it is emphasized that adapting ideas from nanothermodynamics to simplistic models improves agreement with the measured properties of many materials. Examples include non-classical critical scaling near ferromagnetic transitions, thermal and dynamic behavior near liquid-glass transitions, and the 1/f-like noise in metal films and qubits. A key feature in several models is to allow separate time steps for distinct conservation laws: one type of step conserves energy and the other conserves momentum (e.g. dipole alignment). This "orthogonal dynamics" explains how the relaxation of a single parameter can exhibit multiple responses such as primary, secondary, and microscopic peaks in the dielectric loss of supercooled liquids, and the crossover in thermal fluctuations from Johnson-Nyquist (white) noise at high frequencies to 1/f-like noise at low frequencies. Nanothermodynamics also provides new insight into three basic questions. First, it gives a novel solution to Gibbs' paradox for the entropy of the semi-classical ideal gas. Second, it yields the stable equilibrium of Ising's original model for finite-sized chains of interacting binary degrees of freedom ("spins"). Third, it confronts Loschmidt's paradox for the arrow of time, showing that an intrinsically irreversible step is required for maximum entropy and the second law of thermodynamics, not only in the thermodynamic limit but also in systems as small as N=2 particles</description>

      <title>Modal decomposition of localized plasmon on gold nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localized surface plasmons (LSPs) are collective oscillations of free electrons in metal nanoparticles that confine electromagnetic waves into subwavelength regions, making them an ideal platform for light-matter coupling. To design and understand plasmonic structures, numerical computations of Maxwell's equations are commonly used. However, obtaining physical insight from these numerical solutions can be challenging, especially for complex-shaped nanoparticles. To circumvent this, we introduce mode decomposition strategies within the boundary element method (BEM). By employing singular value decomposition (SVD) and quasi-normal mode (QNM) decomposition, we break down optical responses into elementary modes. QNMs offer deeper insights into frequency and damping, while SVD modes allow for more accurate spectral reconstruction with fast computation. These techniques provide a deeper understanding of LSPs and facilitates the design of metal nanoparticles for efficient light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear semiclassical spectroscopy of ultrafast molecular polariton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways which are not possible in free space. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase effects in dipole superfluids: vortex lattices and singular domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the response of dipole superfluids to an applied electromagnetic field, drawing parallels to the Meissner effect in conventional superconductors. While superconductors, consisting of electric monopoles, interact with magnetic fields via the Aharonov-Bohm phase, magnetic-dipole superfluids -- composed of charge-neutral particles with magnetic dipole moments -- interact with electric fields through the Aharonov-Casher phase, where spatially modulating electric fields act as pseudo-magnetic fields. This leads to a distinct response compared to conventional superconductors. We develop a phenomenological theory to describe this behavior, revealing that the magnetic-dipole superfluid under a pseudo-magnetic field forms a vortex lattice, separated by singular domain walls where the pseudo-magnetic field and the charge density diverge. A similar effect is predicted in electric-dipole superfluids, where electric and magnetic roles are reversed, establishing the singular domain wall formation as a fundamental property of dipole condensates.</description>

      <title>Single particle tracking of polymer aggregates inside disordered porous media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion motions of individual polymer aggregates in disordered porous media were visualized using the single particle tracking (SPT) method because the motions inside porous media play important roles in various fields of science and engineering. The aggregates diffused on the surfaces of pores; continuous adsorption and desorption processes were obserbed. The relationship between the size of the aggregates and pore size was analysed based on diffusion coefficients, moment scaling spectrum (MSS) slope, and diffusion anisotropy analyisies. The obtained diffusion coefficients were different for different the aggregate and pore sizes. The MSS Slope analysis indicated that more than 85% of the aggregates were confined diffusion for all the conditions investigated. The diffusion anisotropies analysis suggested that the diffusions of the aggregates were anisotropic. The interactions between the aggregates and the pores were complex and exhibited different motions than surface diffusion of smooth surfaces.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions for ultra-fast precessional switching in inertial magnetization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we consider the magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic nanoparticles or films driven by external magnetic field pulses directed transverse to the initial equilibrium state. The excitation pulse drives large-angle ultra-fast magnetization dynamics that may eventually end up in the reversed equilibrium realizing successful precessional switching. We consider ultra-short pulse duration (fractions of picosecond) and large external field intensities (several Tesla) which may be relevant for the realization of faster energy-efficient memory cells. For such short time scales, we include inertial effects in the theoretical description by considering the inertial Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation which requires to be treated as a system of singularly perturbed ODEs for small values of the inertia. By using suitable perturbation approach based on multiple time scales analysis, we develop an approximate closed-form solution for the switching dynamics as well as formulas for switching time and its safety tolerances to obtain the successful switching as function of physical parameters of the particle and strength of magnetic inertia. The developed analytical solution is validated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A single-phase epitaxially grown ferroelectric perovskite nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of ferroelectrics with semiconductors is crucial for developing functional devices, such as field-effect transistors, tunnel junctions, and nonvolatile memories. However, the synthesis of high-quality single-crystalline ferroelectric nitride perovskites has been limited, hindering a comprehensive understanding of their switching dynamics and potential applications. Here we report the synthesis and characterizations of epitaxial single-phase ferroelectric cerium tantalum nitride (CeTaN3) on both oxides and semiconductors. The polar symmetry of CeTaN3 was confirmed by observing the atomic displacement of central ions relative to the center of the TaN6 octahedra, as well as through optical second harmonic generation. We observed switchable ferroelectric domains in CeTaN3 films using piezo-response force microscopy, complemented by the characterization of square-like polarization-electric field hysteresis loops. The remanent polarization of CeTaN3 reaches approximately 20 uC/cm2 at room temperature, consistent with theoretical calculations. This work establishes a vital link between ferroelectric nitride perovskites and their practical applications, paving the way for next-generation information and energy-storage devices with enhanced performance, scalability, and manufacturability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-beam microscopy and spectroscopy featuring atomic-scale spatial resolution have become essential tools used daily in almost all branches of nanoscale science and technology. As a natural supercontinuum source of light, free electrons couple with phonons, plasmons, electron-hole pairs, inter- and intra-band transitions, and inner-shell ionization. The multiple excitations, intertwined with the intricate nature of nanostructured samples, present significant challenges in isolating specific spectral characteristics amidst complex experimental backgrounds. Here we introduce the approach of synthetic complex frequency waves to mitigate these challenges in free-electron--light interaction. The complex frequency waves, created through causality-informed coherent superposition of real-frequency waves induced by free electrons, offer virtual gain to offset material losses. This amplifies and enhances spectral features, as confirmed by our electron energy loss and cathodoluminescence measurements on multi-layer membranes, suspended nanoparticles, and film-coupled nanostructures. Strikingly, we reveal that our approach can retrieve resonance excitation completed buried underneath the zero-loss peak, substantially enhance the quality of hyperspectral imaging, and resolve entangled multiple-photon--electron events in their quantum interaction. Our findings indicate the versatile utility of complex frequency waves in various electron-beam spectroscopy and their promising diagnostic capabilities in free-electron quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of Binary Nanocrystal Superlattices and the Relevance of Short-Range Attraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The synthesis of binary nanocrystal superlattices (BNSLs) enables the targeted integration of orthogonal physical properties, like photoluminescence and magnetism, into a single superstructure, unlocking a vast design space for multifunctional materials. Yet, the formation mechanism of BNSLs remains poorly understood, restricting the use of simulation to predict the structure and properties of the superlattices. Here, we use a combination of in situ scattering and molecular simulation to elucidate the self-assembly of two common BNSLs through emulsion templating. Our self-assembly experiments reveal that no intermediate structures precede the formation of the final binary phases, indicating that their formation proceeds through classical nucleation. Using simulations, we find that, despite the formation of AlB2 and NaZn13 typically being attributed to entropy, their self-assembly is most consistent with the nanocrystals possessing short-range interparticle attraction, which we find can dramatically accelerate nucleation kinetics in BNSLs. We also find homogenous, classical nucleation in simulation, corroborating our experiments. These results establish a robust correspondence between experiment and theory, paving the way towards a priori prediction of BNSLs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) has emerged as a highly promising material for high-temperature applications due to its robust piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and dielectric properties. This study investigates the behavior of Al0.7Sc0.3N thin films in extreme thermal environments, demonstrating functional stability up to 1000{\deg}C, making it suitable for use in aerospace, hypersonics, deep-well, and nuclear reactor systems. Tantalum silicide (TaSi2)/Al0.7Sc0.3N/TaSi2 capacitors were fabricated and characterized across a wide temperature range, revealing robust ferroelectric and dielectric properties, along with significant enhancement in piezoelectric performance. At 1000{\deg}C, the ferroelectric hysteresis loops showed a substantial reduction in coercive field from 4.3 MV/cm to 1.2 MV/cm, while the longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient increased nearly tenfold, reaching 75.1 pm/V at 800{\deg}C. Structural analysis via scanning and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the integrity of the TaSi2/Al0.7Sc0.3N interfaces, even after exposure to extreme temperatures. Furthermore, the electromechanical coupling coefficient was calculated to increase by over 500%, from 12.9% at room temperature to 82% at 700{\deg}C. These findings establish AlScN as a versatile material for high-temperature ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and dielectric applications, offering unprecedented thermal stability and functional enhancement.</description>

Abstract: We study the optical response of a one-dimensional array of strongly nonlinear optical microcavities with alternating tunnel transmissivities, mimicking the paradigmatic Su-Schriefer Heeger model. We show that the non-equilibrium steady state of the bosonic system contains clear signatures of fermionization when the intra-cavity Kerr non-linearity is stronger than both losses and inter-site tunnel coupling. Furthermore, by changing the experimentally controllable parameters detuning and driving strength, in a topologically non-trivial phase, one can selectively excite either the bulk or edge modes or both modes, revealing interesting topological properties in a non-equilibrium system.</description>

Abstract: Building two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures and enhancing their properties through strain engineering unlocks new applications for their constituent materials. In this study, we present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of oxygen-functionalized MXene-based heterostructures (M$_2$CO$_2$ (M=Sc,Zr,Hf)/blue phosphorene), emphasizing their structural, electronic, and thermoelectric properties under the application of various types of strain. Our results indicate a reduction in band gap under strain and metallic transition for in-plane strain (uni- and bi-axial strain). Transition from type-I to type-II could be obtained for Hf$_2$CO$_2$/blueP and Zr$_2$CO$_2$/blueP heterostructure by applying strain, providing a method for their potential application in photocatalytic devices that require type-II band alignment for photogenerated charge separation. We observe a positive correlation between strain and thermoelectric efficiency under most conditions, with a significant enhancement in thermoelectric power factor (PF) and electronic figure of merit (ZTe) achievable in all heterostructures through strain engineering. Among the three heterostructures, Sc$_2$CO$_2$/blueP showed the maximum PF (ZTe) of $11.2 \times 10^{11}$ W/mK$^2$s (43.2) for 2% normal compressive (4% biaxial compressive) strain. These findings suggest that MX-ene/blueP heterostructures hold significant promise for applications in optoelectronics and high-temperature thermoelectric devices.</description>

Abstract: Bosonic codes enable the protection and correction of quantum information in a single continuous variable system. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing based on Floquet Hamiltonian engineering. We construct the target Hamiltonian directly from the target state and engineer the codes states with an adiabatic ramp protocol. We introduce a new universal set of quantum lattice gate composed of only one type of gate element, and develop a systematic decomposition of complex code state preparation and transformation processes into sequences of quantum lattice gates. We apply our method to three basic code states engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and transformation. We also discuss the automatic quantum error correction against photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource.</description>

      <title>Competition between ponderomotive acceleration and attosecond chirps in optimizing attosecond pulse generation in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A practical approach is proposed for efficiently generating ultrashort attosecond pulses (APs) from realistic solid-state materials, aiming to achieve pulse widths comparable to those generated in gases. This approach focuses on modulating the plateau region of the high harmonic spectrum by adjusting the peak vector potential of laser fields through changing photon energy, while maintaining a constant peak electric field. It initiates a competition between heightened ponderomotive acceleration and the attosecond chirp effect, leading to a non-monotonic variation in both intensity and duration of the generated APs. Using hexagonal boron nitride as a prototypical material, we demonstrate the generation of optimal ultrashort pulses with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 143 attoseconds, marking an updated record for the shortest pulse duration from solid-state sources. This strategy shows promise for application across a broad range of materials, offering new pathways to promote high harmonic performance.</description>

      <title>Interpreting tunneling spectroscopic maps of a dinuclear Co(II) complex on gold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscope data from a dinuclear Co(II) complex adsorbed on Au(111) are analysed using density functional theory calculations. We find that the interaction with the substrate substantially changes the geometry of the non-planar molecule. Its electronic states, however, remain fairly similar to those calculated for a gas-phase molecule. The calculations reproduce intriguing contrasts observed in experimental maps of the differential conductance dI/dV and reveal the relative importance of geometric and electronic factors that impinge on the image contrasts. For a meaningful comparison, it is important that the calculations closely mimic the experimental mode of measurement.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a Lattice Supersolid of Subradiant Dipolar Excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In condensed-matter physics, supersolids refer to many-body quantum states breaking translational symmetry while exhibiting off-diagonal long-range order. This combination is debated for commensurate crystals, however it is accessible in lattice potentials fractionally filled by bosons with extended interactions. Here, we report such lattice supersolid with dipolar excitons confined in a sub-wavelength period potential. Excitons implement the Dicke-Hubbard Hamiltonian controlled by spatially extended dipolar and Dicke correlations. At half lattice-filling, these induce both a condensation in a single sub-radiant state and a dipolar quantum order spontaneously breaking the lattice symmetry. This combination signals a lattice supersolid dissipatively prepared across 8x8 sites. Our study underlines that nanoscopic exciton arrays open a route to explore new frontiers of quantum matter, e.g. many-body entanglement, at the interface with quantum nano-photonics.</description>

      <title>Highly correlated two-dimensional electron fluid in best-quality GaAs quantum wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.01035v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetotransport phenomena often provide critically important information about microscopic states and relaxation processes in two-dimensional (2D) electron systems. For example, the independence of magneto-photo-resistance of 2D electrons in best-quality quantum wells on the polarization helicity of incident radio-frequency radiation have been treated as a puzzling effect, which is important for characterization of these systems, but had no well-established explanation up to now. Here we develop a phenomenological model of dynamics of a highly correlated 2D electron fluid in moderate magnetic fields, in which the viscosity and the non-local in time contributions in inter-particle interaction are important. In this system, successive collisions of electrons joined in pairs turn out to be as important as single collisions of statistically independent electrons. The resulting photoresistance exhibits an irregular shape of magnetooscillations, the absence of the dependence on the helicity of the circular polarization of radiation, and a giant peak near the doubled cyclotron frequency. All these effects were observed in experiments on best-quality GaAs quantum wells in moderate magnetic fields at low temperatures. Although the most general conditions of applicability of the developed phenomenological model of the fluid dynamics remains unclarified now, this coincidence can point out that 2D electrons in such systems form the highly correlated viscous fluid.</description>

      <title>Interfering Josephson diode effect in Ta2Pd3Te5 asymmetric edge interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge states in topological systems have attracted great interest due to their robustness and linear dispersions. Here a superconducting-proximitized edge interferometer is engineered on a topological insulator Ta2Pd3Te5 with asymmetric edges to realize the interfering Josephson diode effect (JDE), which hosts many advantages, such as the high efficiency as much as 73% at tiny applied magnetic fields with an ultra-low switching power around picowatt. As an important element to induce such JDE, the second-order harmonic in the current-phase relation is also experimentally confirmed by half-integer Shapiro steps. The interfering JDE is also accompanied by the antisymmetric second harmonic transport, which indicates the corresponding asymmetry in the interferometer, as well as the polarity of JDE. This edge interferometer offers an effective method to enhance the performance of JDE, and boosts great potential applications for future superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Bulk versus surface: Nonuniversal partitioning of the topological magnetoelectric effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17859v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic ground state of a three-dimensional (3D) band insulator with time-reversal ($\Theta$) symmetry or time-reversal times a discrete translation ($\Theta T_{1/2}$) symmetry is classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-valued topological invariant and characterized by quantized magnetoelectric response. Here we demonstrate by explicit calculation in model $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological insulator thin-films that whereas the magnetoelectric response is localized at the surface in the $\Theta$ symmetry (nonmagnetic) case, it is nonuniversally partitioned between surface and interior contributions in the $\Theta T_{1/2}$ (antiferromagnetic) case, while remaining quantized. Within our model the magnetic field induced polarization arises entirely from an anomalous $\mathscr{N}=0$ Landau level subspace within which the projected Hamiltonian is a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model whose topological properties are consistent with those of the starting 3D model. We identify a new connection between the ground-state geometry of that 3D model and surface-interior partitioning in thin films.</description>

      <title>InP/GaSb core-shell nanowires: a novel hole-based platform with strong spin-orbit coupling for full-shell hybrid devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full-shell hybrid nanowires (NWs), structures comprising a superconductor shell that encapsulates a semiconductor (SM) core, have attracted considerable attention in the search for Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, the predicted Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the SM is too small to achieve substantial topological minigaps. In addition, the SM wavefunction spreads all across the section of the nanowire, leading typically to a finite background of trivial subgap states with which MZMs may coexist. To overcome both problems, we explore the advantages of utilizing core-shell hole-band NWs as the SM part of a full-shell hybrid, with an insulating core and an active SM shell. In particular, we consider InP/GaSb core-shell NWs, which allow to exploit the unique characteristics of the III-V compound SM valence bands. We demonstrate that they exhibit a robust hole SOC that emerges from the combination of the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction of the SM active shell and the confinement effects of the nanostructure, thus depending mainly on SM and geometrical parameters. In other words, the SOC is intrinsic and does not rely on neither electric fields, which are non-tunable in a full-shell hybrid geometry, nor on the strain at the interface, contrary to what happens in Ge/Si heterostructures. As a result, core-shell SM hole-band NWs are found to be a promising candidate to explore Majorana physics in full-hell hybrid devices, addressing several challenges in the field.</description>

Abstract: We study the low-frequency noise (LFN), i.e. flicker noise, also referred to as 1/f noise, in 2D networks of molecularly functionalized gold nanoparticles (NMN: nanoparticle-molecule network). We examine the noise behaviors of the NMN hosting alkyl chains (octanethiol), fatty acid oleic acids (oleylamine), redox molecule switches (polyoxometalate derivatives) or photo-isomerizable molecules (azobenzene derivatives) and we compare their 1/f noise behaviors. These noise metrics are used to evaluate which molecules are the best candidates to build in-materio reservoir computing molecular devices based on NMNs.</description>

      <title>Tunneling current and current correlations for anyonic quasiparticles of {\nu} = 1/2 chiral Luttinger liquid in multi-edge geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider anyonic quasiparticles with charge e/2 described by the {\nu} = 1/2 chiral Luttinger liquid, which collide in a Hong-Ou-Mandel-like interferometer. These colliding anyonic channels can be formally viewed as hosting Laughlin-like fractional {\nu} = 1/2 quasiparticles. More specifically, two possible geometries are considered: (i) a two-edge-channel setup where anyons originate from equilibrium reservoirs; (ii) a four-edge-channel setup where nonequilibrium anyons arrive at the collider in the form of diluted beams. For both setups, we calculate the tunneling current and the current correlations. For setup (i), our results provide analytically exact expressions for the tunneling current, tunneling-current noise, and cross-correlation noise, The exact relation between conductance and noise is demonstrated. For setup (ii), we show that the tunneling current and the generalized Fano factor [defined in B. Rosenow et al. (2016)] are finite for diluted streams of {\nu} = 1/2 anyons. This is due to the processes where nonequilibrium anyons, supplied via either source edge, directly tunnel at the central QPC. Thus, to obtain meaningful results in this case, one should go beyond the so-called time-domain braiding processes, where nonequilibrium anyons do not tunnel at the collider, but rather indirectly influence the tunneling by braiding with the quasiparticle-quasihole pairs created at the collider. This suggests that the effect of direct tunneling and collisions of diluted anyons in the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer can be important for various observables in physical quantum-Hall edges at Laughlin filling fractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator (3D TI) supports a chiral Majorana edge mode at the interface between a superconductor and a magnetic insulator. The complexity of the materials combination is such that this state has not yet been observed. Here we show that a helical Majorana edge mode appears even in the absence of the magnetic insulator, if the Fermi level of the massless surface electrons is at the Dirac point. Specular Andreev reflection of Dirac fermions is at the origin of the effect. The simplified geometry may favor experimental observation of the helical Majorana mode, although it lacks the topological protection of its chiral counterpart.</description>

      <title>Solving Superconducting Quantum Circuits in Dirac's Constraint Analysis Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we exploit Dirac's Constraint Analysis (DCA) in Hamiltonian formalism to study different types of Superconducting Quantum Circuits (SQC) in a {\it{unified}} way. The Lagrangian of a SQC reveals the constraints, that are classified in a Hamiltonian framework, such that redundant variables can be removed to isolate the canonical degrees of freedom for subsequent quantization of the Dirac Brackets via a generalized Correspondence Principle. This purely algebraic approach makes the application of concepts such as graph theory, null vector, loop charge,\ etc that are in vogue, (each for a specific type of circuit), completely redundant. The universal validity of DCA scheme in SQC, proposed by us, is demonstrated by correctly re-deriving existing results for different SQCs, obtained previously exploiting different formalisms each applicable for a specific SQC. Furthermore, we have also analysed and predicted new results for a generic form of SQC - it will be interesting to see its validation in an explicit circuit implementation.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Exotic Spin Texture in Supramolecular Metal Complexes on a 2D Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designer heterostructures, where the desired physics emerges from the controlled interactions between different components, represent one of the most powerful strategies to realize unconventional electronic states. This approach has been particularly fruitful in combining magnetism and superconductivity to create exotic superconducting states. In this work, we use a heterostructure platform combining supramolecular metal complexes (SMCs) with a quasi-2D van der Waals (vdW) superconductor NbSe$_2$. Our scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements demonstrate the emergence of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bands arising from the interaction between the SMC magnetism and the NbSe$_2$ superconductivity. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements, we show the presence of antiferromagnetic coupling between the SMC units. These result in the emergence of an unconventional $3\times3$ reconstruction in the magnetic ground state that is directly reflected in real space modulation of the YSR bands. The combination of flexible molecular building blocks, frustrated magnetic textures, and superconductivity in heterostructures establishes a fertile starting point to fabricating tunable quantum materials, including unconventional superconductors and quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exciton optomechanics, bridging cavity exciton polaritons and optomechanics, opens new opportunities for the study of light-matter strong interactions and nonlinearities, due to the rich nonlinear couplings among excitons, phonons, and photons. Here, we propose to entangle two exciton modes in an exciton-optomechanics system, which consists of a semiconductor microcavity integrated with two quantum wells. The quantum wells support two exciton modes, which simultaneously couple to an optical cavity mode via a linear dipole interaction and to a mechanical vibration mode via a nonlinear deformation potential interaction. We show that by strongly driving the microcavity with a red-detuned laser field and when the two exciton modes are respectively resonant with the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands scattered by the mechanical motion, stationary entanglement between the two exciton modes can be established under realistic parameters. The protocol is within reach of current technology and may become a promising approach for preparing excitonic entanglement.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast terahertz conductivity in epitaxial graphene nanoribbons: an interplay between photoexcited and secondary hot carriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical pump-terahertz probe spectroscopy has been used to investigate ultrafast photo-induced charge carrier transport in 3.4 $\mu$m wide graphene ribbons upon scaling the optical pump intensity. For low pump fluences, the deposited pump energy is rapidly redistributed through carrier-carrier scattering, producing secondary hot carriers: the picosecond THz photoconductivity then acquires a negative sign and scales linearly with an increasing pump fluence. At higher fluences, there are not enough equilibrium carriers able to accept the deposited energy, directly generated (excess) carriers start to contribute significantly to the photoconductivity with a positive sign leading to its saturation behavior. This leads to a non-monotonic variation of the carrier mobility and plasmonic resonance frequency as a function of the pump fluence and, at high fluences, to a balance between a decreasing carrier scattering time and an increasing Drude weight. In addition, a weak carrier localization observed for the polarization parallel to the ribbons at low pump fluences is progressively lifted upon increasing the pump fluence as a result of the rise of initial carrier temperature.</description>

      <title>Detection of Electron Paramagnetic Resonance of Two Electron Spins Using a Single NV Center in Diamond</title>

Abstract: An interacting spin system is an excellent testbed for fundamental quantum physics and applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation. For these investigations, detailed information of the interactions, e.g., the number of spins and their interaction strengths, is often required. In this study, we present the identification and characterization of a single nitrogen vacancy (NV) center coupled to two electron spins. In the experiment, we first identify a well-isolated single NV center and characterize its spin decoherence time. Then, we perform NV-detected electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to detect surrounding electron spins. From the analysis of the NV-EPR signal, we precisely determine the number of detected spins and their interaction strengths. Moreover, the spectral analysis indicates that the candidates of the detected spins are diamond surface spins. This study demonstrates a promising approach for the identification and characterization of an interacting spin system for realizing entangled sensing using electron spin as quantum reporters.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-assisted transport in a tight-binding chain with a linear potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An environment interacting with a quantum system can enhance transport through the suppression of quantum effects responsible for localization. In this paper, we study the interplay between bulk dephasing and a linear potential in a boundary-driven tight-binding chain. A linear potential induces Wannier-Stark localization in the absence of noise, while dephasing induces diffusive transport in the absence of a tilt. We derive an approximate expression for the steady-state current as a function of both dephasing and tilt which closely matches the exact solution for a wide range of parameters. From it, we find that the maximum current occurs for a dephasing rate equal to the period of Bloch oscillations in the Wannier-Stark localized system. We also find that the current displays a maximum as a function of the system size, provided that the total potential tilt across the chain remains constant. Our results can be verified in current experimental platforms and represents a step forward in analytical studies of environment-assisted transport.</description>

      <title>Forming and Compliance-free Operation of Low-energy, Fast-switching HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate low energy, forming and compliance-free operation of a resistive memory obtained by the partial oxidation of a two-dimensional layered van-der-Waals semiconductor: hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$). Semiconductor - oxide heterostructures are achieved by low temperature ($&lt;300^{o}$C) thermal oxidation of HfS$_2$ in dry conditions, carefully controlling process parameters. The resulting HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ heterostructures are integrated between metal contacts, forming vertical crossbar devices. Forming-free, compliance-free resistive switching between non-volatile states is demonstrated by applying voltage pulses and measuring the current response in time. We show non-volatile memory operation with an R$_{ON}$/ R$_{OFF}$ of 102, programmable by 80ns WRITE and ERASE operations. Multiple stable resistance states are achieved by modulating pulse width and amplitude, down to 60ns, $&lt;$ 20pJ operation. This demonstrates the capability of these devices for low - energy, fast-switching and multi-state programming. Resistance states were retained without fail at 150$^o$C over 10$^4$s, showcasing the potential of these devices for long retention times and resilience to ageing. Low-energy resistive switching measurements were repeated in vacuum (8.6 mbar) showing unchanged characteristics and no dependence of the device on surrounding oxygen or water vapour. Using a technology computer-aided design (TCAD) tool, we explore the role of the semiconductor layer in tuning the device conductance and driving gradual resistive switching in 2D HfO$_x$ - based devices.</description>
