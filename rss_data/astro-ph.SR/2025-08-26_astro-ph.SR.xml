      <title>Optical Spectroscopy Reveals Hidden Neutron-capture Elemental Abundance Differences among APOGEE-identified Chemical Doppelg\"angers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grouping stars by chemical similarity has the potential to reveal the Milky Way's evolutionary history. The APOGEE stellar spectroscopic survey has the resolution and sensitivity for this task. However, APOGEE lacks access to strong lines of neutron-capture elements ($Z &gt; 28$) which have nucleosynthetic origins that are distinct from those of the lighter elements. We assess whether APOGEE abundances are sufficient for selecting chemically similar disk stars by identifying 25 pairs of chemical ``doppelgangers'' in APOGEE DR17 and following them up with the Tull spectrograph, an optical, $R \sim 60{,}000$ echelle on the McDonald Observatory 2.7-m telescope. Line-by-line differential analyses of pairs' optical spectra reveals neutron-capture (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, and Eu) elemental abundance differences of $\Delta$[X/Fe] $\rm \sim 0.020 \pm 0.015$ to $0.380 \pm 0.15$ dex (4--140%), and up to 0.05 dex (12%) on average, a factor of 1--2 times higher than intra-cluster pairs. This is despite the pairs sharing nearly identical APOGEE-reported abundances and [C/N] ratios, a tracer of giant-star age. This work illustrates that even when APOGEE abundances derived from SNR $&gt; 300$ spectra are available, optically-measured neutron-capture element abundances contain critical information about composition similarity. These results hold implications for the chemical dimensionality of the disk, mixing within the interstellar medium, and chemical tagging with the neutron-capture elements.</description>

      <title>Magnetic interaction analysis of multiple interplanetary coronal mass ejections leading to a historic geomagnetic storm in May 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), the large-scale eruptive phenomena capable of shedding a huge amount of solar magnetic helicity and energy are potential in driving strong geomagnetic storms. They complexly evolve while preceded and followed by other large-scale structures e.g. ICMEs. Magnetic interaction among multiple ICMEs may result intense and long-lived geomagnetic storms. Our aim is to understand the reason of substantial changes in the geoeffectivity of two meso-scale separated counterparts of a complex solar wind structure through investigating their magnetic content e.g. helicity, energy and magnetic interaction among multiple ICMEs. We utilized the insitu observations of solar wind from Wind and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-A (STA) spacecraft during the strongest geomagnetic storm period in past two decades on May 10-11, 2024 and heliospheric imagers onboard STA. Our investigation confirms complex interactions among five ICMEs resulting in distinct counterparts within a coalescing large-scale structure. These counterparts possess substantially different magnetic contents. We conclude that the complex counterpart resulted from the interaction among common-origin ICMEs observed by STA, favorably orientated for magnetic reconnection, had 1.6 and 2.8 times higher total magnetic energy and helicity, respectively, than the counterpart containing a left-handed filament-origin ICME observed by Wind. The left-handed ICME non-favorably oriented for magnetic reconnection with the surrounding right-handed, common-origin ICMEs. Therefore, two medium-separated counterparts despite belonging to a common solar wind structure, were potential to lead different geoeffectivity. This ultimately challenges space weather predictions based on early observations.</description>

      <title>The Kinematical Behavior of Solar Eruptive Filaments Affected by the Poloidal Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinematics of solar eruptive filaments is one of the important diagnostic parameters for predicting whether solar eruptions would induce geomagnetic storms. Particularly, some geomagnetic storms might be induced by solar filament eruptions originating from unexpected surface source regions because of non-radial ejection. The non-radial ejection of filaments has received widespread attention but remains inconclusive. We select two eruptive filaments, both of which are supported by flux ropes, as indicated by the hot channel structures seen in the 94 {\AA} images and the hook-shaped brightenings where the filament material falls back. We measure the three-dimensional ejection trajectory of the eruptive filaments by integrating the simultaneous observations from SDO and STEREO. Furthermore, we calculate the distribution of the poloidal field along the ejection path and compare it to the ejection acceleration. It is revealed that the reinforcement of the poloidal magnetic field may lead to the suppression of the acceleration, with the acceleration resuming its increase only when the poloidal field diminishes to a certain level. Additionally, we compute the spatial distribution of the poloidal field in various directions and find that the poloidal magnetic field above the filaments is asymmetric. For both investigated events, the filaments appear to eject towards the side where the poloidal magnetic field is weaker, indicating that the eruptive filaments tend to propagate along the side with weaker strapping force. This may provide a new explanation for the inclined ejection of filaments.</description>

      <title>TheUse of Conditional Variational Autoencoders in Generating Stellar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) that generates stellar spectra covering 4000 $\le$ $T_{\mathrm{eff}$ $\le$ 11,000 K, $2.0 \le \log g \le 5.0$ dex, $-1.5 \le [\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{H}] \le +1.5$ dex, $v\sin i \le 300$ km/s, $\xi_t$ between 0 and 4 km/s, and for any instrumental resolving powers less than 115,000. The spectra can be calculated in the wavelength range 4450-5400 \AA. Trained on a grid of \textsc{SYNSPEC} spectra, the network synthesizes a spectrum in around two orders of magnitude faster than line-by-line radiative transfer. We validate the CVAE on $10^4$ test spectra unseen during training. Pixel-wise statistics yield a median absolute residual of &lt;$1.8\times10^{-3}$ flux units with no wavelength-dependent bias. A residual error map across the parameters plane shows $\langle|\Delta F|\rangle&lt;2\times10^{-3}$ everywhere, and marginal diagnostics versus $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, $v\sin i$, $\xi_t$, and $[Fe/H]$\ reveal no relevant trends. These results demonstrate that the CVAE can serve as a drop-in, physics-aware surrogate for radiative transfer codes, enabling real-time forward modeling in stellar parameter inference and offering promising tools for spectra synthesis for large astrophysical data analysis.</description>

      <title>On the Spatial Distribution of Luminous Blue Variables, B[e] Supergiants, and Wolf-Rayet stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the spatial distributions of LBV's, B[e] supergiants, and W-R stars in the LMC, to clarify their relative ages, evolutionary states, and relationships. This survey employs a reference catalog that was not available for previous work, comprising more than 3900 of the LMC's most luminous stars. Our analysis shows that LBV's, B[e] supergiants, and WR's have spatial distributions like normal stars with the same spectral types and luminosities. Most LBV's are not isolated, nor do they require binary or multiple status to explain their spatial relationship to other populations. There are two likely exceptions: one lower-luminosity LBV and one LBV candidate are relatively isolated and may have velocities that require additional acceleration. The B[e] supergiants are spatially and kinematically more dispersed than LBV's, suggesting that they belong to an older population. The most luminous early-type WN's are most closely associated with the evolved late O-type supergiants. The high luminosity late WN's, however, are highly concentrated in the 30 Dor region which biases the analysis. The less luminous WN's and WC's are associated with a mix of evolved late B, A-type, and yellow supergiants which may be in a post-red-supergiant phase. Spatial distributions of the less luminous WN, WC, and WN3/O3 stars reinforce proposed evolutionary links among those subtypes. Our analysis also demonstrates the importance of using a comprehensive census, with reference populations clearly defined by spectral type and luminosity, and how small number statistics, especially combined with spatial clustering, can invalidate some commonly-cited statistical tests.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Tiered Magnetic Polarity Inversion Features Dataset for Space Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a publicly available, multimodal, tiered magnetic polarity inversion lines (MPILs) dataset extracted from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's (SDO) Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) Active Region Patches (SDO/HMI HARP) between May 2010 and April 2025. The dataset comprises four distinct tiers, each generated by running our detection methodology with four different magnetic field strength thresholds to capture nuanced variations in MPIL features at multiple levels of detail. In total, we provide 6,695 HARP series mapped using the Lambert Cylindrical Equal Area (CEA) projection at a 12-minute cadence. This tiered approach ensures that each tier captures specific sensitivities to polarity changes, enabling researchers to tailor their analyses to a range of scientific and operational objectives. In each threshold tier, we offer six binary MPIL masks associated with heliophysics and space weather forecasting, including MPIL, Region of Polarity Inversion (RoPI), positive and negative polarity regions, unsigned polarity regions, and MPIL convex hulls. Furthermore, structured metadata in the form of multivariate time series is included, allowing users to track and analyze MPIL properties over time.</description>

      <title>The Role of Magnetic Reconnection in the Structure &amp; Dynamics of Fast Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both observations and models of flare-associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) suggest that magnetic reconnection in an ejection's wake substantially increases the net, outward Lorentz force accelerating the CME. A stronger outward force can cause a feedback loop, driving further magnetic reconnection in a "reconnective instability." The flux accretion model captures this by relating reconnected flux (Delta Phi_rec) and magnetic field strength (B_CME) to increased outward Lorentz force (Delta F_r). To better understand reconnection's role in CME dynamics, we analyze two snapshots from a 2.5D, MHD simulation of a breakout eruption. Outward Lorentz forces increase substantially as reconnection proceeds, caused primarily by "flank currents," which flow just inside the boundary of the rising ejection's wake and parallel to its axis. This model's reconnection jet also alters the ejection's internal structure, an effect that could be sought in observations. Analyzing reconnection-induced Lorentz forces in 3D simulations could provide additional insights into CME dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C--MetaLL) survey: VII. Metallicity dependence of Period-Wesenheit relations based on a homogeneous spectroscopic sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The C-MetaLL project has provided homogeneous spectroscopic abundances of 290 Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) for which we have the intensity-averaged magnitudes in multiple optical and near-infrared (NIR) bands, periods, pulsation modes, and Gaia parallaxes. Our goal is to derive updated period--Wesenheit--metallicity (PWZ) relations using the largest and most homogeneous metallicity sample ever used for such analyses, covering a range of $-1.3&lt;$[Fe/H]$&lt;+0.3$ dex. We computed several optical and NIR Wesenheit magnitudes using 275 DCEPs with reliable parallaxes, by applying a robust photometric parallax technique, which simultaneously fits all parameters -- including the global Gaia parallax counter-correction -- and handles outliers without data rejection. We find a stronger metallicity dependence ($\gamma \approx -0.5$ mag/dex in optical, $-0.4$ mag/dex in NIR) than recent literature reports. Gaia parallax zero-point conter-corrections ($\epsilon$) vary smoothly across bands, with an average value of $\sim$10 $\mu$as, aligning with previous determinations. Applying our PWZ relations to LMC Cepheids yields distances generally consistent within $1\sigma$ with geometric estimates. The choice of reddening law has a negligible impact, while using only fundamental-mode pulsators significantly increases the uncertainties. Including $\alpha$-element corrections increases $|\gamma|$ and reduces $\epsilon$. However, we find statistically consistent $\gamma$ values with the literature, particularly for the key Wesenheit magnitude in the HST bands, by restricting the sample to the brighter (i.e. closer) objects, or by including only pulsators with $-0.7&lt;$[Fe/H]$&lt;$0.2 dex. Our results hint at a large $\gamma$ or a non-linear dependence on metallicity of DCEP luminosities at the metal-poor end, which is difficult to quantify with the precision of parallaxes of the present dataset.</description>

      <title>On the analysis of eruptive events with non-radial evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of space weather disturbances, and their deflection from the radial direction critically affects their potential impact on Earth. While the influence of the surrounding magnetic field in guiding CME trajectories is well established, accurately predicting non-radial propagation remains a challenge.
  In this work, we introduce and compare recently developed techniques for analyzing the early deflection of eruptive events. We revisit a largely deflected prominence-CME event of 2010 December 16 using an improved tracking framework and a new application of the topological path method. Our results suggest the deflection of the eruption is dominated by the channeling of the magnetic field lines. This study offers new physical insight into CME guidance mechanisms and validates the predictive capability of the topological path, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic tool for estimating the propagation direction of strongly deflected events.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Silicate Grain Coagulation on Millimeter Emission from Massive Protostellar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot accretion disks around massive protostars provide a unique opportunity to study ice-free silicate grains that cannot be investigated in protoplanetary disks. We conduct a self-consistent investigation into grain-size evolution and its impact on (sub)millimeter-wave emission from massive protostellar disks. Our radiative transfer modeling accounts for dust self-scattering and includes vertical temperature gradients in the disk structure. The results show that once silicate grains grow to sizes exceeding the observing wavelength, enhanced scattering dims the disk emission by 20\%--30\% relative to the blackbody emission expected at the disk surface temperature. By comparing our model with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array 1.14 mm observations of the disk around the massive protostar GGD27-MM1, we constrain the threshold velocity for collisional fragmentation of silicate grains to approximately 15 m s-1. This fragmentation velocity is lower than the typical maximum collisional velocities in protoplanetary disks around low-mass stars, suggesting that collisional coagulation alone is insufficient for silicate dust to form rocky planetesimals in such environments. Furthermore, our analysis identifies two potential scenarios to better reproduce the bright inner-disk emission of GGD27-MM1. One possibility is that the grain growth is limited to 160 mum by another growth barrier (e.g., collisional bouncing), reducing scattering dimming. Alternatively, the stellar luminosity may be as much as five times higher than current estimates, compensating for the reduced brightness. Future multiwavelength observations, particularly at shorter submillimeter wavelengths, will be crucial to distinguish between these scenarios and further constrain silicate grain coagulation processes in massive protostellar disks.</description>

      <title>Sun-as-a-star Analysis of the Solar Eruption Source Region Using Ha Spectroscopic Observations of CHASE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sun-as-a-star analyses serve as a bridge for comparative studies on solar and stellar activities. To investigate the typical Sun-as-a-star Ha temporal spectral characteristics in solar eruption source regions, we analyzed five different types of solar eruptions, using spectroscopic data from the Chinese Ha Solar Explorer (CHASE). Because the spatially-integral Ha spectrum of source region is mainly contributed by emission from heated plasma in flare ribbons and absorption from cold plasma in evolving filaments, we separately analyze the sub-regions of the source region dominated by different dynamical processes. It is revealed that filament eruptions show emission near Ha line center, accompanied by blueshifted/redshifted absorption, while flare ribbons show Ha line center emission with red asymmetry and line broadening. Moreover, a special spectral signature likely associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is identified: prominent blueshifted absorption without a clear deceleration phase, along with redshifted absorption, which can be used as a probe when searching stellar CMEs. Furthermore, in the X9.0 flare (SOL2024-10-03T12:18) accompanied by a violent CME, the expected blueshifted signal is not visible in the spatially-integral Ha spectra. This suggests that filament-lifting signals associated with CMEs in the source region can be obscured by the simultaneous dominant flare-ribbon emission within the integration region, which may explain the relatively small number of confirmed stellar CMEs observed in Ha. We also find that comparison between the Ha and UV spectral observations can effectively reveal the velocity evolution of erupting filaments and potential existence of associated CMEs.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Axion-Like Particles on Late Stellar Evolution From Intermediate-Mass Stars to core-collapse Supernova Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Stars with masses ranging from 3 to 11 M_\odot exhibit multiple evolutionary paths. Less massive stars in this range conclude their evolution as carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs. However, those that achieve carbon ignition before the pressure by degenerate electron halts the core contraction may either form massive CONe/ONe white dwarfs, or undergo an electron-capture supernova, or photo-disintegrate neon and proceed with further thermonuclear burning, ultimately leading to the formation of a gravitationally unstable iron core. Aims. An evaluation of the impact of the energy loss caused by the production of axion-like-particles (ALPs) on evolution and final destiny of these stars is the main objective of this paper. Methods. We compute various sets of stellar models, all with solar initial composition, varying the strengths of the ALP coupling with photons and electrons. Results. As a consequence of an ALP thermal production, the critical masses for off-center C and Ne ignitions are both shifted upward. When the current bounds for the ALP coupling strengths are assumed, the maximum mass for CO WD progenitors is about 1.1 M_\odot heavier than that obtained without the ALP energy loss, while the minimum mass for a core collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitor is 0.7 M_\odot higher. Conclusions. Current constraints from observed Type II-P supernova light curves and pre-explosive luminosity do not exclude an ALP production within the current bounds. However, the maximum age of CCSN progenitors, as deduced from the star formation rate of the parent stellar population, would require a smaller minimum mass. This discrepancy can be explained by assuming a moderate extra mixing (as due to core overshooting or rotational induced mixing) above the fully convective core that develops during the main sequence.</description>

      <title>Solar Observation with MeerKAT: Demonstration of Technical Readiness and Initial Science Highlight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar radio emissions offer unique diagnostic insights into the solar corona. However, their dynamic and multiscale nature, along with several orders of magnitude variations in intensity, pose significant observational challenges. To date, at gigahertz frequencies, MeerKAT stands out globally with high potential of producing high-fidelity, spectroscopic snapshot images of the Sun, enabled by its dense core, high sensitivity, and broad frequency coverage. Yet, as a telescope originally designed for observing faint galactic and extragalactic sources, observing the Sun at the boresight of the telescope requires customized observing strategies and calibration methods. This work demonstrates the technical readiness of MeerKAT for solar observations at the boresight of the telescope in the UHF (580-1015 MHz) and L-band (900-1670 MHz) frequency ranges, including optimized modes, a dedicated calibration scheme, and a tailored, entirely automated calibration and imaging pipeline. The quality of solar images is validated through morphological comparisons with the solar images at other wavelengths. Several unique early science results showcase the potential of this new capability of MeerKAT. Once fully commissioned and operational, this will unlock novel solar studies, significantly expand the scientific portfolio of MeerKAT, and lay the groundwork for solar observations with the mid-frequency telescope of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory, for which MeerKAT serves as a precursor.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic modelling of Kepler Legacy stars including lithium depletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The Kepler Legacy sample is, to this day, the sample of solar-like oscillators with the most exquisite asteroseismic data. In this work, we carry out a detailed modelling of a subsample of these stars for which the surface lithium abundance has also been observed by the GALAH survey and a photometric surface rotation as been measured. Aims. We aim at studying the impact of additional mixing processes on the asteroseismic modelling of Kepler Legacy G and F-type stars. We also investigate whether a single process can be invoked to reproduce the lithium depletion and asteroseismic constraints at the same time. Methods. We use detailed asteroseismic modelling techniques combining global and local minimization techniques. We start by using standard models and then aim at improving this solution by the addition of extra-mixing at the border of convective regions using either convective penetration or turbulence in radiative layers. Results. We find that lower mass models (~ 1M_Sun ) have no problem in reproducing the observed lithium depletion using only turbu- lence in the radiative zone, similarly to solar models. F-type stars, having a shallower convective envelope, are unaffected by additional turbulence at the BCZ, but require significant convective penetration values to actually reproduce the observed lithium depletion. The extent of this penetration is however incompatible with the frequency separation ratios. Conclusions. We conclude that the impact of extra-mixing is moderate for solar-type stars of the Kepler Legacy sample and well within the requirements of the PLATO mission. For more massive stars (~ 1.5M_Sun ), we conclude that the behaviour of the frequency separation ratios must be further investigated, as even models with large convective penetration at the base of their convective envelope are unable to reproduce them.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure and asymmetric eruption of a 500 Mm filament rooted in weak-field regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a detailed analysis of the magnetic structure and asymmetric eruption of a large (about 500 Mm) inverse S-shaped filament partially located in AR 13229 on February 24, 2023. We linked the filament's pre-eruptive magnetic configuration to its highly asymmetric eruption dynamics and the formation of a large-scale coronal dimming in a weak-field region (mean unsigned flux of about 5 G). To reconstruct the coronal magnetic field, we applied a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation method to a pre-eruption HMI vector magnetogram. The NLFFF extrapolation reveals a large-scale magnetic flux rope (MFR) of about 500 Mm in length, consistent with the filament. We identified an extended MFR footprint to the east that connects to the J-shaped flare ribbon, outlining where the coronal dimming began. Overlying strapping fields connect to the area into which the dimming and flare ribbon later expand. This configuration explains the formation of the dimming as a stationary flux rope and strapping flux dimming, with subsequent expansion driven by the growth of the MFR footprint through strapping-strapping reconnection. Conversely, the western filament leg shows multiple anchor points and strong overlying magnetic fields, which suppressed the dimming and partially confined the eruption on that side. The reconstructed pre-eruptive NLFFF configuration offers a clear physical explanation for the asymmetries seen in the eruption, flare geometry, and coronal dimming. This demonstrates that PINN-based NLFFF extrapolation can effectively model large-scale filaments extending into weak-field regions, enhancing our understanding of complex solar eruptions.</description>

      <title>Linear map-making with LuSEE-Night</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LuSEE-Night is a pathfinder radio telescope on the lunar far side employing four 3-m monopole antennas arranged as two horizontal cross pseudo-dipoles on a rotational stage and sensitive to the radio sky in the 1-50 MHz frequency band. LuSEE-Night measures the corresponding 16 correlation products as a function of frequency. While each antenna combination measures radiation coming from a large area of the sky, their aggregate information as a function of phase in the lunar cycle and rotational stage position can be deconvolved into a low-resolution map of the sky. We study this deconvolution using linear map-making based on the Wiener filter algorithm. We illustrate how systematic effects can be effectively marginalised over as contributions to the noise covariance and demonstrate this technique on beam knowledge uncertainty and gain fluctuations. With reasonable assumptions about instrument performance, we show that LuSEE-Night should be able to map the sub-50 MHz sky at a ~5-degree resolution.</description>

      <title>Characterising the short-orbital period X-ray transient Swift J1910.2-0546</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16775v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SwiftJ1910.2-0546 is a Galactic X-ray transient discovered during a bright outburst in 2012. We use time-series optical photometry and spectroscopy to estimate the orbital period, characterise the donor star, determine the interstellar extinction, distance, and system geometry, and constrain the component masses. Multi-site r-band and clear-filter light curves and WHT/ACAM spectra from the 2012 outburst are combined with time-series spectroscopy from GTC/OSIRIS and VLT/FORS2 in quiescence. Period searches are conducted using generalised Lomb-Scargle, phase-dispersion minimisation, and analysis-of-variance algorithms. Diffuse interstellar bands constrain E(B-V), while empirical correlations involving H$\alpha$ yield estimates of K2, q, and i. We detect a double-humped modulation with a period of $0.0941\pm0.0007$d ($2.26\pm0.02$h) during the outburst. Its morphology is consistent with an early superhump, suggesting that the true orbital period may be slightly shorter than 4.52h. The H$\alpha$ radial velocity curves do not yield a definitive orbital period. In quiescence, TiO bands indicate an M3-M3.5 donor contributing 70% of the red continuum. Diffuse interstellar bands give E(B-V)=$0.60\pm0.05$ and N_H=$(3.9\pm1.3)$x10$^{21}$cm$^{-2}$, placing the system at a distance of 2.8-4.0 kpc. The H$\alpha$ line width in quiescence (FWHM_0 =$990\pm45$km/s), via a FWHM-K_2 calibration, provides an estimate of K_2, while its double peaked profile gives q and i. Adopting the resulting K_2=$230\pm17$km/s and q=$0.032\pm0.010$, and two orbital period scenarios (2.25 and 4.50h), Monte Carlo sampling returns a compact object mass M_1=8-11M_sun and an inclination i=13-18 deg for plausible donor masses (M_2=0.25-0.35M_sun). We favour an orbital period of 4.5h. Further phase-resolved spectroscopy and photometry during quiescence are needed to better determine its fundamental parameters.</description>

      <title>$\textit{BMAD}$-Circumbinary Magnetically Arrested Disks around Stellar or Black Hole Binaries: Hot Accretion Flows, Disk Properties, and Angular Momentum Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary systems surrounded by a circumbinary accretion flow can be subject to strong magnetic fields, potentially altering the character of the accretion flow itself, the evolution of the orbital dynamics, and outflow properties from the system. Here we focus on a regime where magnetic fields become so strong that the outer circumbinary flow becomes magnetically arrested, establishing a (circum)binary magnetically arrested disk ($\textit{BMAD}$) state. Such flows feature quasi-periodic magnetic flux eruptions, power jet-like magnetic tower outflows, and consequently alter the predominant contribution to angular momentum transfer inside the circumbinary disk. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the properties of these flows around equal-mass binary systems on circular orbits ultilizing massively parallel three-dimensional Newtonian magnetohydrodynamics simulations. We investigate the impact of the equation of state and of dynamical cooling, as well as that of the (large-scale) magnetic field topology. Our findings are as follows: (1) A magnetically arrested accretion flow through the cavity can generally be achieved, so long as the initial seed field is strong enough. (2) The cavity, and magnetic flux tube properties and their subsequent propagation are subject to the choice of equation of state/cooling physics. (3) We find tentative evidence that in some regimes the BMAD state, particularly during a flux eruption cycle, can aid shrinking of the binary's orbit. The regimes we explore have implications for multi-messenger transients to stars, supermassive and stellar black hole binaries and their orbital evolution in gaseous environments.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Second Y+Y Dwarf Binary System: CWISEP J193518.59-154620.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a companion to the Y-dwarf, CWISEP J193518.59-154620.3, the second Y-Y dwarf binary detected to date. Y-dwarfs are the coldest known free-floating objects ($&lt;$ 500 K) and on average represent the lowest mass objects directly formed through turbulent fragmentation of a molecular cloud. Studying their multiplicity allows us to place strong constraints on the ability to form multiple systems of planetary masses and approaching the opacity limit of fragmentation. Due to their physical properties, Y-dwarfs also serve as analogs to gas giant planets. CWISEP J193518.59-154620.3 has been shown to have a unique methane emission feature in its near infrared spectrum at 3.326 $\mu$m, potentially indicative of auroral processes without a clear origin. CWISEP J193518.59-154620.3 was observed with JWST's MIRI in the F1000W, F1280W, and F1800W filters. We applied a point-spread function (PSF) fitting algorithm using empirically derived PSF models and resolve a companion in the F1000W and F1280W filters separated by 172 milli-arcseconds, 2.48 au assuming the distance of 14.43 pc. Using the ATMO2020 evolutionary models, we estimate a mass of 12-39 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for the primary and 7-24 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for the companion assuming an age of 1-10 Gyr for a mass ratio of 0.55-0.62, resulting in an estimated period of 16-28 years. It is unknown which component of this binary exhibits the methane emission feature. We also resolve known companions WISE J014656.66+423410.0B and WISE J171104.60+350036.8B using MIRI data and present their F1000W and F1280W photometry.</description>

      <title>Detecting Gravitational Waves from Exoplanets Orbiting Binary Neutron Stars with B-DECIGO and DECIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first detection of a gravitational-wave (GW) signal in 2015 has opened a new observational window to probe the universe. This probe can not only reveal previously inaccessible binaries, black holes, and other compact objects, but also can detect exoplanets through their imprint on GW signals, thereby significantly extend current exoplanet surveys. To date, nearly 6000 exoplanets have been confirmed, yet most of them reside either in the solar neighbourhood or along the sightline toward the Galactic bulge, reflecting the range limits of traditional electromagnetic techniques. In this work, we follow the method proposed in N.Tamanini&amp;C.Danielski(2019) to investigate frequency modulations in GW signals from early-stage binary neutron stars (BNSs) induced by circumbinary planets (CBPs) and obtain that CBPs can be detected by the future space-borne detector DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO). For BNS system with the masses of two components both being 1.4 $M_{\odot}$, DECIGO could detect CBPs with mass being dozens of times that of Jupiter out to distances of $\sim 1$ Gpc, well beyond the Local Supercluster, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study planetary formation and evolution for the post main-sequence stage.</description>

      <title>Latitudinal dependence of heat transport in turbulent geostrophic convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latitudinal variations in turbulent heat flux play a key role in the thermal and magnetic evolution of rapidly rotating planets and stars. Although global spherical-shell simulations have documented such variations, explicit latitude-dependent scaling relations for heat transport have remained elusive. Here we employ the rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RRBC) framework with tilted rotation and gravity axes to model convection at different latitudes $\varphi$ in the geostrophic regime. We derive scaling relations for the latitude dependence of convective length scales $\ell(\varphi)$ and the Nusselt number $Nu(\varphi)$. At high latitudes, the scalings $Nu \sim \sin^{-4/3}\varphi$ (near onset) and $Nu \sim \sin^{-4}\varphi$ (above onset) emerge, while at low latitudes $Nu \sim \cos^{4}\varphi$. These predictions are validated against direct numerical simulations of convection in a spherical shell. The results provide a quantitative framework for regional thermal transport in planetary and stellar interiors and establish a unified interpretation of spherical convection that connects naturally with planar RRBC turbulence.</description>

      <title>The Near-Infrared Echo from SN 2023xgo: Evidence for a Massive Pre-Supernova Eruption in a Type Ibn/Icn Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present near-infrared (NIR) and optical observations and analysis of the Type Ibn/Icn supernova (SN) 2023xgo, spanning the period from two days to 100 days past explosion. A comparison of the NIR light curves and color evolution with those of other Type Ibn SNe reveals prominent NIR excess persisting from 15 to 100 days. The spectral energy distribution (SED) is well explained by a combination of a hot blackbody component and a carbon dust model. The dust temperature remained relatively constant at $T=1600\pm100$ K up to $t=60$ d. The estimated dust mass is $\sim1.2 \times10^{-4}~M_{\odot}$. Based on the SN emission of $10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak luminosity, the evaporation radius is estimated to be $1.2\times10^{16}$ cm, consistent with the expectation from light travel time. The dust shell is located outside the shocked cool dense shell (CDS) at the position of $7.6\times10^{14}$ cm. It suggests that the observed NIR excess originates from pre-existing circumstellar (CS) dust. Considering a typical dust-to-gas mass ratio, the CS gas mass is estimated to be $\simeq10^{-2}~M_{\odot}$, implying a high mass-loss rate of $\sim0.1~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ from either a low-mass helium star progenitor with a binary interaction, or may be a massive Wolf-Rayet star that experienced a significant eruption.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Simplified Chemistries for H2O and CO in three-phase astrochemical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrochemical models can be greatly simplified, with obvious computational advantages, if the reaction networks for key species can be reduced to a bare minimum. In addition, if chemical equilibrium holds, then simple analytical solutions can be formulated. These have particular advantages in the application to complex models evolving over multi-point spatial grids. In this study, the equilibrium solutions to highly simplified chemical networks for CO and H2O have been re-assessed with particular attention to the formulation of the ice desorption rates in the context of 'three-phase' gas-grain astrochemical models. The analytical solutions have also been updated to account for the chemically inert reservoir of molecules below the surface ice layers, and to include the effects of reactive desorption. We find that a very close match is obtained to the results from detailed three-phase models of the time-dependent astrochemistry, and the abundances are typically accurate to within a factor of two over the entire range of densities and extinction that are applicable to dense clouds and young star-forming regions. In addition, these solutions give accurate results over most of the range of conditions even for systems undergoing rapid dynamical evolution. Although there are some caveats of applicability, we therefore recommend that these solutions be used in models of cold molecular environments where the rapid calculation of the abundances of CO, H2O and atomic coolants is helpful.</description>

Abstract: Only 8% of the protoplanetary discs orbiting a T Tauri star show emission features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). As PAHs are strong absorbers of UV radiation, they contribute to the heating of the discs photosphere, shielding of UV radiation that drives photo-chemistry in the disc, and their abundance is a key parameter to determine the strength of photo-evaporative disc winds. We want to understand the photochemical evolution of PAHs in protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars and thus explain the absence of PAH features. We want to determine whether PAHs are destroyed because of the X-ray emission from their host stars or whether PAHs can withstand these conditions. We developed a model for the absorption of X-rays by PAHs. X-rays with more energy than the K edge of carbon will double ionise PAHs and will vibrationally excite them by ~ 15-35 eV. With a Monte Carlo model, we modelled the dissociation of H, H2, and C2H2 from PAH monomers. Furthermore, we modelled the dissociation of PAH clusters and the desorption of PAH clusters from dust grains caused by X-ray excitation. We find that small PAH clusters will quickly desorb and dissociate into individual molecules. PAH molecules experience rapid loss of H and acetylene C2H2 by the high excitation and will lose C2H2 on average after three X-ray excitations. However, large PAH clusters can stay intact and frozen out on dust grains. Based on our results, we expect a gas-phase PAH abundance that is lower than 0.01 times the ISM abundance and will rapidly decrease over time due to the dissociation of small clusters that are subsequently destroyed. To maintain a higher abundance, replenishment processes must exist such as vertical mixing. Large PAH clusters remain in the disc, frozen out on dust grains, but barely emit PAH features because of their strong thermal coupling to dust grains.</description>

Abstract: Triple stellar systems, consisting of three gravitationally bound stars, play a fundamental role in a wide array of astrophysical processes, from stellar evolution to the formation of exotic objects and gravitational wave sources. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the dynamics and evolution of triple stellar systems, highlighting their crucial role in shaping stellar populations and driving diverse astrophysical phenomena. We begin by discussing the observed properties of triples, including their frequency and orbital configurations, emphasizing the challenges in characterizing these systems. We then delve into the intricate dynamics of triples, exploring hierarchical, secular, quasi-secular, and chaotic regimes, with particular attention to the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (vZLK) mechanism and its extensions. The interplay between stellar evolution and triple dynamics is examined, including mass loss, mass transfer, common-envelope evolution, and supernovae effects. We discuss the development and applications of triple population synthesis codes, demonstrating their power in modeling complex evolutionary scenarios and predicting observational outcomes. Finally, we emphasize the unique role of triple evolution in producing a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, from interacting binaries and stellar mergers to explosive transients and gravitational wave sources, underscoring the importance of triple systems in our understanding of stars and stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Upper Scorpius OB association with HERMES. I. The spectroscopic sample and 6D kinematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from a large spectroscopic survey of the nearest young association to the Sun, Upper Scorpius, conducted using 2dF/HERMES on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We use spectroscopic youth criteria such as Li-equivalent widths to identify &gt;1000 pre-main sequence (PMS) members across the region and measure radial velocities, combining these with Gaia EDR3 5-parameter astrometry to obtain 6D kinematic information. We separate confirmed PMS association members into distinct kinematic groups and measure expansion and rotation trends in each. We find strong evidence for asymmetric expansion in several groups and derive expansion timescales from the greatest rates of expansion in each group. We also trace the past motion of these groups using an epicycle approximation and estimate the time since their most compact configuration. These kinematic properties are compared to literature ages and the star formation history of Upper Scorpius is discussed. We find evidence that a scenario in which star formation in the subgroups of Upper Scorpius proceeded independently, either by self-instability or external feedback from Upper Centaurus-Lupus, is more likely than a recently proposed "cluster chain" scenario in which these subgroups have triggered each other.</description>

      <title>Binary stars take what they get: Evidence for Efficient Mass Transfer from Stripped Stars with Rapidly Rotating Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary stars and their interactions shape the formation of compact binaries, supernovae, and gravitational wave sources. The efficiency of mass transfer - the fraction of mass retained by the accretor during binary interaction - is a critical parameter that significantly impacts the final fate of these systems. However, this parameter is observationally poorly constrained due to a scarcity of well-characterized post-mass-transfer binaries. Be+sdOB binaries, consisting of a rapidly rotating Be star and a stripped hot subdwarf companion, are particularly valuable for studying mass transfer since they represent clear examples of past binary interaction. Recently, a significantly expanded observational sample of 16 Be+sdOB binaries with well-constrained masses was obtained through combined spectroscopic and interferometric observations. In this work, we compile and analyze this sample to provide robust constraints on the mass transfer efficiency in binaries that underwent stable mass transfer during the donor's hydrogen-shell burning phase. Our analysis reveals that mass transfer was predominantly conservative: half of the systems require mass transfer efficiencies above 50%. This challenges commonly adopted assumptions of highly non-conservative mass transfer in binary evolution modeling. Our findings are inconsistent with models that account for spin-up and limit accretion due to a centrifugal barrier. We also find tension with a commonly used mass transfer model in rapid population synthesis that limits accretion based on the thermal timescale of the accretor. These results have strong implications for almost all products of binary evolution including the variety of supernovae, white dwarfs, blue stragglers, runaway stars, X-ray binaries, and gravitational-wave sources.</description>

      <title>Tidal heating in detached double white dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short--period ($P&lt;$1 hr orbits) detached double white dwarf binary (DWDB) components identified with transient surveys (e.g. SDSS, ZTF) have hot surface temperatures ($&gt;$10,000 K) and observed radii a factor two larger than completely degenerate white dwarfs. We formulate tidal heating in helium composition extremely low mass white dwarf (ELM WD) components of detached DWDBs which reach mass transfer within a Hubble time. We combine a mass radius relation which varies with surface temperature and the equilibrium tidal friction model of Hut 1981, where the additional orbital energy loss from tidal friction is accounted for by increases in the primary surface temperature, and hence increasing radius. Applying this heating model to the current sample of binaries with ZTF, we predict temperature increases from the present day of up to $\sim$40\% before the onset of mass transfer. We find that helium white dwarfs are generically hot and large at the onset of mass transfer, even for the oldest DWDBs whose components can cool to be degenerate by the present day. In the population of Galactic DWDBs, we find that the onset of mass transfer should occur at orbital periods as long as 1000s (17 minutes), or binary gravitational wave frequency of 2 mHz. This is over three times longer than periods expected for degenerate WD (5 minutes). Since mass transferring DWDBs are progenitors for a variety of transients and stellar populations e.g. RCrB stars, AM CVn binaries, type .Ia supernova, the finite temperature of donor white dwarfs should be taken into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal a nonlinear magnetic dynamo in a Taylor-Couette flow at small magnetic Prandtl numbers $Pm\leq 1$, which has been previously believed to exist only at higher $Pm\gtrsim 10$ in this flow. The amplitude of initial perturbations, $Pm$ and domain aspect ratio play a key role in the onset and evolution of the dynamo. It exists in two main states -- a weak state dominated by large-scale modes and a strong, turbulent state with higher amplitude dominated by small-scale modes. These findings can be important for dynamo processes in various astrophysical objects with small $Pm$.</description>

      <title>Searching for Accreting Compact Object Binaries in SRG/eROSITA eRASS1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact object binaries with accreting white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes are crucial for understanding accretion physics. In this study, we identify accreting compact object binary candidates in the SRG/eROSITA eRASS1 by combining their X-ray fluxes with Gaia photometry and ZTF time-domain observations. Candidates are selected based on their location in the "X-ray Main Sequence", a diagram incorporating their X-ray-to-optical flux ratios and optical colors, which suggest accretion-driven X-ray emission. We identify 22 candidates in eRASS1 catalog using a three-step selection process: (1) cross-matching to a unique Gaia optical counterpart within a 10" radius; (2) requiring X-ray-to-optical flux ratios exceeding the "X-ray Main Sequence"; and (3) detecting short-period variability in ZTF time-domain photometry. The resulting 22 candidates, including two previously confirmed compact object binaries, represent promising candidates for spectroscopic follow-up to confirm their accreting nature. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining X-ray-to-optical flux ratios and optical colors jointly with time-domain photometry to uncover accreting compact object binaries. The approach is scalable and adaptable to future multi-wavelength sky surveys, offering a promising path toward a more complete census of compact object binaries in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): I. Program Overview and Summary of First Results</title>

Abstract: We present the ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO), a Large Program of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). AGE-PRO aims to systematically trace the evolution of gas disk mass and size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. It uses a carefully selected sample of 30 disks around M3-K6 stars in three nearby star-forming regions: Ophiuchus (0.5-1 Myr), Lupus (1-3 Myr), and Upper Sco (2-6 Myr). Assuming the three regions had similar initial conditions and evolutionary paths, we find the median gas disk mass appears to decrease with age. Ophiuchus disks have the highest median gas mass (6 M$_{\rm Jup}$), while the Lupus and Upper Sco disks have significantly lower median masses (0.68 and 0.44 M$_{\rm Jup}$, respectively). Notably, the gas and dust disk masses appear to evolve on different timescales. This is evidenced by the median gas-to-dust mass ratio, which decreases from 122 in the youngest disks ($&lt;$1 Myr) to 46 in Lupus disks, and then increases to 120 in the Upper Sco disks. The median gas disk sizes range between 74-110 au, suggesting that typical gas disks are much smaller than those of well-studied, massive disks. Population synthesis models suggest that magneto-hydrodynamic wind-driven accretion can reproduce median disk properties across all three regions, when assuming compact disks with a declining magnetic field over time. In contrast, turbulent-driven models overestimate gas masses of $&gt;$1 Myr disks by an order of magnitude. Here we discuss the program's motivation, survey design, sample selection, observation and data calibration processes, and highlight the initial results.</description>

Abstract: The ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks (AGE-PRO) Large Program aims to trace the evolution of gas disk mass and size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. This paper presents Band-6 ALMA observations of 10 embedded (Class I and Flat Spectrum) sources in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, with spectral types ranging from M3 to K6 stars, which serve as the evolutionary starting point in the AGE-PRO sample. While we find 4 nearly edge on disks (&gt;70 deg.), and 3 highly inclined disks (&gt;60 deg.) in our sample, we show that, as a population, embedded disks in Ophiuchus are not significantly contaminated by more evolved, but highly inclined sources. We derived dust disk masses from the Band 6 continuum and estimated gas disk masses from the C18O and C17O lines. The mass estimates from the C17O line are slightly higher, suggesting C18O emission might be partially optically thick. While the 12CO and 13CO lines are severely contaminated by extended emission and self-absorption, the C18O and C17O lines allowed us to trace the radial extent of the gaseous disks. From these measurements, we found that the C18O and C17O fluxes correlate well with each other and with the continuum fluxes. Furthermore, the C18O and C17O lines present a larger radial extension than disk dust sizes by factors ranging from 1.5 to 2.5, as it is found for Class II disks using the radial extension of the 12CO. In addition, we have detected outflows in three disks from 12CO observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential for planet formation of a circumstellar disk depends on the dust and gas reservoirs, which evolve as a function of the disk age. The ALMA Large Program AGE-PRO has measured several disk properties across three star-forming regions of different ages, and in this study we compare the observational results to dust evolution simulations. Using DustPy for the dust evolution, and RADMC-3D for the radiative transfer, we ran a large grid of models spanning stellar masses of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 $M_\odot$, with different initial conditions, including: disk sizes, disk gas masses, and dust-to-gas ratio, and viscosity. Our models are performed assuming smooth, weakly, or strongly substructured disks, aiming to investigate if any observational trend can favor or exclude the presence of dust traps. The observed gas masses in the disks of the AGE-PRO sample are not reproducible with our models, which only consider viscous evolution with constant $\alpha$, suggesting that additional physical mechanisms play a role in the evolution of the gas mass of disks. When comparing the dust continuum emission fluxes and sizes at 1.3 mm, we find that most of the disks in the AGE-PRO sample are consistent with simulations that have either weak or strong dust traps. The evolution of spectral index in the AGE-PRO sample is also suggestive of an unresolved population of dust traps. Future observations at high angular resolution are still needed to test several hypotheses that result from comparing the observations to our simulations, including that more massive disks in gas mass have the potential to form dust traps at larger disk radii.</description>

      <title>Euclid: The potential of slitless infrared spectroscopy: A z=5.4 quasar and new ultracool dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the potential of Euclid's slitless spectroscopy to discover high-redshift (z&gt;5) quasars and their main photometric contaminant, ultracool dwarfs. Sensitive infrared spectroscopy from space is able to efficiently identify both populations, as demonstrated by Euclid Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer Red Grism (NISP RGE) spectra of the newly discovered z=5.404 quasar EUCL J181530.01+652054.0, as well as several ultracool dwarfs in the Euclid Deep Field North and the Euclid Early Release Observation field Abell 2764. The ultracool dwarfs were identified by cross-correlating their spectra with templates. The quasar was identified by its strong and broad CIII] and MgII emission lines in the NISP RGE 1206-1892 nm spectrum, and confirmed through optical spectroscopy from the Large Binocular Telescope. The NISP Blue Grism (NISP BGE) 926-1366 nm spectrum confirms CIV and CIII] emission. NISP RGE can find bright quasars at z~5.5 and z&gt;7, redshift ranges that are challenging for photometric selection due to contamination from ultracool dwarfs. EUCL J181530.01+652054.0 is a high-excitation, broad absorption line quasar detected at 144 MHz by the LOw-Frequency Array (L144=4e25 W/Hz). The quasar has a bolometric luminosity of 3e12 Lsun and is powered by a 3.4e9 Msun black hole. The discovery of this bright quasar is noteworthy as fewer than one such object was expected in the ~20 deg2 surveyed. This finding highlights the potential and effectiveness of NISP spectroscopy in identifying rare, luminous high-redshift quasars, previewing the census of these sources that Euclid's slitless spectroscopy will deliver over about 14,000 deg2 of the sky.</description>

      <title>Energetic ($&lt;$ 2 MeV) ion fluxes measured by ASPEX-STEPS on board Aditya-L1 during its earth-bound phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During its earth-bound phase of the Aditya-L1 spacecraft of India, the Supra-Thermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of the Aditya Solar wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) was operated whenever the orbit was above 52000 km during 11 - 19 September 2023. This phase of operation provided measurements of energetic ions (with energies 0.1--2 MeV) in the magnetosphere, magnetosheath, and interplanetary medium. Three interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICME) hit the magnetosphere during this period. This provided opportunity to examine the relative roles of ICME-generated solar energetic particles (SEPs) and substorm generated energetic ions on the magnetosphere. We approach this objective by detailed spectral analyses of energetic ion fluxes measured by two units of ASPEX-STEPS. We identify three distinctly different conditions of the north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF $B_z$ = 0, $&gt;$ 0, and $&lt;$ 0) and use the derived spectral indices to understand this relative role. By combining these with the simultaneous energetic ion flux variations from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) around the Sun-Earth first Lagrangian (L1) point and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) in the Earth's magnetosphere, we show that the polarity of IMF $B_z$ influences the energetic ion spectra in the magnetosphere by modulating the interplay of the ICME-generated SEP with the energetic particles generated inside the magnetosphere by substorms. Interestingly, ASPEX-STEPS observations also indicate towards directional anisotropy based on spectral indices. This suggests spatially inhomogeneous mixing of energetic ions coming from different source processes.</description>

      <title>Multi-frequency analysis of the ALMA and VLA high resolution continuum observations of the substructured disc around CI Tau. Preference for sub-mm-sized low-porosity amorphous carbon grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) We present high angular resolution and sensitivity ALMA 3.1 mm and VLA 9.1 mm observations of the disc around CI Tau. These new data were combined with similar-resolution archival ALMA 0.9 and 1.3 mm observations and new and archival VLA 7.1 mm, 2.0, 3.0, and 6.0 cm photometry to study the properties of dust in this system. At wavelengths &lt;3.1 mm, CI Tau's continuum emission is very extended and highly substructured (with three gaps, four rings, and two additional gap-ring pairs identified by non-parametric visibility modelling). Instead, the VLA 9.1 mm data are dominated by a bright central component, only partially (&lt; 50%) due to dust emission, surrounded by a marginally detected, faint, and smooth halo. We fitted the ALMA and VLA 9.1 mm data together, adopting a physical model that accounts for the effects of dust absorption and scattering. For our fiducial dust composition ("Ricci" opacities), we retrieved a flat maximum grain size distribution across the disc radius of $(7.1\pm0.8)\times10^{-2}$ cm, that we tentatively attributed to fragmentation of fragile dust or bouncing. We tested, for the first time, the dependence of our results on the adopted dust composition model to assess which mixture can best reproduce the observations. We found that the "Ricci" opacities work better than the traditionally adopted "DSHARP" ones, while graphite-rich mixtures perform significantly worse. We also show that, for our fiducial composition, the data prefer low-porosity (&lt; 70%) grains, in contrast with claims of highly porous aggregates in younger sources, which we tentatively justified by time-dependent compaction. Our results are in line with constraints from disc population synthesis models and naturally arise from CI Tau's peculiar spectral behaviour, making this disc an ideal target for deeper cm-wavelength and dust polarisation follow-ups.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx Discovery of Strong Water Ice Absorption and an Extended Carbon Dioxide Coma in 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In mid-August 2025, 0.75-5.0 micron SPHEREx imaging spectrophotometric and ancillary NASA-IRTF SpeX 0.7-2.5 micron low-resolution spectral observations of Interstellar Object 3I ATLAS were obtained. The combined spectrophotometry is dominated by features due to water ice absorption and CO2 gas emission. A bright, 3 arcmin radius CO2 gas coma was clearly resolved, corresponding to Qgas,CO2 = 9.4 x 10{^26} molec/sec. From the SPHEREx photometry, we put conservative, preliminary 3sigma upper limits on the gas production rates for H2O and CO of 1.5 x 10{^26} and 2.8 x 10{^26} molec/sec. No obvious jet, tail, or trail structures were found in SPHEREx images. Assuming all observed 1-um flux is scattered light from an pv = 0.04 albedo spherical nucleus, its radius would be 23 km. Compared to the nucleus size limit r = 2.8km of Jewitt+ 2025, this suggests that greater than 99 percent of the measured SPHEREx continuum flux is from coma dust.</description>
