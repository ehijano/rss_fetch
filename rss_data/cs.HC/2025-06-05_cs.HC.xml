      <title>From Reality to Recognition: Evaluating Visualization Analogies for Novice Chart Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novice learners often have difficulty learning new visualization types because they tend to interpret novel visualizations through the mental models of simpler charts they have previously encountered. Traditional visualization teaching methods, which usually rely on directly translating conceptual aspects of data into concrete data visualizations, often fail to attend to the needs of novice learners navigating this tension. To address this, we conducted an empirical exploration of how analogies can be used to help novices with chart comprehension. We introduced visualization analogies: visualizations that map data structures to real-world contexts to facilitate an intuitive understanding of novel chart types. We evaluated this pedagogical technique using a within-subject study (N=128) where we taught 8 chart types using visualization analogies. Our findings show that visualization analogies improve visual analysis skills and help learners transfer their understanding to actual charts. They effectively introduce visual embellishments, cater to diverse learning preferences, and are preferred by novice learners over traditional chart visualizations. This study offers empirical insights and open-source tools to advance visualization education through analogical reasoning.</description>

      <title>Sampling Preferences Yields Simple Trustworthiness Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the onset of large language models (LLMs), the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) models is becoming increasingly multi-dimensional. Accordingly, there have been several large, multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks put forward to evaluate LLMs. Though these frameworks are much more realistic than previous attempts which only used a single score like accuracy, multi-dimensional evaluations can complicate decision-making since there is no obvious way to select an optimal model. This work introduces preference sampling, a method to extract a scalar trustworthiness score from multi-dimensional evaluation results by considering the many characteristics of model performance which users value. We show that preference sampling improves upon alternate aggregation methods by using multi-dimensional trustworthiness evaluations of LLMs from TrustLLM and DecodingTrust. We find that preference sampling is consistently reductive, fully reducing the set of candidate models 100% of the time whereas Pareto optimality never reduces the set by more than 50%. Likewise, preference sampling is consistently sensitive to user priors-allowing users to specify the relative weighting and confidence of their preferences-whereas averaging scores is intransigent to the users' prior knowledge.</description>

      <title>The Stress of Improvisation: Instructors' Perspectives on Live Coding in Programming Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Live coding is a pedagogical technique in which an instructor writes and executes code in front of students to impart skills like incremental development and debugging. Although live coding offers many benefits, instructors face many challenges in the classroom, like cognitive challenges and psychological stress, most of which have yet to be formally studied. To understand the obstacles faced by instructors in CS classes, we conducted (1) a formative interview with five teaching assistants in exercise sessions and (2) a contextual inquiry study with four lecturers for large-scale classes. We found that the improvisational and unpredictable nature of live coding makes it difficult for instructors to manage their time and keep students engaged, resulting in more mental stress than presenting static slides. We discussed opportunities for augmenting existing IDEs and presentation setups to help enhance live coding experience.</description>

      <title>VChatter: Exploring Generative Conversational Agents for Simulating Exposure Therapy to Reduce Social Anxiety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many people struggle with social anxiety, feeling fear, or even physically uncomfortable in social situations like talking to strangers. Exposure therapy, a clinical method that gradually and repeatedly exposes individuals to the source of their fear and helps them build coping mechanisms, can reduce social anxiety but traditionally requires human therapists' guidance and constructions of situations. In this paper, we developed a multi-agent system VChatter to explore large language models(LLMs)-based conversational agents for simulating exposure therapy with users. Based on a survey study (N=36) and an expert interview, VChatter includes an Agent-P, which acts as a psychotherapist to design the exposure therapy plans for users, and two Agent-Hs, which can take on different interactive roles in low, medium, and high exposure scenarios. A six-day qualitative study (N=10) showcases VChatter's usefulness in reducing users' social anxiety, feelings of isolation, and avoidance of social interactions. We demonstrated the feasibility of using LLMs-based conversational agents to simulate exposure therapy for addressing social anxiety and discussed future concerns for designing agents tailored to social anxiety.</description>

      <title>Understanding Visually Impaired Tramway Passengers Interaction with Public Transport Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing inclusive public transport services is crucial to developing modern, barrier-free smart city infrastructure. This research contributes to the design of inclusive public transport by considering accessibility challenges emerging from socio-technical systems, thus demanding the integration of technological and social solutions. Using Actor-Network Theory (ANT) as a theoretical framework and a mixed-method approach, including shadowing and a focus group, this study examines the socio-technical networks that shape accessibility experiences for visually impaired passengers utilizing the tram in Linz, Austria. Key dimensions that influence public transport accessibility are identified: network configuration, mobility patterns, technology integration, and warning systems. The results show that accessibility emerges from complex interactions between human actors (passengers, staff) and non-human actors (assistive devices, infrastructure) rather than being an inherent property of transport systems. Digital technologies serve multiple functions, from navigational assistance to broader social inclusion, although users comfort with technology varies. Participants emphasized the importance of the two-sense principle for warning signals, with directional audio and tactile feedback particularly valuable.</description>

      <title>Design of a visual environment for programming by direct data manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of applications on computers, smartphones, and tablets has been considerably simplified thanks to interactive and dynamic graphical interfaces coupled with the mouse and touch screens. It is no longer necessary to be a computer specialist to use them. Paradoxically, the development of computer programs generally requires writing lines of code in a programming language whose syntax is particularly strict. This process poses many difficulties for programmers. We propose an original tool in which arbitrary programs (Turing-complete) can be developed in a completely visual manner by direct manipulation of the data, without writing a line of code. The user can thus develop an algorithm by directly visualizing the result of actions taken on the data. A method for constructing iterations is associated with the tool. It proposes to create each part, including the loop body, in a non-linear manner under visual control of the state of the data. In addition, the tool supports the production of lines of code in several languages including Python, C, Java, that correspond to the actions performed. In this article, we present the tool, the design choices, the problems to be solved, and the limits and the contributions of the direct-data-manipulation approach.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Text Comprehension for Dyslexic Readers: A 3D Semantic Visualization Approach Using Transformer Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dyslexic individuals often face significant challenges with traditional reading, particularly when engaging with complex texts such as mystery novels. These texts typically demand advanced narrative tracking and information integration skills, making it difficult for dyslexic readers to fully comprehend the content. However, research indicates that while dyslexic individuals may struggle with textual processing, they often possess strong spatial imagination abilities. Leveraging this strength, this study proposes an innovative approach using Transformer models to map sentences and words into three-dimensional vector representations. This process clusters semantically similar sentences and words in spatial proximity, allowing dyslexic readers to interpret the semantic structure and narrative flow of the text through spatial perception. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to direct text reading, this three-dimensional semantic visualization method significantly enhances dyslexic readers' comprehension of complex texts. In particular, it shows marked advantages in identifying narrative relationships and character connections. This study provides a novel pathway for improving textual comprehension among dyslexic individuals</description>

      <title>PromptCanvas: Composable Prompting Workspaces Using Dynamic Widgets for Exploration and Iteration in Creative Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PromptCanvas, a concept that transforms prompting into a composable, widget-based experience on an infinite canvas. Users can generate, customize, and arrange interactive widgets representing various facets of their text, offering greater control over AI-generated content. PromptCanvas allows widget creation through system suggestions, user prompts, or manual input, providing a flexible environment tailored to individual needs. This enables deeper engagement with the creative process. In a lab study with 18 participants, PromptCanvas outperformed a traditional conversational UI on the Creativity Support Index. Participants found that it reduced cognitive load, with lower mental demand and frustration. Qualitative feedback revealed that the visual organization of thoughts and easy iteration encouraged new perspectives and ideas. A follow-up field study (N=10) confirmed these results, showcasing the potential of dynamic, customizable interfaces in improving collaborative writing with AI.</description>

      <title>Understanding Mental Models of Generative Conversational Search and The Effect of Interface Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experience and adoption of conversational search is tied to the accuracy and completeness of users' mental models -- their internal frameworks for understanding and predicting system behaviour. Thus, understanding these models can reveal areas for design interventions. Transparency is one such intervention which can improve system interpretability and enable mental model alignment. While past research has explored mental models of search engines, those of generative conversational search remain underexplored, even while the popularity of these systems soars. To address this, we conducted a study with 16 participants, who performed 4 search tasks using 4 conversational interfaces of varying transparency levels. Our analysis revealed that most user mental models were too abstract to support users in explaining individual search instances. These results suggest that 1) mental models may pose a barrier to appropriate trust in conversational search, and 2) hybrid web-conversational search is a promising novel direction for future search interface design.</description>

      <title>Neural and Cognitive Impacts of AI: The Influence of Task Subjectivity on Human-LLM Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-based interactive assistants are advancing human-augmenting technology, yet their effects on users' mental and physiological states remain under-explored. We address this gap by analyzing how Copilot for Microsoft Word, a LLM-based assistant, impacts users. Using tasks ranging from objective (SAT reading comprehension) to subjective (personal reflection), and with measurements including fNIRS, Empatica E4, NASA-TLX, and questionnaires, we measure Copilot's effects on users. We also evaluate users' performance with and without Copilot across tasks. In objective tasks, participants reported a reduction of workload and an increase in enjoyment, which was paired with objective performance increases. Participants reported reduced workload and increased enjoyment with no change in performance in a creative poetry writing task. However, no benefits due to Copilot use were reported in a highly subjective self-reflection task. Although no physiological changes were recorded due to Copilot use, task-dependent differences in prefrontal cortex activation offer complementary insights into the cognitive processes associated with successful and unsuccessful human-AI collaboration. These findings suggest that AI assistants' effectiveness varies with task type-particularly showing decreased usefulness in tasks that engage episodic memory-and presents a brain-network based hypothesis of human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>On the Necessity of Multi-Domain Explanation: An Uncertainty Principle Approach for Deep Time Series Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A prevailing approach to explain time series models is to generate attribution in time domain. A recent development in time series XAI is the concept of explanation spaces, where any model trained in the time domain can be interpreted with any existing XAI method in alternative domains, such as frequency. The prevailing approach is to present XAI attributions either in the time domain or in the domain where the attribution is most sparse. In this paper, we demonstrate that in certain cases, XAI methods can generate attributions that highlight fundamentally different features in the time and frequency domains that are not direct counterparts of one another. This suggests that both domains' attributions should be presented to achieve a more comprehensive interpretation. Thus it shows the necessity of multi-domain explanation. To quantify when such cases arise, we introduce the uncertainty principle (UP), originally developed in quantum mechanics and later studied in harmonic analysis and signal processing, to the XAI literature. This principle establishes a lower bound on how much a signal can be simultaneously localized in both the time and frequency domains. By leveraging this concept, we assess whether attributions in the time and frequency domains violate this bound, indicating that they emphasize distinct features. In other words, UP provides a sufficient condition that the time and frequency domain explanations do not match and, hence, should be both presented to the end user. We validate the effectiveness of this approach across various deep learning models, XAI methods, and a wide range of classification and forecasting datasets. The frequent occurrence of UP violations across various datasets and XAI methods highlights the limitations of existing approaches that focus solely on time-domain explanations. This underscores the need for multi-domain explanations as a new paradigm.</description>

      <title>The Reader is the Metric: How Textual Features and Reader Profiles Explain Conflicting Evaluations of AI Creative Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies comparing AI-generated and human-authored literary texts have produced conflicting results: some suggest AI already surpasses human quality, while others argue it still falls short. We start from the hypothesis that such divergences can be largely explained by genuine differences in how readers interpret and value literature, rather than by an intrinsic quality of the texts evaluated. Using five public datasets (1,471 stories, 101 annotators including critics, students, and lay readers), we (i) extract 17 reference-less textual features (e.g., coherence, emotional variance, average sentence length...); (ii) model individual reader preferences, deriving feature importance vectors that reflect their textual priorities; and (iii) analyze these vectors in a shared "preference space". Reader vectors cluster into two profiles: 'surface-focused readers' (mainly non-experts), who prioritize readability and textual richness; and 'holistic readers' (mainly experts), who value thematic development, rhetorical variety, and sentiment dynamics. Our results quantitatively explain how measurements of literary quality are a function of how text features align with each reader's preferences. These findings advocate for reader-sensitive evaluation frameworks in the field of creative text generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning models have achieved remarkable success. Training them is often accelerated by building on top of pre-trained models which poses the risk of perpetuating encoded biases. Here, we investigate biases in the representations of commonly used ImageNet classifiers for facial images while considering intersections of sensitive variables age, race and gender. To assess the biases, we use linear classifier probes and visualize activations as topographic maps. We find that representations in ImageNet classifiers particularly allow differentiation between ages. Less strongly pronounced, the models appear to associate certain ethnicities and distinguish genders in middle-aged groups.</description>

      <title>Generating Pedagogically Meaningful Visuals for Math Word Problems: A New Benchmark and Analysis of Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visuals are valuable tools for teaching math word problems (MWPs), helping young learners interpret textual descriptions into mathematical expressions before solving them. However, creating such visuals is labor-intensive and there is a lack of automated methods to support this process. In this paper, we present Math2Visual, an automatic framework for generating pedagogically meaningful visuals from MWP text descriptions. Math2Visual leverages a pre-defined visual language and a design space grounded in interviews with math teachers, to illustrate the core mathematical relationships in MWPs. Using Math2Visual, we construct an annotated dataset of 1,903 visuals and evaluate Text-to-Image (TTI) models for their ability to generate visuals that align with our design. We further fine-tune several TTI models with our dataset, demonstrating improvements in educational visual generation. Our work establishes a new benchmark for automated generation of pedagogically meaningful visuals and offers insights into key challenges in producing multimodal educational content, such as the misrepresentation of mathematical relationships and the omission of essential visual elements.</description>

      <title>Think Like a Person Before Responding: A Multi-Faceted Evaluation of Persona-Guided LLMs for Countering Hate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated counter-narratives (CN) offer a promising strategy for mitigating online hate speech, yet concerns about their affective tone, accessibility, and ethical risks remain. We propose a framework for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM)-generated CNs across four dimensions: persona framing, verbosity and readability, affective tone, and ethical robustness. Using GPT-4o-Mini, Cohere's CommandR-7B, and Meta's LLaMA 3.1-70B, we assess three prompting strategies on the MT-Conan and HatEval datasets. Our findings reveal that LLM-generated CNs are often verbose and adapted for people with college-level literacy, limiting their accessibility. While emotionally guided prompts yield more empathetic and readable responses, there remain concerns surrounding safety and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Controlling Difficulty of Generated Text for AI-Assisted Language Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Practicing conversations with large language models (LLMs) presents a promising alternative to traditional in-person language learning. However, most LLMs generate text at a near-native level of complexity, making them ill-suited for beginner learners (CEFR: A1-A2). In this paper, we investigate whether controllable generation techniques -- specifically modular methods that do not require model fine-tuning -- can adapt LLM outputs to better support absolute beginners. We evaluate these methods through both automatic metrics and a user study with university-level learners of Japanese. Our findings show that while prompting alone fails to control output difficulty, the use of future discriminators (Yang and Klein, 2021) significantly improves output comprehensibility (from 40.4\% to 84.3\%). We further introduce a novel token-level evaluation metric, Token Miss Rate (TMR), that quantifies the proportion of incomprehensible tokens per utterance and correlates strongly with human judgments. To support future research in AI-assisted language learning, we release our code, models, annotation tools, and dataset.</description>

      <title>Missing Pieces: How Do Designs that Expose Uncertainty Longitudinally Impact Trust in AI Decision Aids? An In Situ Study of Gig Drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision aids based on artificial intelligence (AI) induce a wide range of outcomes when they are deployed in uncertain environments. In this paper, we investigate how users' trust in recommendations from an AI decision aid is impacted over time by designs that expose uncertainty in predicted outcomes. Unlike previous work, we focus on gig driving - a real-world, repeated decision-making context. We report on a longitudinal mixed-methods study ($n=51$) where we measured gig drivers' trust as they interacted with an AI-based schedule recommendation tool. Our results show that participants' trust in the tool was shaped by both their first impressions of its accuracy and their longitudinal interactions with it; and that task-aligned framings of uncertainty improved trust by allowing participants to incorporate uncertainty into their decision-making processes. Additionally, we observed that trust depended on their characteristics as drivers, underscoring the need for more in situ studies of AI decision aids.</description>

      <title>Examining Algorithmic Curation on Social Media: An Empirical Audit of Reddit's r/popular Feed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Platforms are increasingly relying on algorithms to curate the content within users' social media feeds. However, the growing prominence of proprietary, algorithmically curated feeds has concealed what factors influence the presentation of content on social media feeds and how that presentation affects user behavior. This lack of transparency can be detrimental to users, from reducing users' agency over their content consumption to the propagation of misinformation and toxic content. To uncover details about how these feeds operate and influence user behavior, we conduct an empirical audit of Reddit's algorithmically curated trending feed called r/popular. Using 10K r/popular posts collected by taking snapshots of the feed over 11 months, we find that recent comments help a post remain on r/popular longer and climb the feed. We also find that posts below rank 80 correspond to a sharp decline in activity compared to posts above. When examining the effects of having a higher proportion of undesired behavior -- i.e., moderator-removed and toxic comments -- we find no significant evidence that it helps posts stay on r/popular for longer. Although posts closer to the top receive more undesired comments, we find this increase to coincide with a broader increase in overall engagement -- rather than indicating a disproportionate effect on undesired activity. The relationships between algorithmic rank and engagement highlight the extent to which algorithms employed by social media platforms essentially determine which content is prioritized and which is not. We conclude by discussing how content creators, consumers, and moderators on social media platforms can benefit from empirical audits aimed at improving transparency in algorithmically curated feeds.</description>

      <title>Towards Sustainable Creativity Support: An Exploratory Study on Prompt Based Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creativity is a valuable human skill that has long been augmented through both analog and digital tools. Recent progress in generative AI, such as image generation, provides a disruptive technological solution to supporting human creativity further and helping humans generate solutions faster. While AI image generators can help to rapidly visualize ideas based on user prompts, the use of such AI systems has also been critiqued due to their considerable energy usage. In this paper, we report on a user study (N = 24) to understand whether energy consumption can be reduced without impeding on the tool's perceived creativity support. Our results highlight that, for example, a main effect of (image generation) condition on energy consumption, and index of creativity support per prompt but not per task, which seem mainly attributed to image quantity per prompt. We provide details of our analysis on the relation between energy usage, creativity support, and prompting behavior, including attitudes towards designing with AI and its environmental impact.</description>

      <title>A Survey on (M)LLM-Based GUI Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents have emerged as a transformative paradigm in human-computer interaction, evolving from rule-based automation scripts to sophisticated AI-driven systems capable of understanding and executing complex interface operations. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of the rapidly advancing field of LLM-based GUI Agents, systematically analyzing their architectural foundations, technical components, and evaluation methodologies. We identify and analyze four fundamental components that constitute modern GUI Agents: (1) perception systems that integrate text-based parsing with multimodal understanding for comprehensive interface comprehension; (2) exploration mechanisms that construct and maintain knowledge bases through internal modeling, historical experience, and external information retrieval; (3) planning frameworks that leverage advanced reasoning methodologies for task decomposition and execution; and (4) interaction systems that manage action generation with robust safety controls. Through rigorous analysis of these components, we reveal how recent advances in large language models and multimodal learning have revolutionized GUI automation across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. We critically examine current evaluation frameworks, highlighting methodological limitations in existing benchmarks while proposing directions for standardization. This survey also identifies key technical challenges, including accurate element localization, effective knowledge retrieval, long-horizon planning, and safety-aware execution control, while outlining promising research directions for enhancing GUI Agents' capabilities. Our systematic review provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the field's current state and offers insights into future developments in intelligent interface automation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the design of a propaganda detection tool using Large Language Models (LLMs). Acknowledging the inherent biases in AI models, especially in political contexts, we investigate how these biases might be leveraged to enhance critical thinking in news consumption. Countering the typical view of AI biases as detrimental, our research proposes strategies of user choice and personalization in response to a user's political stance, applying psychological concepts of confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance. We present findings from a qualitative user study, offering insights and design recommendations (bias awareness, personalization and choice, and gradual introduction of diverse perspectives) for AI tools in propaganda detection.</description>

      <title>MAC-Gaze: Motion-Aware Continual Calibration for Mobile Gaze Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile gaze tracking faces a fundamental challenge: maintaining accuracy as users naturally change their postures and device orientations. Traditional calibration approaches, like one-off, fail to adapt to these dynamic conditions, leading to degraded performance over time. We present MAC-Gaze, a Motion-Aware continual Calibration approach that leverages smartphone Inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors and continual learning techniques to automatically detect changes in user motion states and update the gaze tracking model accordingly. Our system integrates a pre-trained visual gaze estimator and an IMU-based activity recognition model with a clustering-based hybrid decision-making mechanism that triggers recalibration when motion patterns deviate significantly from previously encountered states. To enable accumulative learning of new motion conditions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting, we employ replay-based continual learning, allowing the model to maintain performance across previously encountered motion conditions. We evaluate our system through extensive experiments on the publicly available RGBDGaze dataset and our own 10-hour multimodal MotionGaze dataset (481K+ images, 800K+ IMU readings), encompassing a wide range of postures under various motion conditions including sitting, standing, lying, and walking. Results demonstrate that our method reduces gaze estimation error by 19.9% on RGBDGaze (from 1.73 cm to 1.41 cm) and by 31.7% on MotionGaze (from 2.81 cm to 1.92 cm) compared to traditional calibration approaches. Our framework provides a robust solution for maintaining gaze estimation accuracy in mobile scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates emotional expression and perception in music performance using computational and neurophysiological methods. The influence of different performance settings, such as repertoire, diatonic modal etudes, and improvisation, as well as levels of expressiveness, on performers' emotional communication and listeners' reactions is explored. Professional musicians performed various tasks, and emotional annotations were provided by both performers and the audience. Audio analysis revealed that expressive and improvisational performances exhibited unique acoustic features, while emotion analysis showed stronger emotional responses. Neurophysiological measurements indicated greater relaxation in improvisational performances. This multimodal study highlights the significance of expressivity in enhancing emotional communication and audience engagement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a contrastive learning based framework, ExeChecker, for the interpretation of rehabilitation exercises. Our work builds upon state-of-the-art advances in the area of human pose estimation, graph-attention neural networks, and transformer interpretablity. The downstream task is to assist rehabilitation by providing informative feedback to users while they are performing prescribed exercises. We utilize a contrastive learning strategy during training. Given a tuple of correctly and incorrectly executed exercises, our model is able to identify and highlight those joints that are involved in an incorrect movement and thus require the user's attention. We collected an in-house dataset, ExeCheck, with paired recordings of both correct and incorrect execution of exercises. In our experiments, we tested our method on this dataset as well as the UI-PRMD dataset and found ExeCheck outperformed the baseline method using pairwise sequence alignment in identifying joints of physical relevance in rehabilitation exercises.</description>

      <title>Understanding Impact of Human Feedback via Influence Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), it is crucial to learn suitable reward models from human feedback to align large language models (LLMs) with human intentions. However, human feedback can often be noisy, inconsistent, or biased, especially when evaluating complex responses. Such feedback can lead to misaligned reward signals, potentially causing unintended side effects during the RLHF process. To address these challenges, we explore the use of influence functions to measure the impact of human feedback on the performance of reward models. We propose a compute-efficient approximation method that enables the application of influence functions to LLM-based reward models and large-scale preference datasets. In our experiments, we demonstrate two key applications of influence functions: (1) detecting common forms of labeler bias in human feedback datasets and (2) guiding labelers to refine their strategies to align more closely with expert feedback. By quantifying the impact of human feedback on reward models, we believe that influence functions can enhance feedback interpretability and contribute to scalable oversight in RLHF, helping labelers provide more accurate and consistent feedback.

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey of Agents for Computer Use: Foundations, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agents for computer use (ACUs) are an emerging class of systems capable of executing complex tasks on digital devices - such as desktops, mobile phones, and web platforms - given instructions in natural language. These agents can automate tasks by controlling software via low-level actions like mouse clicks and touchscreen gestures. However, despite rapid progress, ACUs are not yet mature for everyday use.
  In this survey, we investigate the state-of-the-art, trends, and research gaps in the development of practical ACUs. We provide a comprehensive review of the ACU landscape, introducing a unifying taxonomy spanning three dimensions: (I) the domain perspective, characterizing agent operating contexts; (II) the interaction perspective, describing observation modalities (e.g., screenshots, HTML) and action modalities (e.g., mouse, keyboard, code execution); and (III) the agent perspective, detailing how agents perceive, reason, and learn.
  We review 87 ACUs and 33 datasets across foundation model-based and classical approaches through this taxonomy. Our analysis identifies six major research gaps: insufficient generalization, inefficient learning, limited planning, low task complexity in benchmarks, non-standardized evaluation, and a disconnect between research and practical conditions.
  To address these gaps, we advocate for: (a) vision-based observations and low-level control to enhance generalization; (b) adaptive learning beyond static prompting; (c) effective planning and reasoning methods and models; (d) benchmarks that reflect real-world task complexity; (e) standardized evaluation based on task success; (f) aligning agent design with real-world deployment constraints.
  Together, our taxonomy and analysis establish a foundation for advancing ACU research toward general-purpose agents for robust and scalable computer use.</description>

      <title>Dehumanizing Machines: Mitigating Anthropomorphic Behaviors in Text Generation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As text generation systems' outputs are increasingly anthropomorphic -- perceived as human-like -- scholars have also increasingly raised concerns about how such outputs can lead to harmful outcomes, such as users over-relying or developing emotional dependence on these systems. How to intervene on such system outputs to mitigate anthropomorphic behaviors and their attendant harmful outcomes, however, remains understudied. With this work, we aim to provide empirical and theoretical grounding for developing such interventions. To do so, we compile an inventory of interventions grounded both in prior literature and a crowdsourcing study where participants edited system outputs to make them less human-like. Drawing on this inventory, we also develop a conceptual framework to help characterize the landscape of possible interventions, articulate distinctions between different types of interventions, and provide a theoretical basis for evaluating the effectiveness of different interventions.</description>

      <title>InSerter: Speech Instruction Following with Unsupervised Interleaved Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in speech large language models (SpeechLLMs) have attracted considerable attention. Nonetheless, current methods exhibit suboptimal performance in adhering to speech instructions. Notably, the intelligence of models significantly diminishes when processing speech-form input as compared to direct text-form input. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this semantic inconsistency between speech and text representations through techniques such as representation and behavior alignment, which involve the meticulous design of data pairs during the post-training phase. In this paper, we introduce a simple and scalable training method called InSerter, which stands for Interleaved Speech-Text Representation Pre-training. InSerter is designed to pre-train large-scale unsupervised speech-text sequences, where the speech is synthesized from randomly selected segments of an extensive text corpus using text-to-speech conversion. Consequently, the model acquires the ability to generate textual continuations corresponding to the provided speech segments, obviating the need for intensive data design endeavors. To systematically evaluate speech instruction-following capabilities, we introduce SpeechInstructBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for speech-oriented instruction-following tasks. Our proposed InSerter achieves SOTA performance in SpeechInstructBench and demonstrates superior or competitive results across diverse speech processing tasks.</description>
