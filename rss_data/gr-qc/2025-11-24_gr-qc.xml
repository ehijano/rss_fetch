      <title>Exploring the gauge flexibility of the linear-in-spin effective-one-body Hamiltonian at the 5.5 post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the gauge-general expressions of the two gyro-gravitomagnetic functions entering the spin-orbit sector of the effective-one-body (EOB) Hamiltonian up to the fifth-and-half post-Newtonian (5.5PN) order. Our results include both local and nonlocal-in-time contributions, providing the most general analytical formulation of the linear-in-spin conservative dynamics within the EOB framework. These expressions are then employed to compute two gauge-invariant observables for quasi-circular orbits: the binding energy and the fractional periastron advance. We also use them to compare two spin-gauge choices: the well-known Damour-Jaranowski-Sch\"afer ($\rm DJS$) gauge, in which the gyro-gravitomagnetic functions are independent of the orbital angular momentum, and the alternative anti-$\rm DJS$ (or $\overline{\rm DJS}$) gauge, designed to reproduce in the test-mass limit the spin-orbit interaction of a spinning test particle in a Kerr background. For a circular, equal-mass, equal-spin binary, our analysis indicates that the $\overline{\rm DJS}$ gauge provides a slightly improved description of the inspiral dynamics, suggesting potential advantages for its use in future EOB waveform models.</description>

      <title>LISA as a probe of pre-big-bang physics: a nested sampling analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a nested sampling analysis, we study the gravitational-wave background (GWB) predicted by pre-big-bang cosmology, both in its minimal and non-minimal version. Within the LISA sensitivity range, the GWB signal is a flat or a broken power law, parametrized by four fundamental quantities: the Hubble parameter at the curvature bounce $H_1$, the axion mass $m$, the initial amplitude of the axion field $\sigma_i$ and the exponent $\beta$ governing the high-energy growth of the dilaton and the dynamics of the internal dimensions. We determine the posterior distributions of these parameters based on how LISA would detect such signal. Including the galactic and extra-galactic foregrounds in the analysis, the most stringent constraints on $H_1$, $\sigma_i$ and $\beta$ are obtained when the signal exhibits a left-bend feature, while for $m$ this happens for a right-bend feature. Relative uncertainties reach $\Delta H_1/H_1 ,\,\Delta m/m \sim 18\%$ at $68\%$ confidence level under favourable conditions. LISA will thus be capable of placing significant constraints on the pre-big-bang model, potentially providing empirical hints of string theory in the case of detection.</description>

      <title>Numerical tiling-based simulations of decoherence in multifield models of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work, we developed a method for computing two-point correlators by decomposing the mode degrees of freedom into fast and slow components. Building on this framework, we present a numerical implementation to study the evolution of primordial scalar perturbations under controlled state deformations induced by the simplest environment corrections from the Lindblad equation. Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.</description>

      <title>All-sky search for continuous gravitational-wave signals from unknown neutron stars in binary systems in the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a blind all-sky search for continuous gravitational-wave signals from neutron stars in binary systems using data from the first part of the fourth observing run (O4a) using LIGO detectors data. Rapidly rotating, non-axisymmetric neutron stars are expected to emit continuous gravitational waves, whose detection would significantly improve our understanding of the galactic neutron star population and matter under extreme conditions, while also providing valuable tests of general relativity. Neutron stars in binary systems likely constitute a substantial fraction of the unobserved galactic population and, due to potential mass accretion, may emit stronger gravitational-wave signals than their isolated counterparts. This search targets signals from neutron stars with frequencies in the 100-350 Hz range, with orbital periods between 7 and 15 days and projected semi-major axes between 5 and 15 light-seconds. The analysis employs the GPU-accelerated fasttracks pipeline. No credible astrophysical signals were identified, and, in the absence of a detection, we report search sensitivity estimates on the population of neutron stars in binary systems in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Accelerating parameter estimation for parameterized tests of general relativity with gravitational-wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tests of general relativity (GR) with gravitational waves (GWs) introduce additional deviation parameters in the waveform model. The enlarged parameter space makes inference computationally costly, which has so far limited systematic, large-scale studies that are essential to quantify degeneracies, check effect of waveform systematics, and assess robustness across non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise effects. The need is even sharper for next-generation (XG) observatories where signals are longer, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are higher, and likelihood evaluations increase substantially. We address this by applying relative binning to the TIGER framework for parameterized tests of GR. Relative binning replaces dense frequency evaluations with evaluations on adaptively chosen frequency bins, reducing the cost per likelihood call while preserving posterior accuracy. Using simulated binary black hole signals, we demonstrate unbiased recovery for GR-consistent cases and targeted non-GR deviations, and we map how bin resolution controls accuracy, with fine binning primarily required for the $-1$ post-Newtonian term. A high-SNR simulated signal at next-generation sensitivity further shows accurate recovery with tight posteriors. Applied to GW150914 and GW250114, both single and multi-parameter TIGER analyses finish within a day, yielding deviation bounds consistent with GR at 90\% credibility and in agreement with previous results. Across analyses, the method reduces wall time by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ to $\mathcal{O}(100)$, depending on frequency range and binning, without degrading parameter estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Exceptional line and pseudospectrum in black hole spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the exceptional points (EPs) and their pseudospectra in black hole perturbation theory. By considering a Gaussian bump modification to the Regge-Wheeler potential with variable amplitude, position, and width parameters, $(\varepsilon,d,\sigma_0)$, a continuous line of EPs (exceptional line, EL) in this three-dimensional parameter space is revealed. We find that the vorticity $\nu=\pm1/2$ and the Berry phase $\gamma=\pi$ for loops encircling the EL, while $\nu=0$ and $\gamma=0$ for those do not encircle the EL. Through matrix perturbation theory, we prove that the $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum contour size scales as $\epsilon^{1/q}$ at an EP, where $q$ is the order of the largest Jordan block of the Hamiltonian-like operator, contrasting with the linear $\epsilon$ scaling at non-EPs. Numerical implements confirm this observation, demonstrating enhanced spectral instability at EPs for non-Hermitian systems including black holes.</description>

      <title>The Two-Measure Theory and an Overview of Some of its Manifestations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Two-Measure theory (TMT) has been developing since 1998 and has yielded a number of highly interesting results, including those not realized in traditional field theory models. The most important advantage of TMT as an alternative theory is that, under the conditions under which all classical tests of general relativity are performed, TMT models are able to accurately reproduce Einstein's general relativity. Despite this, TMT is still often perceived as something too exotic to be relevant to reality. In fact, the fundamental idea underlying TMT seems undeniable: if we truly believe in the effectiveness of mathematics in studying nature, we must agree that there must be a correspondence between the fundamental laws of nature and the structure of the mathematical apparatus necessary to adequately describe them. It then turns out that there is no reason to ignore the volume measure existing on the differentiable manifold on which the theory of gravity and matter fields is built. This idea has far-reaching implications. The goals of this paper are: 1) to provide a clear mathematical and conceptual justification for TMT; 2) to collect in a single article some of the main results of TMT obtained over the past 25 years.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations on an averaged background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In relativistic cosmology, the formation of nonlinear inhomogeneities can induce non-negligible backreaction on late-time expansion. Among the important consequences for precision cosmology is the potential impact on the linear growth of large-scale structures. We address this impact by combining covariant spatial averaging with covariant and gauge-invariant perturbation theory. We focus on irrotational dust model spacetimes. The effects of backreaction and nontrivial dynamical curvature on the average cosmological dynamics are formulated as the addition of an effective perfect fluid with pressure. We then introduce an effective background driven by both the averaged dust density and the emergent effective fluid, and derive the general evolution equations for linear perturbations of this system. The residual freedom in this framework amounts to specifying the properties of the effective-fluid perturbations as a closure condition. We analyse two physically motivated choices for this condition. In addition, we clarify the conditions under which the coupling between linear structure growth and perturbations of the effective fluid can be neglected. Finally, we apply this formalism to four examples of averaged cosmological models from the literature, three of which -- intended as effective full descriptions of the largest scales -- have been shown to provide a good fit to observational data. Our results highlight the importance of backreaction effects in shaping linear structure growth in such models. Neglecting these effects may thus lead to biased predictions for the development of large structures, even when the models provide a good description of the general background observables.</description>

      <title>Emergence of critical phenomena from the black hole interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the $r=0$ singularity inside a spherically symmetric charged black hole, is studied numerically within the Einstein-Maxwell-real scalar model. When the scalar field reaches a critical strength, the $r=0$ singularity emerges inside of the black hole at the tip of the causal diamond. By varying the parameter $p$ of the initial profile for the scalar field towards the critical value ${p_*}$, we observe the areal radius at the tip follows a power law scaling, ${r_S } \propto {| {p - {p_*}}|^\gamma }$, with a universal critical exponent $\gamma\approx 0.5$. This remarkable discovery, analogous to Choptuik's critical phenomena for the black hole formation, provides the first evidence of the universality and scaling for the emergence of the $r=0$ singularity inside black holes, offering new insights into the nonlinear dynamics of strong gravitational field.</description>

      <title>Implications of GW241011 for rotating exotic compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of theoretical proposals have been made for horizonless compact objects with masses and spins similar to those of black holes. While gravitational wave signatures from their mergers can resemble those of black holes, features like the spin-induced quadrupole moment may reveal their distinct nature. Using the tight bounds on the spin-induced quadrupole moment of GW241011, we place gravitational wave constraints on the nature of its primary. We find that large classes of exotic compact objects (including rotating boson stars) cannot explain its nature, however, models of sufficiently large compactness of $C \gtrsim 0.24$ may still be viable contenders.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and correlations between local observables in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of quantum field entanglement in de Sitter space based on the von Neumann entropy of local patches have concluded that curvature enhances entanglement between regions and their complements. Similar conclusions about entanglement enhancement have been reached in analyses of Fourier modes in the cosmological patch of de Sitter space. We challenge this interpretation by adopting a fully local approach: examining entanglement between pairs of field modes compactly supported within de Sitter's cosmological patch. Our approach is formulated in terms of the properties of a metric tensor and an associated complex structure induced by the Bunch-Davies vacuum on the classical phase space. We find that increasing curvature increases correlations between local modes but, somewhat counterintuitively, decreases their entanglement. Our methods allow us to characterize how entanglement is spatially distributed, revealing that a cosmological constant, even if tiny, qualitatively alters the vacuum's entanglement structure. We show that our results are compatible with previous entropy-based studies when properly interpreted. Our findings have implications for entanglement between observables generated during cosmic inflation.</description>

      <title>A battle of designs: triangular vs. L-shaped detectors and parity violation in the gravitational-wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the prospects for detecting a parity-violating gravitational-wave background (GWB) with third-generation ground-based detector networks. We focus on a network consisting of one Einstein Telescope (ET) and two Cosmic Explorer (CE) detectors. In our analysis we vary the ET design, detector orientations, and arm lengths, in order to assess the impact of geometry and scale on detection capabilities. We demonstrate that networks with an L-shaped ET design have stronger parity violation constraining power than networks with a triangular ET design, particularly seen when studying ET designs on their own.</description>

      <title>Constraining interacting dark energy models with black hole superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent preference for a dynamical dark energy (DE) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument seems to call for interactions between DE and dark matter (DM), either from direct DM-DE interaction or indirect interaction induced by modified gravity. Therefore, an independent probe for these kinds of DE-DM interactions would be appealing from observational aspects. In this paper, we propose the black hole superradiance as a novel astrophysical probe for field-theoretic interacting DE-DM models, providing complementary constraints independent of large-scale cosmological observations. The core principle is that the DE-DM interaction can alter the effective mass of the superradiant ultralight boson, thereby modifying its superradiant instability rate around spinning black holes. We explore this connection through two distinct scenarios: a model where the DE field mediates a dark fifth force within the DM sector, affecting the superradiance from DM particles; and a novel mechanism where the DE field itself becomes superradiant due to the effective mass enhancement induced by dense DM spikes around supermassive black holes. By applying a statistical framework to black hole observations in both scenarios, we derive constraints on the fundamental DE-DM coupling strength. Although the current constraints are rather loose due to small samples and inaccurate measurements, our work provides new astrophysical constraints on these interacting DE-DM scenarios and establishes a new synergy between black hole physics and cosmology for probing the fundamental nature of the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Growth of Cosmic Strings with Field-Dependent Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel mechanism to produce a cosmic network of fundamental superstrings based on a time-varying string tension has been recently proposed. It has been found that fundamental superstrings can grow in a kinating background driven by the rolling of the volume modulus of Type IIB string compactifications towards the minimum of its potential. In this talk, I will generalise this analysis using dynamical systems techniques. First, I will analyse the cosmological growth of strings with a field-dependent tension in a Universe filled with a perfect fluid, finding a growth region in the phase space of this system. This machinery is then applied to both fundamental superstrings and effective strings obtained from wrapping $p$-branes on $(p-1)$- dimensional cycles. I will show how cosmological growth can be achieved in both cases not only in kinating backgrounds, but also in scaling fixed points. This talk is based on arXiv:2502.14953.</description>

      <title>GSpyNetTreeS: a machine learning solution for glitch localization in time and frequency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data from ground-based gravitational wave detectors are often contaminated by non-Gaussian instrumental artifacts or detector noise transients. Unbiased source property estimation relies on the ability to correctly identify and characterize these artifacts and remove them if necessary. To this end, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration has implemented candidate vetting for all significant candidates to identify the presence of artifacts and assess the need for mitigation. The current candidate vetting process requires human experts to identify the frequency ranges and the time windows associated with any data quality issues present. Differences in judgment between human experts may cause inconsistency, making results difficult to reproduce across gravitational wave events. We present GSpyNetTreeS, an extension to GSpyNetTree based on the You Only Look Once algorithm, for the automatic detection, classification, and time-frequency localization of detector noise transients. As a proof of concept, we tested GSpyNetTreeS's performance on the data collected by the LIGO detectors during the third observing run for gravitational waves as well as common detector glitch classes included in GSpyNetTree: Blip, Low frequency blip, Low frequency line and Scratchy. We also demonstrated that GSpyNetTreeS is capable of accurately identifying common glitch classes and capturing the frequency and time information associated with detected detector noise transients, establishing its potential as an automatic event validation tool for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's observing runs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optical Simulator for Unruh-DeWitt Detector Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum-optical platform for simulating relativistic detector-field interactions using entangled nonlinear biphoton sources (ENBSs), realized through phase-controlled single-photon frequency-comb (SPFC) sources. By mapping the dynamical evolution of this system onto the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector model, we show that signal-mode excitations emulate detector transitions driven by vacuum fluctuations, while coherently seeded idler modes act as an effective quantum field. This correspondence enables tabletop exploration of Unruh-like excitation, coherence harvesting, and field-induced entanglement. We derive the effective interaction Hamiltonian and Lindblad master equation for two coherently seeded ENBS units and obtain analytical solutions for the signal photon number \(N_{\rm sig}(t)\) and second-order correlation function \(g^{(2)}(0;t)\). Numerical simulations confirm that phase-dependent biphoton dynamics reproduce UDW-type behavior, including tunable excitation and quantum correlations. The output signal state exhibits controllable fidelity, interference visibility, and entanglement entropy as functions of the seeding phase and amplitude. These results establish ENBSs as experimentally accessible quantum simulators of relativistic field phenomena, providing a photonic testbed for analog gravitational effects, vacuum fluctuations, and spacetime-induced coherence-all within reach of current nonlinear-optics technology.</description>

      <title>50-km fiber interferometer for testing gravitational signatures in quantum interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics and general relativity are the foundational pillars of modern physics, yet experimental tests that combine the two frameworks remain rare. Measuring optical phase shifts of massless photons in a gravitational potential provides a unique quantum platform to probe gravity beyond Newtonian descriptions, but laboratory-based interferometers have not yet reached the sensitivity needed to access this regime. Here, we report the realization of a 50-km table-top Mach-Zehnder fiber interferometer operating at the single-photon level, achieving a phase sensitivity of $4.42\times10^{-6}$ rad root-mean-square (RMS) within the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 5 Hz. We demonstrate that this sensitivity is sufficient to resolve a phase-shift signal of $(6.18 \pm 0.44)\times10^{-5}$ rad RMS at 0.1 Hz, associated with a modulated gravity-induced signal. Our results establish a milestone for quantum sensing with large-scale optical interferometry, demonstrating the capability to detect gravitational redshifts in a local laboratory, thereby paving the way for testing quantum phenomena within general relativistic frameworks.</description>

      <title>Entanglement first law for timelike entanglement entropy and linearized Einstein's equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the entanglement first law of conformal field theory (CFT) to timelike subregions. Focusing on intervals along the time direction of the boundary CFT, we show that the associated timelike entanglement entropy obeys a first-law-like relation, with an effective entanglement temperature inversely proportional to the temporal size of the interval. By implementing a double Wick rotation, we obtain the exact modular Hamiltonian for a suitable hyperbolic subsystem and use it to formulate the timelike entanglement first law precisely. Our central result is a detailed proof that, in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetime, this timelike entanglement first law is equivalent to linearized Einstein's equations in the bulk: the first law follows from the linearized equations and, conversely, implies them. Our result further reveal the dynamical connections between entanglement and gravity.</description>

      <title>Magnetized particle motion and accretion process with shock cone morphology around a decoupled hairy black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic accretion onto compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars is one of the most efficient known mechanisms for converting gravitational potential energy into radiation. In the case of rapidly spinning black holes, up to $40\%$ of the rest-mass energy of accreting matter can be released, far exceeding the efficiency of nuclear fusion. In this work, we investigate magnetized particle motion and relativistic accretion processes around a decoupled hairy black hole via extended geometric deformation. The developed geometry involves two hairy parameters that preserve the horizon structure with the additional feature of the fulfillment of weak energy conditions outside the event horizon. We provide the foundation with necessary formalism for magnetized particle motion around a decoupled black hole. The effective potential and innermost stable circular orbits are then derived, which demonstrate a significant reduction of the radius of the latter quantity under the hairy parameters for the magnetized particle. Afterwards, we obtain exact analytical expressions for radial velocity profiles, mass accretion rates, and a few others which reveal improved energy efficiency and emissivity as compared to the standard black hole. Furthermore, the decoupling parameter shows strong influence on oscillations, accretion presenting fantastic agreement between analytical predictions and numerical simulations, and thus offering noticeable observational signatures for future gravitational wave and X-ray astronomy.</description>

      <title>Analytic Computation of Dilaton Black Hole Quasinormal Modes via Seiberg-Witten Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of dilaton black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity through a correspondence with the quantum Seiberg-Witten (SW) curve of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SU(2) gauge theory with $N_f=3$ hypermultiplets. By mapping both the black hole perturbation equation and the quantum SW curve to the confluent Heun form, the QNM problem is reformulated in a gauge-theoretic framework, and the spectrum is obtained via the SW quantization condition. The resulting frequencies show excellent agreement with those computed using the WKB and continued fraction methods, with typical deviations below $10^{-3}$. The QNM spectrum exhibits consistent trends: increasing the black hole charge or scalar field mass raises the oscillation frequency, while higher angular momentum reduces the damping rate. These results demonstrate the precision of the quantum SW framework in describing black hole perturbations and reveal new links between supersymmetric gauge theories and gravitational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Constraining non-minimally coupled squared-Quartic Hilltop Inflation in light of ACT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of the data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) with the recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) indicate that the scalar spectral index \( n_s \) has a larger value than the Planck 2018 which leads to tension within standard inflationary models. In this study in order to explain the new data, We consider the squared-Quartic Hilltop inflation potential \( V(\phi) = V_0 [1 - \lambda (\phi/M_p)^4]^2 \) within the Einstein and Jordan frames. In the Jordan frame we introduce the coupling term \( \xi \phi^2 R \) and we calculate analytic expressions for the slow-roll parameters, scalar spectral index, and tensor-to-scalar ratio on the weak and strong coupling regimes. In the weak limit (\( \xi \ll 1 \)), perturbative corrections slightly increase \( n_s \) and suppress \( r \), leading to \( n_s \simeq 0.9743 \) and \( r \sim 7.8 \times 10^{-5} \) for representative parameters \( \lambda = 10^{-3}, \xi = 10^{-3}, {\cal N} = 117 \), values which are in agreement with the joint Planck--ACT--DESI (P-ACT-LB) constraints. On the other hand, for a strong coupled (\( \xi \gg 1 \)), the conformal rescaling provides an exponentially flat potential plateau, which allows us to calculate \( n_s \approx 0.9743 \) with \( r \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4} \) for \( {\cal N} = 65{-}70 \), consistent with ACT and BK18 bounds. The associated energy scale of inflation, \( V_0^{1/4} \sim 10^{-3}{-}10^{-2} M_p \), remains compatible with high-scale inflationary scenarios.</description>

      <title>Moving superfluids in the rotating universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study homogeneous cosmological models featuring shift-symmetric scalar fields (or, superfluids) in relative motion. In the presence of anisotropy this universe generally features rotation, in the sense that the principal axes of anisotropic expansion rotate with respect to the cosmic comoving frame. We focus in particular on the minimal case of two superfluids in 2+1 dimensions. The momentum constraint enforces their spatial gradients to be collinear and the dynamics tends to align such a direction with that of maximal expansion at late times. As opposed to the recently studied case of solids, rotation plays a more important role in the present two-superfluids model. The associated energy density does not dilute away but scales as that of anisotropy and affects the total equation of state. We find that purely non-rotating solutions correspond to an unstable surface in phase space in the direction of non-vanishing rotation. This suggests that rotation is a crucial feature of these scenarios that cannot be neglected.</description>

      <title>How Significant are Cosmological Collider Signals in the Planck Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) is theoretically well motivated but remains observationally challenging. Tight constraints with low significance for the standard non-Gaussian shapes suggest that detection may lie beyond the reach of near-future experiments. However, tests of PNG are highly template-dependent. From a theory perspective, a whole new family of bispectrum shapes arise in the cosmological collider program, with distinct signatures of heavy particles during inflation. In this work, we provide a class of simplified collider templates for these particles that encompasses a broader range of masses, sound speeds, and interactions. We propose that, given the current state of observations, the most effective strategy to search for PNG signals is through orthogonalizing the collider templates, such that they are uncorrelated with the tightly constrained single field predictions. Using the Modal pipeline and Planck CMB data, we perform a systematic parameter scan of the collider templates with the most significant result reaching $2.4\sigma$ for spin-0, after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect; indicative results for spin-1 and spin-2 peak near 2$\sigma$. These results indicate that, with refined collider templates and improved data analysis strategies, there are credible prospects with forthcoming observations to detect PNG and also rule out single field inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology one has more number of dynamical equations, compared to the number of unknown variables. This fact makes some equations redundant. The situation becomes complicated because all the relevant differential equations in cosmology are not of the same order. In this article we study the fate of the redundant equations. We show that this redundancy is inevitable in general relativity and a modern modification of gravity, called $f(R)$ gravity. It is shown that this redundancy predicts a special role to one of the Friedmann equations, which constrains the initial values of the problem. It is shown that the initial constraint condition itself evolves with time. Our method of analyzing the dynamical structure of the theories relies on an operational approach and can be generalized further.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the quasinormal mode spectrum for Kerr black holes surrounded by an asymptotically uniform magnetic field, modeled with the Ernst-Wild geometry. A perturbative expansion in both the rotation parameter $a$ and the magnetic field $B$ allows the analysis of perturbations with Kerr-like asymptotics well inside the Melvin radius, and we obtain the spectrum for a variety of scalar quasinormal modes over a range of parameters using the continued fraction method. We then interpolate the low-lying mode spectrum to construct an Ernst-Wild template for the ringdown, and use the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analysis tool pyRing to assess the impact of the magnetosphere on the extraction of ringdown signatures from several observed binary black hole mergers.</description>

Abstract: We explore the gravitational-wave emission from head-on collisions of equal-mass solitonic boson-star binaries from simulations spanning a two-dimensional parameter space, consisting of the central scalar-field amplitude of the stars and the solitonic potential parameter. We report the gravitational-wave energies emitted by boson-star binaries which, due to their combination of moderately high compactness with significant deformability, we often find to be louder by up to an order of magnitude than analogous black-hole collisions. The dependence of the radiated energy on the boson-star parameters exhibits striking needle-sharp features and discontinuous jumps to the value emitted by black-hole binaries. We explain these features in terms of the solitonic potential and the stability properties of the respective individual stars.</description>

      <title>Exploring the universal $\bar{\mathcal{I}}-\mathcal{C}$ relations for relativistic stars in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of neutron stars within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity by incorporating rotational effects through a slowly rotating metric. We derive the modified TOV equations and calculate the angular velocity profiles and moments of inertia (MOI) for linear, quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic $f(Q)$ models. Our results show that deviations in the MOI are more pronounced than those in the stellar mass profiles, suggesting that rotational observables are highly sensitive to geometric corrections. We also calculate a quasi-universal relation between the dimensionless MOI and compactness ($\bar{I}$-$C$). The linear and quadratic models are generally consistent with observational data from PSR J0737-3039A, although the deviations are small and difficult to distinguish from General Relativity due to inherent EoS variability. On other hand, the logarithmic and exponential models show larger deviations (over 20 %), exceeding the EoS-induced uncertainty reported by Suleiman &amp; Read (2024), highlighting the relation's sensitivity to the $f(Q)$ gravity model. These results indicate that $f(Q)$ gravity could potentially be tested in the strong-field regime and point to a direction for future studies, such as investigating EoS-insensitive quasi-universal relations, like the $\bar{I}(\Lambda)$ relations, within the $f(Q)$ framework. Such relations may provide a clearer pathway for exploring possible signatures in strong-field gravity when combined with more precise future observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the shadow and thin accretion disk around Ay\'{o}n-Beato-Garc\'{i}a (ABG) black hole (BH) coupled with a cloud of strings (CS), characterized by the nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) parameter $g$, and the CS parameter $a$. By comparing shadow diameters with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87$^{*}$ and Sgr A$^*$, we have established constraints on the BH parameters $g$ and $a$. Additionally, we analyze the BH shadow, lensing ring, and photon ring features for the ABG BH coupled with CS. Our results indicate that the shadow radius increases monotonically with the CS parameter $a$, while it decreases with increasing $g$. Finally, the study explores the physical properties and observational signatures of thin accretion disks around ABG BH with CS. The results show that an increase in parameter $g$ leads to a hotter and more luminous disk, while an increase in parameter $a$ results in a cooler and less luminous disk.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy parameterizations in VCDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of a theory of minimally modified gravity called VCDM, one can realize any cosmological behavior at the level of the homogeneous and isotropic background without introducing fatal instabilities for perturbations. Therefore, VCDM provides a theoretically-consistent and observationally-testable framework of dynamical dark energy parameterizations with or without phantom behaviors. In this paper, we propose the VCDM realizations of various phenomenological parameterizations present in the literature: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Exponential (EXP), and Logarithmic (LOG) models. Using the VCDM equations for cosmological perturbations, we test them against the recent cosmological datasets, Planck 2018 and DESI BAO DR2, and then discuss their implications.</description>

      <title>Observable signature of magnetic tidal coupling in hierarchical triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study hierarchical triple systems formed by a compact binary orbiting a supermassive black hole (SMBH), focusing on the role of relativistic magnetic tidal interactions. Extending previous analyses of precession resonances to 0.5 post-Newtonian order, we incorporate quadrupolar magnetic tidal moments, which have no Newtonian counterpart. We find that magnetic tides introduce new resonances absent at lower order, leading to additional eccentricity excitations and significantly modifying the binary's long-term evolution. Numerical solutions of the Lagrange Planetary Equations confirm these analytical predictions and reveal how resonance strength depends on orbital eccentricity and inclination. The resulting dynamics accelerates the binary merger and imprints distinctive signatures on gravitational waves, potentially observable by LISA. Our findings identify magnetic tidal coupling as a novel strong-gravity effect and establish its importance for the resonant dynamics of compact-object binaries near SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Formation of Apparent Horizons due to Boundary Effect in Vacuum Einstein Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that an apparent horizon can form as a result of Einsteinian evolution in pure vacuum spacetime starting from regular initial data free of apparent horizons due to pure boundary effects. We adapt a Cauchy-double-null framework and use the boundary generalized mean curvature condition for the existence of an interior apparent horizon imposed by the author S-T Yau in \cite{yau}. In particular, we prove that the condition of \cite{yau} can be met dynamically starting from a configuration that does not verify the same through a focusing mechanism. This is the first part of a two-part sequence, and in the sequel, we will focus on explicitly constructing the Cauchy data.</description>

Abstract: Lecture notes prepared for the Les Houches school "Quantum Geometry: Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics" that took place during the summer 2024. We cover the techniques to perform the exact gravitational path integral of two-dimensional dilaton-gravity, and supergravity, over spacetimes with arbitrary topology, with an application to black holes. We discuss the connection with random matrix models and moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces briefly, since those concepts were covered in other lectures of the school.</description>

      <title>The Role of Conceptual Problem Solving in Learning Physics: A Study in a General Relativity University Course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective physics learning, especially in complex topics, requires balancing mathematical formalism with conceptual understanding. Conceptual problem-solving involves connecting math to physical reality, and using an epistemological framework like problem framing helps students justify their mathematical decisions. This approach deepens students' understanding by linking theory to practice and enhancing their reasoning skills. This study explores the effectiveness of conceptual problem-solving in learning complex topics like general relativity (GR) through a pedagogical framework that emphasizes the integration of qualitative and quantitative reasoning. We present a case study conducted at the University of Cagliari in 2021 and 2022, examining how students construct problem frames and how this influences their conceptual understanding of GR. Findings indicate that students who effectively integrate conceptual reasoning with mathematical formalism demonstrate a deeper grasp of physical principles and enhanced problem-solving capabilities. The research underscores the importance of symbol sense and the iterative nature of problem framing, suggesting that an integrated approach - combining visual, symbolic, and natural language representations - can improve students' conceptual engagement. Furthermore, the methodology offers instructors valuable insights into students' thinking processes, supporting more effective and targeted feedback.</description>

      <title>Hadamard states for decomposable Green-hyperbolic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadamard states were originally introduced for quantised Klein-Gordon fields and occupy a central position in the theory of quantum fields on curved spacetimes. Subsequently they have been developed for other linear theories, such as the Dirac, Proca and Maxwell fields, but the particular features of each require slightly different treatments.
  The first aim of this paper is to give a generalised definition of Hadamard states for linear bosonic and fermionic theories encompassing a range of theories that are described by Green-hyperbolic operators with 'decomposable' Pauli-Jordan propagators, including theories whose bicharacteristic curves are not necessarily determined by the spacetime metric. The new definition reduces to previous definitions for normally hyperbolic and Dirac-type operators. We develop the theory of Hadamard states in detail, showing that our definition propagates under the equation of motion, and is also stable under pullbacks and suitable pushforwards. There is an equivalent formulation in terms of Hilbert space valued distributions, and the generalised Hadamard condition on 2-point functions constrains the singular behaviour of all $n$-point functions. For locally covariant theories, the Hadamard states form a covariant state space. It is also shown how Hadamard states may be combined through tensor products or reduced by partial tracing while preserving the Hadamard property. As a particular application it is shown that state updates resulting from nonselective measurements preserve the Hadamard condition.
  The treatment we give was partly inspired by a recent work of Moretti, Murro and Volpe (MMV) on the neutral Proca field. Among our other applications, we revisit the neutral Proca field and prove a complete equivalence between the MMV definition of Hadamard states and an older work of Fewster and Pfenning.</description>

      <title>Proto-neutron star oscillations including accretion flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signature from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is dominated by quadrupolar oscillation modes of the newly born proto-neutron star (PNS), and could be detectable at galactic distances. We have developed a framework for computing the normal oscillation modes of a PNS in general relativity, including, for the first time, the presence of an accretion flow and a surrounding stalled accretion shock. These new ingredients are key to understand PNS oscillation modes, in particular those related to the standing-accretion-shock instability (SASI). Their incorporation is an important step towards accurate PNS asteroseismology. For this purpose, we perform linear and adiabatic perturbations of a spherically symmetric background, in the relativistic Cowling approximation, and cast the resulting equations as an eigenvalue problem. We discretize the eigenvalue problem using collocation Chebyshev spectral methods, which is then solved by means of standard and efficient linear algebra methods. We impose boundary conditions at the accretion shock compatible with the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. We present several numerical examples to assess the accuracy and convergence of the numerical code, as well as to understand the effect of an accretion flow on the oscillation modes, as a stepping stone towards a complete analysis of the CCSNe case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational path integral on $S^2 \times S^2$ can be interpreted either as evaluating a contribution to the norm of the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction conditional on spatial $S^1 \times S^2$ topology, or the pair creation rate of black holes in de Sitter. Both interpretations are distinguished at the quantum level. The former requires the path integral to be real and the latter to be imaginary. We develop a formalism to efficiently compute the phase of the gravitational path integral on Einstein spaces. We apply it to a broad class of spacetimes and in particular $S^2\times S^{D-2}$, finding it to be real and positive. We generalize some of the analysis to cases with charge and rotation.</description>

      <title>The early universe is $\textit{ACT}$-ing $\textit{warm}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently released data from the $\textit{Atacama Cosmology Telescope}$ (ACT) confirms that the primordial scalar spectrum is extremely flat. This, together with current upper bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, implies that the simplest models of inflation coming from particle physics (for instance, a minimally-coupled scalar with monomial potentials) need additional ingredients in order to make them compatible with observations. Instead of invoking arbitrary new couplings or new interactions that are not protected symmetries, we argue that dissipation of the inflaton field with the radiation bath should be added as a new physical principle. Accordingly, we show that warm inflation provides the correct paradigm to explain the current observations, given very natural choices of dissipative terms. The model analyzed here has mirror and $Z_4$ symmetries, which explicitly protect the inflaton potential from large quantum and thermal corrections. We use a recent precision numerical code designed for warm inflationary perturbations, improving on the determination of the cosmological observables previously obtained for such models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new coherent state expansion of the exponential representation of the S-matrix for the classical gravitational two-body problem. By combining the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell (KMOC) formalism with the Dirac bracket structure emerging in the classical limit, we derive compact and gauge-invariant expressions for scattering observables in the presence of radiation. This causal formulation bypasses the calculation of KMOC cuts and provides a direct link between observables and a minimal set of classical matrix elements extracted from amplitudes. We illustrate our method with several examples, including the impulse, spin kick, angular momentum, waveform and the related radiative fluxes. Finally, using our formalism we evaluate for the first time the spin kick and the change in angular momentum of each particle up to $\mathcal{O}(G^2 s_1^{j_1} s_2^{j_2})$ with $j_1+ j_2 \leq 11$.</description>

      <title>$w_{dm}$-$w_{de}$ cosmological model with new data samples of cosmological observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit a cosmological model where dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) follow barotropic equations of state, allowing deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework (i.e. $w_{dm} \neq 0$, $w_{de} \neq -1$), considering both flat and non-flat curvature. Using a dynamical system approach, we identify equilibrium states that govern stability, expansion, and contraction. Expansion occurs when $H&gt;0$, while contraction is linked to $H &lt; 0$. Accelerated expansion arises from DE dominance, whereas radiation- and matter-dominated phases lead to deceleration. Some solutions are unphysical due to density constraints, but viable cases offer insights into cosmic transitions, including the Einstein static universe, which allows for shifts between accelerating and decelerating phases. We perform a Bayesian analysis with updated datasets, including observational Hubble data, Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae, strong lensing systems, baryon acoustic oscillations and cosmic microwave background, to constrain the parameters $w_{dm}$ and $w_{de}$. Our results from the data joint analysis show consistency with $\Lambda$CDM within $3\sigma$, but none of the cases reproduce $w_{dm} = 0$ and $w_{de} = -1$. Nevertheless, the comparison with the standard model using the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria indicates that only the non-flat scenario has the potential to be competitive. This suggests that a non-dust-like DM may impact structure formation, while DE could shift toward quintessence fluid. While $\Lambda$CDM remains a strong model, our findings indicate that alternative dark sector models with non-standard EoS could be viable and offer new insights into cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>Revealing Limitation in the Standard Cosmological Model: A Redshift-Dependent Hubble Constant from Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major issue in contemporary cosmology is the persistent discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) estimates from local measurements and those inferred from early-Universe observations under the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm. Recent advances have identified fast radio bursts (FRBs), a class of extragalactic phenomena observable at considerable redshifts, as a promising observational tool for probing late-time cosmology. In this study, we incorporate two complementary methodologies, machine learning algorithms and Bayesian analysis, on a set of localized FRBs to rigorously test the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model at late cosmic epochs. Our results reveal a statistically significant redshift-dependent variation of $H_0$ when using separate priors on baryon density parameters $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$ or $\Omega_\mathrm{b}h^2$, indicating contradiction to the core postulate of $\Lambda$CDM. However, when the priors are combined, this redshift dependence disappears, yielding a consistent estimate of $H_0$. We further validate that the redshift dependency of $H_0$ can be removed within the more flexible framework of $w_0w_a$CDM model even without combining the priors. These findings highlight that the redshift evolution of $H_0$ is not merely an artifact of the standard model but an indication of a deeper inadequacy in the $\Lambda$CDM model, supporting the need for a more flexible cosmological framework.</description>

      <title>Direct High-Resolution Imaging of Earth-Like Exoplanets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have surveyed all conventional methods proposed or conceivable for obtaining resolved images of an Earth-like exoplanet. Generating a 10 x 10 pixel map of a 1 R_E world at 10 pc demands ~0.85 uas angular resolution and photon-collection sufficient for SNR &gt;= 5 per micro-pixel. We derived diffraction-limit and photon-budget requirements for: (1) large single-aperture space telescopes with internal coronagraphs; (2) external starshades; (3) space-based interferometry (nulling and non-nulling); (4) ground-based ELTs with extreme AO; (5) pupil-densified "hypertelescopes"; (6) indirect reconstructions (rotational light-curve inversion, eclipse mapping, intensity interferometry); (7) diffraction occultation by Solar System bodies. Even though these approaches serve their primary goals -- exoplanet discovery and initial coarse characterization -- each remains orders of magnitude away from delivering a spatially resolved image. In every case, technology readiness falls short, and fundamental barriers leave them 2-5 orders of magnitude below the angular-resolution and photon-budget thresholds to map an Earth analog even on decadal timescales. Ultimately, an in-situ platform delivered to &lt;= 0.1 AU of the target could, in principle, overcome both diffraction and photon-starvation limits -- but such a mission far exceeds current propulsion, autonomy, and communications capabilities. By contrast, the Solar Gravitational Lens -- providing on-axis gain of ~1e10 and inherent uas-scale focusing once an imaging spacecraft reaches heliocentric distances beyond &gt;= 550 AU -- is uniquely capable of simultaneously meeting both the resolution and photon-budget requirements. Once mission-specific risks (coronal calibration, focal-plane scanning, deconvolution) are retired, the SGL enables true, resolved surface images and spatially resolved spectroscopy of Earth-like exoplanets in our stellar neighborhood.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new large $N$ limit which at the extreme limit is dual in the bulk to a back-reacted traversable wormhole, by making use if a novel definition of algebra at infinity, an algebra familiar in the literature from the study of quasi-local algebras. We also compute, from a purely algebraic perspective, the effects registered by a left universe observer due to a unitary fluctuation on the right universe of the traversable wormhole, and reproduce a result from an earlier computation by Maldacena, Stanford and Yang \cite{Maldacena:2017axo}.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that violent kinetic preheating following inflation can lead to the formation of black holes in the early Universe. In $\alpha$-attractor models with derivative inflaton couplings, nonlinear amplification of field fluctuations drives large spacetime curvature and gravitational collapse shortly after inflation ends. Using fully general-relativistic lattice simulations, we find that these dynamics produce black holes with masses of order tens of grams at sub-horizon scales, without requiring large primordial curvature perturbations. Although such micro-black holes evaporate rapidly via Hawking radiation, their formation modifies the post-inflationary equation of state and their evaporation can successfully reheat the Universe before Big Bang nucleosynthesis. These results identify kinetic preheating as a new, efficient channel for black-hole production and establish a direct connection between inflationary symmetries and strong-gravity phenomena at reheating.</description>
