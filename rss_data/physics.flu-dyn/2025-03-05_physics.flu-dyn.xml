      <title>Operational Feasibility Analysis of a Cryogenic Active Intake Device for Atmosphere-Breathing Electric Propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion (ABEP) systems are emerging for orbit maintenance in very-low-Earth orbit (VLEO) by capturing atmospheric propellant \textit{in situ} using an intake device. A previous study proposed the cryocondensation-regeneration active intake device (CRAID) to significantly enhance intake performance. This study investigates the operational feasibility of CRAID. A conceptual prototype model (CPM) is presented to verify its feasibility, and numerical analyses demonstrate the practical operational sequences, required cryocooler capacity, intake performance, and flight envelope. The numerical analyses employ the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method with a phase change model and a 0D analytical model for RF ion thrusters. A significant improvement in intake performance is estimated based on the practical sequences, with compression performance at least 1000 times higher than that of prevalent intake devices. The capability for consistent propellant supply is observed regardless of atmospheric conditions. A model satellite incorporating CPM confirms that CRAID enables complete drag compensation at altitudes above 190 km without limiting the upper boundary of the flight envelope.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Insights into Jet Turbulence: Explainable AI Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are applied to analyze flow fields obtained through PIV measurements of an axisymmetric turbulent jet. A convolutional neural network (U-Net) was trained to predict velocity fields at subsequent time steps. Three XAI methods: SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP), Gradient-SHAP, and Grad-CAM were employed to identify the flow field regions relevant for prediction. SHAP requires predefined segmentation of the flow field into relevant regions, while Gradient-SHAP and Grad-CAM avoid this bias by generating gradient-based heatmaps. The results show that the most relevant structures do not necessarily coincide with regions of maximum vorticity but rather with those exhibiting moderate vorticity, highlighting the critical role of these regions in energy transfer and jet dynamics. Additionally, structures with high turbulent dissipation values are identified as the most significant. Gradient-SHAP and Grad-CAM methods reveal a uniform spatial distribution of relevant regions, emphasizing the contribution of nearly circular structures to turbulent mixing. This study advances the understanding of turbulent dynamics through XAI tools, providing an innovative approach to correlate machine learning models with physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>On Target Pattern Formation in the CHNS system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the concentration field in a prescribed 2D Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes (CHNS) system. We formulate a description for the target pattern formation and pattern merging processes, and compare this description with simulation results. Shear-augmented diffusion along streamlines causes a separation of time scales, thus 2D CHNS system can be simplified to a 1D system. In this 1D system, target pattern formation is induced by linear instability. The waveform of patterns are described by Jacobi Elliptic Functions. The interface (of pattern) migration or coarsening velocity is determined by the derivative of interface curvature. The anomalous migration of inner pattern can be explained by the singularity at the origin and therefore the boundary motion in the quasi-one-dimension system. Finally we derive a simple criterion for when CHNS system becomes dynamic by following similar cases in MHD.</description>

      <title>Experimental identification of blade-level forces, torque, and pitching moment for cross-flow turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-flow turbine power is a net sum of power generation from rotating blades and power loss from rotating support structures. While the aggregate forces and torques at the turbine level are important for end use, these can inhibit a deeper understanding of fluid-structure interactions. Identification of blade-level forces and torques allows for specific investigations into how the fluid forcing on the blade drives rotation and can aid blade structural design. Here, we present a physics-based methodology for extracting blade-level forces and torques from experimental measurements at the axis of rotation of a cross-flow turbine, and demonstrate strong agreement with equivalent blade-only simulations. In doing so, we highlight the significance of the commonly ignored pitching moment term which is found to oppose power generation and drive performance degradation in the downstream portion of the rotation.</description>

      <title>On the choice of proper outlet boundary conditions for numerical simulation of cardiovascular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that in the computational fluid dynamics simulations related to the cardiovascular system the enforcement of outflow boundary conditions is a crucial point. In fact, they highly affect the computed flow and a wrong setup could lead to unphysical results. In this chapter we discuss the main features of two different ways for the estimation of proper outlet boundary conditions in the context of hemodynamics simulations: on one side, a lumped parameter model of the downstream circulation and, on the other one, a technique based on optimal control.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Turbulence Modeling for Separated Flows Considering Non-Local Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02482v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to enhance the generalizability of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models, which are crucial for engineering applications. Classic RANS turbulence models often struggle to predict separated flows accurately. Recently, Data-driven machine learning approaches for turbulence modeling have been explored to address this issue. However, these models are often criticized for their limited generalizability. In this study, we address this issue by incorporating non-local effects into data-driven turbulence modeling. Specifically, we introduce a transport equation for the correction term \b{eta} of the shear stress transport (SST) model to encode non-local information along the mean streamline. The coefficients of the equation are calibrated using high-fidelity data from the NASA hump and periodic hills. The resulting model, termed the \b{eta}-Transport model, demonstrates high accuracy across various separated flows outside the training set, including periodic hills with different geometries and Reynolds numbers, the curved backward-facing step, a two-dimensional bump, and a three-dimensional simplified car body. In all tested cases, the \b{eta}-Transport model yields smaller or equal prediction errors compared to those from classic local data-driven turbulence models using algebraic relations for \b{eta}. These results indicate improved generalizability for separated flows. Furthermore, the \b{eta}-Transport model shows similar accuracy to the baseline model in basic flows including the mixing layer and the channel flow. Therefore, the non-local modeling approach presented here offers a promising pathway for developing more generalizable data-driven turbulence models.</description>

      <title>Tidal fluctuations and spatial heterogeneity lead to trapping and chaotic mixing in coastal aquifers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combined effect of tidal forcing and aquifer heterogeneity leads to intricate transport patterns in coastal aquifers that impact both on solute residence times and mixing dynamics. We study these patterns through detailed numerical simulations of density-dependent flow and transport in a three-dimensional heterogeneous coastal aquifer under tidal forcing. Advective particle tracking from both the freshwater and seawater domains reveals the formation of chaotic and periodic orbits in the freshwater-saltwater transition zone that may persistently trap contaminants. We find that increasing heterogeneity results in increased trapping, but also increased mixing entropy, which suggests that the chaotic orbits enhance mixing between contaminants from the freshwater and seawater domains. These findings highlight on the one hand, the long-term contamination risks of coastal aquifers through trapping, and on the other hand, the creation of hotspots for chemical and biological reactions through chaotic mixing in the transition zone.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic free-surface jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a body of inviscid fluid is disturbed, it will typically eject a jet of fluid. If the effects of gravity and surface tension are negligible, these jets travel in straight lines, with the tips approaching a constant velocity. It has been observed that these jets can have a broad base, tapering progressively toward the tip, but the mathematical form of their profile has not been successfully analysed in earlier works. In this paper, we describe the simplest case, in two dimensions: an infinitely deep body of inviscid fluid, with no surface tension or gravitational forces acting, responds to an impulsive disturbance. We find that, contrary to some earlier suggestions, the jet has a hyperbolic profile (away from its tip and its base).</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Relative Pressure Estimation Methods Utilizing 4D Flow MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4D flow MRI allows for the estimation of three-dimensional relative pressure fields, providing rich pressure information, unlike catheterization and Doppler echocardiography, which provide one-dimensional pressure drops only. The accuracy of one-dimensional pressure drops derived from 4D flow has been explored in previous literature, but additional work must be done to evaluate the accuracy of three-dimensional relative pressure fields. This work presents an analysis of three state-of-the-art relative pressure estimators: virtual Work-Energy Relative Pressure (vWERP), the Pressure Poisson Estimator (PPE), and the Stokes Estimator (STE). Spatiotemporal behavior and sensitivity to noise were determined in silico. Estimators were validated with a type B aortic dissection (TBAD) flow phantom with varying tear geometry and an array of twelve catheter pressure measurements. Finally, the performance of each estimator was evaluated across eight patient cases. In silico pressure field errors were lower in STE compared to PPE, although PPE pressures were less affected by noise. High velocity gradients and low spatial resolution contributed most significantly to local variations in 3D error fields. Low temporal resolution leads to highly transient peak pressure events being averaged, systematically underestimating peak pressures. In the flow phantom analysis, vWERP was the most accurate method, followed by STE and PPE. Each pressure estimator strongly correlated with ground truth pressure values despite the tendency to underestimate peak pressures. Patient case results demonstrated that the pressure estimators could be feasibly integrated into a clinical workflow.</description>

      <title>High Speed Imagery Analysis of Droplet Impact on Soft Oil Infused Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplet impact on solid liquid-infused surfaces (LIS) has been widely explored due to its significant scientific implications and industrial relevance. In most studies, the predominant impact behavior observed is complete droplet rebound. In This study we investigated the influence of octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) functionalization and oil coatings on the droplet impact dynamics of smooth polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces. We conducted droplet impact experiments on smooth PDMS functionalized with OTS and subsequently coated or absorbed with two different oils, silicone oil (5cSt) and hexadecane, to create Van der Waals and non-Van der Waals SLIP surfaces. Contact angle measurements revealed that OTS functionalization reduced adhesion and increased water repellency, facilitating partial droplet rebound upon impact. Oil-coated surfaces exhibited reduced droplet spreading due to viscous resistance, while absorbed oils altered surface flexibility, influencing impact dynamics. PDMS samples absorbed with silicone oil demonstrated complete droplet rebound at all Weber numbers, whereas hexadecane-absorbed surfaces exhibited limited spreading and no rebound, highlighting the significance of oil-PDMS interactions. High-speed imaging and quantitative analysis confirmed that surface functionalization and oil interactions critically affect droplet spreading, recoil, and rebound behavior. These findings provide insights into optimizing liquid-repellent surfaces for applications such as self-cleaning coatings and droplet transport systems.</description>

      <title>Direct detonation initiation and propagation in methane/air mixtures containing coal particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanisms of direct detonation initiation (DDI) in methane/air mixtures containing coal particles are investigated through simulations conducted using the Eulerian-Lagrangian method in a two-dimensional configuration. Methane-air combustion is modelled with a detailed chemical mechanism involving 36 species and 219 reactions, while coal particle surface reactions are computed using a kinetic/diffusion-limited rate model. The findings indicate that shock waves generated from the hotspot can initiate detonation through heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions, with contributions from both methane and particle combustion. Coal particle surface reactions provide the dominant energy for detonation initiation, whereas gas-phase reactions enhance detonation stability during propagation. The difficulty of achieving detonation initiation exhibits a non-linear dependence on particle concentrations and gas equivalence ratios. An optimal particle concentration and gas equivalence ratio for successful DDI is identified. Smaller particles are found to facilitate detonation initiation more effectively. Key processes in DDI of two-phase mixtures are identified, including particle heating, methane combustion, and particle burning. Three DDI modes, critical, stable, and cell-free, are observed based on particle concentration. As particle concentration increases, the temperatures of both particles and gas become close, initially rising and then decreasing with further increases in particle concentration. Additionally, the introduction of coal particles gives rise to two distinct stages in gas-phase reactions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Physics-informed Neural Network: Towards Efficient Learning of High-speed Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study assesses the potential use of hybrid quantum physics-informed neural network (HQPINN) to model high-speed flows as an alternative to classical PINN and quantum neural network options. The model integrates parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) with classical neural network in parallel as input to a physics-based optimization. For problems with harmonic solutions, the HQPINN exhibits superior accuracy and trainability compared to both classical and quantum models at low parameter costs. For transonic flows, the hybrid approach yields modest results and additionally suffers from poor trainability if the quantum layer were under-parameterized. Our results highlight inherent limitations in deploying quantum neural networks in PINN applications, and potential use of hybrid architectures as a general tool in problems where the nature of the solution is not known a-priori.</description>

      <title>Resonance-Driven Mechanisms of Ion Transport and Selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ion channels selectively transport ions, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We propose a physical model based on the Driven Damped Harmonic Oscillator (DDHO), where self-organizing turbulent structures in the ionic flow generate oscillating pressure waves and toroidal vortices. These structures drive aqua-ions into resonance, facilitating the shedding of hydration shells and enabling ion permeation as free ions.
  To capture the spatiotemporal complexity of this process, we develop a macroscopic continuum model integrating the Navier--Stokes equations, Gauss's law, and convection-diffusion dynamics. Numerical simulations reveal strong oscillations that drive dehydration and ionic jet formation, supporting the DDHO mechanism. Model predictions closely match patch-clamp experimental data.
  The DDHO framework predicts a frequency-dependent resonance response, effectively acting as a selective filter. Applied to experimental data, the model reveals distinct separation between ion species and hydration states, quantified by a high Mahalanobis distance and oscillator quality factor.
  Furthermore, the model provides insight into the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on ion selectivity. Mutations that alter channel geometry shift resonance peaks, disrupting selective transport and potentially leading to genetic disorders.</description>

      <title>FGM Modeling of Thermo-Diffusive Unstable Lean Premixed Hydrogen-Air Flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-lean premixed hydrogen combustion is a possible solution to decarbonize industry, while limiting flame temperatures and thus nitrous oxide emissions. These lean hydrogen/air flames experience strong preferential diffusion effects, which result in thermo-diffusive (TD) instabilities. To efficiently and accurately model lean premixed hydrogen flames, it is crucial to incorporate these preferential diffusion effects into flamelet tabulated chemistry frameworks, such as the Flamelet-Generated Manifold (FGM) method. This is challenging because the preferential diffusion terms in the control variable transport equations contain diffusion fluxes of all species in the mechanism. In this work, a new implementation is presented; the full term is reduced by only considering the most contributing species. When carefully selecting this set of major species, preferential diffusion fluxes along the flame front, i.e., cross-diffusion, can be captured. This is particularly important for manifolds that include heat loss effects, where enthalpy is one of the control variables. The diffusion of the H-radical has a significant contribution to the enthalpy transport equation, and cross-diffusion of the H-radical is non-negligible. Two manifolds, without and with heat loss effects, and the set of major species are analyzed in an a-priori and a-posteriori manner. Simulations of TD unstable hydrogen-air flames with detailed chemistry and several FGM models show that accurately capturing cross-diffusion of enthalpy is important for correctly predicting the flame shape and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Elastic Pseudoturbulence in Polymer Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of polymer additives on pseudoturbulence induced by a swarm of bubbles rising in a quiescent fluid. We find that, beyond a critical polymer concentration, the energy spectra of velocity fluctuations in bubble-induced turbulence decay more steeply with respect to the wavenumber $k$. This new scaling is significantly steeper than the classical $k^{-3}$ scaling observed for bubbles in Newtonian fluids; it is independent of the gas volume fraction in the inertial limit and occurs within the length scales between the bubble wake length and the bubble diameter. Furthermore, we provide strong evidence that the presence of polymers enhances the coherence of the flow, highlighting the significant role of polymer additives in modifying the characteristics of pseudoturbulence.</description>

      <title>Interfacial flows in sessile evaporating droplets of mineral water</title>

Abstract: Liquid flow in sessile evaporating droplets of ultrapure water typically results from two main contributions: a capillary flow pushing the liquid towards the contact line from the bulk and a thermal Marangoni flow pulling the drop free surface towards the summit. Current analytical and numerical models are in good qualitative agreement with experimental observations however they overestimate the interfacial velocity values by 2-3 orders of magnitude. This discrepancy is generally ascribed to contamination of the water samples with non-soluble surfactants, however an experimental confirmation of this assumption has not yet been provided. In this work, we show that a small "ionic contamination" can cause a significant effect in the flow pattern inside the droplet. To provide the proof, we compare the flow in evaporating droplets of ultrapure water with commercially available bottled water of different mineralization levels. Mineral waters are bottled at natural springs, are micro-biologically pure, and contain only traces of minerals (as well as traces of other possible contaminants), therefore one would expect a slower interfacial flow as the amount of "contaminants" increase. Surprisingly, our results show that the magnitude of the interfacial flow is practically the same for mineral waters with low content of minerals as that of ultrapure water. However, for waters with larger content of minerals, the interfacial flow tends to slow down due to the presence of ionic concentration gradients. Our results show a much more complex scenario than it has been typically suspected, and therefore a deeper and more comprehensive analysis of the huge differences between numerical models and experiments is necessary.</description>

      <title>A Period-Doubling Route to Chaos in Viscoelastic Kolmogorov Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polymer solutions can develop chaotic flows, even at low inertia. This purely elastic turbulence is well studied, but little is known about the transition to chaos. In 2D channel flow and parallel shear flow, traveling wave solutions involving coherent structures are present for sufficiently large fluid elasticity. We numerically study 2D periodic parallel shear flow in viscoelastic fluids and show that these traveling waves become oscillatory and undergo a series of period-doubling bifurcations en-route to chaos.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning-assisted Blending of Data-Driven Turbulence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a machine learning-based framework for blending data-driven turbulent closures in the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, aimed at improving their generalizability across diverse flow regimes. Specialized models (hereafter referred to as experts) are trained via sparse Bayesian learning and symbolic regression for distinct flow classes, including turbulent channel flows, separated flows, and a near-sonic axisymmetric jet. These experts are then combined intrusively within the RANS equations using weighting functions, initially derived via a Gaussian kernel on a dataset spanning equilibrium shear conditions to separated flows. Finally, a Random Forest Regressor is trained to map local physical features to these weighting functions, enabling deployment in previously unseen scenarios. We evaluate the resulting blended model on three representative test cases: a turbulent zero-pressure-gradient flat plate, a wall-mounted hump, and a NACA0012 airfoil at various angles of attack, ranging from fully attached to near-stall conditions. Results for these 2D flows show that the proposed strategy adapts to local flow characteristics, effectively leveraging the strengths of individual models and consistently selecting the most suitable expert in each region. Notably, the blended model also demonstrates robustness for flow configurations not included in the training set, underscoring its potential as a practical and generalizable framework for RANS turbulence modeling.</description>

      <title>Modal Force Partitioning -- A Method for Determining the Aerodynamic Loads for Decomposed Flow Modes with Application to Aeroacoustic Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aerodynamic loads play a central role in many fluid dynamics applications, and we present a method for identifying the structures (or modes) in a flow that make dominant contributions to the time-varying aerodynamic loads in a flow. The method results from the combination of the force partitioning method (Menon and Mittal, J. Fluid Mech., 907:A37, 2021) and modal decomposition techniques such as Reynolds decomposition, triple decomposition, and proper orthogonal decomposition, and is applied here to three distinct flows - two-dimensional flows past a circular cylinder and an airfoil, and the three-dimensional flow over a revolving rectangular wing. We show that the force partitioning method applied to modal decomposition of velocity fields results in complex, and difficult to interpret inter-modal interactions. We therefore propose and apply modal decomposition directly to the $Q$-field associated with these flows. The variable $Q$ is a non-linear observable that is typically used to identify vortices in a flow, and we find that the direct decomposition of $Q$ leads to results that are more amenable to interpretation. We also demonstrate that this modal force partitioning can be extended to provide insights into the far-field aeroacoustic loading noise of these flows.</description>
