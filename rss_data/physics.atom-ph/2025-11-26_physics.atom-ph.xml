      <title>Response Analysis of Four-Level Heterodyne Rydberg Atom Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The four-level heterodyne Rydberg atom receiver has garnered significant attention in microwave detection and communication due to its high sensitivity and phase measurement capabilities. Existing theoretical studies, primarily based on static solutions, are limited in characterizing the system's frequency response. To address this, this paper comprehensively investigates the dynamic solutions of the density matrix elements for the four-level heterodyne structure, establishing a quantitative relationship between system response, signal frequency, and system parameters. This enables theoretical bandwidth calculations and performance analysis. This paper also constructs a noise model for the density matrix elements, revealing the relationship between the ultimate sensitivity of the Rydberg atom receiver and the noise in the density matrix elements. Both theoretical simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the bandwidth of the four-level heterodyne receiver can exceed 10 MHz. This study provides critical theoretical support for the engineering applications and performance optimization of heterodyne Rydberg atom receivers.</description>

      <title>Extreme Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of Highly Charged Lu and Yb Ions for Nuclear Charge Radius Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a high-precision determination of the natural-abundance-averaged nuclear charge-radius difference between Yb and Lu using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectroscopy of highly charged ions (HCIs). By measuring the $D_1$ transition energies in Na- and Mg-like charge states of Lu and Yb confined in the Tokyo electron-beam ion trap, we extract meV-level energy shifts that are directly sensitive to nuclear-size effects. Transition-energy differences obtained from these spectra are compared with state-of-the-art relativistic many-body perturbation theory, including a new treatment of Mg-like ions. We develop a generalized framework to propagate uncertainties arising from nuclear deformation and surface diffuseness and evaluate corresponding nuclear-sensitivity coefficients. Combining Na- and Mg-like results yields mutually consistent radius differences, demonstrating the robustness of both the experimental calibration and the theoretical predictions. To determine absolute isotopic radii, we perform a generalized least-squares optimization incorporating our HCI constraints together with optical-isotope-shift data and muonic-atom results. This analysis establishes that the $^{175}$Lu charge radius is smaller than that of $^{174}$Yb, restoring the expected odd-even staggering across the $N=94$ isotonic chain. Our recommended value, $R(^{175}\text{Lu}) = 5.291(11)$ fm, reduces the uncertainty of the Lu radius by a factor of three compared with the previous electron-scattering result and resolves a long-standing anomaly in rare-earth nuclear systematics. This work demonstrates that EUV spectroscopy of HCIs provides a powerful and broadly applicable method for precision nuclear-structure studies in heavy, deformed nuclei. The techniques developed here enable future investigations of isotonic and isoelectronic sequences, including radioactive nuclides and higher-$Z$ systems.</description>

      <title>Infrared absorption spectroscopy of a single polyatomic molecular ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Absorption spectroscopy is a fundamental tool for probing molecular structure. However, performing absorption spectroscopy on individual molecules is challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we report on a nondestructive absorption spectroscopy on a mid-infrared vibrational transition in a single molecular ion that is co-trapped with an atomic ion. The absorption of a single photon is detected via the momentum transfer from the absorbed photon onto the molecule. This recoil signal is amplified using a non-classical state of motion of the two-ion crystal and subsequently read out via the atomic ion. We characterize the recoil detection method and use it to investigate the interaction between femtosecond laser pulses and the O-H stretching vibration in individual CaOH+ molecular ions. Furthermore, we present the single-photon absorption spectrum obtained for the vibrational transition. This method represents a milestone towards quantum non-demolition measurements of complex polyatomic molecules, providing high-fidelity methods for preparation and measurement of the quantum state of a wide range of molecular species.</description>

      <title>Active compensation of the AC Stark shift in a two-photon rubidium optical frequency reference using power modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement a feedback protocol to suppress the AC Stark shift in a two-photon rubidium optical frequency reference, reducing its sensitivity to optical power variations by a factor of 1000. This method alleviates the tradeoff between short-term and long-term stability imposed by the AC Stark shift, enabling us to simultaneously achieve instabilities of $3\times10^{-14}$ at 1 s and $2\times10^{-14}$ at $10^4$ s. We also quantitatively describe, and experimentally explore, a stability limit imposed on clocks using this method by frequency noise on the local oscillator.</description>

      <title>Intense and controlled beam of S($^1D_2$) atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the production of an intense and controlled beam of electronically excited sulfur atoms in the $^1D_2$ state using a multistage Zeeman decelerator. Sulfur atoms, generated via photolysis of CS$_2$, are produced in both the ground $^3P_J$ and excited $^1D_2$ states. We demonstrate that both can be manipulated using the decelerator, and that temporal separation between them can be achieved by operating in deceleration mode. This enables the generation of sulfur atom beams with a well-defined velocity, narrow velocity spreads, and an enhanced quantum-state purity. To assess the suitability of the beam for scattering studies, we performed a proof-of-principle elastic collision experiment with S($^1D_2$) and argon atoms. The observed velocity-map-imaging signal confirms that the S($^1D_2$) beam density is sufficient for detailed scattering studies. These results form the foundation for future studies of reactive and quenching processes involving S($^1D_2$) atoms at tunable and well-defined collision energies.</description>

      <title>Twisted Electron Collisions Enhance the Production of Circular Rydberg States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circular Rydberg states offer advantages for quantum information and quantum simulation platforms due to their long lifetimes and strong dipole-dipole interactions. Unfortunately, current techniques for the production of these states remain technically challenging. Here we investigate the ability of twisted electron collisions to produce circular Rydberg states. Twisted electrons carry quantized orbital angular momentum that can be transferred to the electronic state of the atom, potentially providing an efficient means to generate circular Rydberg states. Using a fully quantum mechanical framework, we compute total excitation cross sections for circular Rydberg states of hydrogen, rubidium, and cesium targets using Bessel electron beams. Our models account for the full Bessel-beam structure of the incident electron and incorporate macroscopic target effects to model experimentally-relevant conditions. Our results show that twisted electrons with large opening angles produce significant enhancements in the excitation probability relative to plane-wave electrons, particularly for large opening angles and low energies. We trace this enhancement to contributions from projectiles with large values of orbital angular momentum. These findings demonstrate that twisted-electron excitation may provide a feasible and potentially advantageous pathway for generating circular Rydberg states.</description>

      <title>Categorical Symmetries in Spin Models with Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Exact perturbative expansion of the transport coefficients of a normal low-temperature Fermi gas with contact interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity of a Fermi gas with short-range interactions in the Fermi liquid regime of the normal phase, that is at temperatures $T$ much lower than the Fermi temperature $T_{\rm F}$ and much larger than the superfluid critical temperature $T_c$. Given recent advances in the precision of cold atom experiments, we provide exact results up to second-order in the interaction strength. We extend the Landau-Salpeter equation to compute the collision amplitude beyond the forward-scattering limit, covering all collisions on the Fermi surface. We treat the collision kernel exactly, leading to significant corrections beyond relaxation-time or variational approximations. The transport coefficients, as functions of the $s$-wave scattering length $a$ and Fermi wavenumber $k_{\rm F}$, follow $(1+\gamma k_{\rm F}a)/a^2$ up to corrections of order $O(a^0)$, with a positive coefficient $\gamma$ for the viscosity and negative one for the thermal conductivity and spin diffusivity.</description>

      <title>Localization and splitting of a quantum droplet with a potential defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We unravel the existence and nonequilibrium response of one-dimensional harmonically trapped droplet configurations in the presence of a central potential barrier or well. For fixed negative chemical potentials, it is shown that droplets fragment into two for increasing potential barrier heights, a process that occurs faster for larger widths. However, atoms from the droplet accumulate at the potential well, especially for wider ones, leading to a deformed droplet and eventually to the termination of the solution. Linearization analysis yields the underlying excitation spectrum which dictates stability and the behavior of the ensuing collective modes. Quenches in the potential height are used to demonstrate dynamical fragmentation of the droplet for potential barriers as well as self-evaporation along with droplet localization and eventual relaxation for longer evolution times in the case of potential wells. The presence of selective excitation processes emanating from quantum superposition in the induced droplet dynamics is explicated by evaluating the contribution of the participating single-particle eigenstates. Our results should be detectable by current ultracold atom experiments and may inspire engineered droplet dynamics with the aid of external potentials.</description>

      <title>Lellouch-L\"uscher relation for ultracold few-atom systems under confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an analog of the Lellouch-L\"uscher (LL) relation for few-body bosonic systems, linking few-body scattering loss rates to the energies and widths of the corresponding harmonically trapped few-body states. Three-body numerical simulations show that the LL relation applies across a broad range of interaction strengths and energies and allows the determination of scattering rates within a single partial wave. Our work establishes a robust theoretical framework for understanding the role of the finite volume effect in few-body observables in optical lattice and tweezer experiments, enabling precise determination of multi-body scattering rates.</description>
