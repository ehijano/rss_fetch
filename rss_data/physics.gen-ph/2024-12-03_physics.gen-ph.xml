      <title>Black Hole Orbit Classification: The Synergistic Effects of Cloud Strings, Gauss-Bonnet Terms, and Non-Commutative Parameters in Identifying WGC candidate Models: WGC as WCCC protector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of non-commutative geometry and Gauss-Bonnet corrections in an action and the study of their black hole responses can provide highly intriguing insights. Our primary motivation for this study is to understand the interplay of these two parameters on the geodesics of spacetime, including photon spheres and time-like orbits. In this study, we found that this integration, in its initial form, can limit the value of the Gauss-Bonnet parameter ($\alpha$), creating a critical threshold beyond which changes in the non-commutative parameter ($\Xi$) become ineffective, and the structure can only manifest as a naked singularity. Furthermore, we found that using a more complex model, which includes additional factors such as a cloud of strings and linear charge, as a sample for studying spacetime geodesics, yield different and varied results. In this scenario, negative $\alpha$ values can also play a role, notably preserving the black hole form even with a super-extremal charge ($q &gt; m$). For $\alpha&gt; 0.1$, the black hole mass parameter becomes significantly influential, with a critical mass below which the impact of other parameter changes is nullified. Interestingly, considering a more massive black hole, this high-mass state also maintains its black hole form within the super-extremal charge range. The existence of these two models led us to our main goal. By examining the temperature for these two cases, we find that both situations are suitable for studying the WGC. Finally, based on the behavior of these two models, we will explain how the WGC acts as a logical solution and a protector for the WCCC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use experiment-supported dimensional analysis to further bolster our arguments that crucial information on the emergence and/or nature of space could be extracted from the combination of the properties of gravitational and strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Hamilton-Jacobi Treatment of Constraint Field Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the Hamilton$-$Jacobi approach of fields with constraints, we analyse the classical structure of three different constrained field systems: (i) the scalar field coupled to two flavors of fermions through Yukawa couplings (ii) the scalar field coupled minimally to the vector potential (iii) the electromagnetic field coupled to a spinor. The equations of motion are obtained as total differential equations in many variables. The integrability conditions are investigated. The second and third constrained systems are quantized using canonical path integral formulation based on the Hamilton$-$Jacobi treatment.</description>

      <title>Statistical Gravity through Affine Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I propose a possible way to introduce the effect of temperature (defined through the virial theorem) into Einstein's theory of general relativity. This requires the computation of a path integral on a 10-dimensional flat space in a four dimensional spacetime lattice. Standard path integral Monte Carlo methods can be used to compute it.</description>

      <title>Equivalent of Non-Trivial Riemann Zeros Condition in Matrix Representation and Particle Anti-Particle Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Hermitian matrix can be formed for a large enough cutoff N on the number of terms in the Riemann zeta function. At zeros, the matrix trace equals the off-diagonal sum. Riemann's hypothesis is true if and only if the condition is satisfied. It suggests a relationship between the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the matrix formed. By forming a matrix with Riemann non-trivial zero, the quantum field vacuum loop level diagram can be opened exactly by coupling the matrix with an anti-particle annihilation operator, which gives rise to asymmetry between matter and anti-matter.</description>
