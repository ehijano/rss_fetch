      <title>$\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathbf{B}$, outer boundary, and Biot-Savart in magnetosphere MHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the size of $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathbf{B}$ and outer surface boundary integrals in estimating the surface magnetic field from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Maxwell's equations tell us $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathbf{B}$ = 0, which may be violated due to numerical error. MHD models, such as the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) and the Open Geospace General Circulation Model (OpenGGCM), use different techniques to limit $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathbf{B}$. Analyses of MHD simulations typically assume $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathbf{B}$ errors are small. Similarly, analyses commonly use the Biot-Savart Law and magnetospheric current density estimates from MHD simulations to determine the magnetic field at a specific point on Earth. This calculation frequently omits the surface integral over the outer boundary of the simulation volume that the Helmholtz decomposition theorem requires. This paper uses SWMF and OpenGGCM simulations to estimate the magnitudes of the $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathbf{B}$ and outer boundary integrals compared to Biot-Savart estimates of the magnetic field on Earth. In the simulations considered, the $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \mathbf{B}$ and outer surface integrals are up to 30 percent of Biot-Savart estimates when the Biot-Savart estimates are large. These integrals are largest, relative to Biot-Savart magnetospheric contributions, when the Biot-Savart estimates are small. The integrals are correlated; locations on the Earth's surface near one another have integrals of similar magnitudes. The conclusions are the same for a simulation involving a simple change in the interplanetary magnetic field and a more complex superstorm simulation.</description>

      <title>The periastron regression of 2M1510 AB, the jet precession of M87* and Telisto/Planet Nine: three different scenarios for a possible common cause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eclipsing binary 2M1510 AB made of two brown dwarfs, the supermassive black hole M87* and our solar system may all have in common the presence of a massive pointlike distant companion perturbing in some ways their inner dynamics. That is, respectively, a circumbinary exoplanet whose orbital plane should be perpendicular to that of its host inner binary, an intermediate mass black hole potentially causing the observed jet precession, and a still unseen planet, known as Telisto or Planet Nine, which may, perhaps, have been recently spotted in archival images although in a quite different orbit with respect to that originally expected. To this aim, the long-term rates of change of all the Keplerian orbital elements of the relative motion of a gravitationally bound two-body system acted upon by a massive remote perturber are analytically worked out in full generality and presented in a way facilitating a straightforward application to those and other potentially interesting astronomical scenarios. For each of the considered cases, exclusion plots in their parameter spaces are provided.</description>

      <title>Unlocking New Paths for Science with Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals: Machine Learning-Enhanced MCMC for Accurate Parameter Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in space-borne antennas like Taiji and LISA promises deep insights into strong-field gravity and black hole physics. However, the complex, highly degenerate, and non-convex likelihood landscapes characteristic of EMRI parameter spaces pose severe challenges for conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Under realistic instrumental noise and broad priors, these methods demand impractical computational costs but are prone to becoming trapped in local maxima, leading to biased and unreliable parameter estimates. To address this, we introduce Flow-Matching Markov Chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC), a novel Bayesian framework that integrates continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with parallel tempering MCMC (PTMCMC). By generating high-likelihood regions via CNFs and refining them through PTMCMC, FM-MCMC enables robust exploration of the nontrivial parameter spaces, while achieving orders-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency and, more importantly, ensuring statistically reliable and unbiased inference. By enabling real-time, unbiased parameter inference, FM-MCMC could unlock the full scientific potential of EMRI observations, and would serve as a scalable pipeline for precision gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>
