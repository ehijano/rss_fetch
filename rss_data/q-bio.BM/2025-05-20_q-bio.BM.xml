      <title>Prediction of Novel CXCR7 Inhibitors Using QSAR Modeling and Validation via Molecular Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CXCR7, a G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor, has recently emerged as a key player in cancer progression, particularly in driving angiogenesis and metastasis. Despite its significance, currently, few effective inhibitors exist for targeting this receptor. In this study aimed to address this gap by developing a QSAR model to predict potential CXCR7 inhibitors, followed by validation through molecular docking. Using the Extra Trees classifier for QSAR modeling and employing a combination of physicochemical descriptors and molecular fingerprints, compounds were classified as active or inactive with a high accuracy of 0.85. The model could efficiently screen a large dataset, identifying several promising CXCR7 inhibitors. The predicted inhibitors were further validated through molecular docking studies, revealing strong binding affinities, with the best docking score of -12.24 +- 0.49 kcal/mol. Visualization of the docked structures in both 2D and 3D confirmed the interactions between the inhibitors and the CXCR7 receptor, reinforcing their potential efficacy.</description>

      <title>Multi-Ligand Simultaneous Docking Analysis of Moringa Oleifera Phytochemicals Reveals Enhanced BCL-2 Inhibition via Synergistic Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moringa oleifera, known for its medicinal properties, contains bioactive compounds such as polyphenols and flavonoids with diverse therapeutic potentials, including anti-cancer effects. This study investigates the efficacy of M. oleifera leaf phytochemicals in inhibiting BCL-2, a critical protein involved in cancer cell survival. For the first time, multi-ligand simultaneous docking (MLSD) has been employed to understand the anti-cancer properties of M. oleifera leaf extract. Molecular docking techniques, including single-ligand and MLSD, were used to assess binding interactions with BCL-2. Single-ligand docking revealed strong binding affinities for compounds such as niazinin, alpha carotene, hesperetin, apigenin, niaziminin B, and niazimicin A, with some compounds even surpassing Venetoclax, a commercial BCL-2 inhibitor. MLSD highlighted inter-ligand interactions among apigenin, hesperetin, and niazimicin A, exhibiting a binding affinity of -14.96 kcal/mol, indicating a synergistic effect. These results shed light on the potential synergistic effects of phytochemicals when using multi-ligand simultaneous docking, underscoring the importance of considering compound interactions in the development of therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <title>Flash Invariant Point Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Invariant Point Attention (IPA) is a key algorithm for geometry-aware modeling in structural biology, central to many protein and RNA models. However, its quadratic complexity limits the input sequence length. We introduce FlashIPA, a factorized reformulation of IPA that leverages hardware-efficient FlashAttention to achieve linear scaling in GPU memory and wall-clock time with sequence length. FlashIPA matches or exceeds standard IPA performance while substantially reducing computational costs. FlashIPA extends training to previously unattainable lengths, and we demonstrate this by re-training generative models without length restrictions and generating structures of thousands of residues. FlashIPA is available at https://github.com/flagshippioneering/flash_ipa.</description>

      <title>Improving Targeted Molecule Generation through Language Model Fine-Tuning Via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing new drugs is laborious and costly, demanding extensive time investment. In this paper, we introduce a de-novo drug design strategy, which harnesses the capabilities of language models to devise targeted drugs for specific proteins. Employing a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we refine the model to acquire a policy for generating drugs tailored to protein targets. The proposed method integrates a composite reward function, combining considerations of drug-target interaction and molecular validity. Following RL fine-tuning, the proposed method demonstrates promising outcomes, yielding notable improvements in molecular validity, interaction efficacy, and critical chemical properties, achieving 65.37 for Quantitative Estimation of Drug-likeness (QED), 321.55 for Molecular Weight (MW), and 4.47 for Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient (logP), respectively. Furthermore, out of the generated drugs, only 0.041% do not exhibit novelty.</description>

      <title>Prot42: a Novel Family of Protein Language Models for Target-aware Protein Binder Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlocking the next generation of biotechnology and therapeutic innovation demands overcoming the inherent complexity and resource-intensity of conventional protein engineering methods. Recent GenAI-powered computational techniques often rely on the availability of the target protein's 3D structures and specific binding sites to generate high-affinity binders, constraints exhibited by models such as AlphaProteo and RFdiffusion. In this work, we explore the use of Protein Language Models (pLMs) for high-affinity binder generation. We introduce Prot42, a novel family of Protein Language Models (pLMs) pretrained on vast amounts of unlabeled protein sequences. By capturing deep evolutionary, structural, and functional insights through an advanced auto-regressive, decoder-only architecture inspired by breakthroughs in natural language processing, Prot42 dramatically expands the capabilities of computational protein design based on language only. Remarkably, our models handle sequences up to 8,192 amino acids, significantly surpassing standard limitations and enabling precise modeling of large proteins and complex multi-domain sequences. Demonstrating powerful practical applications, Prot42 excels in generating high-affinity protein binders and sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Our innovative models are publicly available, offering the scientific community an efficient and precise computational toolkit for rapid protein engineering.</description>

      <title>Immunogenicity Prediction with Dual Attention Enables Vaccine Target Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Immunogenicity prediction is a central topic in reverse vaccinology for finding candidate vaccines that can trigger protective immune responses. Existing approaches typically rely on highly compressed features and simple model architectures, leading to limited prediction accuracy and poor generalizability. To address these challenges, we introduce VenusVaccine, a novel deep learning solution with a dual attention mechanism that integrates pre-trained latent vector representations of protein sequences and structures. We also compile the most comprehensive immunogenicity dataset to date, encompassing over 7000 antigen sequences, structures, and immunogenicity labels from bacteria, virus, and tumor. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VenusVaccine outperforms existing methods across a wide range of evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we establish a post-hoc validation protocol to assess the practical significance of deep learning models in tackling vaccine design challenges. Our work provides an effective tool for vaccine design and sets valuable benchmarks for future research. The implementation is at https://github.com/songleee/VenusVaccine.</description>
