      <title>Studying the Degradation of Propagation Delay on FPGAs at the European XFEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of unhardened commercial-off-the-shelf embedded devices are deployed under harsh operating conditions and in highly-dependable systems. Due to the mechanisms of hardware degradation that affect these devices, ageing detection and monitoring are crucial to prevent critical failures. In this paper, we empirically study the propagation delay of 298 naturally-aged FPGA devices that are deployed in the European XFEL particle accelerator. Based on in-field measurements, we find that operational devices show significantly slower switching frequencies than unused chips, and that increased gamma and neutron radiation doses correlate with increased hardware degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of developing machine learning models that estimate the switching frequencies of the devices based on historical and environmental data.</description>

      <title>Laser Fault Injection Attacks against Radiation Tolerant TMR Registers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security requirements for the Internet of things (IoT), wireless sensor nodes, and other wireless devices connected in a network for data exchange are high. These devices are often subject to lab analysis with the objective to reveal secret hidden information. One kind of attacks to reveal the cryptographic key is to perform optical Fault Injection attacks. In this work, we investigated the IHP radiation tolerant shift registers built of Triple Modular Redundant flip-flops. In our experiments, we were able to inject different transient faults into TMR registers.</description>

      <title>A 46 Gbps 12 pJ/b Sparsity-Adaptive Beamspace Equalizer for mmWave Massive MIMO in 22FDX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a GlobalFoundries 22FDX FD-SOI application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) of a beamspace equalizer for millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The ASIC implements a recently-proposed power-saving technique called sparsity-adaptive equalization (SPADE). SPADE exploits the inherent sparsity of mmWave channels in the beamspace domain to reduce the dynamic power of matrix-vector products by skipping multiplications for which the magnitude of both operands are below pre-defined thresholds. Simulations with realistic mmWave channels show that SPADE incurs less than 0.7dB SNR degradation at 1% target bit error rate compared to antenna-domain equalization. ASIC measurement results demonstrate an equalization throughput of 46Gbps and show that SPADE offers up to 38% power savings compared to antenna-domain equalization. A comparison with state-of-the-art massive MIMO equalizer designs reveals that our ASIC achieves superior normalized energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>On the Importance of Reproducibility of Experimental Results Especially in the Domain of Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security especially in the fields of IoT, industrial automation and critical infrastructure is paramount nowadays and a hot research topic. In order to ensure confidence in research results they need to be reproducible. In the past we reported [18] that in many publications important information such as details about the equipment used are missing. In this paper we report on our own experiments that we run to verify the parameters reported in the datasheets that came along with our experimental equipment. Our results show that there are significant discrepancies between the datasheets and the real world data. These deviations concern accuracy of positions, movements, duration of laser shots etc. In order to improve reproducibility of results we therefore argue on the one hand that research groups verify the data given in datasheets of equipment they use and on the other hand that they provide measurement set-up parameters in globally accepted units such as cm, seconds, etc.</description>

      <title>A Scalable FPGA Architecture for Quantum Computing Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum computing simulation provides the opportunity to explore the behaviors of quantum circuits, study the properties of quantum gates, and develop quantum computing algorithms. Simulating quantum circuits requires geometric time and space complexities, impacting the size of the quantum circuit that can be simulated as well as the respective time required to simulate a particular circuit. Applying the parallelism inherent in the simulation and crafting custom architectures, larger quantum circuits can be simulated. A scalable accelerator architecture is proposed to provide a high performance, highly parallel, accelerator. Among the challenges of creating a scalable architecture is managing parallelism, efficiently routing quantum state components for gate evaluation, and measurement. An example is demonstrated on an Intel Agilex field programmable gate array (FPGA).</description>

      <title>On the Influence of the Laser Illumination on the Logic Cells Current Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical side-channel attacks represent a great challenge for today's chip design. Although attacks on CMOS dynamic power represent a class of state-of-the-art attacks, many other effects potentially affect the security of CMOS chips analogously by affecting mostly static behaviour of the chip, including aging, ionizing radiation, or non-ionizing illumination of the CMOS. Vulnerabilities exploiting data dependency in CMOS static power were already demonstrated in practice and the analogous vulnerability exploiting light-modulated static power was demonstrated by simulation. This work confirms the CMOS vulnerability related to the light-modulated data-dependent static power experimentally and discusses future work.</description>

      <title>GreenFPGA: Evaluating FPGAs as Environmentally Sustainable Computing Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growing global concerns about climate change highlight the need for environmentally sustainable computing. The ecological impact of computing, including operational and embodied, is a key consideration. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) stand out as promising sustainable computing platforms due to their reconfigurability across various applications. This paper introduces GreenFPGA, a tool estimating the total carbon footprint (CFP) of FPGAs over their lifespan, considering design, manufacturing, reconfigurability (reuse), operation, disposal, and recycling. Using GreenFPGA, the paper evaluates scenarios where the ecological benefits of FPGA reconfigurability outweigh operational and embodied carbon costs, positioning FPGAs as a environmentally sustainable choice for hardware acceleration compared to Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). Experimental results show that FPGAs have lower CFP than ASICs, particularly for multiple distinct, low-volume applications, or short application lifespans.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a composite inner-product computation unit based on left-to-right (LR) arithmetic for the acceleration of convolution neural networks (CNN) on hardware. The efficacy of the proposed L2R-CIPU method has been shown on the VGG-16 network, and assessment is done on various performance metrics. The L2R-CIPU design achieves 1.06x to 6.22x greater performance, 4.8x to 15x more TOPS/W, and 4.51x to 53.45x higher TOPS/mm2 than prior architectures.</description>

      <title>EA4RCA:Efficient AIE accelerator design framework for Regular Communication-Avoiding Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the introduction of the Adaptive Intelligence Engine (AIE), the Versal Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (Versal ACAP) has garnered great attention. However, the current focus of Vitis Libraries and limited research has mainly been on how to invoke AIE modules, without delving into a thorough discussion on effectively utilizing AIE in its typical use cases. As a result, the widespread adoption of Versal ACAP has been restricted. The Communication Avoidance (CA) algorithm is considered a typical application within the AIE architecture. Nevertheless, the effective utilization of AIE in CA applications remains an area that requires further exploration. We propose a top-down customized design framework, EA4RCA(Efficient AIE accelerator design framework for regular Communication-Avoid Algorithm), specifically tailored for CA algorithms with regular communication patterns, and equipped with AIE Graph Code Generator software to accelerate the AIE design process. The primary objective of this framework is to maximize the performance of AIE while incorporating high-speed data streaming services. Experiments show that for the RCA algorithm Filter2D and Matrix Multiple (MM) with lower communication requirements and the RCA algorithm FFT with higher communication requirements, the accelerators implemented by the RA4RCA framework achieve the highest throughput improvements of 22.19x, 1.05x and 3.88x compared with the current highest performance acceleration scheme (SOTA), and the highest energy efficiency improvements of 6.11x, 1.30x and 7.00x.</description>

      <title>Low latency optical-based mode tracking with machine learning deployed on FPGAs on a tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active feedback control in magnetic confinement fusion devices is desirable to mitigate plasma instabilities and enable robust operation. Optical high-speed cameras provide a powerful, non-invasive diagnostic and can be suitable for these applications. In this study, we process fast camera data, at rates exceeding 100kfps, on $\textit{in situ}$ Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware to track magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) mode evolution and generate control signals in real-time. Our system utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model which predicts the $n$=1 MHD mode amplitude and phase using camera images with better accuracy than other tested non-deep-learning-based methods. By implementing this model directly within the standard FPGA readout hardware of the high-speed camera diagnostic, our mode tracking system achieves a total trigger-to-output latency of 17.6$\mu$s and a throughput of up to 120kfps. This study at the High Beta Tokamak-Extended Pulse (HBT-EP) experiment demonstrates an FPGA-based high-speed camera data acquisition and processing system, enabling application in real-time machine-learning-based tokamak diagnostic and control as well as potential applications in other scientific domains.</description>

      <title>MicroT: Low-Energy and Adaptive Models for MCUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose MicroT, a low-energy, multi-task adaptive model framework for resource-constrained MCUs. We divide the original model into a feature extractor and a classifier. The feature extractor is obtained through self-supervised knowledge distillation and further optimized into part and full models through model splitting and joint training. These models are then deployed on MCUs, with classifiers added and trained on local tasks, ultimately performing stage-decision for joint inference. In this process, the part model initially processes the sample, and if the confidence score falls below the set threshold, the full model will resume and continue the inference. We evaluate MicroT on two models, three datasets, and two MCU boards. Our experimental evaluation shows that MicroT effectively improves model performance and reduces energy consumption when dealing with multiple local tasks. Compared to the unoptimized feature extractor, MicroT can improve accuracy by up to 9.87%. On MCUs, compared to the standard full model inference, MicroT can save up to about 29.13% in energy consumption. MicroT also allows users to adaptively adjust the stage-decision ratio as needed, better balancing model performance and energy consumption. Under the standard stage-decision ratio configuration, MicroT can increase accuracy by 5.91% and save about 14.47% of energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Mooncake: A KVCache-centric Disaggregated Architecture for LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mooncake is the serving platform for Kimi, a leading LLM service provided by Moonshot AI. It features a KVCache-centric disaggregated architecture that separates the prefill and decoding clusters. It also leverages the underutilized CPU, DRAM, and SSD resources of the GPU cluster to implement a disaggregated cache of KVCache. The core of Mooncake is its KVCache-centric scheduler, which balances maximizing overall effective throughput while meeting latency-related Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Unlike traditional studies that assume all requests will be processed, Mooncake faces challenges due to highly overloaded scenarios. To mitigate these, we developed a prediction-based early rejection policy. Experiments show that Mooncake excels in long-context scenarios. Compared to the baseline method, Mooncake can achieve up to a 525% increase in throughput in certain simulated scenarios while adhering to SLOs. Under real workloads, Mooncake's innovative architecture enables Kimi to handle 75% more requests.</description>

      <title>Towards CPU Performance Prediction: New Challenge Benchmark Dataset and Novel Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CPU performance prediction, which involves forecasting the performance scores of a CPU based on its hardware characteristics during its operation, is a critical technology for computational system design and resource management in the big data era. However, this research field currently faces two significant challenges. First, collecting real-world data is challenging due to the wide variety of CPU products on the market and the highly specialized nature of relevant hardware characteristics. In the research process, this field lacks a standard dataset with unified hardware characteristics, wide data coverage, and comprehensive benchmarks. Second, existing methods based on hardware simulation models or machine learning exhibit notable shortcomings, such as lengthy simulation test cycles and low prediction accuracy. To bridge these gaps, we first collect, preprocess, and standardize historical data from the 4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors across multiple benchmark suites to create a new dataset, named PerfCastDB. Subsequently, we design a deep learning based model called Nova CPU Performance Predictor (NCPP) as the baseline for this new dataset. The NCPP network is designed based on group attention mechanism. It effectively quantifies the implicit relationships between hardware characteristics within and across groups and comprehensively models the impact of various hardware characteristics on CPU performance prediction. We conduct comparative experiments using the proposed PerfCastDB dataset. Compared to existing approaches, NCPP achieves superior evaluation results, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, we have open-sourced part of the dataset and the NCPP network code to facilitate subsequent research. The resources can be accessed at https://github.com/xiaoman-liu/NCPP.</description>
