      <title>Integrating Score-Based Generative Modeling and Neural ODEs for Accurate Representation of Multiscale Chaotic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiscale dynamical systems characterized by interacting fast and slow processes are ubiquitous across scientific domains, from climate dynamics to fluid mechanics. Accurate modeling of such systems requires capturing both the long-term statistical properties governed by slow variables and the short-term transient dynamics driven by fast chaotic processes. We present a hybrid data-driven framework that integrates score-based generative modeling with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) to construct reduced-order models (ROMs) capable of reproducing both regimes. The slow dynamics are represented by a Langevin equation whose drift is informed by a score function learned via the K-means Gaussian Mixture Model (KGMM) method, ensuring faithful reproduction of the system's invariant measure. The fast chaotic forcing is modeled by a NODE trained on delay-embedded residuals extracted from observed trajectories, replacing conventional Gaussian noise approximations. We validate this approach on a hierarchy of prototypical metastable systems driven by Lorenz 63 dynamics, including bistable potentials with additive and multiplicative forcing, and tristable non-autonomous systems with cycloperiodic components. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid framework maintains statistical consistency over long time horizons while accurately forecasting rare critical transitions between metastable states with lead times approaching the Lyapunov time of the chaotic driver. This work establishes a principled methodology for combining statistical closure techniques with explicit surrogate models of fast dynamics, offering a pathway toward predictive modeling of complex multiscale phenomena where both long-term statistics and short-term transients are essential.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Hidden Multistability in Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multistability, the coexistence of multiple stable states, is a cornerstone of nonlinear dynamical systems, governing their equilibrium, tunability, and emergent complexity. Recently, the concept of hidden multistability, where certain stable states evade detection via conventional continuous parameter sweeping, has garnered increasing attention due to its elusive nature and promising applications. In this Letter, we present the first experimental observation of hidden multistability using a programmable acoustic coupled-cavity platform that integrates competing self-focusing and self-defocusing Kerr nonlinearities. Beyond established bistability, we demonstrate semi- and fully-hidden tristabilities by precisely programming system parameters. Crucially, the hidden stable states, typically inaccessible via the traditional protocol, are unambiguously revealed and dynamically controlled through pulsed excitation, enabling flexible transitions between distinct types of stable states. These experimental findings not only offer new insights into the fundamental physics of emerging hidden multistability, but also unlock new avenues for applications in information storage, information encryption, and safety precaution, where multi-state dynamics could enable advanced control techniques.</description>

      <title>Energy transport and chaos in a one-dimensional disordered nonlinear stub lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate energy propagation in a one-dimensional stub lattice in the presence of both disorder and nonlinearity. In the periodic case, the stub lattice hosts two dispersive bands separated by a flat band; however, we show that sufficiently strong disorder fills all intermediate band gaps. By mapping the two-dimensional parameter space of disorder and nonlinearity, we identify three distinct dynamical regimes (weak chaos, strong chaos, and self-trapping) through numerical simulations of initially localized wave packets. When disorder is strong enough to close the frequency gaps, the results closely resemble those obtained in the one-dimensional disordered discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation and Klein-Gordon lattice model. In particular, subdiffusive spreading is observed in both the weak and strong chaos regimes, with the second moment $m_2$ of the norm distribution scaling as $m_2 \propto t^{0.33}$ and $m_2 \propto t^{0.5}$, respectively. The system's chaotic behavior follows a similar trend, with the finite-time maximum Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda$ decaying as $\Lambda \propto t^{-0.25}$ and $\Lambda \propto t^{-0.3}$. For moderate disorder strengths, i.e., near the point of gap closing, we find that the presence of small frequency gaps does not exert any noticeable influence on the spreading behavior. Our findings extend the characterization of nonlinear disordered lattices in both weak and strong chaos regimes to other network geometries, such as the stub lattice, which serves as a representative flat-band system.</description>

      <title>Resolution of Loschmidts Paradox via Geometric Constraints on Information Accessibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve Loschmidt's paradox -- the apparent contradiction between time-reversible microscopic dynamics and irreversible macroscopic evolution -- including the long-standing puzzle of the thermodynamic arrow of time. The resolution: entropy increases not because dynamics are asymmetric, but because information accessibility is geometrically bounded. For Hamiltonian systems (conservative dynamics), Lyapunov exponents come in positive-negative pairs ($\{\lambda_i, -\lambda_i\}$) due to symplectic structure. Under time reversal these pairs flip ($\lambda_i \to -\lambda_i$), but stable manifolds contract below quantum resolution $\lambda = \hbar/\sqrt{mk_BT}$, becoming physically indistinguishable. We always observe only unstable manifolds where trajectories diverge. Hence information loss proceeds at the same rate $h_{KS} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\text{all } i}|\lambda_i|$ in both time directions, resolving the arrow of time: ``forward'' simply means ``where we observe expansion,'' which is universal because stable manifolds always contract below measurability. Quantitatively, for N$_2$ gas at STP with conservative estimates ($h_{KS} \sim 10^{10}$ s$^{-1}$), time reversal at $t = 1$ nanosecond requires momentum precision $\sim 10^{-13}$ times quantum limits -- geometrically impossible. At macroscopic times, the precision requirement becomes $\sim 10^{-10^{10}}$ times quantum limits. This framework preserves microscopic time-reversal symmetry, requires no special initial conditions or Past Hypothesis, and extends to quantum systems (OTOCs) and black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamics and route to quasiperiodic synchronization in non-isochronous directed Stuart-Landau triads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupled Stuart-Landau equation serves as a fundamental model for exploring synchronization and emergent behavior in complex dynamical systems. However, understanding its dynamics from a comprehensive nonlinear perspective remains challenging due to the multifaceted influence of coupling topology, interaction strength, and oscillator frequency detuning. Despite extensive theoretical investigations over the decades, numerous aspects remain unexplored, particularly those that bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observations-an essential step toward deepening our understanding of real-world dynamical phenomena. This work investigates the complex dynamics of unidirectionally coupled non-isochronous Stuart-Landau oscillators. Calculations of steady-states and their stability analysis further reveal that periodic attractors corresponding to weak forcing or coupling regimes are dynamically unstable, which pushes the system towards quasiperiodic oscillation on the torus attractor. The mapping of parameter values with the kind of attractor of the oscillatory system is presented and classified into periodic, quasiperiodic, partially synchronized, and chaotic regions. The results of this study can be leveraged to design complex yet controllable dynamical architectures.</description>

      <title>Choosing observables that capture critical slowing down before tipping points: A Fokker-Planck operator approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tipping points (TP) are abrupt transitions between metastable states in complex systems, most often described by a bifurcation or crisis of a multistable system induced by a slowly changing control parameter. An avenue for predicting TPs in real-world systems is critical slowing down (CSD), which is a decrease in the relaxation rate after perturbations prior to a TP that can be measured by statistical early warning signals (EWS) in the autocovariance of observational time series. In high-dimensional systems, we cannot expect a priori chosen scalar observables to show significant EWS, and some may even show an opposite signal. Thus, to avoid false negative or positive early warnings, it is desirable to monitor fluctuations only in observables that are designed to capture CSD. Here we propose that a natural observable for this purpose can be obtained by a data-driven approximation of the first non-trivial eigenfunction of the backward Fokker-Planck (or Kolmogorov) operator, using the diffusion map algorithm.</description>

      <title>On the solvable-unsolvable transition due to noise-induced chaos in digital memcomputing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) have been designed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. Since DMMs are fundamentally classical dynamical systems, their ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be efficiently simulated on modern computers. This provides a unique platform to study their performance under various conditions. An aspect that has received little attention so far is how their performance is affected by the numerical errors in the solution of their ODEs and the physical noise they would be naturally subject to if built in hardware. Here, we analyze these two aspects in detail by varying the integration time step (numerical noise) and adding stochastic perturbations (physical noise) into the equations of DMMs. We are particularly interested in understanding how noise induces a chaotic transition that marks the shift from successful problem-solving to failure in these systems. Our study includes an analysis of power spectra and Lyapunov exponents depending on the noise strength. The results reveal a correlation between the instance solvability and the sign of the ensemble averaged mean largest Lyapunov exponent. Interestingly, we find a regime in which DMMs with positive mean largest Lyapunov exponents still exhibit solvability. Furthermore, the power spectra provide additional information about our system by distinguishing between regular behavior (peaks) and chaotic behavior (broadband spectrum). Therefore, power spectra could be utilized to control whether a DMM operates in the optimal dynamical regime. Overall, we find that the qualitative effects of numerical and physical noise are mostly similar, despite their fundamentally different origin.</description>
