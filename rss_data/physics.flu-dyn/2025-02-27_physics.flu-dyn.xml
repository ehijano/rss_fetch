      <title>Investigation on the Spreading Behaviour of Sand Powder Used in Binder Jet 3D Printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spreading behaviour of cohesive sand powder is modelled by Discrete Element Method, and the spreadability and the mechanical jamming are focused. The empty patches and total particle volume of the spread layer are examined, followed by the analysis of the geometry force and jamming structure. The results show that several empty patches with different size and shapes could be observed within the spread layer along the spreading direction even when the gap height increases to 3.0D90. Large particles are more difficult to be spread onto the base due to jamming, although their size is smaller than the gap height. Size segregation of particles occurs before particles entering the gap between the blade and base. There are almost no particles on the smooth base when the gap height is small, due to the full-slip flow of particles. The difference of the spread layer and spreadability between the cases with rough and smooth base is reduced by the increase of the gap height. An interesting correlation between jamming effect and local defects (empty spaces) in the powder layer is identified. The resistance to particle rolling is important for the mechanical jamming reported in this work. The jammed particles with a larger size ratio tend to be more stable.</description>

      <title>Viscous and Inviscid Reconnection of Vortex Rings on Logarithmic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the possible occurrence of a Finite-Time Singularity (FTS) during the oblique reconnection of two vortex rings, Moffatt-Kimura (MK) (J. Fluid Mech., 2019a; J. Fluid Mech., 2019b) developed a simplified model based on the Biot-Savart law and claimed that the vorticity amplification $\omega_{\text{max}}/\omega_0$ becomes very large for vortex Reynolds number $Re_{\Gamma} \geq 4000$. However, with Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), Yao and Hussain (J. Fluid Mech., 2020) were able to show that the vorticity amplification is in fact much smaller and increases slowly with $Re_{\Gamma}$. The suppression of vorticity was linked to two key factors - deformation of the vortex core during approach and formation of hairpin-like bridge structures. In this work, a recently developed numerical technique called log-lattice (Campolina and Mailybaev, Nonlinearity, 2021), where interacting Fourier modes are logarithmically sampled, is applied to the same oblique vortex ring interaction problem. It is shown that this technique is not only capable of capturing the two key physical processes overlooked by the MK model but also other quantitative and qualitative attributes generally seen with DNS, at a fraction of the computational cost. Furthermore, the sparsity of the Fourier modes allows us to probe very large $Re_{\Gamma} = 10^8$ until which the peak of the maximum norm of vorticity, while increasing with $Re_{\Gamma}$, remains finite, and a blowup is observed only for the inviscid case.</description>

      <title>Analysis on the mechanical jamming of particle flow using impeller-based rheometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulated the cohesive particle flow in an impeller-based rheometer using Discrete Element Method (DEM), and we focus on the dynamics of particles around the constriction between the blade and its surrounding vessel wall. The results show that mechanical jamming could transiently and intermittently occur in the constriction, but it is limited in a narrow region and short duration. Larger stiffness of particles and lifting flow pattern are more prone to the occurrence of jamming. The scaling law used to speed up the DEM simulation by reducing particle stiffness may fail for particle flow passing through clearance. The mechanical jamming of particles is in low frequency with value less than 50 Hz and the duration of an individual jamming event is usually less than 0.04 s. The existence of mechanical jamming is also illustrated by the experiment, where the wear of particle surface is clearly observed with scratches and pits.</description>

      <title>Tackling Compressible Turbulent Multi-Component Flows with Dynamic hp-Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an hp-adaptive hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin/Finite Volume method for simulating compressible, turbulent multi-component flows. Building on a previously established hp-adaptive strategy for hyperbolic gas- and droplet-dynamics problems, this study extends the hybrid DG/FV approach to viscous flows with multiple species and incorporates non-conforming interfaces, enabling enhanced flexibility in grid generation. A central contribution of this work lies in the computation of both convective and dissipative fluxes across non-conforming element interfaces of mixed discretizations. To achieve accurate shock localization and scale-resolving representation of turbulent structures, the operator dynamically switches between an h-refined FV sub-cell scheme and a p-adaptive DG method, based on an a priori modal solution analysis. The method is implemented in the high-order open-source framework FLEXI and validated against benchmark problems, including the supersonic Taylor-Green vortex and a triplepoint shock interaction, demonstrating its robustness and accuracy for under-resolved shock-turbulence interactions and compressible multi-species scenarios. Finally, the method's capabilities are showcased through an implicit large eddy simulation of an under-expanded hydrogen jet mixing with air, highlighting its potential for tackling challenging compressible multi-species flows in engineering.</description>

      <title>Transported Memory Networks accelerating Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, augmentation of differentiable PDE solvers with neural networks has shown promising results, particularly in fluid simulations. However, most approaches rely on convolutional neural networks and custom solvers operating on Cartesian grids with efficient access to cell data. This particular choice poses challenges for industrial-grade solvers that operate on unstructured meshes, where access is restricted to neighboring cells only. In this work, we address this limitation using a novel architecture, named Transported Memory Networks. The architecture draws inspiration from both traditional turbulence models and recurrent neural networks, and it is fully compatible with generic discretizations. Our results show that it is point-wise and statistically comparable to, or improves upon, previous methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms and Scale-up Potential of 3D Solar Interfacial-Evaporators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaporation rates from porous evaporators under sunlight have been reported to exceed the solar-thermal limit, determined by relating the incoming solar energy to the latent and sensible heat of water, for applications in desalination and brine pond drying. Although flat two-dimensional (2D) evaporators exceeding the solar limit implies a non-thermal process, tall three-dimensional (3D) solar evaporators can exceed it by absorbing additional environmental heat into its cold sidewalls. Through modeling, we explain the physics and identify the critical heights in which a fin transitions from 2D to 3D evaporation and exceeds the solar-thermal limit. Our analyses illustrate that environmental heat absorption in 3D evaporators is determined by the ambient relative humidity and the airflow velocity. The model is then coarse-grained into a large-scale fin array device on the meters scale to analyze their scalability. We identify that these devices are unlikely to scale favorably in closed environment settings such as solar stills. Our modeling clearly illustrates the benefits and limitations of 3D evaporating arrays and pinpoints design choices in previous works that hinder the device's overall performance. This work illustrates the importance in distinguishing 2D from 3D evaporation for mechanisms underlying interfacial evaporation exceeding the solar-thermal limit.</description>

      <title>Amplification of turbulence through multiple planar shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the amplification of isotropic, incompressible turbulence through multiple planar, collisional shocks, using analytical linear theory. There are two limiting cases we explore. The first assumes shocks occur rapidly in time such that the turbulence does not evolve between shocks. Whereas the second case allows enough time for turbulence to isotropize between each shock. For the latter case, through a quasi-equation-of-state, we show that the weak multi-shock limit is agnostic to the distinction between thermal and vortical turbulent pressures, like an isotropic volumetric compression. When turbulence does not return to isotropy between shocks, the generated anisotropy -- itself a function of shock strength -- can feedback on amplification by further shocks, altering choices for maximal or minimal amplification. In addition for this case, we find that amplification is sensitive to the shock ordering. We map how choices of shock strength can impact these amplification differences due to ordering, finding, for example, shock pairs which lead to identical mean post-shock fields (density, temperature, pressure) but maximally distinct turbulent amplification.</description>

      <title>Robust Prediction of Frictional Contact Network in Near-Jamming Suspensions Employing Deep Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18743v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The viscosity of the suspension consisting of fine particles dispersed in a Newtonian liquid diverges close to the jamming packing fraction. The contact microstructure in suspensions governs this macroscopic behavior in the vicinity of jamming through a frictional contact network (FCN). FCN is composed of mechanical load-bearing contacts that lead to the emergence of rigidity near the jamming transition. The stress transmission and network topology, in turn, depend sensitively on constraints on the relative motion of the particles. Despite their significance, predicting the FCN, especially close to jamming conditions, remains challenging due to experimental and computational impediments. This study introduces a cost-effective machine learning approach to predict the FCN using a graph neural network (GNN), which inherently captures hidden features and underlying patterns in dense suspension by mapping interparticle interactions. Employing a variation of GNN called the Deep Graph Convolutional Network (DeepGCN) trained on data-driven simulations, this study demonstrates robust generalization and extrapolation capabilities, accurately predicting FCNs in systems with divergent flow parameters and phase spaces, despite each being trained exclusively on a single condition. The study covers a wide range of phase space, from semi-dilute to jammed states, spanning transient to steady states, while systematically varying parameters such as shear stress (${\sigma}_{xy}$), packing fraction(${\phi}$) and sliding and rolling friction (${{\mu}_s, {\mu}_r}$). The results of this research pave the way for innovative transferable techniques in predicting the properties of particulate systems, offering new avenues for advancement in material science and related fields.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Efficiency in Shear-Loaded Brownian Gyrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Brownian gyrator is a system in which a particle experiences thermal noise from two distinct heat baths. This nonequilibrium setup inherently generates a nonzero torque, leading to gyrating motion around a potential energy minimum. As a minimal model for a heat engine, the Brownian gyrator provides valuable insights into energy conversion and nonequilibrium dynamics. Here, we investigate the effect of an externally imposed shear flow on a Brownian gyrator, treating it as a mechanical load. The shear flow introduces a tunable mechanism that allows the system to operate either as a heat engine, extracting work from the temperature gradient, or as a refrigerator, transferring heat from the colder to the hotter bath. Focusing on the heat engine regime, we analytically derive the steady-state probability distribution to compute the average torque exerted by the gyrator and quantify the mechanical power extracted from the shear. Our results show a remarkable increase in efficiency compared to the standard Brownian gyrator without shear, approaching Carnot efficiency at maximum power. Surprisingly, we also find that while the system can operate efficiently as a heat engine, it may become unstable before reaching the stall condition, highlighting a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and stability in shear-driven microscopic engines.</description>

      <title>Highly Localised Droplet Clustering in Shallow Cumulus Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth, lifetime, number density, and size of water droplets in warm atmospheric clouds determine the evolution, lifetime and light transmission properties of those clouds. These small-scale cloud properties, in addition to precipitation initiation, have strong implications for the Earth's energy budget since warm clouds cover large geographic areas. Spatio-temporal correlations on the millimetre scale and smaller may or may not affect these properties of clouds. To date, the pioneering measurements of such correlations in marine stratocumulus clouds have relied on averaging over holographically reconstructed volumes spanning at least ten kilometres. These have revealed weak but widespread spatial clustering of cloud droplets. Here we present results of strong localised clustering on scales of half a metre or less from holographic measurements collected with the Max Planck CloudKite in shallow cumulus clouds in the mid-Atlantic trade wind region near Barbados, with a spatial separation of only 12~cm between measurement volumes. This observation challenges the foundations of our understanding of cloud microphysics at the droplet scale, with implications for cloud modelling in weather and climate prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent flows are well known to pose extreme computational challenges due to the huge number of dynamical degrees of freedom required to correctly describe the complex multi-scale statistical correlations of the velocity. On the other hand, kinetic mesoscale approaches based on the Boltzmann equation, have the potential to describe a broad range of flows, stretching well beyond the special case of gases close to equilibrium, which results in the ordinary Navier-Stokes dynamics. Here we demonstrate that, by properly tuning, a kinetic approach can statistically reproduce the quantitative dynamics of the larger scales in turbulence, thereby providing an alternative, computationally efficient and physically rooted approach towards subgrid scale (SGS) modeling in turbulence. More specifically we show that by leveraging on data from fully resolved Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) we can learn a collision operator for the discretized Boltzmann equation solver (the lattice Boltzmann method), which effectively implies a turbulence subgrid closure model. The mesoscopic nature of our formulation makes the learning problem fully local in both space and time, leading to reduced computational costs and enhanced generalization capabilities. We show that the model offers superior performance compared to traditional methods, such as the Smagorinsky model, being less dissipative and, therefore, being able to more closely capture the intermittency of higher-order velocity correlations. This foundational work lays the basis for extending the proposed framework to different turbulent flow settings and -- most importantly -- to develop new classes of hybrid data-driven kinetic-based models capable of faithfully capturing the complex macroscopic dynamics of diverse physical systems such as emulsions, non-Newtonian fluid and multiphase systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scale-invariant inverse energy cascade is a hallmark of 2D turbulence, with its theoretical energy spectrum observed in both direct numerical simulations (DNS) and laboratory experiments. Under this scale-invariance assumption, the effective diffusivity of a 2D turbulent flow is dimensionally controlled by the energy flux and the friction coefficient only. Surprisingly, however, we show that such scaling predictions are invalidated by numerical solutions of the 2D Navier-Stokes equation forced at intermediate wave number and damped by weak linear or quadratic drag. We derive alternate scaling-laws for the effective diffusivity based on the emergence of intense, isolated vortices causing spatially inhomogeneous frictional dissipation localized within the small vortex cores. The predictions quantitatively match DNS data. This study points to a universal large-scale organization of 2D turbulent flows in physical space, bridging standard 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence with large-scale geophysical turbulence.</description>

      <title>Implicit factorized transformer approach to fast prediction of turbulent channel flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer neural operators have recently become an effective approach for surrogate modeling of systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we introduce a modified implicit factorized transformer (IFactFormer-m) model which replaces the original chained factorized attention with parallel factorized attention. The IFactFormer-m model successfully performs long-term predictions for turbulent channel flow, whereas the original IFactFormer (IFactFormer-o), Fourier neural operator (FNO), and implicit Fourier neural operator (IFNO) exhibit a poor performance. Turbulent channel flows are simulated by direct numerical simulation using fine grids at friction Reynolds numbers $\text{Re}_{\tau}\approx 180,395,590$, and filtered to coarse grids for training neural operator. The neural operator takes the current flow field as input and predicts the flow field at the next time step, and long-term prediction is achieved in the posterior through an autoregressive approach. The results show that IFactFormer-m, compared to other neural operators and the traditional large eddy simulation (LES) methods including dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) and the wall-adapted local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model, reduces prediction errors in the short term, and achieves stable and accurate long-term prediction of various statistical properties and flow structures, including the energy spectrum, mean streamwise velocity, root mean square (rms) values of fluctuating velocities, Reynolds shear stress, and spatial structures of instantaneous velocity. Moreover, the trained IFactFormer-m is much faster than traditional LES methods. By analyzing the attention kernels, we elucidate the reasons why IFactFormer-m converges faster and achieves a stable and accurate long-term prediction compared to IFactFormer-o. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/huiyu-2002/IFactFormer-m.</description>

Abstract: Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.</description>

      <title>On a critical acceleration scale of dark matter in Lambda-CDM and dynamical dark energy</title>

Abstract: Universal acceleration $a_0$ emerges in various empirical laws, yet its fundamental nature remains unclear. Using Illustris and Virgo N-body simulations, we propose $a_0$ is the scale of acceleration fluctuations in collisionless dark matter involving long-range gravity. In contrast, in the kinetic theory of gases, molecules undergo random elastic collisions involving short-range interactions, where only velocity fluctuations are relevant. We identify the redshift evolution $a_0\propto (1+z)^{3/4}$ that is in good agreement with Magneticum and EAGLE simulations and in reasonable agreement with limited observations. This suggests a larger $a_0$ at a higher redshift such that galaxies of fixed baryonic mass rotate faster at a higher redshift. The velocity fluctuations involve a critical velocity $u_c\propto (1+z)^{-3/4}$. The acceleration fluctuations involve a critical acceleration $a_c\propto (1+z)^{3/4}$. Two critical quantities are related by the rate of energy cascade $\varepsilon_{u}\approx -{a_c u_c/[2(3\pi)^2]}$, where factor $3\pi$ is from the angle of incidence and $\varepsilon_u\approx -10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$. With critical velocity $u_c$ on the order of 300 km/s at $z=0$, the critical acceleration is determined to be $a_{c0}\equiv a_c(z=0) \approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$, suggesting $a_c$ might explain the universal acceleration $a_0\approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$ in the empirical Tully-Fisher relation or modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). Note that dark energy (DE) density $\rho_{DE0}\approx {a_{c0}^{2}/G}=10^{-10}$J/m$^3$, we postulate an entropic origin of the dark energy from acceleration fluctuations of dark matter, in analogy to the gas pressure from velocity fluctuations. This leads to a dynamical dark energy coupled to the structure evolution involving a relatively constant DE density followed by a slow weakening phase, suggesting possible deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Harvesting energy from turbulent winds with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) is an emerging technology designed to harness the power of high-altitude winds, offering a solution to several limitations of conventional wind turbines. AWE is based on flying devices (usually gliders or kites) that, tethered to a ground station and driven by the wind, convert its mechanical energy into electrical energy by means of a generator. Such systems are usually controlled by manoeuvering the kite so as to follow a predefined path prescribed by optimal control techniques, such as model-predictive control. These methods are strongly dependent on the specific model at use and difficult to generalize, especially in unpredictable conditions such as the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer. Our aim is to explore the possibility of replacing these techniques with an approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike traditional methods, RL does not require a predefined model, making it robust to variability and uncertainty. Our experimental results in complex simulated environments demonstrate that AWE agents trained with RL can effectively extract energy from turbulent flows, relying on minimal local information about the kite orientation and speed relative to the wind.</description>
