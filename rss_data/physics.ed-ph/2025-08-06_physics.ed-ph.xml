      <title>Experimental Physics Laboratory 2: Calculating the Value of Water Density using Metal Rod and Water Container</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a detailed analysis of an undergraduate physics laboratory experiment designed to determine the density of water using fundamental measurement techniques and data analysis methods. The experimental setup consists of a precision scale, a graduated container filled with water, and a suspended metal rod held by a crank, allowing for controlled displacement measurements. The primary objective of this experiment is to reinforce essential concepts in experimental physics, particularly in deriving physical models that correlate measurable quantities, performing precise measurements, and analyzing data using regression techniques via ordinary least squares methods for fitting data into linear models. This article aims to provide students with a theoretical and computational aid to explore the physical interpretations of this experiment. I developed a theoretical framework to introduce the fundamental concepts of hydrostatics, Newtonian mechanics, and the primary equations used in the experiment. I supplied Python code with thorough explanations that performs analysis on the experiment.</description>

      <title>Connect the dots ... finding all possible orbits between two points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: You have a satellite spacecraft or asteroid that moves under the gravitational influence of a massive central body and follows a Keplerian orbit around it ellipse parabola or hyperbola Given measurements of two positions in its orbit what is the family of possible orbital paths that connects them I use the conic section orbits semilatus rectum directly related to orbital angular momentum to parameterise these orbits The solutions have applications to orbit determination ballistic missiles interplanetary interception and targeted reentry I also show how they can be applied to solve the Lambert problem of finding the unique transfer orbit that connects two points in a specified time interval These results are accessible to advanced undergraduate students in physics or aerospace engineering. Supplementary materials are provided online</description>

      <title>Semantic Network Analysis of Achievement Standards in Physics of 2022 Revised Curriculum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate semantic networks of achievement standards for physics subjects in the 2022 revised curriculum to derive information embedded in the curriculum. We extract each subject's keywords with node strength and random-walk betweenness, detect communities of physics terms by the optimized greedy algorithm, and find the connectivity of physics subjects using bipartite networks. The network analysis reveals three remarkable results: First, keywords are about scientific thinking and practices, evolving to a higher level as the grades increase. Second, there is a lack of connection to learning content in physics. Lastly, achievement standards for 'Integrated Science' are inadequate to fulfill the intended purpose of the curriculum. This is attributed to the reduced learning volume in the 2022 revised curriculum. Our study implies that the curriculum and achievement standards should be improved for the better connectivity of subjects.</description>

      <title>When AI Evaluates Its Own Work: Validating Learner-Initiated, AI-Generated Physics Practice Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can now generate physics practice problems in real time, yet the educational value of these items hinges on rapid, reliable post-generation vetting. We investigated which automated checks are both technically feasible and pedagogically meaningful when exercises are produced on demand within a chatbot interface. A cohort of 34 introductory-physics students generated and attempted 543 problems during exam preparation. Each item was labeled by an expert on a wide range of quality attributes and presented to the learners in pairs to record their preference. We then (i) benchmarked three commodity LLMs as "judges" against the expert labels, (ii) quantified which attributes predict student choice via random-forest models, and (iii) triangulated these results with free-form exit surveys. Only a small subset of the original rubric proved necessary to reliably address student preferences either directly or by proxy. The study demonstrates that scalable formative assessment does not require exhaustive scoring: a carefully curated core of structural and learner-visible checks is sufficient to ensure both technical soundness and user appeal. The findings provide a practical blueprint for deploying real-time, AI-generated practice in physics and other quantitative disciplines.</description>
