      <title>Block-Diagonal Guided DBSCAN Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cluster analysis plays a crucial role in database mining, and one of the most widely used algorithms in this field is DBSCAN. However, DBSCAN has several limitations, such as difficulty in handling high-dimensional large-scale data, sensitivity to input parameters, and lack of robustness in producing clustering results. This paper introduces an improved version of DBSCAN that leverages the block-diagonal property of the similarity graph to guide the clustering procedure of DBSCAN. The key idea is to construct a graph that measures the similarity between high-dimensional large-scale data points and has the potential to be transformed into a block-diagonal form through an unknown permutation, followed by a cluster-ordering procedure to generate the desired permutation. The clustering structure can be easily determined by identifying the diagonal blocks in the permuted graph. We propose a gradient descent-based method to solve the proposed problem. Additionally, we develop a DBSCAN-based points traversal algorithm that identifies clusters with high densities in the graph and generates an augmented ordering of clusters. The block-diagonal structure of the graph is then achieved through permutation based on the traversal order, providing a flexible foundation for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We introduce a split-and-refine algorithm to automatically search for all diagonal blocks in the permuted graph with theoretically optimal guarantees under specific cases. We extensively evaluate our proposed approach on twelve challenging real-world benchmark clustering datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art clustering method on every dataset.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Search on Complete Bipartite Graphs by Continuous Time Quantum Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a deterministic search algorithm on complete bipartite graphs. Our algorithm adopts the simple form of alternating iterations of an oracle and a continuous-time quantum walk operator, which is a generalization of Grover's search algorithm. We address the most general case of multiple marked states, so there is a problem of estimating the number of marked states. To this end, we construct a quantum counting algorithm based on the spectrum structure of the search operator. To implement the continuous-time quantum walk operator, we perform Hamiltonian simulation in the quantum circuit model. We achieve simulation in constant time, that is, the complexity of the quantum circuit does not scale with the evolution time. Besides, deterministic search serves as a simple tool for perfect state transfer (PST). As an application, we explore the problem of PST on complete bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Settling Time vs. Accuracy Tradeoffs for Clustering Big Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the theoretical and practical runtime limits of k-means and k-median clustering on large datasets. Since effectively all clustering methods are slower than the time it takes to read the dataset, the fastest approach is to quickly compress the data and perform the clustering on the compressed representation. Unfortunately, there is no universal best choice for compressing the number of points - while random sampling runs in sublinear time and coresets provide theoretical guarantees, the former does not enforce accuracy while the latter is too slow as the numbers of points and clusters grow. Indeed, it has been conjectured that any sensitivity-based coreset construction requires super-linear time in the dataset size. We examine this relationship by first showing that there does exist an algorithm that obtains coresets via sensitivity sampling in effectively linear time - within log-factors of the time it takes to read the data. Any approach that significantly improves on this must then resort to practical heuristics, leading us to consider the spectrum of sampling strategies across both real and artificial datasets in the static and streaming settings. Through this, we show the conditions in which coresets are necessary for preserving cluster validity as well as the settings in which faster, cruder sampling strategies are sufficient. As a result, we provide a comprehensive theoretical and practical blueprint for effective clustering regardless of data size. Our code is publicly available and has scripts to recreate the experiments.</description>

      <title>Simpler and Unified Recognition Algorithm for Path Graphs and Directed Path Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.08476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A path graph is the intersection graph of paths in a tree. A directed path graph is the intersection graph of paths in a directed tree. Even if path graphs and directed path graphs are characterized very similarly, their recognition algorithms differ widely. We further unify these two graph classes by presenting the first recognition algorithm for both path graphs and directed path graphs. We deeply use a recent characterization of path graphs, and we extend it to directed path graphs. Our algorithm does not require complex data structures and has an easy and intuitive implementation, simplifying recognition algorithms for both graph classes.</description>

      <title>Scalable Distributed Algorithms for Size-Constrained Submodular Maximization in the MapReduce and Adaptive Complexity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09563v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed maximization of a submodular function in the MapReduce (MR) model has received much attention, culminating in two frameworks that allow a centralized algorithm to be run in the MR setting without loss of approximation, as long as the centralized algorithm satisfies a certain consistency property - which had previously only been known to be satisfied by the standard greedy and continous greedy algorithms. A separate line of work has studied parallelizability of submodular maximization in the adaptive complexity model, where each thread may have access to the entire ground set. For the size-constrained maximization of a monotone and submodular function, we show that several sublinearly adaptive (highly parallelizable) algorithms satisfy the consistency property required to work in the MR setting, which yields practical, parallelizable and distributed algorithms. Separately, we develop the first distributed algorithm with linear query complexity for this problem. Finally, we provide a method to increase the maximum cardinality constraint for MR algorithms at the cost of additional MR rounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a polynomially bounded, in time and space, method to decide whether a given 3-SAT formula is satisfiable or not. The tools we use here are, in fact, very simple. We first decide satisfiability for a particular 3-SAT formula, called pivoted 3-SAT and, after a plain transformation, still keeping the polynomial boundaries, it is shown that 3-SAT formulas can be written as pivoted formulas.</description>

      <title>On (Random-order) Online Contention Resolution Schemes for the Matching Polytope of (Bipartite) Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online Contention Resolution Schemes (OCRS's) represent a modern tool for selecting a subset of elements, subject to resource constraints, when the elements are presented to the algorithm sequentially. OCRS's have led to some of the best-known competitive ratio guarantees for online resource allocation problems, with the added benefit of treating different online decisions -- accept/reject, probing, pricing -- in a unified manner. This paper analyzes OCRS's for resource constraints defined by matchings in graphs, a fundamental structure in combinatorial optimization. We consider two dimensions of variants: the elements being presented in adversarial or random order; and the graph being bipartite or general. We improve the state of the art for all combinations of variants, both in terms of algorithmic guarantees and impossibility results. Some of our algorithmic guarantees are best-known even compared to Contention Resolution Schemes that can choose the order of arrival or are offline. All in all, our results for OCRS directly improve the best-known competitive ratios for online accept/reject, probing, and pricing problems on graphs in a unified manner.</description>

Abstract: Linked lists have long served as a valuable teaching tool in programming.However, the question arises: Are they truly practical for everyday program use? In most cases, it appears that array-based data structures offer distinct advantages, particularly in terms of memory efficiency and,more importantly, execution speed.While it's relatively straightforward to calculate the complexity of operations, gauging actual execution efficiency remains a challenge.This paper addresses this question by introducing a new benchmark.Our study compares various linked list implementations with several array-based alternatives.We also demonstrate the ease of incorporating memory caching for linked lists, enhancing their performance.Additionally, we introduce a new array-based data structure designed to excel in a wide range of operations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Shape Formation by 3D Hybrid Programmable Matter: An Algorithm for Low Diameter Intermediate Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the shape formation problem within the 3D hybrid model, where a single agent with a strictly limited viewing range and the computational capacity of a deterministic finite automaton manipulates passive tiles through pick-up, movement, and placement actions. The goal is to reconfigure a set of tiles into a specific shape termed an icicle. The icicle, identified as a dense, hole-free structure, is strategically chosen to function as an intermediate shape for more intricate shape formation tasks. It is designed for easy exploration by a finite state agent, enabling the identification of tiles that can be lifted without breaking connectivity. Compared to the line shape, the icicle presents distinct advantages, including a reduced diameter and the presence of multiple removable tiles. We propose an algorithm that transforms an arbitrary initially connected tile structure into an icicle in $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ steps, matching the runtime of the line formation algorithm from prior work. Our theoretical contribution is accompanied by an extensive experimental analysis, indicating that our algorithm decreases the diameter of tile structures on average.</description>

      <title>Balanced Substructures in Bicolored Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An edge-colored graph is said to be balanced if it has an equal number of edges of each color. Given a graph $G$ whose edges are colored using two colors and a positive integer $k$, the objective in the Edge Balanced Connected Subgraph problem is to determine if $G$ has a balanced connected subgraph containing at least $k$ edges. We first show that this problem is NP-complete and remains so even if the solution is required to be a tree or a path. Then, we focus on the parameterized complexity of Edge Balanced Connected Subgraph and its variants (where the balanced subgraph is required to be a path/tree) with respect to $k$ as the parameter. Towards this, we show that if a graph has a balanced connected subgraph/tree/path of size at least $k$, then it has one of size at least $k$ and at most $f(k)$ where $f$ is a linear function. We use this result combined with dynamic programming algorithms based on color coding and representative sets to show that Edge Balanced Connected Subgraph and its variants are FPT. Further, using polynomial-time reductions to the Multilinear Monomial Detection problem, we give faster randomized FPT algorithms for the problems. In order to describe these reductions, we define a combinatorial object called relaxed-subgraph. We define this object in such a way that balanced connected subgraphs, trees and paths are relaxed-subgraphs with certain properties. This object is defined in the spirit of branching walks known for the Steiner Tree problem and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Modularity and partially observed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose that there is an unknown underlying graph $G$ on a large vertex set, and we can test only a proportion of the possible edges to check whether they are present in $G$. If $G$ has high modularity, is the observed graph $G'$ likely to have high modularity? We see that this is indeed the case under a mild condition, in a natural model where we test edges at random. We find that $q^*(G') \geq q^*(G)-\varepsilon$ with probability at least $1-\varepsilon$, as long as the expected number edges in $G'$ is large enough. Similarly, $q^*(G') \leq q^*(G)+\varepsilon$ with probability at least $1-\varepsilon$, under the stronger condition that the expected average degree in $G'$ is large enough. Further, under this stronger condition, finding a good partition for $G'$ helps us to find a good partition for $G$.
  We also consider the vertex sampling model for partially observing the underlying graph: we find that for dense underlying graphs we may estimate the modularity by sampling constantly many vertices and observing the corresponding induced subgraph, but this does not hold for underlying graphs with a subquadratic number of edges. Finally we deduce some related results, for example showing that under-sampling tends to lead to overestimation of modularity.</description>

      <title>Low Rank Matrix Completion via Robust Alternating Minimization in Nearly Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a matrix $M\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, the low rank matrix completion problem asks us to find a rank-$k$ approximation of $M$ as $UV^\top$ for $U\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times k}$ and $V\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times k}$ by only observing a few entries specified by a set of entries $\Omega\subseteq [m]\times [n]$. In particular, we examine an approach that is widely used in practice -- the alternating minimization framework. Jain, Netrapalli, and Sanghavi [JNS13] showed that if $M$ has incoherent rows and columns, then alternating minimization provably recovers the matrix $M$ by observing a nearly linear in $n$ number of entries. While the sample complexity has been subsequently improved [GLZ17], alternating minimization steps are required to be computed exactly. This hinders the development of more efficient algorithms and fails to depict the practical implementation of alternating minimization, where the updates are usually performed approximately in favor of efficiency.
  In this paper, we take a major step towards a more efficient and error-robust alternating minimization framework. To this end, we develop an analytical framework for alternating minimization that can tolerate a moderate amount of errors caused by approximate updates. Moreover, our algorithm runs in time $\widetilde O(|\Omega| k)$, which is nearly linear in the time to verify the solution while preserving the sample complexity. This improves upon all prior known alternating minimization approaches which require $\widetilde O(|\Omega| k^2)$ time.</description>

Abstract: Quantum span program algorithms for function evaluation sometimes have reduced query complexity when promised that the input has a certain structure. We design a modified span program algorithm to show these improvements persist even without a promise ahead of time, and we extend this approach to the more general problem of state conversion. As an application, we prove exponential and superpolynomial quantum advantages in average query complexity for several search problems, generalizing Montanaro's Search with Advice [Montanaro, TQC 2010].</description>

      <title>Two-sided Assortment Optimization: Adaptivity Gaps and Approximation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the challenge of choice congestion in matching markets, in this work, we introduce a two-sided assortment optimization framework under general choice preferences. The goal in this problem is to maximize the expected number of matches by deciding which assortments are displayed to the agents and the order in which they are shown. In this context, we identify several classes of policies that platforms can use in their design. Our goals are: (1) to measure the value that one class of policies has over another one, and (2) to approximately solve the optimization problem itself for a given class. For (1), we define the adaptivity gap as the worst-case ratio between the optimal values of two different policy classes. First, we show that the gap between the class of policies that statically show assortments to one-side first and the class of policies that adaptively show assortments to one-side first is exactly $1-1/e$. Second, we show that the gap between the latter class of policies and the fully adaptive class of policies that show assortments to agents one by one is exactly $1/2$. We also note that the worst policies are those who simultaneously show assortments to all the agents, in fact, we show that their adaptivity gap even with respect to one-sided static policies can be arbitrarily small. For (2), we first show that there exists a polynomial time policy that achieves a $1/4$ approximation factor within the class of policies that adaptively show assortments to agents one by one. Finally, when agents' preferences are governed by multinomial-logit models, we show that a 0.066 approximation factor can be obtained within the class of policies that show assortments to all agents at once.</description>
