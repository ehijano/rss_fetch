      <title>Evaluating Company-specific Biases in Financial Sentiment Analysis using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to evaluate the sentiment of financial texts using large language models~(LLMs) and to empirically determine whether LLMs exhibit company-specific biases in sentiment analysis. Specifically, we examine the impact of general knowledge about firms on the sentiment measurement of texts by LLMs. Firstly, we compare the sentiment scores of financial texts by LLMs when the company name is explicitly included in the prompt versus when it is not. We define and quantify company-specific bias as the difference between these scores. Next, we construct an economic model to theoretically evaluate the impact of sentiment bias on investor behavior. This model helps us understand how biased LLM investments, when widespread, can distort stock prices. This implies the potential impact on stock prices if investments driven by biased LLMs become dominant in the future. Finally, we conduct an empirical analysis using Japanese financial text data to examine the relationship between firm-specific sentiment bias, corporate characteristics, and stock performance.</description>

      <title>Simulate and Optimise: A two-layer mortgage simulator for designing novel mortgage assistance products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel two-layer approach for optimising mortgage relief products through a simulated multi-agent mortgage environment. While the approach is generic, here the environment is calibrated to the US mortgage market based on publicly available census data and regulatory guidelines. Through the simulation layer, we assess the resilience of households to exogenous income shocks, while the optimisation layer explores strategies to improve the robustness of households to these shocks by making novel mortgage assistance products available to households. Households in the simulation are adaptive, learning to make mortgage-related decisions (such as product enrolment or strategic foreclosures) that maximize their utility, balancing their available liquidity and equity. We show how this novel two-layer simulation approach can successfully design novel mortgage assistance products to improve household resilience to exogenous shocks, and balance the costs of providing such products through post-hoc analysis. Previously, such analysis could only be conducted through expensive pilot studies involving real participants, demonstrating the benefit of the approach for designing and evaluating financial products.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time q-learning for mean-field control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16208v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the q-learning, recently coined as the continuous time counterpart of Q-learning by Jia and Zhou (2023), for continuous time Mckean-Vlasov control problems in the setting of entropy-regularized reinforcement learning. In contrast to the single agent's control problem in Jia and Zhou (2023), the mean-field interaction of agents renders the definition of the q-function more subtle, for which we reveal that two distinct q-functions naturally arise: (i) the integrated q-function (denoted by $q$) as the first-order approximation of the integrated Q-function introduced in Gu, Guo, Wei and Xu (2023), which can be learnt by a weak martingale condition involving test policies; and (ii) the essential q-function (denoted by $q_e$) that is employed in the policy improvement iterations. We show that two q-functions are related via an integral representation under all test policies. Based on the weak martingale condition and our proposed searching method of test policies, some model-free learning algorithms are devised. In two examples, one in LQ control framework and one beyond LQ control framework, we can obtain the exact parameterization of the optimal value function and q-functions and illustrate our algorithms with simulation experiments.</description>
