      <title>Demystifying the oracle: A "20 Questions" game to promote AI ethics and literacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Generative AI becomes a key component in physics education, a significant ethical challenge has emerged: the tendency of students to anthropomorphize Large Language Models (LLMs), treating them as authoritative "oracles" that retrieve fixed facts from an internal database. However, LLMs operate fundamentally as probabilistic engines. This paper describes the design and implementation of a didactic activity, a reduced version of the "20 Questions" game, aimed at making this stochastic nature directly observable. Unlike a human player who fixes a target object at the start of the game, students discover that the model generates answers based solely on local coherence with the interaction history. By utilizing functionalities such as re-sampling and history rewinding, students act as experimenters, observing how identical interaction histories can yield diverging narrative paths. We discuss how mapping these behaviors to familiar physics concepts provides the epistemic scaffolding necessary to promote informed skepticism, framing the verification of AI outputs not merely as a compliance rule, but as a technical necessity derived from the system's probabilistic nature.</description>

      <title>From Block Diagrams to Bloch Spheres: Graphical Quantum Circuit Simulation in LabVIEW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing transitions from theoretical physics to engineering applications, there is a growing need for accessible simulation tools that bridge the gap between abstract linear algebra and practical implementation. While text-based frameworks (like Qiskit or Cirq) are standard, they often present a steep learning curve for students and engineers accustomed to graphical system design. This paper introduces QuVI (Quantum Virtual Instrument), an open-source quantum circuit toolkit developed natively within the NI LabVIEW environment. Moving beyond initial proof-of-concept models, QuVI establishes a robust framework that leverages LabVIEW's "dataflow" paradigm-where wires represent data and nodes represent operations-to provide an intuitive, visual analog to standard quantum circuit notation while enabling the seamless integration of classical control structures like loops and conditionals. The toolkit's capabilities are demonstrated through the construction and visualization of fundamental quantum algorithms, verifying results against theoretical predictions. By translating "Block Diagrams" directly into quantum state evolutions ("Bloch Spheres"), QuVI offers educators and researchers a powerful platform for prototyping quantum logic without leaving the graphical engineering workspace.</description>

      <title>Where's the Line? A Classroom Activity on Ethical and Constructive Use of Generative AI in Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI tools like ChatGPT are rapidly reshaping how students and instructors engage with course material -- and how they think about academic integrity. This paper presents a classroom activity designed to help physics students critically examine the ethical and educational implications of using AI in coursework. Through a structured sequence of scenario analysis, boundary-setting, and reflective discussion, with optional individual policy writing, students develop the metacognitive, ethical, and collaborative capacities needed to navigate emerging technologies thoughtfully and responsibly. Grounded in research on social constructivist learning, metacognition, and ethics education, the activity positions students as co-creators of an engaged and reflective learning environment.</description>
