      <title>On the Exponential Stability of Koopman Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman Model Predictive Control (MPC) uses a lifted linear predictor to efficiently handle constrained nonlinear systems. While constraint satisfaction and (practical) asymptotic stability have been studied, explicit guarantees of local exponential stability seem to be missing. This paper revisits the exponential stability for Koopman MPC. We first analyze a Koopman LQR problem and show that 1) with zero modeling error, the lifted LQR policy is globally optimal and globally asymptotically stabilizes the nonlinear plant, and 2) with the lifting function and one-step prediction error both Lipschitz at the origin, the closed-loop system is locally exponentially stable. These results facilitate terminal cost/set design in the lifted Koopman space. Leveraging linear-MPC properties (boundedness, value decrease, recursive feasibility), we then prove local exponential stability for a stabilizing Koopman MPC under the same conditions as Koopman LQR. Experiments on an inverted pendulum show better convergence performance and lower accumulated cost than the traditional Taylor-linearized MPC approaches.</description>

      <title>Tight Lower Bounds for the Bit and Inner Product Oracle for Constrained Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new lower-bounds for the information complexity of mixed-integer convex optimization under two "bit-wise" oracles.
  The first oracle provides bits of first-order information in the standard
  coordinate model, and the second oracle answers whether the inner product of a specified vector with the gradient of the function at a point or
  the normal vector of a separating hyperplane for the feasible region is
  positive or non-positive, thus also providing one bit of first-order information. The new contribution is that under such oracles, the complexity is quadratic in the number of continuous decision variables, which
  was not known before even for continuous convex optimization. These
  new lower-bounds are tight (up to a logarithmic term), matched by a
  natural discretization of standard cutting-plane methods for convex optimization. These reveal that using a standard bit-representation of the
  first-order information is, in general, the best one can do with respect
  to the number of bits of information needed to solve constrained convex
  optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Discrete and Continuous Action Spaces in Reservoir Management and Inventory Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of discrete and continuous action spaces within the contexts of reservoir management and inventory control problems. We explore the computational trade-offs between discrete action discretizations and continuous action settings, focusing on their effects on time complexity and space requirements across different horizons. Our analysis includes a detailed evaluation of discretization levels in reservoir management, highlighting that finer discretizations approach the performance of continuous actions but at increased computational costs. For inventory control, we investigate deterministic and stochastic demand scenarios, demonstrating the exponential growth in time and space with increasing discrete actions and inventory items. We also introduce a novel symbolic approach for solving continuous problems in hybrid MDPs (H-MDPs), utilizing a new XADD data structure to manage piecewise symbolic value functions. Our results underscore the challenges of scaling solutions and provide insights into efficient handling of discrete and continuous action spaces in complex decision problems. Future research directions include exploring heuristic search methods and improved approximations for enhancing the practicality of exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantification of Time-Series Prediction Error: Optimal Selection Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty is almost ubiquitous in safety-critical autonomous systems due to dynamic environments and the integration of learning-based components. Quantifying this uncertainty--particularly for time-series predictions in multi-stage optimization--is essential for safe control and verification tasks. Conformal Prediction (CP) is a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool with rigorous finite-sample guarantees, but its performance relies on the design of the nonconformity measure, which remains challenging for time-series data. Existing methods either overfit on small datasets, or are computationally intensive on long-time-horizon problems and/or large datasets. To overcome these issues, we propose a new parameterization of the score functions and formulate an optimization program to compute the associated parameters. The optimal parameters directly lead to norm-ball regions that constitute minimal-average-radius conformal sets. We then provide a reformulation of the underlying optimization program to enable faster computation. We provide theoretical proofs on both the validity and efficiency of predictors constructed based on the proposed approach. Numerical results on various case studies demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency, with much lower computational requirements.</description>

      <title>Representability of forests via generalized subtour elimination constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized subtour elimination constraints (GSECs) are widely used in state-of-the-art exact algorithms for vehicle routing and network design problems, as their right-hand sides often capture problem-specific feasibility conditions of each solution component. In this work, we present the first characterization of the families of forests that can be represented as the integer points inside a polytope defined by GSECs. This result generalizes a recent framework developed for vehicle routing problems under uncertainty and broadens the applicability of GSEC-based formulations to a wider class of combinatorial problems. In particular, using our characterization, we recover vehicle routing formulations that could not be obtained with previous results. Additionally, we show that GSECs can naturally model a robust variant of the capacitated minimum spanning tree problem.</description>

      <title>Asset-liability management with Epstein-Zin utility$\quad$ under stochastic interest rate and unknown market price of risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a stochastic control problem with Epstein-Zin recursive utility under partial information (unknown market price of risk), in which an investor is constrained to a liability at the end of the investment period. Introducing liabilities is the main novelty of the model and appears for the first time in the literature of recursive utilities. Such constraint leads to a fully coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE), which well-posedness has not been addressed in the literature. We derive an explicit solution to the FBSDE, contrasting with the existence and uniqueness results with no explicit expression of the solutions typically found in most related literature. Moreover, under minimal additional assumptions, we obtain the Malliavin differentiability of the solution of the FBSDE. We solve the problem completely and find the expression of the controls and the value function. Finally, we determine the utility loss that investors suffer from ignoring the fact that they can learn about the market price of risk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the control properties of heat equations with memory terms. We recall previous results showing that if the moving support of the control covers the whole domain where heat diffuses, the system is null controllable when the memory kernel is polynomial. We formulate the problem of extending this result to the case of some more general memory kernels, in particular analytic ones.</description>

      <title>Relationships Between the Maximum Principle and Dynamic Programming for Infinite Dimensional Non-Markovian Stochastic Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Pontryagin's maximum principle and dynamic programming principle in the context of stochastic optimal control systems governed by stochastic evolution equations with random coefficients in separable Hilbert spaces. Our investigation proceeds through three contributions: (1). We first establish the formulation of the dynamic programming principle for this class of infinite-dimensional stochastic systems, subsequently deriving the associated stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations that characterize the value function's evolution. (2). For systems with smooth value functions, we develop explicit correspondence relationships between Pontryagin's maximum principle and dynamic programming principle, elucidating their fundamental connections through precise mathematical characterizations. (3). In the more challenging non-smooth case, we employ tools in nonsmooth analysis and relaxed transposition solution techniques to uncover previously unknown sample-wise relationships between the two principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present some hardness results on finding the optimal policy for the static formulation of distributionally robust Markov decision processes. We construct problem instances such that when the considered policy class is Markovian and non-randomized, finding the optimal policy is NP-hard, and when the considered policy class is Markovian and randomized, the robust value function possesses sub-optimal strict local minima. The considered hard instances involve an ambiguity set with only two transition kernels.</description>

      <title>Radon random sampling and reconstruction in local shift-invariant signal space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the problem of reconstruction from Radon random samples in local shift-invariant signal space. Different from sampling after Radon transform, we consider sampling before Radon transform, where the sample set is randomly selected from a square domain with a general probability distribution. First, we prove that the sampling set is stable with high probability under a sufficiently large sample size. Second, we address the problem of signal reconstruction in two-dimensional computed tomography. We demonstrate that the sample values used for this reconstruction process can be determined completely from its Radon transform data. Consequently, we develop an explicit formula to reconstruct the signal using Radon random samples.</description>

      <title>Distributed Nonconvex Optimization with Double Privacy Protection and Exact Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the pervasive lack of privacy protection in existing distributed nonconvex optimization methods, this paper proposes a decentralized proximal primal-dual algorithm enabling double protection of privacy ($\text{DPP}^2$) for minimizing nonconvex sum-utility functions over multi-agent networks, which ensures zero leakage of critical local information during inter-agent communications. We develop a two-tier privacy protection mechanism that first merges the primal and dual variables by means of a variable transformation, followed by embedding an additional random perturbation to further obfuscate the transmitted information. We theoretically establish that $\text{DPP}^2$ ensures differential privacy for local objectives while achieving exact convergence under nonconvex settings. Specifically, $\text{DPP}^2$ converges sublinearly to a stationary point and attains a linear convergence rate under the additional Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P-{\L}) condition. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates the superiority of $\text{DPP}^2$ over a number of state-of-the-art algorithms, showcasing the faster, exact convergence achieved by $\text{DPP}^2$ under the same level of differential privacy.</description>

      <title>Fiedler-Based Characterization and Identification of Leaders in Semi-Autonomous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02317v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of identifying leader nodes in semi-autonomous consensus networks from observed agent dynamics. Using the grounded Laplacian formulation, we derive spectral conditions that ensure the components of the Fiedler vector associated with leader and follower nodes are distinct. Building on the foundation, we emply the notion of relative tempo from prio works as an observable quantity that relates agents' steady-state velocities to the Fiedler vector. This relationship enables the development of a data-driven algorithm that reconstructs the Fiedler vector - and consequently identifies the leader set - using only steady-state velocity measurements, without requiring knowledge of the network topology. The proposed approach is validated through nuerical examples, demonstrating how spectral properties and relative tempo measurements can be combined to reveal hidden leadership structures in consensus networks.</description>

      <title>An LLM-powered MILP modelling engine for workforce scheduling guided by expert knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formulating mathematical models from real-world decision problems is a core task in Operational Research, yet it typically requires considerable human expertise and effort, limiting practical application. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked interest in automating this process from natural language descriptions. However, challenges including limited modelling expertise, dependence on large-scale training data, and hallucination affect the reliable application of LLMs in optimisation modelling. To address these challenges, we propose SMILO, an expert-knowledge-driven framework that integrates optimisation modelling expertise with LLMs to generate mixed-integer linear programming models. SMILO uses a three-stage architecture built on reusable modelling graphs and associated resources: identifying relevant modelling components, extracting instance-specific information using LLMs, and constructing models through expert-defined templates. This modular architecture separates information extraction from formula generation, enhancing modelling accuracy, transparency, and reproducibility. We demonstrate the implementation of our modelling framework using workforce scheduling problems spanning manufacturing, logistic, and service operations as illustrative cases. Experiments show that SMILO consistently generates correct models in 90% of test instances across five trials, outperforming one-step LLM baselines by at least 35%. This work offers a generalisable paradigm for integrating LLMs with expert knowledge across diverse decision-making contexts, advancing automation in optimisation modelling.</description>

      <title>Terminal Control Area Capacity Estimation Model Incorporating Structural Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous growth in global air traffic demand highlights the need to accurately estimate airspace capacity for efficiently using limited resources in air traffic management (ATM) systems. Although previous studies focused on either sector capacity based on air traffic controllers (ATCo) workload or runway throughput, studies on the unique structural and functional characteristics of terminal control area (TMA) remain lacking. In this study, capacity is defined as the maximum occupancy count. Further, a TMA capacity estimation model grounded in structural space conceptually defined as the space formed by instrument flight procedures and traffic characteristics is developed. Capacity is estimated from the temporal flight distance, which represents the physical length of arrival paths converted to flight time, and the average time separation at the runway threshold considering traffic proportions and aircraft mix. The proposed model is applied to the Jeju International Airport TMA (RWY 07/25) using one year of ADS-B trajectory data. The estimated capacities are 9.3 (RWY 07) and 6.9 (RWY 25) aircraft, and the differences are attributed to the temporal flight distance. Sensitivity analysis shows that capacity is shaped by aircraft speed and air traffic control (ATC) separations, which implies that operational measures such as speed restrictions or adjusted separations effectively enhance capacity even within physically constrained TMA. The model offers a practical, transparent, and quantitative framework for TMA capacity assessment and operational design.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Optimality Conditions for Nonsmooth Constrained Optimization with Applications to Bilevel Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order optimality conditions are essential for nonsmooth optimization, where both the objective and constraint functions are Lipschitz continuous and second-order directionally differentiable. This paper provides no-gap second-order necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for such problems without requiring convexity assumptions on the constraint set. We introduce the concept of second-order gph-regularity for constraint functions, which ensures the outer second-order regularity of the feasible region and enables the formulation of comprehensive optimality conditions through the parabolic curve approach. An important application of our results is bilevel optimization, where we derive second-order necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for bi-local optimal solutions, which are based on the local solutions of the lower-level problem. By leveraging the Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification (MFCQ), strong second-order sufficient condition (SSOSC) and constant rank constraint qualification (CRCQ) of lower-level problem, these second-order conditions are derived without requiring the uniqueness of the lower-level multipliers. In addition, if the linear independence constraint qualification (LICQ) holds, these conditions are expressed solely in terms of the second-order derivatives of the functions defining the bilevel problem, without relying on the second-order information from the solution mapping, which would introduce implicit complexities.</description>

      <title>Non-Locally Controllable but Trackable Magnetic Head Flagellated Swimmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike macroscopic swimmers, microswimmers operate in a low-Reynolds-number regime dominated by viscous forces. This paper investigates the controllability of a magnetic microswimmer composed of a spherical magnetic head and an elastic, non-magnetic flagellum. The swimmer evolves in a Stokes flow and is modeled using the resistive force theory. We prove that, under planar motion, the system is not small-time locally controllable and numerically identify regions that remain inaccessible. Nevertheless, simulations show that trajectory tracking can still be achieved via Bayesian optimization, though it requires large-amplitude transverse deformations.</description>

      <title>Influence Diagrams for Robust Multi-Target Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Target Tracking (MTT) is foundational for radar, defense, and autonomous systems, where tracking accuracy directly affects decision-making and safety. For linear systems with Gaussian process and measurement noise, the Kalman filter remains the gold standard for state estimation. However, its performance can degrade in real-world scenarios where measurement noise is temporally correlated. This violates the white-noise assumptions that Kalman filters have. Various approaches include state augmentation of the Kalman filter, but this approach is susceptible to failure due to ill-conditioned problem formulations. This work investigates the limitations of classical Kalman filtering in colored noise environments and presents an influence diagram-based approach to the Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter (JPDAF). Simulation results on benchmark scenarios demonstrate that the Influence Diagram JPDAF (ID-JPDAF) achieves lower root mean square error (RMSE) than classical methods. These findings highlight the potential of influence diagram models for advancing multi-target tracking performance in radar and related applications.</description>

      <title>Towards grid-aware multi-period flexibility aggregation - A constrained zonotope approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregation schemes provide a means to reduce the computational complexity of power system operation by reducing the number of devices that are considered individually. This can be achieved with tools of computational geometry, where the feasible set is projected onto the decision variables of the point of interconnection. Set projection is computationally expensive, especially in the context of multi-period power system operation. Hence this calls for efficiency improvements via structure exploitation of certain set representations, such as constrained zonotopes. This paper proposes these benefits for efficient flexibility aggregation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on a 15-bus distribution grid with time-dependent elements for up to 96 timesteps. The results suggest that the presented method significantly improves computation times.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Bayesian Networks for Estimating Stiff Continuous-Discrete Stochastic Systems with Ill-Conditioned Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Gaussian Bayesian Network-based Extended Kalman Filter (GBN-EKF) for non-linear state estimators on stiff and ill-conditioned continuous-discrete stochastic systems, with a further analysis on systems with ill-conditioned measurements. For most nonlinear systems, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and the Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) typically outperform the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). But, in state estimation of stochastic systems, the EKF outperforms the CKF and UKF. This paper aims to extend the advantages of the EKF by applying a Gaussian Bayesian Network approach to the EKF (GBN-EKF), and analyzing its performance against all three filters. The GBN-EKF does not utilize any matrix inversions. This makes the GBN-EKF stable with respect to ill-conditioned matrices. Further, the GBN-EKF achieves comparable accuracy to the EKF in stiff and ill-conditioned stochastic systems, while having lower root mean squared error (RMSE) under these conditions.</description>

      <title>An accelerated primal-dual flow for linearly constrained multiobjective optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02751v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a continuous-time primal-dual approach for linearly constrained multiobjective optimization problems. A novel dynamical model, called accelerated multiobjective primal-dual flow, is presented with a second-order equation for the primal variable and a first-order equation for the dual variable. It can be viewed as an extension of the accelerated primal-dual flow by Luo [arXiv:2109.12604, 2021] for the single objective case. To facilitate the convergence rate analysis, we introduce a new merit function, which motivates the use of the feasibility violation and the objective gap to measure the weakly Pareto optimality. By using a proper Lyapunov function, we establish the exponential decay rate in the continuous level. After that, we consider an implicit-explicit scheme, which yields an accelerated multiobjective primal-dual method with a quadratic subproblem, and prove the sublinear rates of the feasibility violation and the objective gap, under the convex case and the strongly convex case, respectively. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Fortifying Distribution Network Nodes Subject to Network-Based Disruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a distribution network for delivering a natural resource or physical good to a set of nodes, each of which serves a set of customers, in which disruptions may occur at one or more nodes. Each node receives flow through a path from a source node, implying that the service at a node is interrupted if one or more nodes on the path from a source node experience a disruption. All network nodes are vulnerable to a future disturbance due to a potential natural or man-made disaster, the severity of which follows some measurable probability distribution. For each node in the network, we wish to determine a fortification level that enables the node to withstand a disturbance up to a given severity level, while minimizing the expected number of customers who experience a service interruption under a limited fortification budget. We formulate this problem as a continuous, nonlinear knapsack problem with precedence constraints, demonstrate that this optimization problem is $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard for general tree networks and general disturbance severity distributions, and provide a polynomial-time solution algorithm for serial systems, which forms the basis for an effective heuristic approach to problems on tree networks. Our computational test results demonstrate the ability of the proposed heuristic methods to quickly find near-optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Frank-Wolfe Algorithms: Complementarity Conditions and Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop new accelerated first-order algorithms in the Frank-Wolfe (FW) family for minimizing smooth convex functions over compact convex sets, with a focus on two prominent constraint classes: (1) polytopes and (2) matrix domains given by the spectrahedron and the unit nuclear-norm ball. A key technical ingredient is a complementarity condition that captures solution sparsity -- face dimension for polytopes and rank for matrices. We present two algorithms: (1) a purely linear optimization oracle (LOO) method for polytopes that has optimal worst-case first-order (FO) oracle complexity and, aside of a finite \emph{burn-in} phase and up to a logarithmic factor, has LOO complexity that scales with $r/\sqrt{\epsilon}$, where $\epsilon$ is the target accuracy and $r$ is the solution sparsity $r$ (independently of the ambient dimension), and (2) a hybrid scheme that combines FW with a sparse projection oracle (e.g., low-rank SVDs for matrix domains with low-rank solutions), which also has optimal FO oracle complexity, and after a finite burn-in phase, only requires $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ sparse projections and LOO calls (independently of both the ambient dimension and the rank of optimal solutions). Our results close a gap on how to accelerate recent advancements in linearly-converging FW algorithms for strongly convex optimization, without paying the price of the dimension.</description>

      <title>Overprocurement of balancing capacity may increase the welfare in the cross-zonal energy-reserve coallocation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the traded energy and reserve products between zones are co-allocated to optimize the infrastructure usage, both deterministic and stochastic flows have to be accounted for on interconnector lines. We focus on allocation models, which guarantee deliverability in the context of the portfolio bidding European day-ahead market framework, assuming a flow-based description of network constraints. In such models, as each unit of allocated reserve supply implies additional cost, it is straightforward to assume that the amount of allocated reserve is equal to the accepted reserve demand quantity. However, as it is illustrated by the proposed work, overprocurement of reserves may imply counterintuitive benefits. Reserve supplies not used for balancing may be used for congestion management, thus allowing valuable additional flows in the network.</description>

      <title>Geometric Data Valuation via Leverage Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shapley data valuation provides a principled, axiomatic framework for assigning importance to individual datapoints, and has gained traction in dataset curation, pruning, and pricing. However, it is a combinatorial measure that requires evaluating marginal utility across all subsets of the data, making it computationally infeasible at scale. We propose a geometric alternative based on statistical leverage scores, which quantify each datapoint's structural influence in the representation space by measuring how much it extends the span of the dataset and contributes to the effective dimensionality of the training problem. We show that our scores satisfy the dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms of Shapley valuation and that extending them to \emph{ridge leverage scores} yields strictly positive marginal gains that connect naturally to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria. We further show that training on a leverage-sampled subset produces a model whose parameters and predictive risk are within $O(\varepsilon)$ of the full-data optimum, thereby providing a rigorous link between data valuation and downstream decision quality. Finally, we conduct an active learning experiment in which we empirically demonstrate that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms standard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control with Multiple Constraint Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose a Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation that splits constraints in two different types. Motivated by safety considerations, the first type of constraint enforces a control-invariant set, while the second type could represent a less restrictive constraint on the system state. This distinction enables closed-loop sub- optimality results for nonlinear MPC with heterogeneous state constraints (distinct constraints across open loop predicted states), and no terminal elements. Removing the non-invariant constraint recovers the partially constrained case. Beyond its theoretical interest, heterogeneous constrained MPC shows how constraint choices shape the system's closed loop. In the partially constrained case, adjusting the constraint horizon (how many predicted- state constraints are enforced) trades estimation accuracy for computational cost. Our analysis yields first, a sub- optimality upper-bound accounting for distinct constraint sets, their horizons and decay rates, that is tighter for short horizons than prior work. Second, to our knowledge, we give the first lower bound (beyond open-loop cost) on closed-loop sub-optimality. Together these bounds provide a powerful analysis framework, allowing designers to evaluate the effect of horizons in MPC sub-optimality. We demonstrate our results via simulations on nonlinear and linear safety-critical systems.</description>

      <title>Variance-Aware Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variance-dependent regret bounds have received increasing attention in recent studies on contextual bandits. However, most of these studies are focused on upper confidence bound (UCB)-based bandit algorithms, while sampling based bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling are still understudied. The only exception is the LinVDTS algorithm (Xu et al., 2023), which is limited to linear reward function and its regret bound is not optimal with respect to the model dimension. In this paper, we present FGTSVA, a variance-aware Thompson Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with general reward function with optimal regret bound. At the core of our analysis is an extension of the decoupling coefficient, a technique commonly used in the analysis of Feel-good Thompson sampling (FGTS) that reflects the complexity of the model space. With the new decoupling coefficient denoted by $\mathrm{dc}$, FGTS-VA achieves the regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$, where $|\mathcal{F}|$ is the size of the model space, $T$ is the total number of rounds, and $\sigma_t^2$ is the subgaussian norm of the noise (e.g., variance when the noise is Gaussian) at round $t$. In the setting of contextual linear bandits, the regret bound of FGTSVA matches that of UCB-based algorithms using weighted linear regression (Zhou and Gu, 2022).</description>

      <title>A Joint Variational Framework for Multimodal X-ray Ptychography and Fluorescence Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering high-resolution structural and compositional information from coherent X-ray measurements involves solving coupled, nonlinear, and ill-posed inverse problems. Ptychography reconstructs a complex transmission function from overlapping diffraction patterns, while X-ray fluorescence provides quantitative, element-specific contrast at lower spatial resolution. We formulate a joint variational framework that integrates these two modalities into a single nonlinear least-squares problem with shared spatial variables. This formulation enforces cross-modal consistency between structural and compositional estimates, improving conditioning and promoting stable convergence. The resulting optimization couples complementary contrast mechanisms (i.e., phase and absorption from ptychography, elemental composition from fluorescence) within a unified inverse model. Numerical experiments on simulated data demonstrate that the joint reconstruction achieves faster convergence, sharper and more quantitative reconstructions, and lower relative error compared with separate inversions. The proposed approach illustrates how multimodal variational formulations can enhance stability, resolution, and interpretability in computational X-ray imaging.</description>

      <title>Near Optimal Convergence to Coarse Correlated Equilibrium in General-Sum Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: No-regret learning dynamics play a central role in game theory, enabling decentralized convergence to equilibrium for concepts such as Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE) or Correlated Equilibrium (CE). In this work, we improve the convergence rate to CCE in general-sum Markov games, reducing it from the previously best-known rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log^5 T / T)$ to a sharper $\mathcal{O}(\log T / T)$. This matches the best known convergence rate for CE in terms of $T$, number of iterations, while also improving the dependence on the action set size from polynomial to polylogarithmic-yielding exponential gains in high-dimensional settings. Our approach builds on recent advances in adaptive step-size techniques for no-regret algorithms in normal-form games, and extends them to the Markovian setting via a stage-wise scheme that adjusts learning rates based on real-time feedback. We frame policy updates as an instance of Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL), customized for value-iteration-based learning. The resulting self-play algorithm achieves, to our knowledge, the fastest known convergence rate to CCE in Markov games.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Fidelity Global Search Framework for Hotspot Prevention in 3D Thermal Design Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a B\'ezier-based Multi-Fidelity Thermal Optimization Framework, which is a computationally efficient methodology for the global optimization of 3D heat sinks. The flexible B\'ezier-parameterized fin geometries and the adopted multi-fidelity pseudo-3D thermal modeling strategy meet at a balance between accuracy and computational cost. In this method, the smooth and compact B\'ezier representation of fins defines the design space from which diverse topologies can be generated with minimal design variables. A global optimizer, the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, minimizes the pressure drop with respect to a given surface-average temperature constraint to achieve improvement in the pressure loss. In the framework, the pseudo-3D model couples two thermally interacting 2D layers: a thermofluid layer representing the fluid domain passing through the fins, and a conductive base plate representing the surface where excessive average temperature is to be avoided. Both layers are coupled with calibrated heat transfer coefficients obtained from high-fidelity 3D simulations. For several fin geometries, the proposed framework has been validated by comparing the pseudo-3D results with those of full 3D simulations, which yielded good agreement in terms of temperature distribution and pressure drops when the computational cost was reduced by several orders of magnitude. Optimization results show that it attains up to 50\% pressure loss reduction compared to conventional straight-fin configurations, and it reveals a clear trade-off between thermal performance and hydraulic efficiency. Thus, the proposed method forms a new basis for fast, geometry-flexible, and optimized heat sink design, enabling efficient exploration of complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Variation Online Adaptivity for Accelerated Optimization with H\"older Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smoothness is known to be crucial for acceleration in offline optimization, and for gradient-variation regret minimization in online learning. Interestingly, these two problems are actually closely connected -- accelerated optimization can be understood through the lens of gradient-variation online learning. In this paper, we investigate online learning with H\"older smooth functions, a general class encompassing both smooth and non-smooth (Lipschitz) functions, and explore its implications for offline optimization. For (strongly) convex online functions, we design the corresponding gradient-variation online learning algorithm whose regret smoothly interpolates between the optimal guarantees in smooth and non-smooth regimes. Notably, our algorithms do not require prior knowledge of the H\"older smoothness parameter, exhibiting strong adaptivity over existing methods. Through online-to-batch conversion, this gradient-variation online adaptivity yields an optimal universal method for stochastic convex optimization under H\"older smoothness. However, achieving universality in offline strongly convex optimization is more challenging. We address this by integrating online adaptivity with a detection-based guess-and-check procedure, which, for the first time, yields a universal offline method that achieves accelerated convergence in the smooth regime while maintaining near-optimal convergence in the non-smooth one.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Circuits and Neural Networks for Regular Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that there exist uniform $(+,\times,/)$-circuits of size $O(n^3)$ to compute the basis generating polynomial of regular matroids on $n$ elements. By tropicalization, this implies that there exist uniform $(\max,+,-)$-circuits and ReLU neural networks of the same size for weighted basis maximization of regular matroids. As a consequence in linear programming theory, we obtain a first example where taking the difference of two extended formulations can be more efficient than the best known individual extended formulation of size $O(n^6)$ by Aprile and Fiorini. Such differences have recently been introduced as virtual extended formulations. The proof of our main result relies on a fine-tuned version of Seymour's decomposition of regular matroids which allows us to identify and maintain graphic substructures to which we can apply a local version of the star-mesh transformation.</description>

      <title>Biomolecular LQR under Partial Observation</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces a biomolecular Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to investigate the design principles of gene regulatory networks. We show that for fundamental gene regulation network, the bio-controller derived from LQR theory precisely recapitulate natural network motifs, such as auto-regulation and incoherent feedforward loops. This emulation arises from a fundamental principle: the LQR cost function mathematically encodes environmental survival demands, which subsequently drives the selection of both network topology and biochemical parameters. Our work thus establishes a theoretical basis for interpreting biological circuit design, directly linking evolutionary pressures to observable regulatory structures.</description>

      <title>Explicit MPC for the constrained zonotope case with low-rank matrix updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving the explicit Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem requires enumerating all critical regions and their associated feedback laws, a task that scales exponentially with the system dimension and the prediction horizon, as well. When the problem's constraints are boxes or zonotopes, the feasible domain admits a compact constrained-zonotope representation. Building on this insight, we exploit the geometric properties of the equivalent constrained-zonotope reformulation to accelerate the computation of the explicit solution. Specifically, we formulate the multi-parametric problem in the lifted generator space and solve it using second-order optimality conditions, employ low-rank matrix updates to reduce computation time, and introduce an analytic enumeration of candidate active sets that yields the explicit solution in tree form.</description>

      <title>ConMeZO: Adaptive Descent-Direction Sampling for Gradient-Free Finetuning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zeroth-order or derivative-free optimization (MeZO) is an attractive strategy for finetuning large language models (LLMs) because it eliminates the memory overhead of backpropagation. However, it converges slowly due to the inherent curse of dimensionality when searching for descent directions in the high-dimensional parameter space of billion-scale LLMs. We propose ConMeZO, a novel zeroth-order optimizer that accelerates convergence by adaptive directional sampling. Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random, ConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate. This concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more likely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that ConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO. Empirically, when finetuning LLMs on natural language tasks, ConMeZO is up to 2X faster than MeZO while retaining the low-memory footprint of zeroth-order methods.</description>

      <title>On Linear Quadratic Potential Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13476v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our paper addresses characterizing conditions for a linear quadratic (LQ) game to be a potential game. The desired properties of potential games in finite action settings, such as convergence of learning dynamics to Nash equilibria, and the challenges of learning Nash equilibria in continuous state and action settings motivate us to characterize LQ potential games. Our first contribution is to show that the set of LQ games with full-state feedback that are potential games is very limited, essentially differing only slightly from an identical interest game. Given this finding, we restrict the class of LQ games to those with decoupled dynamics and decoupled state information structure. For this subclass, we show that the set of potential games strictly includes non-identical interest games and characterize conditions for the LQ games in this subclass to be potential. We further derive their corresponding potential function and prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium. Meanwhile, we highlight the challenges in the characterization and computation of Nash equilibrium for this class of potential LQ games.</description>

Abstract: We develop a new method called affine facial reduction (FR) for recovering Slater's condition for semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations of combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. Affine FR is a user-friendly method, as it is fully automatic and only requires a description of the problem. We provide a rigorous analysis of differences between affine FR and the existing methods. We also present numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of affine FR in reducing the size of SDP relaxations for CO problems.</description>

      <title>A Re-solving Heuristic for Dynamic Assortment Optimization with Knapsack Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a multi-stage dynamic assortment optimization problem with multi-nomial choice modeling (MNL) under resource knapsack constraints. Given the current resource inventory levels, the retailer makes an assortment decision at each period, and the goal of the retailer is to maximize the total profit from purchases. With the exact optimal dynamic assortment solution being computationally intractable, a practical strategy is to adopt the re-solving technique that periodically re-optimizes deterministic linear programs (LP) arising from fluid approximation. However, the fractional structure of MNL makes the fluid approximation in assortment optimization non-linear, which brings new technical challenges. To address this challenge, we propose a new epoch-based re-solving algorithm that effectively transforms the denominator of the objective into the constraint, so that the re-solving technique is applied to a linear program with additional slack variables amenable to practical computations and theoretical analysis. Theoretically, we prove that the regret (i.e., the gap between the resolving policy and the optimal objective of the fluid approximation) scales logarithmically with the length of time horizon and resource capacities.</description>

      <title>Application of the Lov\'asz-Schrijver Lift-and-Project Operator to Compact Stable Set Integer Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lov\'asz theta function $\theta(G)$ provides a very good upper bound on the stability number of a graph $G$. It can be computed in polynomial time by solving a semidefinite program (SDP), which also turns out to be fairly tractable in practice. Consequently, $\theta(G)$ achieves a hard-to-beat trade-off between computational effort and strength of the bound. Indeed, several attempts to improve the theta bound are documented, mainly based on playing around the application of the $N_+(\cdot)$ lifting operator of Lov\'asz and Schrijver to the classical formulation of the maximum stable set problem. Experience shows that solving such SDP-s often struggles against practical intractability and requires highly specialized methods. We investigate the application of such an operator to two different linear formulations based on clique and nodal inequalities, respectively. Fewer inequalities describe these two and yet guarantee that the resulting SDP bound is at least as strong as $\theta(G)$. Our computational experience, including larger graphs than those previously documented, shows that upper bounds stronger than $\theta(G)$ can be accessed by a reasonable additional effort using the clique-based formulation on sparse graphs and the nodal-based one on dense graphs.</description>

      <title>Alternating Gradient-Type Algorithm for Bilevel Optimization with Inexact Lower-Level Solutions via Moreau Envelope-based Reformulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of bilevel optimization problems where the lower-level problem is a convex composite optimization model, which arises in various applications, including bilevel hyperparameter selection for regularized regression models. To solve these problems, we propose an Alternating Gradient-type algorithm with Inexact Lower-level Solutions (AGILS) based on a Moreau envelope-based reformulation of the bilevel optimization problem. The proposed algorithm does not require exact solutions of the lower-level problem at each iteration, improving computational efficiency. We prove the convergence of AGILS to stationary points and, under the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) property, establish its sequential convergence. Numerical experiments, including a toy example and a bilevel hyperparameter selection problem for the sparse group Lasso model, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AGILS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes an extension to the leader-first follower (LFF) class of graphs used to solve the bearing-only formation control problem over directed graphs. The first contribution provides an equilibrium, stability, and convergence analysis for a one-follower, multi-leader system (which is not an LFF graph). We then propose an extension to the LFF structure, termed \emph{ordered} LFF graphs, that allows for additional forward directed edges to be included. Using the results of the one-follower multi-leader system we show that the ordered LFF graphs can be used to solve the directed bearing-only formation control problem. We also show that these structures offer improved convergence speed as compared to the LFF graphs. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the results.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization by Kernel Regression and Density-based Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06178v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is highly effective for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions, but it faces significant computational challenges due to the high computational complexity of Gaussian processes, which results in a total time complexity that is quartic with respect to the number of iterations. To address this limitation, we propose the Bayesian Optimization by Kernel regression and density-based Exploration (BOKE) algorithm. BOKE uses kernel regression for efficient function approximation, kernel density for exploration, and integrates them into the confidence bound criteria to guide the optimization process, thus reducing computational costs to quadratic. Our theoretical analysis rigorously establishes the global convergence of BOKE and ensures its robustness in noisy settings. Through extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world optimization tasks, we demonstrate that BOKE not only performs competitively compared to Gaussian process-based methods and several other baseline methods but also exhibits superior computational efficiency. These results highlight BOKE's effectiveness in resource-constrained environments, providing a practical approach for optimization problems in engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-based Universal Formulas for Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of designing a controller that satisfies an arbitrary number of affine inequalities at every point in the state space. This is motivated by the fact that a variety of key control objectives, such as stability, safety, and input saturation, are guaranteed by closed-loop systems whose controllers satisfy such inequalities. Many works in the literature design such controllers as the solution to a state-dependent quadratic program (QP) whose constraints are precisely the inequalities. When the input dimension and number of constraints are high, computing a solution of this QP in real time can become computationally burdensome. Additionally, the solution of such optimization problems is not smooth in general, which can degrade the performance of the system. This paper provides a novel method to design a smooth controller that satisfies an arbitrary number of affine constraints. The controller is given at every state as the minimizer of a strictly convex function. To avoid computing the minimizer of such function in real time, we introduce a method based on neural networks (NN) to approximate the controller. Remarkably, this NN can be used to solve the controller design problem for any task with less than a fixed input dimension and number of affine constraints, and is completely independent of the state dimension. This is why we refer to such NN approximation as a NN-based universal formula for control. Additionally, we show that the NN-based controller only needs to be trained with datapoints from a bounded set in the state space, which significantly simplifies the training process. Various simulations showcase the performance of the proposed solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Submodular functions, defined on continuous or discrete domains, arise in numerous applications. We study the minimization of the difference of two submodular (DS) functions, over both domains, extending prior work restricted to set functions. We show that all functions on discrete domains and all smooth functions on continuous domains are DS. For discrete domains, we observe that DS minimization is equivalent to minimizing the difference of two convex (DC) functions, as in the set function case. We propose a novel variant of the DC Algorithm (DCA) and apply it to the resulting DC Program, obtaining comparable theoretical guarantees as in the set function case. The algorithm can be applied to continuous domains via discretization. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in integer compressive sensing and integer least squares.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a feedback control framework for stabilizing the McKean-Vlasov PDE on the torus. Our goal is to steer the dynamics toward a prescribed stationary distribution or accelerate convergence to it using a time-dependent control potential. We reformulate the controlled PDE in a weighted, zero-mean space and apply the ground-state transform to obtain a Schrodinger-type operator. The resulting operator framework enables spectral analysis, verification of the infinite-dimensional Hautus test, and construction of a Riccati-based feedback law derived from the linearized dynamics, yielding local exponential stabilization with a chosen convergence rate. We rigorously prove local exponential stabilization via maximal regularity arguments and nonlinear estimates. Numerical experiments on well-studied models in one and two dimensions (the noisy Kuramoto model for synchronization, the O(2) spin model in a magnetic field, and the von Mises attractive interaction potential) showcase the effectiveness of our control strategy, demonstrating convergence acceleration and stabilization of unstable equilibria.</description>

      <title>Nonasymptotic Convergence Rates for Plug-and-Play Methods With MMSE Denoisers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) denoiser under Gaussian noise can be written as a proximal operator, which suffices for asymptotic convergence of plug-and-play (PnP) methods but does not reveal the structure of the induced regularizer or give convergence rates. We show that the MMSE denoiser corresponds to a regularizer that can be written explicitly as an upper Moreau envelope of the negative log-marginal density, which in turn implies that the regularizer is 1-weakly convex. Using this property, we derive (to the best of our knowledge) the first sublinear convergence guarantee for PnP proximal gradient descent with an MMSE denoiser. We validate the theory with a one-dimensional synthetic study that recovers the implicit regularizer. We also validate the theory with imaging experiments (deblurring and computed tomography), which exhibit the predicted sublinear behavior.</description>

      <title>Structural and Solution Analysis for the Ordered Weber Problem under Spatial Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general analytical framework for single-facility continuous location problems under spatial demand uncertainty. In contrast to classical formulations based on discrete or regionally aggregated demands, the proposed model represents uncertainty through general probability measures on $\R^d$, thereby encompassing finite, bounded, and unbounded support distributions within a unified formulation. The objective aggregates expected distances by means of an ordered weighted averaging operator, providing a flexible mathematical structure that includes the classical Weber problem and its ordered extensions as special cases. We establish fundamental properties of this stochastic ordered Weber model, including convexity, continuity, and existence of optimal solutions, and we derive quantitative bounds on the proximity between stochastic minimizers and the convex hulls of demand supports. Building upon these results, we develop and analyze an adaptive sample average approximation scheme, proving its convergence and deriving finite-sample error estimates under mild regularity conditions. For spherically symmetric distributions, we further obtain explicit analytical expressions for the approximation error. Together, these results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for a broad class of stochastic ordered location models and highlight new theoretical connections between convex analysis, stochastic programming, and ordered optimization.</description>

Motivated by issues of sensitivity analysis in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) control and optimal stopping problems, we establish explicit formulas for the corresponding sensitivities under drift reference measure uncertainty. Our work is closely related to \citeauthor{bartl2023sensitivity} \cite{bartl2023sensitivity}. In contrast to the existing literature, our analysis is carried out within a general non-Markovian framework.</description>

      <title>Tracking solutions of time-varying variational inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tracking the solution of time-varying variational inequalities is an important problem with applications in game theory, optimization, and machine learning. Existing work considers time-varying games or time-varying optimization problems. For strongly convex optimization problems or strongly monotone games, these results provide tracking guarantees under the assumption that the variation of the time-varying problem is restrained, that is, problems with a sublinear solution path. In this work we extend existing results in two ways: In our first result, we provide tracking bounds for (1) variational inequalities with a sublinear solution path but not necessarily monotone functions, and (2) for periodic time-varying variational inequalities that do not necessarily have a sublinear solution path-length. Our second main contribution is an extensive study of the convergence behavior and trajectory of discrete dynamical systems of periodic time-varying VI. We show that these systems can exhibit provably chaotic behavior or can converge to the solution. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results with experiments.</description>

      <title>Two results on the Convex Algebraic Geometry of sets with continuous symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove two results on convex subsets of Euclidean spaces invariant under an orthogonal group action. First, we show that invariant spectrahedra admit an equivariant spectrahedral description, i.e., can be described by an equivariant linear matrix inequality. Second, we show that the bijection induced by Kostant's Convexity Theorem between convex subsets invariant under a polar representation and convex subsets of a section invariant under the Weyl group preserves the classes of convex semi-algebraic sets, spectrahedral shadows, and rigidly convex sets.</description>

      <title>First order Martingale model risk and semi-static hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate model risk distributionally robust sensitivities for functionals on the Wasserstein space when the underlying model is constrained to the martingale class and/or is subject to constraints on the first marginal law. Our results extend the findings of Bartl, Drapeau, Obloj \&amp; Wiesel \cite{bartl2021sensitivity} and Bartl \&amp; Wiesel \cite{bartlsensitivityadapted} by introducing the minimization of the distributionally robust problem with respect to semi-static hedging strategies. We provide explicit characterizations of the model risk (first order) optimal semi-static hedging strategies. The distributional robustness is analyzed both in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric and the more relevant standard Wasserstein metric.</description>

      <title>Modeling Hierarchical Spaces: A Review and Unified Framework for Surrogate-Based Architecture Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based problems involving mixed-variable inputs frequently feature domains that are hierarchical, conditional, heterogeneous, or tree-structured. These characteristics pose challenges for data representation, modeling, and optimization. This paper reviews extensive literature on these structured input spaces and proposes a unified framework that generalizes existing approaches.
  In this framework, input variables may be continuous, integer, or categorical. A variable is described as meta if its value governs the presence of other decreed variables, enabling the modeling of conditional and hierarchical structures. We further introduce the concept of partially-decreed variables, whose activation depends on contextual conditions.
  To capture these inter-variable hierarchical relationships, we introduce design space graphs, combining principles from feature modeling and graph theory. This allows the definition of general hierarchical domains suitable for describing complex system architectures.
  Our framework defines hierarchical distances and kernels to enable surrogate modeling and optimization on hierarchical domains. We demonstrate its effectiveness on complex system design problems, including a neural network and a green-aircraft case study. Our methods are available in the open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT 2.0).</description>

      <title>A Compositional Kernel Model for Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a compositional variant of kernel ridge regression in which the predictor is applied to a coordinate-wise reweighting of the inputs. Formulated as a variational problem, this model provides a simple testbed for feature learning in compositional architectures. From the perspective of variable selection, we show how relevant variables are recovered while noise variables are eliminated. We establish guarantees showing that both global minimizers and stationary points discard noise coordinates when the noise variables are Gaussian distributed. A central finding is that $\ell_1$-type kernels, such as the Laplace kernel, succeed in recovering features contributing to nonlinear effects at stationary points, whereas Gaussian kernels recover only linear ones.</description>
