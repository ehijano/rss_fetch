      <title>On the relationship between equilibria and dynamics in large, random neuronal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the equilibria of a random model network exhibiting extensive chaos. In this regime, a large number of equilibria is present. They are all saddles with low-dimensional unstable manifolds. Surprisingly, despite network's connectivity being completely random, the equilibria are strongly correlated and, as a result, they occupy a very small region in the phase space. The attractor is inside this region. This geometry explains why the collective states sampled by the dynamics are dominated by correlation effects and, hence, why the chaotic dynamics in these models can be described by a fractionally-small number of collective modes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical mean field approach to associative memory model with non-monotonic transfer functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hopfield associative memory model stores random patterns in synaptic couplings according to Hebb's rule and retrieves them through gradient descent on an energy function. This conventional setting, where neurons are assumed to have monotonic transfer functions, has been central to understanding associative memory. Morita (1993), however, showed that introducing non-monotonic transfer functions can dramatically enhance retrieval performance. While this phenomenon has been qualitatively examined, a full quantitative theory remains elusive due to the difficulty of analysis in the absence of an underlying energy function. In this work, we apply dynamical mean-field theory to the discrete-time synchronous retrieval dynamics of the non-monotonic model, which succeeds in accurately characterizing its macroscopic dynamical properties. We also derive conditions for retrieval states, and clarify their relation to previous studies. Our results provide new insights into the non-equilibrium retrieval dynamics of associative memory models.</description>

      <title>Fock space fragmentation in quenches of disordered interacting fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation, as it is currently investigated, primarily originates from specific kinematic constraints or emergent conservation laws in many-body systems with translation invariance. It leads to non-ergodic dynamics and possible breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Here, we demonstrate that also in disordered systems, such as the XXZ model with random on-site fields, fragmentation appears as a natural concept offering fresh perspectives, for example, on many-body delocalization (MBdL). Specifically, we split the Fock-space into subspaces, potential-energy shells, which contain the accessible phase space for the relaxation of a quenched initial state. In this construction, dynamical observables reflect properties of the shell geometry, e.g., the drastic sample-to-sample fluctuations observed in the weak disorder regime, $W&lt;W_c$, represent fluctuations of the mass of the shell. Upon crossing over from weak to strong disorder, $W&gt;W_c$, the potential-energy shell decays into fragments; we argue that, unlike percolation, fragmentation is a strong-coupling scenario with turn-around flow: $W_c(L)$ diverges with increasing system size. We conjecture that the slowing down of the relaxation dynamics reported in traditional MBdL studies is (essentially) a manifestation of Fock-space fragmentation introduced here.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Real Advantage of Machine-Learning-Enhanced Monte Carlo for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are central to both practical applications and the development of optimization methods. While classical and quantum algorithms have been refined over decades, machine learning-assisted approaches are comparatively recent and have not yet consistently outperformed simple, state-of-the-art classical methods. Here, we focus on a class of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, specifically the challenge of finding minimum energy configurations in three-dimensional Ising spin glasses. We use a Global Annealing Monte Carlo algorithm that integrates standard local moves with global moves proposed via machine learning. We show that local moves play a crucial role in achieving optimal performance. Benchmarking against Simulated Annealing and Population Annealing, we demonstrate that Global Annealing not only surpasses the performance of Simulated Annealing but also exhibits greater robustness than Population Annealing, maintaining effectiveness across problem hardness and system size without hyperparameter tuning. These results provide, to our knowledge, the first clear and robust evidence that a machine learning-assisted optimization method can exceed the capabilities of classical state-of-the-art techniques in a combinatorial optimization setting.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in many-body localization systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems has attracted increasing attention owing to a variety of intriguing phenomena absent in equilibrium physics. A prominent example is the quantum Mpemba effect, where subsystem symmetry is restored more rapidly under a symmetric quench from a more asymmetric initial state. In this work, we investigate symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect in many-body localized systems for a range of initial states. We show that symmetry can still be restored in the many-body localization regime without approaching thermal equilibrium. Moreover, we demonstrate that the quantum Mpemba effect emerges universally for any tilted product state, in contrast to chaotic systems where its occurrence depends sensitively on the choice of the initial state. We further provide a theoretical analysis of symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect using an effective model for many-body localization. Overall, this paper fills an important gap in establishing a unified understanding of symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect in generic many-body systems, and it advances our understanding of many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected synchronization in networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a graph, we say that two nodes are topologically equivalent if their sets of first neighbors, excluding the two nodes, coincide. We prove that nonlinearly coupled heterogeneous oscillators located on a group of topologically equivalent nodes can get easily synchronized when the group forms a fully connected subgraph (or combinations thereof), regardless of the status of all the other oscillators. More generally, any change occurring in the remainder of the graph will not alter the synchronization status of the group. Typically, the group can synchronize when $k^{(\mathrm{OUT})}\leq k^{(\mathrm{IN})}$, $k^{(\mathrm{IN})}$ and $k^{(\mathrm{OUT})}$ being the common internal and outgoing degree of each node in the group, respectively. Simulations confirm our rigorous analysis and suggest that groups of topologically equivalent nodes act as independent pacemakers.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Induced Anomalous Diffusion in a 3D Spin Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emergent hydrodynamics (EHD) bridges short-time unitarity with late-time thermodynamics, universal transport phenomena characterize the manner and speed of transport and thermalization. Typical non-integrable systems with few conserved local quantities are expected to be diffusive. In contrast, strongly disordered systems which admit phases such as many-body localization, are predicted to inhibit thermalization and thus slow dynamical transport. Disordered systems represent a uniquely poised platform to probe the quantum-to-classical transition and the emergence of irreversible thermodynamics from the underlying unitary structure. Here, we study a strongly disordered nuclear spin ensemble, using local measurements enabled by the disordered-state technique. We observe an apparent phase transition into a sub-diffusive regime, which we model as a random walk on the emergent fractal structure of a percolating network in the dipolar spin ensemble. Our novel theoretical model provides a framework for characterizing the emergence of thermalization in closed quantum systems, even in the presence of strong disorder.</description>

      <title>Universal Freezing Transitions of Dipole-Conserving Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a universal phase diagram of quantum chains with range-$k$ interactions subject to the conservation of a total charge and its dipole moment. These systems exhibit "freezing" transitions between strongly and weakly Hilbert-space-fragmented phases as the charge filling $\nu$ is varied. We show that these continuous phase transitions occur at a critical charge filling of $\nu_c=(k-2)^{-1}$ independently of the on-site Hilbert space dimension $d$. To this end, we analytically prove that, for any $d$, any state with $\nu&lt;\nu_c$ hosts a finite density of sites belonging to "blockages", which we define as subregions of the chain across which transport of charge and dipole moment cannot occur. Some blockages arise from sequences of frozen sites, i.e. sites with an unchanging on-site charge, while others do not involve frozen sites at all. We prove that the presence of blockages implies strong fragmentation of typical symmetry sectors into Krylov subspaces, each of which forms an exponentially vanishing fraction of the total sector. By studying the distribution of blockages we analytically characterise how typical states are subdivided into dynamically disconnected local "active bubbles", and prove that typical eigenstates at these charge fillings exhibit area-law entanglement entropy, while there exist rare eigenstates featuring non-area-law scaling. We also numerically show that for $\nu&gt;\nu_c$ and arbitrary $d$, typical symmetry sectors are weakly fragmented, with their dominant Krylov sectors constituted of states that are free of blockages. We analytically derive some critical exponents characterising the transition and numerically determine the density of blockages at $\nu=\nu_c$, with clear implications for transport at the critical point. Finally, we investigate the properties of special-case models for which no phase transitions occur.</description>

      <title>The Wishart--Rosenzweig--Porter random matrix ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years the Rosenzweig--Porter (RP) ensemble, obtained by adding a diagonal matrix with independent and identically distributed elements to a Gaussian random matrix, has been widely used as a minimal model for the emergence of fractal eigenstates in complex many-body systems. A key open question concerns the robustness of its phase diagram when the assumption of independent and uncorrelated entries is relaxed -- an assumption that simplifies its analysis, but is generally violated in realistic quantum systems. In this work, we take a first step in this direction by considering a deformed Wishart (rather than Gaussian) random matrix, which we dub the ``Wishart--RP'' ensemble. Using perturbation theory, as well as the cavity and replica methods and the Dyson Brownian motion approach, we characterize its phase diagram and localization properties. Remarkably, we show that the level compressibility, which quantifies spectral correlations in the fractal phase, coincides with that of the Gaussian RP model, thereby extending the universality conjectured in [SciPost Phys. 14, 110 (2023)] beyond the fully uncorrelated setting. We confirm our results with numerical tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The boundary between classically simulable and computationally superior quantum systems is fundamental to identifying true quantum advantage. We investigate this within the framework of quantum reservoir computing by introducing a tunable $N$-qubit random circuit model, where a fraction $p$ of Clifford gates are probabilistically substituted with nonstabilizing conditional-$\hat{T}$ gates. We establish a direct correspondence between the reservoir's performance on temporal processing tasks and its entanglement spectrum statistics and long-range nonstabilizer resource content. To assess scalability, we study the scaling of the anti-flatness of states in the large-$N$ limit at a fixed circuit depth ratio $d/N \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. This is taken as a witness to concentration of measures, a known impediment to learning in thermalizing systems. We demonstrate that the learnability and scalability of the reservoir can be continuously controlled by the parameter $p$, allowing us to navigate from classically tractable to maximally expressive quantum dynamics. These architecture-agnostic results offer a general strategy for designing powerful and trainable quantum machine learning systems and clarify the physical resources underpinning quantum computational advantage.</description>
