      <title>Fast generation of 3D flow obstacles from parametric surface models: application to cardiac valves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the computationally demanding nature of fluid-structure interaction simulations, heart valve simulation is a complex task. A simpler alternative is to model the valve as a resistive flow obstacle that can be updated dynamically without altering the mesh, but this approach can also become computationally expensive for large meshes.
  In this work, we present a fast method for computing the resistive flow obstacle of a heart valve. The method is based on a parametric surface model of the valve, which is defined by a set of curves. The curves are adaptively sampled to create a polyline representation, which is then used to generate the surface. The surface is represented as a set of points, allowing for efficient distance calculations to determine whether mesh nodes belong to the valve surface. We introduce three algorithms for computing these distances: minimization, sampling, and triangulation. Additionally, we implement two mesh traversal strategies: exhaustive node iteration and recursive neighbor search. The latter significantly reduces the number of distance calculations by only considering neighboring nodes.
  Our pipeline is demonstrated on both a previously reported aortic valve model and a newly proposed mitral valve model, highlighting its flexibility and efficiency for rapid valve shape updates in computational simulations.</description>

      <title>In silico modelling of changes in spinal cord blood flow after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: To develop an in-silico model of the aorta and its spinal cord-supplying branches, and to characterise haemodynamic changes following aortic aneurysm (AA) repair with such a model. The work is motivated by the risk of spinal cord ischaemia (SCI) and paraplegia, serious complications that can arise from disruption of spinal cord perfusion during AA surgery. Methods: SimVascular was used to retrospectively create models of a 76 year old female patient's aorta pre- and post- uncomplicated endovascular AA repair. The full extent of the aorta and its branches, including vessels supplying the spinal cord, was segmented. Pulsatile flow simulations were conducted under the assumption of rigid vessel walls, with patient-specific inlet and three-element Windkessel models for the outlet boundary conditions on the SimVascular Gateway Cluster. Results: Postoperatively, segmental artery flow to the spinal cord decreased by 51.86% due to exclusion of lumbar and posterior intercostal arteries by the stent graft. Spinal cord-supplying arteries showed increased TAWSS (+5.2%) and reduced RRT and ECAP, with minimal change in OSI. Consistent with redistribution away from the spinal territory, modest postoperative flow increases were observed in non-spinal vascular beds, including the legs (+6.09%), reno-visceral vessels (+5.89%), and supra-aortic branches (+5.97%). Across vascular territories, visceral arteries had the highest TAWSS and lowest RRT and ECAP, while leg arteries had the lowest TAWSS and highest RRT and ECAP; supra-aortic vessels exhibited the highest OSI. Conclusion: This study lays a foundation for computational prediction of SCI risk. It leverages in-silico modelling, using an open-source software pipeline and routine medical imaging, to assess spinal cord blood flow alterations after aortic surgery. This may forge a path towards a clinical decision-making tool.</description>
