      <title>Optimizing Beam-Plasma Interactions Through Jitter Analysis Using Start-to-End Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional accelerators, while effective, suffer from extensive spatial and financial demands, necessitating the exploration of compact alternatives like PWFA, which significantly reduces the necessary accelerator length by utilizing the wake generated by a high-speed pulse traveling through plasma. Our research focuses on mitigating instabilities, particularly timing jitter, which critically impacts the quality of accelerated beams. Through the deployment of Impact-T, Bmad, and Tao simulation tools at the FACET-II facility, we examined how timing jitter influences key beam parameters, including peak currents and emittance, over various simulation scenarios. The findings reveal that even minute variations in accelerator settings can significantly influence beam characteristics, underscoring the importance of precise control in beam dynamics. The outcomes contribute to enhancing the reliability and precision of PWFA systems, promising improved applications in both scientific research and medical therapies. Future research directions include integrating machine learning techniques to refine control strategies further and reduce experimental redundancies, highlighting the evolving synergy between accelerator physics and computational data science.</description>

      <title>Space Charge-Induced Emittance Growth in the Downstream Section of ERL Injectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The injector for ERL-FEL has been widely researched. Unlike traditional linacs, the bunch in the injector for ERLs requires additional deflection and matching section at lower energies. It makes the bunch more susceptible to the effects of the Space Charge. This will lead to a degradation in beam quality. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the impact of space charge on ERL-injector and propose new design concepts to further maintain beam quality.</description>

      <title>Isochronous and period-doubling diagrams for symplectic maps of the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symplectic mappings of the plane serve as key models for exploring the fundamental nature of complex behavior in nonlinear systems. Central to this exploration is the effective visualization of stability regimes, which enables the interpretation of how systems evolve under varying conditions. While the area-preserving quadratic H\'enon map has received significant theoretical attention, a comprehensive description of its mixed parameter-space dynamics remain lacking. This limitation arises from early attempts to reduce the full two-dimensional phase space to a one-dimensional projection, a simplification that resulted in the loss of important dynamical features. Consequently, there is a clear need for a more thorough understanding of the underlying qualitative aspects.
  This paper aims to address this gap by revisiting the foundational concepts of reversibility and associated symmetries, first explored in the early works of G.D. Birkhoff. We extend the original framework proposed by H\'enon by adding a period-doubling diagram to his isochronous diagram, which allows to represents the system's bifurcations and the groups of symmetric periodic orbits that emerge in typical bifurcations of the fixed point. A qualitative and quantitative explanation of the main features of the region of parameters with bounded motion is provided, along with the application of this technique to other symplectic mappings, including cases of multiple reversibility. Modern chaos indicators, such as the Reversibility Error Method and the Generalized Alignment Index, are employed to distinguish between various dynamical regimes in the mixed space of variables and parameters. These tools prove effective in differentiating regular and chaotic dynamics, as well as in identifying twistless orbits and their associated bifurcations.</description>
