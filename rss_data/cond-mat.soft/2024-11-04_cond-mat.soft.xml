      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Profiling of Ladder Polymer Structure using Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ladder polymers, known for their rigid, ladder-like structures, exhibit exceptional thermal stability and mechanical strength, positioning them as candidates for advanced applications. However, accurately determining their structure from solution scattering remains a challenge. Their chain conformation is largely governed by the intrinsic orientational properties of the monomers and their relative orientations, leading to a bimodal distribution of bending angles, unlike conventional polymer chains whose bending angles follow a unimodal Gaussian distribution. Meanwhile, traditional scattering models for polymer chains do not account for these unique structural features. This work introduces a novel approach that integrates machine learning with Monte Carlo simulations to address this challenge. We first develop a Monte Carlo simulation for sampling the configuration space of ladder polymers, where each monomer is modeled as a biaxial segment. Then, we establish a machine learning-assisted scattering analysis framework based on Gaussian Process Regression. Finally, we conduct small-angle neutron scattering experiments on a ladder polymer solution to apply our approach. Our method uncovers structural details of ladder polymers that conventional methods fail to capture.</description>

      <title>On modeling fracture of soft polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft polymers are ubiquitous materials found in nature and as engineering materials with properties varying from rate-independent to significantly rate-dependent depending on the crosslinking mechanisms. Current fracture toughness measures such as energy release rate are non-unique for rate-dependent soft materials for varying loading profiles and specimen geometries. Works on modeling fracture in rate-dependent soft polymers are limited to crack tip stress field analyses or crack tip driving force approaches for specific pre-cracked geometries. We have developed a model to predict damage initiation and growth in soft polymers based on a generalized multi-mechanism gradient damage framework. We propose and show that a critical value of stress work $\mathit{W}_{cr}$ can uniquely quantify the total energy dissipation per unit referential volume associated with the complete failure of a material point under a loading mode. $\mathit{W}_{cr}$ can be evaluated using homogeneous deformation experiments and without a constitutive model. $\mathit{W}_{cr}$ is demonstrated to be approximately constant with strain rate for two rate-dependent soft polymers and different loading modes for an elastomer. We propose the energetic contribution to $\mathit{W}_{cr}$ as a suitable damage initiation criterion. The proposed initiation criterion in the damage model enabled successful predictions of fracture in an important rate-stiffening soft polymer Polyborosiloxane in a variety of experiments involving different specimen geometries and loading conditions. The model also provides a consistent energy density estimate for fracture-associated microstructural processes in Polyborosiloxane. The broader applicability of the fracture model is shown by its ability to predict fracture in an elastomer (EPDM) and another viscous soft polymer (EPS25 vitrimer).</description>

      <title>Wall slip and bulk flow heterogeneity in a sludge under shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the shear flow of a sludge mimicking slurries produced by the nuclear industry and constituted of a dispersion of non-Brownian particles into an attractive colloidal dispersion at a total solid volume fraction of about 10%. Combining rheometry and ultrasound flow imaging, we show that, upon decreasing the shear rate, the flow transitions from a homogeneous shear profile in the bulk to a fully arrested plug-like state with total wall slip, through an oscillatory regime where strong fluctuations of the slip velocity propagate along the vorticity direction. When the shear stress is imposed close to the yield stress, the shear rate presents large, quasi-periodic peaks, associated with the propagation of local stick-and-slip events along the vorticity direction. Such complex dynamics, reminiscent of similar phenomena reported in much denser suspensions, highlight the importance of local flow characterization to fully understand sludge rheology.</description>

      <title>Transmission of mobility via cooperative mechanisms in soft active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When supercooled, liquids viscosity increases dramatically as the glass transition temperature is approached. While the physical origin of this behavior is still not understood, it is now well established that the addition of a few activated particles is able to reverse that increase in viscosity. Here we further raise the question of a limit in that fluidization process and of the differences between the fluidized liquid and its viscous counterpart. Results show that a few percent active molecules are enough to trigger a phase transition leading to diffusion coefficients typical of liquids while the medium retains cooperative properties of the viscous phase. The similarity between cooperative properties of the active and non active molecules suggests that the mobility of active molecules is transmitted to inactive ones via the medium cooperative mechanisms, a result in agreement with facilitation theories. This result is then confirmed by the compared behavior of the distinct van hove correlation functions of most mobile active and non active molecules. Interestingly enough, in our simulations the cooperative mechanisms are not induced or related to a decrease of the excitation concentration.</description>

      <title>Pattern Formation in Crumpled Hydrogel upon Rapid Dehydration with Acetone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From microactuators to biological tissues, non-porous materials with the ability to strongly expand when in contact with a solvent are ubiquitous. Consequently, the swelling of polymer systems such as hydrogel has received recently much research attention. However, the related dehydration of these systems has received much less attention. Here, we present experiments investigating the rapid dehydration of a swollen hydrogel sheet whose surface exhibits a transient crumpling instability characterised by line segments of cusps patterning the surface of the gel into an array of bumps. We perform this dehydration through immersion in acetone, which is highly miscible in water, but poorly miscible in the hydrogel. We report the onset of a fascinating pattern formation where regions of the hydrogel sheet turn turbid. We find that the emerging pattern is independent of the overall extent of the hydrated swollen surface. The pattern wavelength only depends on the duration of hydration before immersion in acetone, growing temporally with a power law behaviour. We conclude through drawing comparisons between features of this dehydration induced pattern and the original crumpling instability in the water swollen hydrogel sheet.</description>

      <title>An Exact Solution for the Kinetic Ising Model with Non-Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide range of non-equilibrium phenomena in nature involve non-reciprocal interactions. To understand the novel behaviors that can emerge in such systems, finding tractable models is essential. With this goal, we introduce a non-reciprocal generalization of the kinetic Ising model in one dimension and solve it exactly. Our solution uncovers novel properties driven by non-reciprocity, such as underdamped phases, critically damped phases where a system of size $N$ is described by an $N^{th}$-order exceptional point, and wave phenomena influenced by the parity of $N$. Additionally, we examine the low-energy behavior of these systems in various limits, demonstrating that non-reciprocity leads to unique scaling behavior at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Energy Transfer Between Redox-Active Colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Redox-based electrical conduction in nonconjugated polymers has been explored less than a decade, yet is already showing promise as a new concept for electrical energy transport. Here using monolayers and sub-monolayers of touching micron-sized redox active colloids (RAC) containing high densities of ethyl-viologen (EV) side groups, intercolloid redox-based electron transport was directly observed via fluorescence microscopy. This observation was enabled by the discovery that these RAC exhibit a highly non-linear electrofluorochromism which can be quantitatively coupled to the colloid redox state. By evaluating the quasi-Fickian nature of the charge transfer (CT) kinetics, the apparent CT diffusion coefficient DCT was extracted. Along with addressing more fundamental questions regarding energy transport in colloidal materials, this first real-time real-space imaging of energy transport within monolayers of redox-active colloids may provide insights into energy transfer in flow batteries, and enable design of new forms of conductive polymers for applications including organic electronics.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating hydrodynamics of an autophoretic particle near a permeable interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the autophoretic motion of a spherical active particle interacting chemically and hydrodynamically with its fluctuating environment in the limit of rapid diffusion and slow viscous flow. Then, the chemical and hydrodynamic fields can be expressed in terms of integrals. The resulting boundary-domain integral equations provide a direct way of obtaining the traction on the particle, requiring the solution of linear integral equations. An exact solution for the chemical and hydrodynamic problems is obtained for a particle in an unbounded domain. For motion near boundaries, we provide corrections to the unbounded solutions in terms of chemical and hydrodynamic Green's functions, preserving the dissipative nature of autophoresis in a viscous fluid for all physical configurations. Using this, we give the fully stochastic update equations for the Brownian trajectory of an autophoretic particle in a complex environment. First, we analyse the Brownian dynamics of particles capable of complex motion in the bulk. We then introduce a chemically permeable planar surface of two immiscible liquids in the vicinity of the particle and provide explicit solutions to the chemo-hydrodynamics of this system. Finally, we study the case of an isotropically phoretic particle hovering above an interface as a function of interfacial solute permeability and viscosity contrast.</description>

      <title>Jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in amorphous materials sheared by cyclic quasistatic deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01834v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jamming is an athermal transition between flowing and rigid states in amorphous systems such as granular matter, colloidal suspensions, complex fluids and cells. The jamming transition seems to display mixed aspects of a first-order transition, evidenced by a discontinuity in the coordination number, and a second-order transition, indicated by power-law scalings and diverging lengths. Here we demonstrate that jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in cyclically sheared systems with quasistatic deformations, in two and three dimensions. Based on scaling analyses, we show that fluctuations of the jamming density in finite-sized systems have important consequences on the finite-size effects of various quantities, resulting in a square relationship between disconnected and connected susceptibilities, a key signature of the first-order transition with quenched disorder. This study puts the jamming transition into the category of a broad class of transitions in disordered systems where sample-to-sample fluctuations dominate over thermal fluctuations, suggesting that the nature and behavior of the jamming transition might be better understood within the developed theoretical framework of the athermally driven random-field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining bistability with the Martini force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14440v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An increasing interest in molecular structures whose long term dynamics resemble those of bistable mechanical systems promotes the search of possible candidates that may operate as two-state switching units. Of particular interest are the systems that are capable to exhibit such bistable effects as spontaneous vibrations, stochastic resonance and spontaneous synchronization. Previously, in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations it has been demonstrated that short pyridine-furan springs show these bistable phenomena. In this article we introduce a coarse-grained model of such springs and investigate the possibility to observe the bistability effects, such as spontaneous vibrations. Our findings allow the studies of short pyridine-furan springs at large time and length scales and open field for further computational research of large bistable systems.</description>
