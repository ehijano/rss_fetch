      <title>The Causal Impact of Dean's List Recognition on Academic Performance: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the causal impact of being placed on the Dean's List, a positive education incentive, on future student performance using a regression discontinuity design. The results suggest that for students with low prior academic performance and who are native English speakers, there is a positive impact of being on the Dean's List on the probability of getting onto the Dean's List in the following year. However, being on the Dean's List does not appear to have a statistically significant effect on subsequent GPA, total credits taken, dropout rates, or the probability of graduating within four years. These findings suggest that a place on the Dean's List may not be a strong motivator for students to improve their academic performance and achieve better outcomes.</description>

      <title>Two halves don't make a whole: instability and idleness emerging from the co-evolution of the production and innovation processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a disaggregated representation of production using an agent-based fund-flow model that emphasizes inefficiencies, such as factor idleness and production instability, and allows us to explore their emergence through simulations. The model incorporates productivity dynamics (learning and depreciation) and is extended with time-saving process innovations. Specifically, we assume workers possess inherent creativity that flourishes during idle periods. The firm, rather than laying off idle workers, is assumed to harness this potential by involving them in the innovation process. Results show that a firm's organizational and managerial decisions, the temporal structure of the production system, the degree of workers' learning and forgetting, and the pace of innovation are critical factors influencing production efficiency in both the short and long term. The coevolution of production and innovation processes emerges in our model through the two-sided effects of idleness: the loss of skills through forgetting and the deflection of time from the production of goods to the production of ideas giving birth to idleness-driven innovations. In doing so, it allows us to question the status of labour as an adjustment variable in a productive organisation. The paper concludes by discussing potential solutions to this issue and suggesting avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>The Coherence of US cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diversified economies are critical for cities to sustain their growth and development, but they are also costly because diversification often requires expanding a city's capability base. We analyze how cities manage this trade-off by measuring the coherence of the economic activities they support, defined as the technological distance between randomly sampled productive units in a city. We use this framework to study how the US urban system developed over almost two centuries, from 1850 to today. To do so, we rely on historical census data, covering over 600M individual records to describe the economic activities of cities between 1850 and 1940, and 8 million patent records as well as detailed occupational and industrial profiles of cities for more recent decades. Despite massive shifts in the economic geography of the U.S. over this 170-year period, average coherence in its urban system remains unchanged. Moreover, across different time periods, datasets and relatedness measures, coherence falls with city size at the exact same rate, pointing to constraints to diversification that are governed by a city's size in universal ways.</description>

      <title>Temporal and topological partitioning in real-world growing networks for scale-free properties study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method to study evolution rules and scale-free hypothesis of real-world growing networks using natural partitions of nodes and edges based on temporal and topological attributes, and analyzing degree distributions.
  We apply this method to the Software Heritage dataset, which collects software releases and revisions from open-source communities.Nodes with native temporal information does not fully capture the overall network dynamics, and degree distributions show greater regularity with fewer outliers, suggesting a more likely scale-free regime when examining networks derived from temporal and topological partitions.
  However, underlying aging, fitness, and inheritance mechanisms, along with chosen partitioning, hinder definitive conclusions and suggest that the very common ``pure parametric power-law'' hypothesis for the tail of degree distributions is too strong. Node's type derived from partions and changes in evolution rules, shown by variations in the average number of new edges per node over time, highlight the need for tools better suited for studying transient regimes and ease comparison of real-world networks with minimal models.</description>

      <title>Emergence of echo chambers in a noisy adaptive voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Belief perseverance is the widely documented tendency of holding to a belief, even in the presence of contradicting evidence. In online environments, this tendency leads to heated arguments with users ``blocking'' each other. Introducing this element to opinion modelling in a social network, leads to an adaptive network where agents tend to connect preferentially to like-minded peers. In this work we study how this type of dynamics behaves in the voter model with the addition of a noise that makes agents change opinion at random. As the intensity of the noise and the propensity of users blocking each other is changed, we observe a transition between 2 phases. One in which there is only one community in the whole network and another where communities arise and in each of then there is a very clear majority opinion, mimicking the phenomenon of echo chambers. These results are obtained with simulations and with a mean-field theory.</description>

      <title>Inferring resource competition in microbial communities from time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The competition for resources is a defining feature of microbial communities. In many contexts, from soils to host-associated communities, highly diverse microbes are organized into metabolic groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. The resource preferences of individual taxa that give rise to these guilds are critical for understanding fluxes of resources through the community and the structure of diversity in the system. However, inferring the metabolic capabilities of individual taxa, and their competition with other taxa, within a community is challenging and unresolved. Here we address this gap in knowledge by leveraging dynamic measurements of abundances in communities. We show that simple correlations are often misleading in predicting resource competition. We show that spectral methods such as the cross-power spectral density (CPSD) and coherence that account for time-delayed effects are superior metrics for inferring the structure of resource competition in communities. We first demonstrate this fact on synthetic data generated from consumer-resource models with time-dependent resource availability, where taxa are organized into groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. By applying spectral methods to oceanic plankton time-series data, we demonstrate that these methods detect interaction structures among species with similar genomic sequences. Our results indicate that analyzing temporal data across multiple timescales can reveal the underlying structure of resource competition within communities.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Bugs: The Limits of Symmetry Metrics to Detect Partisan Gerrymandering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two symmetry metrics commonly used to analyze partisan gerrymandering: the Mean-Median Difference (MM) and Partisan Bias (PB). Our main results compare, for combinations of seats and votes achievable in districted elections, the number of districts won by each party to the extent of potential deviation from the ideal metric values, taking into account the political geography of the state. These comparisons are motivated by examples where the MM and PB have been used in efforts to detect when a districting plan awards extreme number of districts won by some party. These examples include expert testimony, public-facing apps, recommendations by experts to redistricting commissions, and public policy proposals.
  To achieve this goal we perform both theoretical and empirical analyses of the MM and PB. In our theoretical analysis, we consider vote-share, seat-share pairs (V, S) for which one can construct election data having vote share V and seat share S, and turnout is equal in each district. We calculate the range of values that MM and PB can achieve on that constructed election data. In the process, we find the range of (V,S) pairs that achieve MM = 0, and see that the corresponding range for PB is the same set of (V,S) pairs. We show how the set of such (V,S) pairs allowing for MM = 0 (and PB = 0) changes when turnout in each district is allowed to vary. By observing the results of this theoretical analysis, we can show that the values taken on by these metrics do not necessarily attain more extreme values in plans with more extreme numbers of districts won. We also analyze specific example elections, showing how these metrics can return unintuitive results. We follow this with an empirical study, where we show that on 18 different U.S. maps these metrics can fail to detect extreme seats outcomes.</description>

      <title>Thermophotovoltaic performance metrics and techno-economics: efficiency vs. power density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00940v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) are a promising new approach for converting heat to electricity. Their performance is primarily characterized by two metrics: efficiency and power density. While recent works have shown high efficiency, it is important to understand how both of these metrics impact the techno-economics of a TPV system as efforts to commercialize the technology advance. In this work, we develop the first unification of efficiency and power density into a single techno-economic metric based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). We find that the LCOE can be broken into two parts: heating cost, including infrastructure and inputs for providing heat to the TPV cells, and cell cost, the capital cost of the TPV cells. We show that systems with high heating costs should prioritize TPV efficiency, while systems with high cell costs should prioritize power density. We then develop a model to identify the most impactful cell properties in improving the important performance metric and reducing system LCOE. Namely, improving spectral control with increased back-surface reflectance is the most effective to reduce LCOE in systems with high infrastructural costs, while increasing the view factor and reducing front-surface reflectance are most critical in systems with high TPV cell cost. Improving just one or two of these properties can reduce the LCOE by 25-75%, reaching competitive values ~ 8 cents/kWh-e, less than the average cost of electricity in the US. This study thus elucidates which TPV performance metric is more important for system technoeconomics and how to maximize it.</description>
