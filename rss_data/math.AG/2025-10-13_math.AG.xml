      <title>Pairs of tree dessins, their Shabat polynomials, and monodromy groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coverings of the Riemann sphere by itself, ramified over two points, are given by so-called Shabat polynomials. The correspondence between Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants and Belyi maps then implies a bijection between Shabat polynomials and tree dessins (bicolored plane trees). Dessins can be assigned a combinatorial invariant known as their passport, which records the degrees of their vertices. We consider all possible passports determining a pair of tree dessins, determining the associated Shabat polynomials and monodromy groups.</description>

      <title>From amoebas to pluripotential theory on hybrid analytic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes are an introduction to the use of non-Archimedean geometry in the study of meromorphic degenerations of complex algebraic varieties. They provide a self-contained discussion of hybrid spaces, which fill in one-parameter degenerations with the associated non-Archimedean Berkovich space as a central fiber. The main focus is on the interplay between complex and non-Archimedean pluripotential theory, and on the relation between convergence of psh metrics and the associated Monge-Ampere measures in the hybrid space, following work of the author with M.Jonsson, and recent breakthrough work by Y.Li.</description>

      <title>Equivariant deformation of minimally elliptic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study certain equivariant deformation components of minimally elliptic surface singularities under finite group actions. Interesting examples include cyclic quotients of simple elliptic singularities and finite group quotients of cusp singularities, where the resulting quotients remain simple elliptic and cusp singularities, respectively. In cases where the minimally elliptic singularities are locally complete intersection (lci) singularities, we identify equivariant deformation components of general type surfaces containing such singularities that admit a perfect obstruction theory.</description>

      <title>Special points on intersections of hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish lower bounds on the ambient dimension for an intersection of hypersurfaces to have a dense collection of ``level $\ell$" points, in the sense introduced by Arnold-Shimura, given as a polynomial in the numbers of hypersurfaces of each degree. Our method builds upon the framework for solvable points of G\'omez-Gonz\'ales-Wolfson to include other classes of accessory irrationality, towards the problem of understanding the arithmetic of "special points." We deduce improved upper bounds on resolvent degree $\operatorname{RD}(n)$ and $\operatorname{RD}(G)$ for the sporadic groups as part of outlining frameworks for incorporating future advances in the theory.</description>

      <title>Around the "Fundamental Theorem of Algebra"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (FTA) asserts that every complex polynomial has as many complex roots, counted with multiplicities, as its degree. A probabilistic analogue of this theorem for real roots of real polynomials, commonly referred to as the Kac theorem, was introduced in 1938 by J. Littlewood and A. Offord. In this paper, we present the Kac theorem and prove two more theorems that can be interpreted as analogues of the FTA: a version of FTA for real Laurent polynomials, and another version for exponential sums. In these two cases, we also provide formulations of multidimensional analogues of corresponding FTA.
  While these results are not new, they may appear unexpected and are therefore worth highlighting.</description>

      <title>Classification of Equivariant Line Bundles on the Drinfeld Upper Half Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly determine the group of isomorphism classes of equivariant line bundles on the non-archimedean Drinfeld upper half plane for $\mathrm{GL}_2(F)$, for its subgroup of matrices whose determinant has trivial valuation, and for $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathcal{O}_F)$. Our results extend a recent classification of torsion equivariant line bundles with connection due to Ardakov and Wadsley, but we use a different approach. A crucial ingredient is a construction due to Van der Put which relates invertible analytic functions on the Drinfeld upper half plane to currents on the Bruhat-Tits tree. Another tool we use is condensed group cohomology.</description>

      <title>The Chevalley--Weil formula for finite group actions on higher dimensional compact complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the Atiyah--Singer holomorphic Lefschetz fixed-point theorem, we define ramification modules associated to the fixed loci of a finite group acting on a compact complex manifold. This allows us to generalize the Chevalley--Weil formula for compact Riemann surfaces to higher dimensions. More precisely, let $G$ be a finite group acting on a compact complex manifold $X$, and let $\mathcal{E}$ be a $G$-equivariant locally free sheaf on $X$. Then, in the representation ring $R(G)_\mathbb{Q}$, we have \[ \chi_G(X, \mathcal{E}):=\sum_{i=0}^{\dim X}(-1)^i[H^i(X, \mathcal{E})]=\frac{1}{|G|}\chi(X,\mathcal{E})[\mathbb{C}[G]] + \sum_Z\Gamma(\mathcal{E})_Z \] where $Z$ runs over all connected components of the fixed-point sets $X^g$ for $g\in G$, and each $\Gamma(\mathcal{E})_Z\in R(X)_\mathbb{Q}$, called the \emph{ramification module} at $Z$, depends only on the restriction $\mathcal{E}|_Z$ and the normal bundle $N_{Z/X}$ as $G_Z$-equivariant bundles. We illustrate the computation of $\Gamma(\mathcal{E})_Z$ in several special cases and provide a detailed example for faithful actions of $G\cong(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$ on a compact complex surface.</description>

      <title>$F$-divided bundles on normal $F$-finite schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study $F$-divided bundles on irreducible Noetherian normal $F$-finite $\mathbb{F}_p$-schemes and we show that their Tannakian category is governed by the behaviour at the generic point. In particular, if $U\subset X$ is an open subset of a normal variety defined over an algebraically closed field then the corresponding homomorphism of $F$-divided fundamental groups is faithfully flat. This is analogous to a known fact about the topological fundamental group of an open subset of a normal complex analytic variety. We use this result to show that simply connected, proper, normal varieties in positive characteristic admit no nontrivial $F$-divided bundles. This generalizes an earlier result of H. Esnault and V. Mehta concerning smooth projective varieties, and settles Gieseker's conjecture in a more general setting.</description>

      <title>Relative Gieseker's problem on $F$-divided bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f: X\to Y$ be a surjective morphism of normal projective varieties defined over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. We prove that if the induced map on \'etale fundamental groups is surjective then the corresponding map on $F$-divided fundamental groups is faithfully flat. We also prove an analogous result for isomorphisms. This generalizes and strengthens a recent result of X. Sun and L. Zhang \cite{Sun-Zhang2025}, which in turn generalized earlier results of H. Esnault and V. Mehta \cite{Esnault-Mehta2010} and I. Biswas, M. Kumar, and A. J. Parameswaran \cite{Biswas-Parameswaran-Kumar2025}. An important new ingredient in our proof is an analogue of B. Bhatt's and P. Scholze's descent theorem \cite[Theorem 1.3]{Bhatt-Scholze2017} for $F$-divided bundles.</description>

      <title>Rank Two Sheaves With Low Discriminant on the Fano Threefold of Index 2 and Degree 5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe rank 2 Gieseker semistable sheaves $E$ on the Fano threefold $X_5$ of index 2 and degree 5 with maximal third Chern class $c_3(E)$ for all possible low values of discriminant $\overline{\Delta}_H(E)\le 40$. The work uses the theory of tilt-stability and Bridgeland stability conditions on smooth projective threefolds. We also make a conjecture about the rank 2 sheaves on $X_5$ with maximal $c_3$ and discriminant big enough.</description>

      <title>Finite generation of higher rank quasi-monomial valuations via the extended Rees algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the algebraic theory of K-stability, one of the most challenging problems is to show the graded algebra associated with certain higher rank quasi-monomial valuations are finitely generated. In the global case of Fano varieties and local case of klt singularities, the finite generation has been proved for quasi-monomial valuations on models of qdlt Fano type. In this paper, we generalize these results using a different argument, by studying the extended Rees algebra via a more algebraic approach. As consequences, our results apply to fibrations of Fano type with singularities worse than qdlt, and graded algebras coming from the multi-section ring of arbitrary divisors.</description>

      <title>Moduli of lattice-polarized K3 surfaces and boundedness of Brauer groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by constructions over the complex numbers of Dolgachev and Alexeev-Engel, we define moduli stacks $\mathcal{M}_{(L,\mathcal{A})/\mathbb{Z}}$ of lattice-polarized K3 surfaces over arbitrary bases, paying particular attention to the open locus $\mathcal{P}_{(L,\mathcal{A})/\mathbb{Z}}$ of primitive lattice polarizations. We introduce the notion of very small ample cones $\mathcal{a}$, after Alexeev and Engel's small cones, to construct smooth, separated stacks of lattice polarized K3 surfaces $\mathcal{P}_{(L,\mathcal{a})/\mathbb{Z}[1/N]}$ over suitable open subsets of $\textrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$.
  We add level structures, coming from classes in $\mathrm{H}^2(X,\mu_n)$, to build moduli stacks $\mathcal{P}^{[n]}_{(L,\mathcal{A})/\mathbb{Z}}$ with a natural action by $\mathcal{P}_{(L,\mathcal{A})}\otimes \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ whose associated quotient $\mathcal{Q}^{[n]}_{(L,\mathcal{A})}$ contains an open substack $\mathcal{Q}^{(n)}_{(L,\mathcal{A})}$ whose points parametrize pairs K3 surfaces $X$ such that $\textrm{Pic}(X) \simeq L$, together with a class $\alpha \in \textrm{Br}(X)$ of order $n$.
  When $L$ has rank 19, we show that the coarse moduli space $\mathrm{Q}_{(L,\mathcal{a}),\mathbb{C}}^{(n)}$ is a union of quasi-projective curves, each isomorphic to an open subvariety of the quotient of the upper half plane by a discrete subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$. Fixing a prime $\ell$, we use this comparison to prove that the genus and the gonality of the components of $\mathrm{Q}_{(L,\mathcal{a}),\mathbb{C}}^{(\ell^{m})}$ grows with $m$, and hence that they have finitely many points over number fields of bounded degree. As an application, we furnish a new proof of a result by Cadoret--Charles, showing uniform boundedness of the $\ell$-primary torsion of Brauer groups of K3 surfaces over number fields varying in a $1$-dimensional lattice-polarized family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We parameterize by a fine moduli space all degenerations of linear series to a singular curve which is the union of two smooth components meeting transversally at a single point. For this we introduce a novel object in the study of degenerations of linear series, which is the continuous linear series. Our moduli space can be regarded as a Hilbert quotient, in the terminology introduced by Kapranov, and is a new compactification of Osserman moduli space of exact limit linear series, and consequently, of Eisenbud and Harris moduli space of refined limit linear series on the curve.</description>

      <title>Division algebras of slice-Nash functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of Nash functions in the context of slice regular functions of one quaternionic or octonionic variable. We begin with a detailed analysis of the possible definitions of Nash slice regular functions which leads us to the definition of \textit{slice-Nash} function proposed in this paper (and which we strongly believe to be the natural generalisation of the classical real and complex Nash functions to this context). Once the `correct' definition of slice-Nash functions has been established, we study their properties with particular focus on their finiteness properties. These finiteness properties position this new class of slice-Nash functions as an intermediate class between the class of slice regular functions and the class of slice polynomials, in analogy with the classical real and complex case. We also introduce semiregular slice-Nash functions, in analogy with meromorphic Nash functions, and study their finiteness properties.</description>

      <title>The Spectral Edges Conjecture via Corners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Spectral Edges Conjecture is a well-known and widely believed conjecture in the theory of discrete periodic operators. It states that the extrema of the dispersion relation are isolated, non-degenerate, and occur in a single band. We present two infinite families of periodic graphs which satisfy the Spectral Edges Conjecture. For each, every extremum of the dispersion relation is a corner point (point of symmetry). In fact, each spectral band function is a perfect Morse function. We also give a construction that increases dimension, while preserving that each spectral band function is a perfect Morse function.</description>

      <title>The smallest $n$-pure subtopos and dimension theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of $n$-pure geometric morphism between Grothendieck toposes, over a Grothendieck base topos $\mathcal{T}$. This is a higher-dimensional analogue of the concepts of dense and pure geometric morphism. We extend the construction of the smallest dense subtopos and smallest pure subtopos by constructing a smallest $n$-pure subtopos, for each natural number $n$. Based on this, we then propose a concept of dimension for a Grothendieck topos, in this way also arriving naturally at a distinction between toposes with boundary and toposes without boundary. We show that the zero-dimensional toposes without boundary are precisely the Boolean toposes, and that the topos associated to an $n$-manifold is again $n$-dimensional (with boundary if the manifold has a boundary). Some other toposes for which we calculate the dimension are the topos associated to the rational line and the toposes associated to a right Ore monoid or free monoid. Finally, we move to algebraic geometry: for a scheme $X$ of characteristic $0$ and Krull dimension $d$, we prove that the dimension of the associated petit \'etale topos is $2d$, assuming that $X$ is excellent and regular, or that $X$ is variety. As a first example in mixed characteristic, we show that the petit \'etale topos associated to $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$ is two-dimensional.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polysymmetric functions, introduced by Asvin G. and Andrew O'Desky, provide a new framework linking combinatorics and algebraic geometry through motivic measures in the Grothendieck ring of varieties. Building on this foundation and the combinatorial results of Khanna and Loehr, we study the non-tensor bases of the polysymmetric algebra, introducing a new basis $\{H^+_{\tau}\}$ and deriving explicit expansions among the families $\{H_{\tau}\}$, $\{E_{\tau}\}$, $\{E^+_{\tau}\}$, $\{P_{\tau}\}$, and $\{H^+_{\tau}\}$, where each basis is indexed by stack partitions (types) that generalize integer partitions by recording both degrees and multiplicities. Using the Pieri-type rule established by Khanna and Loehr for related families, we extend it to the $H^+$ basis, give a combinatorial description of the product of monomial polysymmetric functions, and identify an involution for the $P$ basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using integral $p$-adic Hodge theory, Kato and Koshikawa define a generalization of the Faltings height of an abelian variety to motives defined over a number field. Assuming the adelic Mumford-Tate conjecture, we prove a finiteness property for heights in the isogeny class of a motive, where the isogenous motives are not required to be defined over the same number field. This expands on a result of Kisin and Mocz for the Faltings height in isogeny classes of abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>Shifted twisted Yangians and affine Grassmannian islices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Associated to all quasi-split Satake diagrams of type ADE and even spherical coweights $\mu$, we introduce the shifted twisted Yangians ${}^\imath Y_\mu$ and establish their PBW bases. We construct the iGKLO representations of ${}^\imath Y_\mu$, which factor through quotients known as truncated shifted twisted Yangians (TSTY) ${}^\imath Y_\mu^\lambda$. In type AI with $\mu$ dominant, a variant of ${}^\imath Y_\mu^{N\varpi_1^\vee}$ is identified with the TSTY in another definition which are isomorphic to finite W-algebras of type BCD. We show that ${}^\imath Y_\mu$ quantizes the involutive fixed point locus ${}^\imath W_\mu$ arising from affine Grassmannians of type ADE, and expect that ${}^\imath Y_\mu^\lambda$ quantizes a top-dimensional component of the affine Grassmannian islice ${}^\imath{\bar{W}}_\mu^\lambda$. We identify the islices ${}^\imath{\bar{W}}_\mu^\lambda$ in type AI with suitable nilpotent Slodowy slices of type BCD, building on the work of Lusztig and Mirkovi\'c-Vybornov in type A. We propose a framework for producing ortho-symplectic (and hybrid) Coulomb branches from split (and nonsplit) Satake framed double quivers, which are conjectured to provide a normalization of the islices ${}^\imath{\bar{W}}_\mu^\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Gr\"obner Bases Native to Term-ordered Commutative Algebras, with Application to the Hodge Algebra of Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by better understanding the bideterminant (=product of minors) basis on the polynomial ring in $n \times m$ variables, we develop theory \&amp; algorithms for Gr\"obner bases in not only algebras with straightening law (ASLs or Hodge algebras), but in any commutative algebra over a field that comes equipped with a notion of "monomial" (generalizing the standard monomials of ASLs) and a suitable term order. Rather than treating such an algebra $A$ as a quotient of a polynomial ring and then "lifting" ideals from $A$ to ideals in the polynomial ring, the theory we develop is entirely "native" to $A$ and its given notion of monomial.
  When applied to the case of bideterminants, this enables us to package several standard results on bideterminants in a clean way that enables new results. In particular, once the theory is set up, it lets us give an almost-trivial proof of a universal Gr\"obner basis (in our sense) for the ideal of $t$-minors for any $t$. We note that here it was crucial that theory be native to $A$ and its given monomial structure, as in the standard monomial structure given by bideterminants each $t$-minor is a single variable rather than a sum of $t!$ many terms (in the "ordinary monomial" structure).</description>

      <title>On modular invariants of the truncated polynomial ring in rank four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the rank-4 case of the conjecture of Ha-Hai-Nghia for the invariant subspace of the truncated polynomial ring $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)=\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\dots,x_n^{q^m}),$ under a new, explicit technical hypothesis. Our argument extends the determinant calculus for the delta operator by deriving crucial rank-4 identities governing its interaction with the Dickson algebra. We show that the proof of the conjecture reduces to a specific vanishing property, for which we introduce a sufficient condition, the "matching hypothesis" H$_{\mathrm{match}}$}, relating the degree structures of Dickson invariants. This condition is justified by theoretical arguments and verified computationally in many cases. Combining this approach with the normalized derivation approach from our prior work, we establish the conjecture. As a result, the Lewis-Reiner-Stanton Conjecture is also confirmed for rank four under the given hypothesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a geometric Satake equivalence for affine Kac-Moody groups as an equivalence of abelian semisimple categories over algebraically closed fields. We define a well-behaved category of equivariant sheaves on the double affine grassmannian \Gr_{G}, seen as a infty-stack, that we equip with a t-structure. We obtain an Braden's hyperbolic localization theorem for such a stack and prove that the constant term functor is t-exact using dimension estimates for affine MV-cycles. We then deduce the sought-for equivalence and prove that the IC-complexes match with the irreducible highest weight representations of the Langlands dual group G^{\vee}.</description>

      <title>The Brian\c{c}on-Skoda theorem for pseudo-rational and Du~Bois singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose $J = (f_1, \dots, f_n)$ is an $n$-generated ideal in a ring $R$. We prove a general Brian\c{c}on-Skoda-type containment relating the integral closure of powers of $J$ with ordinary powers of $J$. We prove that our result implies the full standard Brian\c{c}on-Skoda containment $\overline{J^{n+k-1}} \subseteq J^k$ for pseudo-rational singularities (for instance regular rings), and even for the weaker condition of birational derived splinters. Our methods also yield the containment $\overline{J^{n+k}} \subseteq J^k$ for Du Bois singularities and even for a characteristic-free generalization.
  We also show that our containment implies other well-known closure-based Brian\c{c}on-Skoda results $\overline{J^{n+k-1}} \subseteq (J^k)^{\cl}$ where, for instance, $\cl$ is tight or plus closure in characteristic $p &gt; 0$, or $\mathrm{ep}$ closure or extension and contraction from $\widehat{R^+}$ in mixed characteristic. Our proof relies on a study of the tensor product of the derived image of the structure sheaf of a partially normalized blowup of $J$ with the Buchsbaum-Eisenbud complex (equivalently the Eagon-Northcott complex) associated to $(f_1,\dots,f_n)^k$.</description>

      <title>Vandermonde Cells Through the Lens of Positive Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric and algebraic structure of Vandermonde cells, defined as images of the standard probability simplex under the Vandermonde map given by consecutive power sum polynomials. Motivated by their combinatorial equivalence to cyclic polytopes, which are well-known examples of positive geometries and tree amplituhedra, we investigate whether Vandermonde cells admit the structure of positive geometries. We derive explicit parametrizations and algebraic equations for their boundary components, extending known results from the planar case to arbitrary dimensions. By introducing a mild generalization of the notion of positive geometry, allowing singularities within boundary interiors, we show that planar Vandermonde cells naturally fit into this extended framework. Furthermore, we study Vandermonde cells in the setting of Brown-Dupont's mixed Hodge theory formulation of positive geometries, and show that they form a genus zero pair.
  These results provide a new algebraic and geometric understanding of Vandermonde cells, establishing them as promising examples within the emerging theory of positive geometries.</description>

Abstract: We prove vanishing results for the coherent cohomology of the good reduction modulo $p$ of the Siegel variety with coefficients in some automorphic bundles. We show that for an automorphic bundle with highest weight $\lambda$ near the walls of the anti-dominant Weyl chamber, there is an integer $e \geq 0$ such that the cohomology is concentrated in degrees $[0, e]$. The accessible weights with our method are not necessarily regular and not necessarily $p$-small. Since our method is technical, we also provide an algorithm written in Sage that computes explicitly the vanishing results.</description>

Abstract: We study hyperbolicity properties of the moduli space of polarized abelian varieties (also known as the Siegel modular variety) in characteristic $p$. Our method uses the plethysm operation for Schur functors as a key ingredient and requires a new positivity notion for vector bundles in characteristic $p$ called $(\varphi,D)$-ampleness. Generalizing what was known for the Hodge line bundle, we also show that many automorphic vector bundles on the Siegel modular variety are $(\varphi,D)$-ample.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the obstruction to decomposing in degrees $\leq p$ the de Rham complex of a smooth variety over a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p$ that lifts over $W_2(k)$, and show that there exist liftable smooth projective varieties of dimension $p+1$ whose Hodge-to-de Rham spectral sequence does not degenerate at the first page. We also describe the action of the Sen operator on the de Rham complex in degrees $\leq p$ and give examples of varieties with a non-semisimple Sen operator.
  Our methods rely on the commutative algebra structure on de Rham and Hodge-Tate cohomology, and are inspired by the properties of Steenrod operations on cohomology of cosimplicial commutative algebras. The example of a non-degenerate Hodge-to-de Rham spectral sequence relies on a non-vanishing result on cohomology of groups of Lie type. We give applications to other situations such as describing extensions in the canonical filtration on de Rham, Hodge, and \'etale cohomology of an abelian variety equipped with a group action. We also show that the de Rham complex of a smooth variety over $k$ is formal as an $E_{\infty}$-algebra if and only if the variety lifts to $W_2(k)$ together with its Frobenius endomorphism.</description>

      <title>On the minimal algebraic complexity of the rank-one approximation problem for general inner products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the algebraic complexity of Euclidean distance minimization from a generic tensor to a variety of rank-one tensors. The Euclidean Distance (ED) degree of the Segre-Veronese variety counts the number of complex critical points of this optimization problem. We regard this invariant as a function of inner products. We prove that Frobenius inner product is a local minimum of the ED degree, and conjecture that it is a global minimum. We prove our conjecture in the case of matrices and symmetric binary and $3\times 3\times 3$ tensors. We discuss the above optimization problem for other algebraic varieties, classifying all possible values of the ED degree. Our approach combines tools from Singularity Theory, Morse Theory, and Algebraic Geometry.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Sigma_{g'}\to \Sigma_g$ be a cover of an orientable surface of genus g by an orientable surface of genus g', branched at n points, with Galois group H. Such a cover induces a virtual action of the mapping class group $\text{Mod}_{g,n+1}$ of a genus g surface with n+1 marked points on $H^1(\Sigma_{g'}, \mathbb{C})$. When g is large in terms of the group H, we calculate precisely the connected monodromy group of this action. The methods are Hodge-theoretic and rely on a "generic Torelli theorem with coefficients."</description>

Abstract: We prove that for a locally stable family of klt singularities with constant local volume, the ideal sequences of the minimizing valuations for the normalized volume function form a family of ideals with flat cosupport, which induces a degeneration to a locally stable family of K-semistable log Fano cone singularities. Our proof is a family version of the method of C. Xu and Z. Zhuang proving finite generation by Koll\'ar models and multiple degenerations.</description>

Abstract: Igusa proved in 1958 that the polynomial determining the supersingularity of elliptic curve in Legendre form is separable. In this paper, we get an analogous result for curves of genus $2$ in Rosenhain form. More precisely we show that the ideal determining the superspeciality of the curve has multiplicity one at every superspecial point. Igusa used a Picard-Fucks differential operator annihilating a Gau{\ss} hypergeometric series. We shall use Lauricella system (of type D) of hypergeometric differential equations in three variables.</description>

Abstract: We prove a generalization of the algebraic version of Tian conjecture. Precisely, for any smooth strictly increasing function $g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ with ${\rm log}\circ g$ convex, we define the $\mathbf{H}^g$-invariant on a Fano variety $X$ generalizing the $\mathbf{H}$-invariant introduced by Tian-Zhang-Zhang-Zhu, and show that $\mathbf{H}^g$ admits a unique minimizer. Such a minimizer will induce the $g$-optimal degeneration of the Fano variety $X$, whose limit space admits a $g'$-soliton. We present an example of Fano threefold which has the same $g$-optimal degenerations for any $g$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of Lie algebroids over a topological ringed space provides a unified framework to study various geometric structures. This geometric concept is intimately connected with well-known algebraic structures, including Gerstenhaber algebras and Batalin--Vilkovisky algebras. We introduce more general concepts such as $\mathcal{L}$-Lie algebroids and $\mathcal{A}$-Gerstenhaber algebras, associated with a given Lie algebroid $\mathcal{L}$ and Gerstenhaber algebra $\mathcal{A}$ over a topological ringed space, respectively. Following this, we explore how several standard correspondences extend within this broader framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much of the work on Shimura varieties over the last thirty years has been devoted to constructing the theory that would follow from a good notion of motives, one incorporating the Hodge, Tate, and standard conjectures. These conjectures are believed to be beyond reach, and may not even be correct as stated. I argue in this article that there exists a theory of motives, accessible to proof, weaker than Grothendieck's, but with many of the same consequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a finitely determined, quasihomogeneous, corank 1 map germ $f$ from $(\mathbb{C}^2,0)$ to $(\mathbb{C}^3,0)$. We introduce the concept of the $\mu_{\mathbf{m},\mathbf{k}}$-minimal transverse slice of $f$}. Since such a slice is a plane curve, it admits a topological normal form, which we describe explicitly. Assuming the $\mu_{\mathbf{m},\mathbf{k}}$-minimal transverse slice hypothesis, we provide a proof for the equivalence between topological triviality and Whitney equisingularity in Ruas' conjecture within this setting. We also provide a counterexample which shows that Whitney equingularity does not imply bi-Lipschitz equisingularity, given an answer to a question by Ruas. Moreover, we show that every topologically trivial $1$-parameter unfolding of $f=(f_1,f_2,f_3)$ (not necessarily with $\mu_{\mathbf{m},\mathbf{k}}$-minimal transverse slice) is of non-negative degree; that is, any additional term $\alpha$ in the deformation of $f_i$ has weighted degree not smaller than that of $f_i$. As a consequence, we provide a proof of Zariski's multiplicity conjecture for 1-parameter families of such germs.</description>

      <title>Approximate Fiber Products of Schemes and Their \'Etale Homotopical Invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical fiber product in algebraic geometry provides a powerful tool for studying loci where two morphisms to a base scheme, $\phi: X \to S$ and $\psi: Y \to S$, coincide exactly. This condition of strict equality, however, is insufficient for describing many real-world applications. This paper develops a new framework to study and quantify the nature of approximate alignment between morphisms in the context of arithmetic geometry, using the tools of {\'e}tale homotopy theory. We introduce the central object of our work, the \textit{{\'e}tale mismatch torsor}, a sheaf of torsors over the product scheme $X \times_S Y$. The structure of this sheaf serves as a rich, intrinsic, and purely algebraic object amenable to both qualitative classification and quantitative analysis of the global relationship between the two morphisms. Our main results are twofold. First, we provide a complete classification of these structures, establishing a bijection between their isomorphism classes and the first {\'e}tale cohomology group $H_{\text{\'e}t}^1(X \times_S Y, \underline{\pi_1^{\text{\'e}t}(S)})$. Second, we construct a canonical filtration on this classifying cohomology group based on the theory of infinitesimal neighborhoods. This filtration induces a new invariant, which we term the \textit{order of mismatch}, providing a hierarchical, algebraic measure for the degree of approximation between the morphisms. We apply this framework to the concrete case of generalized Howe curves over finite fields, demonstrating how both the characteristic class and its order reveal subtle arithmetic properties.</description>

Starting from quotients of complex hyperbolic space by deep enough non-uniform arithmetic lattices, we also verify the Shafarevich conjecture for their compactifications, by showing that their universal covers are Stein.</description>

Abstract: The variation operator in singularity theory maps relative homology cycles to compact cycles in the Milnor fiber using the monodromy. We construct its symplectic analogue for an isolated singularity. We define the monodromy Lagrangian Floer cohomology, which provides categorifications of the standard theorems on the variation operator and the Seifert form. The key ingredients are a special class $\Gamma$ in the symplectic cohomology of the inverse of the monodromy and its closed-open images. For isolated plane curve singularities whose A'Campo divide has depth zero, we find an exceptional collection consisting of non-compact Lagrangians in the Milnor fiber corresponding to a distinguished collection of vanishing cycles under the variation operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The group scheme of universal centralizers of a complex reductive group $G$ has a quantization called the spherical nil-DAHA. The category of modules over this ring is equivalent, as a symmetric monoidal category, to the category of bi-Whittaker $D$-modules on $G$. We construct a braided monoidal equivalence, called the Knop-Ng\^o functor, of this category with a full monoidal subcategory of the abelian category of $\mathrm{Ad}(G)$-equivariant $D$-modules, establishing a $D$-module abelian counterpart of an equivalence established by Bezrukavnikov and Deshpande, in a different way.
  As an application of our methods, we prove conjectures of Ben-Zvi and Gunningham by relating this equivalence to parabolic induction and prove a conjecture of Braverman and Kazhdan in the $D$-module setting.</description>

Given a Hopf algebra $H$ in a category such as above, it is proved that the following are equivalent: (i) $H$ is smooth as an algebra; (ii) $H$ is smooth as an $H$-comodule algebra; (iii) the product morphism $S_H^2(H^+) \to H^+$ defined on the 2nd symmetric power is monic. Working over a field $k$ of characteristic zero, we prove: (1) every ordinary Hopf algebra, i.e., such in the category $\mathsf{Vec}$ of vector spaces, satisfies the equivalent conditions (i)--(iii) and some others; (2) every Hopf algebra in the category $\mathsf{sVec}$ of super-vector spaces has a certain property that is stronger than (i). In the case where $\operatorname{char}k=p&gt;0$, there are shown weaker properties of ordinary Hopf algebras and of Hopf algebras in $\mathsf{sVec}$ or in the ind-completion $\mathsf{Ver}_p^{\mathrm{ind}}$ of the Verlinde category.</description>

      <title>A Method for Establishing Asymptotically Accurate Bounds for Extremal Roots of Eulerian Polynomials Using Polynomial Stability Preservers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the tools to bound extreme roots of multivariate real zero polynomials globally. This is done through the use of a relaxation that approximates their rigidly convex sets. This relaxation can easily be constructed using the degree $3$ truncation of the polynomial and it produces in this way a spectrahedron whose computation is relatively easy and whose size is relatively small and depending solely on the number of variables of the polynomial. As we know that, in order to be able to produce in general spectrahedral representations of rigidly convex sets it is necessary to build matrices of very big size, we try, analyze and experiment with several constructions that could increase the size of these matrices. These constructions are based principally in two main approaches: adding information about higher degree monomials or non-trivially increasing the number of variables of the original polynomial. We explore these two construction first in a general setting and see that it is necessary to particularize to certain families of polynomials in order to make them work. In particular, we are able to prove that increasing the number of variables improves the behavior of the relaxation along the diagonal in the case of Eulerian polynomials. We see that applying the relaxation to multivariate Eulerian polynomials and then looking at the univariate polynomials injected in their diagonals produces an exponential asymptotic improvement in the bounds provided. We compare these bounds with other bounds that have appeared previously in the literature and refine these previous bounds in order to study how close do the bounds provided by the relaxation are to the actual roots of the univariate Eulerian polynomials.</description>

      <title>Coderived and contraderived categories for a cotorsion pair, flat-type cotorsion pairs, and relative periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a hereditary complete cotorsion pair $(\mathsf A,\mathsf B)$ generated by a set of objects in a Grothendieck category $\mathsf K$, we construct a natural equivalence between the Becker coderived category of the left-hand class $\mathsf A$ and the Becker contraderived category of the right-hand class $\mathsf B$. We show that a nested pair of cotorsion pairs $(\mathsf A_1,\mathsf B_1)\le(\mathsf A_2,\mathsf B_2)$ provides an adjunction between the related co/contraderived categories, which is induced by a Quillen adjunction between abelian model structures. Then we specialize to the cotorsion pairs $(\mathsf F,\mathsf C)$ sandwiched between the projective and the flat cotorsion pairs in a module category, and prove that the related co/contraderived categories for $(\mathsf F,\mathsf C)$ are the same as for the projective and flat cotorsion pairs if and only if two periodicity properties hold for $\mathsf F$ and $\mathsf C$. The same applies to the cotorsion pairs sandwiched between the very flat and the flat cotorsion pairs in the category of quasi-coherent sheaves over a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme. More generally, we define and discuss cotorsion pairs of the very flat type and of the flat type in Grothendieck categories (as well as exact categories of the flat type), and work with a cotorsion pair sandwiched between one of the very flat type and one of the flat type. The motivating examples of the classes of flaprojective modules and relatively cotorsion modules for a ring homomorphism are discussed, and periodicity conjectures formulated for them.</description>

      <title>The isotropy group of a derivation on a Danielewski-type algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic zero, we consider in this paper $k$-algebras of the form $$A_{c,q}=k[x,y,z]/\big(c(x)z-q(x,y)\big),$$ where $c(x)\in k[x]$ is a polynomial of degree at least two and $q(x,y)\in k[x,y]$ is a quasi-monic polynomial of degree at least two with respect to $y$. We give a complete description of the $k$-automorphism group of $A_{c,q}$ as an abstract group. Moreover, for every non-locally nilpotent $k$-derivation $\delta$ of $A_{c,q}$ we prove that the isotropy group of $\delta$ is a linear algebraic group of dimension at most three.</description>
