      <title>Analysis of nonlocal smart beams following fractional-order constitutive relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a fractional-calculus based constitutive model for capturing nonlocal interactions over the multiphysics response in solids. More specifically, we develop constitutive relations for nonlocal piezoelectricity incorporating fractional-order kinematic relations to capture the long-range interactions over electrical and mechanical field variables. This study breaks new ground by developing fractional-order constitutive models for a two-way multiphysics (electro-mechanical) coupling, specifically the direct and converse piezoelectric effect. It is expected that long-range interactions over each field variable (elastic and electrical) can be leveraged to develop metastructures with enhanced multiphysics coupling. To better illustrate this, we choose the example of a smart beam composed of a nonlocal substrate and a piezoelectric layer. We establish the analytical and numerical framework to analyze nonlocal smart beams based on variational principles. The fractional-Finite Element (f-FE) numerical solver, facilitating multiphysics coupling, undergoes comprehensive validation through multiple case studies. Finally, detailed studies point towards tuning the multiphysics coupling possible via nonlocal interactions across the domain.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Networks-Tensor Decomposition (C-HiDeNN-TD): a scalable surrogate modeling approach for large-scale physical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common trend in simulation-driven engineering applications is the ever-increasing size and complexity of the problem, where classical numerical methods typically suffer from significant computational time and huge memory cost. Methods based on artificial intelligence have been extensively investigated to accelerate partial differential equations (PDE) solvers using data-driven surrogates. However, most data-driven surrogates require an extremely large amount of training data. In this paper, we propose the Convolutional Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network-Tensor Decomposition (C-HiDeNN-TD) method, which can directly obtain surrogate models by solving large-scale space-time PDE without generating any offline training data. We compare the performance of the proposed method against classical numerical methods for extremely large-scale systems.</description>

      <title>InvariantStock: Learning Invariant Features for Mastering the Shifting Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting stock returns is crucial for effective portfolio management. However, existing methods often overlook a fundamental issue in the market, namely, distribution shifts, making them less practical for predicting future markets or newly listed stocks. This study introduces a novel approach to address this challenge by focusing on the acquisition of invariant features across various environments, thereby enhancing robustness against distribution shifts. Specifically, we present InvariantStock, a designed learning framework comprising two key modules: an environment-aware prediction module and an environment-agnostic module. Through the designed learning of these two modules, the proposed method can learn invariant features across different environments in a straightforward manner, significantly improving its ability to handle distribution shifts in diverse market settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed InvariantStock not only delivers robust and accurate predictions but also outperforms existing baseline methods in both prediction tasks and backtesting within the dynamically changing markets of China and the United States.</description>

      <title>Multiagent Reinforcement Learning Enhanced Decision-making of Crew Agents During Floor Construction Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained simulation of floor construction processes is essential for supporting lean management and the integration of information technology. However, existing research does not adequately address the on-site decision-making of constructors in selecting tasks and determining their sequence within the entire construction process. Moreover, decision-making frameworks from computer science and robotics are not directly applicable to construction scenarios. To facilitate intelligent simulation in construction, this study introduces the Construction Markov Decision Process (CMDP). The primary contribution of this CMDP framework lies in its construction knowledge in decision, observation modifications and policy design, enabling agents to perceive the construction state and follow policy guidance to evaluate and reach various range of targets for optimizing the planning of construction activities. The CMDP is developed on the Unity platform, utilizing a two-stage training approach with the multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm. A case study demonstrates the effectiveness of this framework: the low-level policy successfully simulates the construction process in continuous space, facilitating policy testing and training focused on reducing conflicts and blockages among crews; and the high-level policy improving the spatio-temporal planning of construction activities, generating construction patterns in distinct phases, leading to the discovery of new construction insights.</description>

      <title>Contaminant Dispersion Simulation in a Digital Twin Framework for Critical Infrastructure Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A digital twin framework for rapid predictions of atmospheric contaminant dispersion is developed to support informed decision making in emergency situations. In an offline preparation phase, the geometry of a built environment is discretized with a finite element (FEM) mesh and a reduced-order model (ROM) of the steady-state incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is constructed for various wind conditions. Subsequently, the ROM provides a fast wind field estimate based on the current wind speed during the online phase. To support crisis management, several methodological building blocks are combined. Automatic FEM meshing of built environments and numerical flow solver capabilities enable fast forward-simulations of contaminant dispersion using the advection-diffusion equation as transport model. Further methods are integrated in the framework to address inverse problems such as contaminant source localization based on sparse concentration measurements. Additionally, the contaminant dispersion model is coupled with a continuum-based pedestrian crowd model to derive fast and safe evacuation routes for people seeking protection during contaminant dispersion emergencies. The interplay of these methods is demonstrated in two critical infrastructure protection (CIP) test cases. Based on simulated real world interaction (measurements, communication), this article demonstrates a full Measurement-Inversion-Prediction-Steering (MIPS) cycle including a Bayesian formulation of the inverse problem.</description>

      <title>ADformer: A Multi-Granularity Transformer for EEG-Based Alzheimer's Disease Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) has emerged as a cost-effective and efficient method for supporting neurologists in assessing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing approaches predominantly utilize handcrafted features or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods. However, the potential of the transformer architecture, which has shown promising results in various time series analysis tasks, remains underexplored in interpreting EEG for AD assessment. Furthermore, most studies are evaluated on the subject-dependent setup but often overlook the significance of the subject-independent setup. To address these gaps, we present ADformer, a novel multi-granularity transformer designed to capture temporal and spatial features to learn effective EEG representations. We employ multi-granularity data embedding across both dimensions and utilize self-attention to learn local features within each granularity and global features among different granularities. We conduct experiments across 5 datasets with a total of 525 subjects in setups including subject-dependent, subject-independent, and leave-subjects-out. Our results show that ADformer outperforms existing methods in most evaluations, achieving F1 scores of 75.19% and 93.58% on two large datasets with 65 subjects and 126 subjects, respectively, in distinguishing AD and healthy control (HC) subjects under the challenging subject-independent setup.</description>

      <title>A fast solver for the spatially homogeneous electron Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for the velocity-space, spatially homogeneous, collisional Boltzmann equation for electron transport in low-temperature plasma (LTP) conditions. Modeling LTP plasmas is useful in many applications, including advanced manufacturing, material processing, semiconductor processing, and hypersonics, to name a few. Most state-of-the-art methods for electron kinetics are based on Monte-Carlo sampling for collisions combined with Lagrangian particle-in-cell methods. We discuss an Eulerian solver that approximates the electron velocity distribution function using spherical harmonics (angular components) and B-splines (energy component). Our solver supports electron-heavy elastic and inelastic binary collisions, electron-electron Coulomb interactions, steady-state and transient dynamics, and an arbitrary nmber of angular terms in the electron distribution function. We report convergence results and compare our solver to two other codes: an in-house particle Monte-Carlo ethod; and Bolsig+, a state-of-the-art Eulerian solver for electron transport in LTPs. Furthermore, we use our solver to study the relaxation time scales of the higher-order anisotropic correction terms. Our code is open-source and provides an interface that allows coupling to multiphysics simulations of low-temperature plasmas.</description>

      <title>Advancing Machine Learning in Industry 4.0: Benchmark Framework for Rare-event Prediction in Chemical Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previously, using forward-flux sampling (FFS) and machine learning (ML), we developed multivariate alarm systems to counter rare un-postulated abnormal events. Our alarm systems utilized ML-based predictive models to quantify committer probabilities as functions of key process variables (e.g., temperature, concentrations, and the like), with these data obtained in FFS simulations. Herein, we introduce a novel and comprehensive benchmark framework for rare-event prediction, comparing ML algorithms of varying complexity, including Linear Support-Vector Regressor and k-Nearest Neighbors, to more sophisticated algorithms, such as Random Forests, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Dense Neural Networks, and TabNet. This evaluation uses comprehensive performance metrics, such as: $\textit{RMSE}$, model training, testing, hyperparameter tuning and deployment times, and number and efficiency of alarms. These balance model accuracy, computational efficiency, and alarm-system efficiency, identifying optimal ML strategies for predicting abnormal rare events, enabling operators to obtain safer and more reliable plant operations.</description>

      <title>Rapid GPU-Based Pangenome Graph Layout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational Pangenomics is an emerging field that studies genetic variation using a graph structure encompassing multiple genomes. Visualizing pangenome graphs is vital for understanding genome diversity. Yet, handling large graphs can be challenging due to the high computational demands of the graph layout process.
  In this work, we conduct a thorough performance characterization of a state-of-the-art pangenome graph layout algorithm, revealing significant data-level parallelism, which makes GPUs a promising option for compute acceleration. However, irregular data access and the algorithm's memory-bound nature present significant hurdles. To overcome these challenges, we develop a solution implementing three key optimizations: a cache-friendly data layout, coalesced random states, and warp merging. Additionally, we propose a quantitative metric for scalable evaluation of pangenome layout quality.
  Evaluated on 24 human whole-chromosome pangenomes, our GPU-based solution achieves a 57.3x speedup over the state-of-the-art multithreaded CPU baseline without layout quality loss, reducing execution time from hours to minutes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generation of VLSI layout patterns is essential for a wide range of Design For Manufacturability (DFM) studies. In this study, we investigate the potential of generative machine learning models for creating design rule legal metal layout patterns. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model can generate legal patterns in complex design rule settings and achieves a high diversity score. The designed system, with its flexible settings, supports both pattern generation with localized changes, and design rule violation correction. Our methodology is validated on Intel 18A Process Design Kit (PDK) and can produce a wide range of DRC-compliant pattern libraries with only 20 starter patterns.</description>

      <title>AstroMAE: Redshift Prediction Using a Masked Autoencoder with a Novel Fine-Tuning Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Redshift prediction is a fundamental task in astronomy, essential for understanding the expansion of the universe and determining the distances of astronomical objects. Accurate redshift prediction plays a crucial role in advancing our knowledge of the cosmos. Machine learning (ML) methods, renowned for their precision and speed, offer promising solutions for this complex task. However, traditional ML algorithms heavily depend on labeled data and task-specific feature extraction. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AstroMAE, an innovative approach that pretrains a vision transformer encoder using a masked autoencoder method on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images. This technique enables the encoder to capture the global patterns within the data without relying on labels. To the best of our knowledge, AstroMAE represents the first application of a masked autoencoder to astronomical data. By ignoring labels during the pretraining phase, the encoder gathers a general understanding of the data. The pretrained encoder is subsequently fine-tuned within a specialized architecture tailored for redshift prediction. We evaluate our model against various vision transformer architectures and CNN-based models, demonstrating the superior performance of AstroMAEs pretrained model and fine-tuning architecture.</description>

Abstract: To monitor the seismic hazard in the Groningen gas field, we modify the rate-and-state model that relates changes in pore pressure to induced seismic hazard by allowing for noise in pore pressure measurements and by explicitly taking into account gas production volumes. We analyse the first and second-moment structure of the resulting Cox process, propose an unbiased estimating equation approach for the unknown model parameters and derive the posterior distribution of the driving random measure. We use a parallel Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm for sampling from the posterior and to monitor the hazard.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate the electrical response of multiple disjoint biological 3D cells undergoing an electropermeabilization process. Instead of solving the boundary value problem in the unbounded volume, we reduce it to a system of boundary integrals equations--the local Multiple Traces Formulation--coupled with nonlinear dynamics on the cell membranes. Though in time the model is highly non-linear and poorly regular, the smooth geometry allows for boundary unknowns to be spatially approximated by spherical harmonics. This leads to spectral convergence rates in space. In time, we use a multistep semi-implicit scheme. To ensure stability, the time step needs to be bounded by the smallest characteristic time of the system. Numerical results are provided to validate our claims and future enhancements are pointed out.</description>

      <title>Chemical Reaction Neural Networks for Fitting Accelerating Rate Calorimetry Data</title>

Abstract: As the demand for lithium-ion batteries rapidly increases there is a need to design these cells in a safe manner to mitigate thermal runaway. Thermal runaway in batteries leads to an uncontrollable temperature rise and potentially fires, which is a major safety concern. Typically, when modelling the chemical kinetics of thermal runaway calorimetry data ( e.g. Accelerating Rate Calorimetry (ARC)) is needed to determine the temperature-driven decomposition kinetics. Conventional methods of fitting Arrhenius Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) thermal runaway models to Accelerated Rate Calorimetry (ARC) data make several assumptions that reduce the fidelity and generalizability of the obtained model. In this paper, Chemical Reaction Neural Networks (CRNNs) are trained to fit the kinetic parameters of N-equation Arrhenius ODEs to ARC data obtained from a Molicel 21700 P45B. The models are found to be better approximations of the experimental data. The flexibility of the method is demonstrated by experimenting with two-equation and four-equation models. Thermal runaway simulations are conducted in 3D using the obtained kinetic parameters, showing the applicability of the obtained thermal runaway models to large-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Controllable Financial Market Generation with Diffusion Guided Meta Agent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Order flow modeling stands as the most fundamental and essential financial task, as orders embody the minimal unit within a financial market. However, current approaches often result in unsatisfactory fidelity in generating order flow, and their generation lacks controllability, thereby limiting their application scenario. In this paper, we advocate incorporating controllability into the market generation process, and propose a Diffusion Guided meta Agent(DiGA) model to address the problem. Specifically, we utilize a diffusion model to capture dynamics of market state represented by time-evolving distribution parameters about mid-price return rate and order arrival rate, and define a meta agent with financial economic priors to generate orders from the corresponding distributions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits outstanding controllability and fidelity in generation. Furthermore, we validate DiGA's effectiveness as generative environment for downstream financial applications.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed-dimensional beam-shell-solid couplings in linear Cosserat continua via tangential differential calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to the coupling of mixed-dimensional continua by employing the mathematically enriched linear Cosserat micropolar model. The kinematical reduction of the model to lower dimensional domains leaves its fundamental degrees of freedom intact. Consequently, the degrees of freedom intrinsically agree even at the interface with a domain of a different dimensionality. Thus, this approach circumvents the need for intermediate finite elements or mortar methods. We introduce the derivations of all models of various dimensions using tangential differential calculus. The coupling itself is then achieved by defining a mixed-dimensional action functional with consistent Sobolev trace operators. Finally, we present numerical examples involving a three-dimensional silicone-rubber block reinforced with a curved graphite shell on its lower surface, a three-dimensional silver block reinforced with a graphite plate and beams, and lastly, intersecting silver shells reinforced with graphite beams.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Blockchain and ANFIS for Optimal Supply Chain Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The supply chain is a critical segment of the product manufacturing cycle, continuously influenced by risky, uncertain, and undesirable events. Optimizing flexibility in the supply chain presents a complex, multi-objective, and nonlinear programming challenge. In the poultry supply chain, the development of mass customization capabilities has led manufacturing companies to increasingly focus on offering tailored and customized services for individual products. To safeguard against data tampering and ensure the integrity of setup costs and overall profitability, a multi-signature decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, integrated with the IoT on a blockchain platform, is proposed. Managing the poultry supply chain involves uncertainties that may not account for parameters such as delivery time to retailers, reorder time, and the number of requested products. To address these challenges, this study employs an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), combining neural networks with fuzzy logic to compensate for the lack of data training in parameter identification. Through MATLAB simulations, the study investigates the average shop delivery duration, the reorder time, and the number of products per order. By implementing the proposed technique, the average delivery time decreases from 40 to 37 minutes, the reorder time decreases from five to four days, and the quantity of items requested per order grows from six to eleven. Additionally, the ANFIS model enhances overall supply chain performance by reducing transaction times by 15\% compared to conventional systems, thereby improving real-time responsiveness and boosting transparency in supply chain operations, effectively resolving operational issues.</description>
