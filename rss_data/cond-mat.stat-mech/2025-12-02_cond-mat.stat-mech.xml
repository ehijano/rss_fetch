      <title>Dissipation and fluctuations of CMOS ring oscillators close to criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a thermodynamically consistent model of CMOS-based ring oscillators near the onset of coherent voltage oscillations. For driving voltages close to the critical value, we derive the normal form of the Hopf bifurcation that underlies the oscillation transition in the thermodynamic limit. Using this normal form, we determine the phase and amplitude dynamics, and demonstrate that entropy dissipation decreases in the oscillating state for ring oscillators with more than three inverters. These findings culminate in a stability-dissipation relation, which links the observed decrease in dissipation to an increase in the local stability of the oscillating state. Next, we characterize finite-size fluctuations of the amplitude and phase near the critical voltage, using a stochastic version of the normal form. We demonstrate that close to the transition, finite-size fluctuations remain important at arbitrary system size, introducing oscillations even below the critical voltage. We further show that these noise-induced oscillations have an anomalously short decoherence time that scales sub-linearly with the system-size, in contrast to the behavior far from criticality.</description>

      <title>First Passage Resetting Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional gas of $N$ Brownian particles that diffuse independently but are simultaneously reset whenever any of them reaches a fixed threshold located at $L &gt; 0$. For any $N &gt; 2$, the system reaches a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) at long-times with strong long-range correlations. These correlations emerge purely from the dynamics, and not from built-in interactions. Despite being strongly correlated, the NESS has a solvable structure that allows for an exact computation of several physical observables, both global and local. These include the average density profile, the distribution of the position of the $k$-th ordered particles, the distribution of the gap between two consecutive particles and the full counting statistics, i.e., the distribution of the number of particles in a finite interval around the origin.</description>

      <title>Universal asymptotic solution of the Fokker-Planck equation with time-dependent periodic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian motion, as one of the most fundamental concepts in statistical physics, has everlasting interests in interdisciplinary fields in the past century. Although this motion with static potentials have been widely explored, its physics in time-dependent periodic potentials are far less well understood. Here we generalize this motion to the realm of time-dependent periodic potentials, showing that the asymptotic solution of the probability distribution function (PDF) can have a universal form, that is, a Boltzmann weight multiplied by a Gaussian envelope function. We derive a partial equation for this Boltzmann weight and demonstrate that many different potentials can give the same Boltzmann weight. We first present an exact solvable model to illustrate the validity of our solution. For the periodic potential with a time-dependent tilt potential, we can determine the Boltzmann weight by numerical solving the partial equation. These results are confirmed by solving the Langevin equation numerically. With this idea, we can determine the asymptotic solution of the Fokker-Planck equation, in which the entropy satisfies the thermodynamic law. Our results can have wide applications, including quasi-periodic potentials, two-dimensional potentials and even with models with inertia, which should greatly broaden our perspective of Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Heider balance of a square lattice in an external field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the Heider model in the presence of an external social field. This field was introduced to break the symmetry between the probabilities of hostile and friendly relationships. We consider the system in the presence of fluctuations generated by thermal noise and present the results of a comparative study of two-dimensional triangular and square networks with periodic boundary conditions. The results were obtained using three different methods: exact calculations for small systems, Monte Carlo simulations of medium-sized systems, and exact calculations in the thermodynamic limit (corresponding to infinite size) of certain limiting cases for which analytical solutions are possible. In particular, we exploit the recently discovered equivalence between structurally balanced systems and the Ising model to derive an exact form of the edge magnetization susceptibility for systems in Heider equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Scaling of a Mutual-Information Distance in One-dimensional Quantum Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric scaling relation that characterizes the local scale behavior of correlations using the informational distance $d_E = K_0/\sqrt{I}$, where $I$ is the mutual information. We define a geometric conversion factor, $G \equiv \partial_r d_E$, which quantifies the local scale. We show that $G$ relates directly to $I$ via $G \propto I^{\kappa}$. For systems with power-law correlations $I(r) \sim r^{-X}$, the metric scaling exponent is $\kappa = 1/X - 1/2$. A key consequence is that the geometric scale $G$ is uniform (position-independent) if and only if $\kappa = 0$, which occurs precisely at $X = 2$. This identifies $X = 2$ as the unique condition for a uniform and metric informational distance. We validate this relation using DMRG simulations of the 1D XXZ chain and exact results for the XX model. We demonstrate two falsifiable diagnostics: (i) $G(r)$ is flat in the bulk at criticality ($X \approx 2$) but varies strongly when gapped; (ii) a coordinate-agnostic slope test of $\log G$ versus $\log I$ at the XX benchmark ($X = 2$) yields $\kappa \simeq 0$. This approach provides a coordinate-independent method for identifying scaling regimes that helps to reduce ambiguity from non-universal amplitudes and from the fitting choices in standard power-law analyses, and defines a simple post-processing pipeline that can be applied directly to numerical or experimental mutual-information data.</description>

      <title>A mean-field theory of effective normal modes in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a non-perturbative, mean-field theory for the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou model with quartic interaction, capturing the quasiperiodic features shown by the system at all energies in the thermodynamic limit. Starting from the true Hamiltonian $H$ of the system with $N$ degrees of freedom, we introduce a mean-field Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$ such that the difference $h_N=(H-\mathcal{H})/N$, considered as a random variable with respect to the Gibbs measure, tends to zero as $N\to\infty$, in probabilistic sense. The dynamics of the mean-field Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$ consists of $N$ independent oscillation modes with renormalized frequencies $\Omega_k = \omega_k\sqrt{1+\gamma(\varepsilon)}$, $\omega_k$ being the frequency of the $k$-th normal mode of the linearized system, whereas $\gamma(\varepsilon)$ is an explicit function of the specific energy $\varepsilon$ of the system. Analytical predictions drawn from the effective Langevin equations ruling the dynamics of such oscillation modes are successfully compared with the numerical data from the original Hamiltonian dynamics. Such a simple decomposition of the true dynamics into $N$ effective normal modes holds at all energy scales, i.e. from the quasi-integrable regime to the strongly chaotic one.</description>

      <title>Canonical Distribution of the Occupancy Numbers of Bosonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper works out the canonical probability distribution of the occupancy numbers of a bosonic system and shows that canonical typicality applies to the canonical density operator of the occupancy numbers. The result is that, if, as it is today standard, the canonical system's mixed state is obtained by tracing out the environment from any typical pure state of the universe, then asymptotically the canonical probability distribution of system's occupancy numbers tends in probability to the multinomial distribution. The paper also shows that the currently accepted probability distribution of the occupancy numbers of a system with fixed number of particles is not compatible with the commonly accepted notion of canonical system.</description>

      <title>Adaptation to time-varying environments in a reaction-diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spatially-extended system of chemical reactions exhibiting adaptation to time-dependent influxes of reactants. Here adaptation is defined as improved reproductive success, namely the ability of one of the many locally stable states available to the system to expand in space at the expense of other states. We find that adaptation can arise simply by environmental exposure to sequences of varying influxes. This adaptation is specific to the temporal sequence yet flexible enough to generalize to related sequences. It is enhanced through repeated exposure to the same environmental sequence, representing a form of learning, and through spatial interactions, enabling natural selection to act and representing a form of collective learning. Finally, adaptation benefits from a nearby adapted state, representing a form of teacher-guided learning. By combining environmental drives and reproduction within a stochastic reaction-diffusion dynamics framework, our model lays a foundation for a theory of adaptation grounded in physical principles.</description>

      <title>Violation of the method of images in non-Markovian processes and its connection to stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a failure of the wide-spread method of images solution to describe the time evolution of probability distribution in diffusive processes with memory. For a path that touches a target during stochastic evolution, we define its conjugate twin of reflected path, and show that their path probability ratio obeys a relation analogous to the fluctuation theorem. With a key quantity properly identified as the heat, the resultant thermodynamic interpretation of the processes provides a quantitative basis as well as an intuitive physical picture on how and why the method of images breaks down for non-Markovian processes.</description>

      <title>The stochastic discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation: microscopic derivation and finite-temperature phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a stochastic version of the one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation (DNSE), which is derived from first principles, and thus possesses all the properties required by statistical mechanics, such as detailed balance and the H-theorem. The stochastic version shows disordered and localised dynamics, and displays a corresponding phase transition at a finite temperature value. The phase transition can be captured in a quantitative way by a mean-field type approach. The corresponding coarsening dynamics shows an unexpected dependence on the noise strength, which is reminiscent of stochastic resonance. The phase transition is linked with negative temperature phase transitions, which have been reported recently for the Hamiltonian dynamics of the DNSE. Our approach gives a clue to how these negative temperature phase transitions can be implemented in experimental setups, which are inevitably coupled to a positive temperature heat bath.</description>

      <title>Path-integrals and optimal paths for the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the path-integral representation of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by Riemann-Liouville fractional Gaussian noise, for both the subdiffusive and superdiffusive regimes. We express the corresponding action, which is a quadratic functional of individual trajectories of the process, in two alternative but equivalent forms: either as a fractional integral or as a double integral with a nonlocal kernel. Moreover, we determine in closed form the optimal (action-minimizing) paths conditioned to reach a prescribed point at a fixed time moment and discuss their behavior, which appears to be non-intuitive for subdiffusive processes in the presence of a strong confining potential.</description>

      <title>Quasistatic response for nonequilibrium processes: evaluating the Berry potential and curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how introducing slow, time-dependent perturbations to a steady, nonequilibrium process alters the expected (excess) values of important observables, such as the dynamical activity and entropy flux. When we make a cyclic thermodynamic transformation, the excesses are described in terms of a (geometric) Berry phase with corresponding Berry potential and Berry curvature quantifying the response. Focussing on Markov jump processes, we show how a non-zero Berry curvature leads to a breakdown of the thermodynamic Maxwell relations and of the Clausius heat theorem. We also present a variant of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in which the parameters follow a curve with vanishing Berry curvature, but the system still experiences a nonzero Berry phase. Finally, we identify (sufficient) no-localization conditions in terms of mean first-passage times under which the corresponding Berry potentials and curvatures vanish at absolute zero, extending, for arbitrary driving, e.g. the case of vanishing heat capacity as for the Nernst postulate.</description>

      <title>Digamma-Function Representation of the Ground-State Energy in Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg $\mathrm{XXX}_s$ Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain remains a central framework for exploring exactly solvable models within quantum integrable systems. For the isotropic XXX chain, the ground-state energy per site of the spin-1/2 system is famously given by ln2. Extending the classic formulations to arbitrary spin-s, Takhtajan and Babujian derived two separate finite-series expressions for integer and half-integer spin representations. Current work introduces a unified analytical expression for the ground-state energy density in terms of the digamma function. This compact formulation reproduces both Takhtajan Babujian series.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Geometry Through Second Order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common approach to quantify excess dissipation in slowly driven thermodynamic processes is through the use of a Riemannian metric on the space of control parameters, where optimal driving protocols follow geodesics. Near phase transitions, this geometric picture breaks down as the metric diverges and geodesics may cease to exist. Using Widom scaling, we analyze this framework for several universality classes and show that in some cases the thermodynamic length across the phase transition remains finite. We then demonstrate a numerical approach for computing minimal paths in such systems. We show that, in some regimes, the shortest path crosses the phase transition - even when alternative paths confined to a single phase exist.</description>

      <title>Piston-Like Information Engine I: Universal Features in Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to measure the stochastic degrees of freedom of a thermal system enables the extraction of energy from an equilibrium heat bath. This is the underlying principle of Maxwell's demon and subsequent information engines. Here, we experimentally realize a microscopic information engine configured as a compressible piston containing a thermalized colloidal suspension. The particle positions are recorded to identify when a predefined region near the wall is empty, allowing the piston to compress the colloidal suspension without applying work on the system. We find that the stored compression energy is universally set by the probability of a positive measurement outcome, which in turn is controlled by parameters such as density and compression step size. We further demonstrate that mechanical work can be extracted during the decompression of the piston, thereby closing the engine's operating cycle.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Two-dimensional Long-range Heisenberg Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of decaying long-range (LR) interactions $1/r^{d+\sigma}$ has drawn persistent interest in understanding how system properties evolve with $\sigma$. The Sak's criterion and the extended Mermin-Wagner theorem have gained broad acceptance in predicting the critical and low-temperature (low-T) behaviors of such systems. We perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for the LR-Heisenberg model in two dimensions (2D) up to linear size $L=8192$, and show that, as long as for $\sigma \leq 2$, the system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking, via a single continuous phase transition, and develops a generic long-range order. We then introduce an LR simple random walk (LR-SRW) with the total walk length fixed at O($L^d$), satisfying the extensivity of statistical systems, and observe that the LR-SRW can faithfully characterize the low-T scaling behaviors of the LR-Heisenberg model in both 2D and 3D, as induced by Goldstone-mode fluctuations. Finally, based on insights from LR-SRW, we propose a general criterion for the phase transition and the low-T properties of LR statistical systems with continuous symmetry in any spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Dilute Limit Coarsening with an Anisotropic Surface Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of an anisotropic surface tension on the late-stage dilute phase separation dynamics, revisiting the seminal Lifshitz-Slyozov (LS) theory, which traditionally relies on the assumption of isotropic surface tension. Using a perturbative treatment for weak anisotropy, we demonstrate that although the characteristic $t^{1/3}$ drop growth law remains unchanged, the anisotropy causes a significant breakdown of morphological universality. Specifically, we calculate explicitly a one-parameter family of nonequilibrium drop shapes that depend on the scaled drop size. These shapes are close to the equilibrium Wulff shape, but the smaller drops are more spherical and the larger drops have an enhanced anisotropy in comparison to the Wulff shape. We also demonstrate that the the drop size distribution is modified from the isotropic LS distribution at second order in the anisotropy strength.</description>

      <title>Geometric Regularity in Deterministic Sampling of Diffusion-based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10177v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics of diffusion generative models: each simulated sampling trajectory along the gradient field lies within an extremely low-dimensional subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical boomerang shape, regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content. We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories, particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing deterministic numerical solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image generation performance, especially in regions with only 5 - 10 function evaluations.</description>

      <title>Tuning Universality in Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit crackling-like avalanches whose origin lacks a mechanistic explanation. Here, I derive a stochastic theory of deep information propagation (DIP) by incorporating Central Limit Theorem (CLT)-level fluctuations. Four effective couplings $(r, h, D_1, D_2)$ characterize the dynamics, yielding a Landau description of the static exponents and a Directed Percolation (DP) structure of activity cascades. Tuning the couplings selects between avalanche dynamics generated by a Brownian Motion (BM) in a logarithmic trap and an absorbed free BM, each corresponding to a distinct universality classes. Numerical simulations confirm the theory and demonstrate that activation function design controls the collective dynamics in random DNNs.</description>

      <title>Precise computation of universal corner entanglement entropy at 2+1 dimension: From Ising to Gaussian quantum critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing the subleading logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy (EE) of (2+1)d quantum many-body systems remains a significant challenge, despite its critical role in revealing universal information about quantum states and quantum critical points (QCPs). Capitalizing on recent algorithmic advances that enable the stable calculation of EE as an exponential observable, we develop a {\it bubble basis} projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to precisely and efficiently compute the universal corner EE along a parameter trajectory connecting the Ising and Gaussian QCPs; where in the latter case there exists an analytic value to benchmark with. Our approach eliminates the dominant area-law term directly within the QMC sampling, thereby promoting the coveted subleading logarithmic term to the leading contribution. We apply this technique to calculate the EE in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction, tracing a path from the Ising to the Gaussian QCPs and then to the first-order transition. The consistent values obtained for the universal corner EE along the path validate the reliability and precision of our approach for extracting challenging entanglement properties. These results establish the long-sought connection between the universal values of an exactly solvable limit and those of a strongly correlated regime at (2+1)d.</description>

      <title>Avalanches in active glasses with finite persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the statistics of avalanches in glassy systems of active particles with finite persistence, with and without an externally applied shear. In departing from the infinite-persistence limit and exploring the interplay of internal activity and external driving, we uncover when and why active and passive systems display similar avalanche statistics and where these analogies fail. We find that power-law distributed stress drops emerge only when activity builds long enough correlations, controlled by the persistence length, with exponents that vary from the purely strain-driven case, to the purely activity-driven case, in a smooth fashion. The local structure and scaling of avalanches of plastic rearrangements remains universal across both limit cases, supporting an interpretation of activity as increasing the typical size of the regions involved in a given avalanche. Our results bridge quasistatic shear strain and finite-persistence active yielding, showing that avalanches driven by self-propulsion retain the characteristic fingerprints of long-range stress propagation.</description>

      <title>No boundary density matrix in elliptic de Sitter dS/$\mathbb{Z}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elliptic de Sitter (dS) spacetime dS$/\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a non-time-orientable spacetime obtained by imposing an antipodal identification to global dS. Unlike QFT on global dS, whose vacuum state can be prepared by a no-boundary Euclidean path integral, the Euclidean elliptic dS does not define a wavefunction in the usual sense. We propose instead that the path integral on the Euclidean elliptic dS defines a no-boundary density matrix. As an explicit example, we study the free Dirac fermion CFT in two-dimensional elliptic dS and analytically compute the von Neumann and the R\'enyi entropies of this density matrix. The calculation reduces to correlation functions of vertex operators on non-orientable surfaces. As a by-product, we compute the time evolution of entanglement entropy following a crosscap quench in free Dirac fermion CFT. We also comment on a striking feature of free QFT in elliptic dS: its global Hilbert space is one-dimensional, wheres the Hilbert space associated to each observer is a nontrivial Fock space.</description>

      <title>Braided QM and Majorana qubits at third root of unity: a color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebra framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebras graded by the abelian groups $Z_3^2$, $Z_2^p\times Z_3^2$ for $p=1,2,3$, and investigate the properties of their associated multi-particle quantum paraoscillators. In the Rittenberg-Wyler's color Lie (super)algebras framework the above abelian groups are the simplest ones which induce mixed brackets interpolating commutators and anticommutators. These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.</description>

      <title>Generalized Boltzmann-Gibbs Distribution and the Electronic Partition Function Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper generalizes the entropy maximization problem leading to the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution through the nonadditive entropy $S_{q,s}(p)=k_{s}\sum^{W}_{i\geq1}p_{i}\ln_{q}1/p_{i}$, $q\in(0,1)$, which is a rescaled version of $S_{q}$ \cite{Tsallis1988} by a factor $k_{s}=k^{q}(e_{\max}/(W^{\sigma}-1))^{1-q}$, $\sigma&gt;0$, varying according to the underlying energy spectrum and satisfying $k_{s}\rightarrow k$ (Boltzmann constant) as $q\rightarrow 1$. The maximization problem based on $S_{q,s}$ is used to derive analytical generalizations of the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution for the case of an energy spectrum that uniformly approaches a continuous, unbounded limit with a common degeneracy, the harmonic oscillator, and the one-dimensional box. Furthermore, I demonstrate that this generalized problem yields a two-tier model with finite structural parameters $\beta$ for the hydrogen atom in free space and, therefore, can be used to circumvent the Electronic Partition Function Paradox and obtain a family of well-defined thermodynamic behaviors indexed by $q\in(0,1)$. In particular, for $q=0.5$, the specific heat of the free hydrogen atom becomes the Boltzmann constant. Finally, it is shown that all the limiting processes involved in these four cases lead naturally to the same definition of the scale factor $k_{s}$ that characterizes $S_{q,s}$ (``s'' stands, in this context, for ``spectrum'') in order to grant finite, smooth, macroscopically observable temperature values that are related to the entropic functional by $\partial S_{q,s}/\partial U=1/\vert T\vert^{q}_{\pm}$, which recovers $\partial S_{BG}/\partial U=1/T$ \cite{Clausius1865} as $q\rightarrow1$.</description>

      <title>Quantum ramp secret sharing from Haar scrambling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling has emerged as a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, assessing benchmarking protocols, and even investigating exotic black hole models. During quantum information scrambling, localized quantum information disperses across the entire system, hiding from the observers who can only access part of it. On the other side, we have a fundamental cryptographic primitive called secret-sharing schemes, where a dealer shares a quantum secret with a group of parties, such that any subset of parties above a specific threshold size can reconstruct it. In this paper, we demonstrate that two protocols, Haar scrambling, which serves as a baseline for other scrambling techniques, and quantum secret sharing, are indeed equivalent. The scheme one gets out of this is of a ramp secret-sharing nature rather than a threshold scheme. We expect this because of the inherent randomness present in Haar unitaries. Moreover, by varying the purity of the initial states, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain all possible types of ramp secret-sharing schemes. Furthermore, utilizing complexity theoretic arguments, we argue that the protocol can be implemented efficiently, i.e., in polynomial time. Finally, we explore potential applications, ranging from security implications for distributed quantum networks to cryptography in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, and draw insights for fundamental physics, such as many-body physics and quantum black holes.</description>

      <title>Dynamics due to competitive flip cycles in active Potts models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium spatiotemporal patterns have been extensively studied. However, a single oscillator or cyclic loop of states is typically employed at each site in theories and simulations. Here, we investigated how competition among multiple identical cyclic loops at each site alters patterns. We simulated active Potts models with standard Potts interactions between neighboring sites in two-dimensional square lattices. When multiple three-state cycles exist in state flips, such as in octahedral and square-antiprism networks, all types of spiral waves comprising the three states are formed simultaneously at high flip energies. However, at lower energies, only one or a few types emerge and switch stochastically into different types. At even lower energies, cyclic changes in single-state dominant homogeneous phases emerge [homogeneous cycling (HC) mode]. At intermediate flip energies, the spiral wave and HC modes temporally coexist in small systems but do not switch between each other in large systems. Conversely, when multiple four-state cycles exist in six-state and cubic networks, one state remains dominant for the entire range of flip energies, whereas the other states occasionally form domains at intermediate flip energies. Therefore, the number of spatially coexisting states can be controlled using flip networks and energies.</description>

      <title>Disorder Suppression of Charge Density Wave in the Honeycomb Holstein Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of charge-density-wave order in Dirac fermion systems via electron-phonon coupling represents a significant topic in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon within the Holstein model on the honeycomb lattice, with a specific focus on the effect of disorder. While the interplay between electron-electron interactions and disorder has long been a central theme in the field, recent attention has increasingly turned to the combined influence of disorder and electron-phonon coupling. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we concentrate on the phase transitions of charge-density-wave order on the honeycomb lattice. Disorder is introduced through the random hopping of electrons in the system, which can localize electrons via the Anderson effect. Our primary result is that disorder suppresses the charge-density-wave phase, and the interplay between disorder and electron-phonon interactions extends the phase area. We also determine the transition temperature \(\beta_c\) to the ordered phase as a function of the electron-phonon coupling. Additionally, we observed a suppression of electron kinetic energy and dc conductivity under disorder, highlighting the role of Anderson localization in the degradation of electronic transport. These findings offer significant theoretical insight into the stability and critical phenomena of correlated phases in disordered two-dimensional systems.</description>

Abstract: Ionic fluids under conductive confinement are central to technologies such as batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. Their interfacial behavior governs energy storage and electrochemical processes. Despite their importance, the thermodynamics of even simple models -- such as the charged Lennard-Jones fluid -- remain underexplored in this regime. We present an extended Wang-Landau sampling approach to efficiently compute the density of states of charged mixtures with respect to the particle number. The method supports simulations in both bulk and confined geometries. Combined with the Constant Potential Method, it also enables to study effects due to confining electrodes. We employ this approach to study symmetric, binary mixtures of charged Lennard-Jones particles -- the modified Restricted Primitive Model -- in bulk, in inert confinement, and in conductive confinement at the potential of zero charge. Our results show that confinement shifts the vapor-liquid critical point to lower temperatures and higher densities compared to bulk, in line with the classical concept of capillary condensation. Importantly, conductive boundaries significantly lower the chemical potential of coexistence relative to inert confinement. These findings offer deeper insight into the phase behavior of ionic fluids in energy-relevant porous environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a thermodynamic phase transition in chiral active matter. Low-frequency disorder triggers global synchronisation and energy dissipation, while high disorder activates a topological heat pump, generating an inverse energy cascade. This drives the system towards an Onsager dipole, which can be arrested into a metastable vortex glass if dispersion is insufficient to overcome the defect lattice. We propose topological gas dynamics as a universality class governed by the interplay of active disorder and topological sorting, unifying active swarms and classical inviscid fluids.</description>

Abstract: Probabilistic error cancellation is an attempt to reverse the effect of dissipative noise channels on quantum computers by applying unphysical channels after the execution of a quantum algorithm on noisy hardware. We investigate on general grounds the properties of such unphysical quantum channels by considering a random matrix ensemble modeling noisy quantum algorithms. We show that the complex spectra of denoiser channels inherit their structure from random Lindbladians. Additional structure imposed by the locality of noise channels of the quantum computer emerges in terms of a hierarchy of timescales.</description>

Abstract: Economic inequality emerges from the interplay between regional growth-rate differences and the interaction network that couples regions. We propose a minimal income-dynamics model, where heterogeneity is governed by growth-rate assortativity $\mathcal{A}$ and regional concentration $\mathcal{R}$, allowing us to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of empirically observed log-income distributions. To systematically analyze these patterns, we derive closed-form approximations for the Hellinger distance and the Gini index in limiting configurations. Our findings highlight the spatial segregation of growth rates as a key driver of economic class division and demonstrate how small-world shortcuts in the underlying network can disrupt this segregation. Finally, our framework provides a robust explanation for the bimodality and strong regional correlations found in global income distributions.</description>

      <title>Translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems: the noninteracting case</title>

Abstract: The study of symmetry restoration has recently emerged as a fruitful means to extract high-level information on the relaxation of quantum many-body systems. However, while the restoration of internal symmetries has been investigated intensively, that of spatial symmetries has hitherto only been considered in the context of random unitary circuits. Here we present a complementary study of translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems. In particular, we consider a one-dimensional chain of spinless, non-interacting fermions quenched from a $\nu&gt;1$ shift invariant state, and follow the local restoration of one-site shift invariance using the Frobenius distance $\Delta F_A$ between the state on a subsystem and its symmetrised counterpart. Distinct from the case of random unitary circuits, where symmetry restoration occurs abruptly for times proportional to the subsystem size, we find that symmetry here is restored smoothly and over timescales of the order of the subsystem size squared. We also find that the so-called `quantum Mpemba effect' is readily observed. Most importantly, we show that - in contrast to the case of continuous internal symmetries - this discrete symmetry restoration is not qualitatively described by a quasiparticle picture for $\Delta F_A$, and therefore goes beyond the hydrodynamic description. Our results can be directly extended to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Nonconserved critical dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model as a surface kinetic roughening process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have revisited the non-conserved (or model A) critical dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model through numerical simulations of its lattice and continuum formulations --Glauber dynamics and the timedependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation, respectively--, to analyze them with current tools from surface kinetic roughening. Our study examines two critical quenches, one from an ordered and a different one from a disordered initial state, for both of which we assess the dynamic scaling ansatz, the critical exponent values, and the fluctuation field statistics that occur. Notably, the dynamic scaling ansatz followed by the system strongly depends on the initial condition: a critical quench from the ordered phase follows Family-Vicsek (FV) scaling, while a critical quench from the disordered phase shows an initial overgrowth regime with intrinsic anomalous roughening, followed by relaxation to equilibrium. This behavior is explained in terms of the dynamical instability of the stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation at the critical temperature, whereby the linearly unstable term is eventually stabilized by nonlinear interactions. For both quenches we have determined the occurrence of probability distribution functions for the field fluctuations, which are time-independent along the non-equilibrium dynamics when suitably normalized by the time-dependent fluctuation amplitude. Additionally, we have developed a related interface model for a field which scales as the space integral of the TDGL field (integral GL model). Numerical simulations of this model reveal either FV or faceted anomalous roughening, depending on the critical quenched performed, as well as an emergent symmetry in the fluctuation statistics for a critical quench from the ordered phase.</description>

Abstract: Feedback cooling enables a system to achieve low temperatures through measurement-based control. Determining the thermodynamic cost required to achieve the ideal cooling efficiency within a finite time remains an important problem. In this work, we establish a thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) for feedback cooling in classical underdamped Langevin systems, thereby deriving a trade-off between the cooling efficiency and the entropy reduction rate. The obtained TUR implies that simultaneous achievement of the ideal cooling efficiency and finite entropy reduction rate is asymptotically possible by letting the fluctuation of the reversible local mean velocity diverge. This is shown to be feasible by using a feedback control based on the Kalman filter. Our results clarify the thermodynamic costs of achieving the fundamental cooling limit of feedback control from the perspective of the TUR.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Non-Abelian Topological Order against Heralded Noise via Local Lindbladian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important open question for the current generation of highly controllable quantum devices is understanding which phases can be realized as stable steady-states under local quantum dynamics. In this work, we show how robust steady-state phases with both Abelian and non-Abelian mixed-state topological order can be stabilized, in two spatial dimensions (2d), against generic ``heralded" noise using active dynamics that incorporate measurement and feedback, modeled as a \emph{fully local} Lindblad master equation. These topologically ordered steady states are two-way connected to pure topologically ordered ground states using local quantum channels, and preserve quantum information for a time that is exponentially large in the system size. Specifically, we present explicit constructions of families of local Lindbladians for both Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_2$) and non-Abelian ($D_4$) topological order whose steady-states host mixed-state topological order when the noise is below a threshold strength. As the noise strength is increased, these models exhibit first-order transitions to intermediate mixed state phases where they encode robust classical memories, followed by (first-order) transitions to a trivial steady state at high noise rates. When the noise is imperfectly heralded, steady-state order disappears but our active dynamics significantly enhances the lifetime of the encoded logical information. To carry out the numerical simulations for the non-Abelian $D_4$ case, we introduce a generalized stabilizer tableau formalism that permits efficient simulation of the non-Abelian Lindbladian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Macroscopicity and observational deficit in states, operations, and correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we develop a unified inferential framework for macroscopic states, that is, coarse descriptions of microscopic quantum systems that can be inferred from macroscopic measurements. Building on quantum statistical sufficiency and Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through equivalent abstract (algebraic) and explicit (constructive) formulations. Central to our approach is the notion of observational deficit, which quantifies the degree of irretrodictability of a state relative to a prior and a measurement. This leads to a general definition of macroscopic entropy as an inferentially grounded measure of asymmetry under Bayesian inversion. We formalize this structure in terms of inferential reference frames, defined by the pair consisting of a prior and a measurement, which encapsulate the observer's informational perspective. We then formulate a resource theory of microscopicity, treating macroscopic states as free states and introducing a hierarchy of microscopicity-non-generating operations. This theory unifies and extends existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, and asymmetry. Finally, we apply the framework to study quantum correlations under observational constraints, introducing the notion of observational discord and deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for their vanishing in terms of information recoverability. This work is dedicated to Professor Ryszard Horodecki on the occasion of his 80th birthday, in deep admiration and gratitude for his pioneering contributions to quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Exact treatment of the memory kernel under time-dependent system-environment coupling via a train of delta distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Memory effects in a quantum system coupled to an environment are one of the central features in the theory of open quantum systems. The dynamics of such quantum systems are typically governed by an equation of motion with a time-convolution integral of the memory kernel. However, solving such integro-differential equations is challenging, especially when the memory kernel is nonstationary (not time-translation invariant). In this paper, we analytically and nonperturbatively solve such integro-differential equations with a nonstationary memory kernel by employing a train of Dirac-delta switchings. We then apply this method to the damped Jaynes-Cummings model and the damped harmonic oscillator model to demonstrate that (i) our solution asymptotes to the well-known exact solution in the continuum limit, and that (ii) our method also enables us to visualize the memory effect in the environment.</description>

      <title>Tricritical Kibble-Zurek scaling in Rydberg atom ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism has been extensively studied in various second-order phase transitions, yet the case of tricriticality-the point where second-order phase transition lines terminate-remains experimentally elusive. Here, we theoretically propose probing KZ scaling at tricritical points using Rydberg atom arrays arranged as two- and three-leg ladders, which realize the tricritical Ising and tricritical Potts universality classes. By slowly ramping the Rabi frequency and detuning, we extract two relevant tricritical exponents, $\nu$ and $\nu'$, both via conventional paths from the disordered to the ordered phase and via "tangential" paths confined entirely within the disordered phase. At faster speeds, ramping dynamics go beyond the standard KZ paradigm: data collapse analysis using the parent critical exponents (rather than the tricritical ones) reveals renormalization group flows toward the adjacent second-order critical line, and we identify it as a dynamical analog of Zamolodchikov's $c$-theorem. Our protocol is readily implementable on existing Rydberg quantum simulators. This provides a direct route to measuring distinct tricritical exponents which can reveal an emergent spacetime supersymmetry constraint $1/\nu - 1/\nu' = 1$. Moreover, this work deepens our theoretical understanding and opens new avenues for exploring beyond-KZ quantum dynamics with rich renormalization group structure.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Study of Rayleigh-Plateau Instability at Liquid-Liquid Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated the Rayleigh-Plateau instability at the interface between two immiscible liquids of equal viscosity using molecular dynamics simulations. Two types of initial conditions were considered, one with an imposed single-mode perturbation at the interface and the other without any imposed perturbation. Under the single-mode perturbation, the growth rate deviated from the theoretical prediction for small cylinder radii, but progressively approached and agreed with classical macroscopic theory as the radius increased. In contrast, for the unperturbed initial condition, we found a systematic relationship between the breakup time and the minimum radius, in which the power-law exponent increased with increasing radius. These results demonstrate that, even in extremely microscopic systems with cylinder radii on the order of only about fifteen atomic diameters, the growth of the instability can follow macroscopic theoretical predictions when appropriate conditions are imposed, and that the influence of thermal fluctuations on the breakup dynamics becomes increasingly significant as the system radius decreases.</description>

      <title>Unified theory of magnetization temperature dependence in ferrimagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in spintronics and fundamental physical research have brought increased attention to the rare-earth-based magnetically ordered materials. One of the important properties of these materials is the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization $M(T)$. Recently, a successful framework was proposed for the theoretical description of M(T) across the entire temperature range from zero to the Curie temperature in simple cubic ferromagnets, EuO and EuS. We extend this approach to compute and analyze $M(T)$ for multi-sublattice collinear ferrimagnets such as Yttrium Iron Garnet $Y_3Fe_5 O_{12}$. We analyzed and generalized for multi-sublattice collinear ferrimagnets two well-known approximations describing $M(T)$. The first approach is the Bloch-3/2 law, which describes the suppression of $M(T)$ due to spin-wave excitation, and is valid in the low-temperature limit $T &lt;&lt; T_c$. The second one is Weiss's mean-field approximation, which provides a reasonable description of $M(T)$ near $T_c$. Using a single tuning parameter, we combine these two approaches to describe $M(T)$ for any $0&lt;T&lt;T_c$. The theoretical result for $M(T)$ aligns well with our measurements and the previously available experimental data across the entire temperature range. We also demonstrate that experimental and theoretical dependences $M(T)$ follow the mean-field prediction $\sqrt{T_c - T }$ for almost all temperatures.</description>

Abstract: We study an overpopulated gas of gravitationally interacting bosons surrounding a droplet of Bose-Einstein condensate - Bose star. We argue that kinetic evolution of this gas approaches with time a self-similar attractor solution to the kinetic equation. If the scale symmetry of the equation is broken by external conditions, the attractor solution exists, remains approximately self-similar, but has slowly drifting scaling dimension. The latter new regime of adiabatic self-similarity can determine growth of dark matter Bose stars in cosmological models.</description>

      <title>From Quantum Tsallis Entropy to Strange Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework connecting quantum Tsallis statistics to electronic transport in strongly interacting systems. Starting from R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies, we construct a quantum Tsallis distribution that reduces to the conventional Fermi--Dirac distribution when $q=1$. For $q$ slightly deviating from unity, the correction term in the occupation function can be mapped to a $q$-deformed Schwarzian action, corresponding to soft reparametrization modes. Coupling these soft modes to electrons via the Fermi Golden Rule yields a modified scattering rate, which reproduces conventional Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures and linear-in-temperature resistivity at high temperatures. Using the memory matrix formalism, we analyze magnetotransport, finding a linear-in-field magnetoresistance and a Hall angle consistent with Anderson's two-lifetime scenario. At sufficiently low temperatures, both magnetoresistance and Hall response smoothly recover Fermi-liquid quadratic behaviors. This approach provides a controlled interpolation between Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid regimes, quantitatively linking $q$-deformation, soft-mode dynamics, and experimentally measurable transport coefficients in strange metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for maximizing returns in betting games. A signal that is correlated with the outcome of such a game can be used to focus the bets on a narrow range of high probability predictions. Diffusion models share the same paradigm in that they gradually concentrate the probability mass to fit the training data. We show that the information stored in an unconditional diffusion model captures, in part, the joint correlation between the components of the data variable $X$. Conditional diffusion models store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. The latter is only a small fraction of the total information in the neural network if the data is low-dimensional. We examine why this does not hinder conditional generation.</description>

      <title>Exploring Replica Symmetry Breaking and Topological Collapse in Spin Glasses with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Replica symmetry breaking (RSB) underlies the complex organization of disordered systems, yet quantitative validation beyond $N \sim 100$ spins has remained computationally challenging. We use quantum annealing to access ground states of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model up to $N = 4000$ spins, enabling the most extensive test of Parisi's Nobel Prize-winning RSB solution to date. Five independent observables confirm RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value with characteristic $N^{-2/3}$ corrections, energy fluctuations scale as $N^{-3/4}$ ($\gamma = 0.739 \pm 0.036$), the chaos exponent $\theta = 0.51 \pm 0.02$ ($R^2 = 0.989$) confirms mean-field universality, the overlap distribution exhibits hierarchical structure ($\sigma_q = 0.19$), and the complexity remains invariant under 36\% network dilution. Beyond a critical threshold $0.8 &lt; D_c &lt; 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously through a cooperative avalanche that converts the entire system to vacancies within a narrow parameter window $\Delta D = 0.1$. These findings establish quantum computation as a tool for probing emergent many-body phenomena and uncover the topological foundations of complexity in disordered systems, with implications for neural networks, optimization, and materials science.</description>

Abstract: The projected ensemble -- an ensemble of pure states on a subsystem conditioned on projective measurement outcomes on its complement -- provides a finer probe of ergodicity and information structure than the reduced density matrix of the subsystem in bipartite quantum states. This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. We contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures. Finally, we show that these information phases, as characterised by the Holevo information, emerge in the dynamics of chaotic quantum circuits and discuss the associated timescales.</description>

      <title>Sliding of cylindrical shell into a rigid hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fitting two different materials is a versatile methodology in manufacturing complex structures. One of the canonical models for fitting is the snap-fit model, in which flexible materials and rigid structures are assembled by pushing their interlocking components together. The assembly via snap-fit is often accompanied by large deformations of flexible structures and abrupt force drops, highlighting the role of elasticity, geometry, and contact friction. Despite several model studies revealing fundamental mechanics for snap-fit, the current snap-fit design relies on prototyping and empirical rules. In this paper, we analyze a snap-fit model in which a naturally curved beam slips into a rigid hole. We construct an analytical model based on the theory of elastica with contact friction and demonstrate that its predictions are in excellent quantitative agreement with both simulations and experiments. We find three distinct sliding modes: Folding, Pinning, and Unfolding. The classification is systematically organized in a phase diagram based on the geometric parameters of the shells and the hole. Our study complements existing approaches by providing a predictive framework for contact-based structures that involve friction, elasticity, and geometry, and sheds light on a unified understanding of the interactions between an elastic and a rigid body.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of exact quantum many-body scars in spin-1 XY chain under perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are special eigenstates that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis while residing at finite energy density along with thermalizing eigenstates. The spin-1 XY model is known to host a family of such exceptional states originating from long-lived quasiparticle excitations that exhibit anomalously low entanglement entropy and long-time periodic revivals, resulting in weak ergodicity breaking. We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbation in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicate that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the long-range order associated with the scars decays under the perturbation, and we estimate the relaxation timescale of oscillatory dynamics in certain local observables to be of order $\lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is the perturbation strength.</description>
