      <title>Estimating the Impact of the Bitcoin Halving on Its Price Using Synthetic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third Bitcoin halving that took place in May 2020 cut down the mining reward from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC per block and thus slowed down the rate of issuance of new Bitcoins, making it more scarce. The fourth and most recent halving happened in April 2024, cutting the block reward further to 3.125 BTC. If the demand did not decrease simultaneously after these halvings, then the neoclassical economic theory posits that the price of Bitcoin should have increased due to the halving. But did it, in fact, increase for that reason, or is this a post hoc fallacy? This paper uses synthetic control to construct a weighted Bitcoin that is different from its counterpart in one aspect - it did not undergo halving. Comparing the price trajectory of the actual and the simulated Bitcoins, I find evidence of a positive effect of the 2024 Bitcoin halving on its price three months later. The magnitude of this effect is one fifth of the total percentage change in the price of Bitcoin during the study period - from April 2, 2023, to July 21, 2024 (17 months). The second part of the study fails to obtain a statistically significant and robust causal estimate of the effect of the 2020 Bitcoin halving on Bitcoin's price. This is the first paper analyzing the effect of halving causally, building on the existing body of correlational research.</description>

      <title>0.001% and Counting: Revisiting the Price Rounding Tax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1991 and 2008, Israel abolished the equivalents of 1-cent and 5-cent coins, respectively, effectively eliminating low-denomination coins and introducing rounding in cash transactions. When totals were rounded up, shoppers incurred a small rounding tax. Using detailed data on price endings and basket sizes across supermarkets, drugstores, small groceries, and convenience stores, we estimate that the magnitude of the rounding tax borne by Israeli consumers averaged only between 0.001 percent and 0.002 percent of revenues in the fast-moving consumer goods markets. These findings have implications for the ongoing debate regarding the desirability and viability of abolishing the 1-cent and 5-cent coins in the US.</description>

      <title>How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid diffusion of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has substantially lowered the costs of launching and developing digital ventures. GenAI can potentially both enable previously unviable entrepreneurial ideas by lowering resource needs and improve the performance of existing ventures. We explore how founders' technical and managerial expertise shapes GenAI's impact on digital ventures along these dimensions. Exploiting exogenous variation in GenAI usage across venture categories and the timing of its broad availability for software tasks (e.g., GitHub Copilot's public release and subsequent GenAI tools), we find that the number of new venture launches increased and the median time to launch decreased significantly more in categories with relatively high GenAI usage. GenAI's effect on new launches is larger for founders without managerial experience or education, while its effect on venture capital (VC) funding likelihood is stronger for founders with technical experience or education. Overall, our results suggest that GenAI expands access to digital entrepreneurship for founders lacking managerial expertise and enhances venture performance among technical founders.</description>

      <title>Does Urban Local Governance Matter? Evidence from India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the causal effect of urban local governance on public goods provision in India. We exploit quasi-random variation in multi-threshold criteria utilized for classifying Census Towns (CTs) and focus on settlements near the thresholds that are likely to obtain statutory recognition. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we instrument for urban local governance to identify the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE). We document a strong first stage relationship between meeting CT thresholds and statutory recognition. Our results show that obtaining an Urban Local Body (ULB) increases local public good provision: government schools increase by approximately 14 (primary), 8 (middle), and 5 (secondary), healthcare infrastructure expands by 2 hospitals and 3 family welfare centers, and financial access deepens with 15 private banks, 2 cooperative banks, and 2 agricultural credit societies. Community amenities improve modestly with an additional public library, reading room, and cinema hall. Sports infrastructure declines by 5 facilities, consistent with our understanding of reallocation of urban space and investments. Our findings suggest that timely municipalization of emerging urban areas can expand provision of certain public goods, which may improve living standards and economic opportunities in urbanizing economies.</description>

      <title>Some economics of artificial super intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that a misaligned artificial superintelligence (ASI) will destroy humanity. But the problem of constraining a powerful agent is not new. I apply classic economic logic of interjurisdictional competition, all-encompassing interest, and trading on credit to the threat of misaligned ASI. Using a simple model, I show that an acquisitive ASI refrains from full predation under surprisingly weak conditions. When humans can flee to rivals, inter-ASI competition creates a market that tempers predation. When trapped by a monopolist ASI, its "encompassing interest" in humanity's output makes it a rational autocrat rather than a ravager. And when the ASI has no long-term stake, our ability to withhold future output incentivizes it to trade on credit rather than steal. In each extension, humanity's welfare progressively worsens. But each case suggests that catastrophe is not a foregone conclusion. The dismal science, ironically, offers an optimistic take on our superintelligent future.</description>

      <title>The Long Shadow of Superstars: Effects on Opportunities, Careers, and Team Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superstars often dominate key tasks because of their exceptional abilities, but this concentration of responsibility may unintentionally limit on-the-job learning opportunities for others. Using panel data from Major League Baseball (MLB), this study examines how superstar presence affects teammates' opportunities and career outcomes. To address potential endogeneity in team composition, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in superstar availability caused by injuries. When a superstar is active in the same team-position unit, non-star teammates play significantly less. These short-term reductions in playing time extend to longer horizons: players who begin their careers alongside a superstar who remains active for a full season (i.e., not on the injured list) are about 1.7 times more likely to exit MLB earlier than comparable peers. A key mechanism is reduced skill development -- limited playing opportunities hinder subsequent growth in offensive performance. At the team level, greater dependence on superstars raises immediate productivity but magnifies performance declines after their departure, indicating a trade-off between short-term success and long-term adaptability. Overall, the findings suggest that while concentrating key roles in top performers boosts output in the short run, it can restrict others' development and retention. Similar dynamics may arise in other organizations that rely heavily on a few exceptional individuals.</description>

      <title>The Value of Personalized Recommendations: Evidence from Netflix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07280v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized recommendation systems shape much of user choice online, yet their targeted nature makes separating out the value of recommendation and the underlying goods challenging. We build a discrete choice model that embeds recommendation-induced utility, low-rank heterogeneity, and flexible state dependence and apply the model to viewership data at Netflix. We exploit idiosyncratic variation introduced by the recommendation algorithm to identify and separately value these components as well as to recover model-free diversion ratios that we can use to validate our structural model. We use the model to evaluate counterfactuals that quantify the incremental engagement generated by personalized recommendations. First, we show that replacing the current recommender system with a matrix factorization or popularity-based algorithm would lead to 4% and 12% reduction in engagement, respectively, and decreased consumption diversity. Second, most of the consumption increase from recommendations comes from effective targeting, not mechanical exposure, with the largest gains for mid-popularity goods (as opposed to broadly appealing or very niche goods).</description>

      <title>The Breadth Premium: Measuring the Firm-level Impact of CEO Career Breadth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prevailing career and education systems continue to reward early specialization and deep expertise within narrow domains. While such depth promotes efficiency, it may also limit adaptability in complex and rapidly changing environments. Building on research showing that variability in training inputs enhances learning outcomes across cognitive and behavioral domains, this study explores whether the same principle applies to executive performance.
  Using an original dataset of 650 CEOs leading firms that together represent roughly 85% of US market capitalization, we construct a composite Breadth Index capturing cross-domain educational and professional breadth. Preliminary analyses reveal that firms led by higher-breadth CEOs outperform their industry peers by an average of 9.8 percentage points over a three-year window. Regression results indicate that each one-point increase on the five-point Range Index corresponds to a 1.8-point gain in abnormal returns (p &lt; 0.03), with effects remaining robust across industries, firm sizes, and CEO age groups.
  These early findings suggest that leadership breadth, defined as experience spanning multiple functions, disciplines, and sectors, is positively associated with firm-level performance. While the dataset remains under validation, the pattern observed supports the emerging view that as specialization deepens, the marginal value of lateral insight rises. Breadth, in this light, functions as a form of adaptive capital; it enhances leaders' capacity for integrative reasoning, organizational translation, and strategic flexibility in uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Daily Forecasting for Annual Time Series Datasets Using Similarity-Based Machine Learning Methods: A Case Study in the Energy Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The policy environment of countries changes rapidly, influencing macro-level indicators such as the Energy Security Index. However, this index is only reported annually, limiting its responsiveness to short-term fluctuations. To address this gap, the present study introduces a daily proxy for the Energy Security Index and applies it to forecast energy security at a daily frequency.The study employs a two stage approach first, a suitable daily proxy for the annual Energy Security Index is identified by applying six time series similarity measures to key energy related variables. Second, the selected proxy is modeled using the XGBoost algorithm to generate 15 day ahead forecasts, enabling high frequency monitoring of energy security dynamics.As the result of proxy choosing, Volume Brent consistently emerged as the most suitable proxy across the majority of methods. The model demonstrated strong performance, with an R squared of 0.981 on the training set and 0.945 on the test set, and acceptable error metrics . The 15 day forecast of Brent volume indicates short term fluctuations, with a peak around day 4, a decline until day 8, a rise near day 10, and a downward trend toward day 15, accompanied by prediction intervals.By integrating time series similarity measures with machine learning based forecasting, this study provides a novel framework for converting low frequency macroeconomic indicators into high frequency, actionable signals. The approach enables real time monitoring of the Energy Security Index, offering policymakers and analysts a scalable and practical tool to respond more rapidly to fast changing policy and market conditions, especially in data scarce environments.</description>

      <title>Anchors in the Machine: Behavioral and Attributional Evidence of Anchoring Bias in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly examined as both behavioral subjects and decision systems, yet it remains unclear whether observed cognitive biases reflect surface imitation or deeper probability shifts. Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Artificial intelligence and the Gulf Cooperation Council workforce adapting to the future of work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) raises a central question: are investments in compute infrastructure matched by an equally robust build-out of skills, incentives, and governance? Grounded in socio-technical systems (STS) theory, this mixed-methods study audits workforce preparedness across Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman. We combine term frequency--inverse document frequency (TF--IDF) analysis of six national AI strategies (NASs), an inventory of 47 publicly disclosed AI initiatives (January 2017--April 2025), paired case studies, the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and the Saudi Data &amp; Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA) Academy, and a scenario matrix linking oil-revenue slack (technical capacity) to regulatory coherence (social alignment). Across the corpus, 34/47 initiatives (0.72; 95% Wilson CI 0.58--0.83) exhibit joint social--technical design; country-level indices span 0.57--0.90 (small n; intervals overlap). Scenario results suggest that, under our modeled conditions, regulatory convergence plausibly binds outcomes more than fiscal capacity: fragmented rules can offset high oil revenues, while harmonized standards help preserve progress under austerity. We also identify an emerging two-track talent system, research elites versus rapidly trained practitioners, that risks labor-market bifurcation without bridging mechanisms. By extending STS inquiry to oil-rich, state-led economies, the study refines theory and sets a research agenda focused on longitudinal coupling metrics, ethnographies of coordination, and outcome-based performance indicators.</description>

      <title>Spatial Selection and the Multiscale Dynamics of Urban Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growth is a multi-layered phenomenon in human societies, composed of socioeconomic and demographic change at many different scales. Yet, standard macroeconomic indicators average over most of these processes, blurring the spatial and hierarchical heterogeneity driving people's choices and experiences. To address this gap, we introduce here a framework based on the Price equation to decompose aggregate growth exactly into endogenous and selection effects across nested spatial scales. We illustrate this approach with population and income data from the Chicago metropolitan area (2014-2019) and show that both growth rates and spatial selection effects are most intense at local levels, fat-tailed and spatially correlated. We also find that selection, defined as the covariance between prevailing income and relative population change, is concentrated in few spatial units and exhibits scaling behavior when grouped by county. Despite the intensity of local sorting, selection effects largely cancel in the aggregate, implying that fast heterogeneous micro-dynamics can yield deceptively stable macro-trends. By treating local spatial units (neighborhoods) as evolving subpopulations under selection, we demonstrate how methods from complex systems provide new tools to classify residential selection processes, such as abandonment and gentrification, in an urban sociological framework. This approach is general and applies to any other nested economic systems such as networks of production, occupations, or innovation enabling a new mechanistic understanding of compositional change and growth across scales of organization.</description>

      <title>Foreign Direct Investment and Job Creation in EU Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on job creation across 109 regions in the old EU member states from 2012 to 2023. Using dynamic and spatial econometric models combined with a unique dataset of FDI projects, we find that increased FDI inflows significantly enhance regional job creation, but the relationship is nonlinear. Sectoral specialization plays a crucial role, as more concentrated FDI inflows lead to higher employment growth. Furthermore, FDI-driven job creation exhibits significant spatial spillover effects. However, regions attracting high-value FDI jobs, such as those in R&amp;D and management, tend to experience slower overall employment growth.</description>
