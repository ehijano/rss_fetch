      <title>Model-Driven Deep Neural Network for Enhanced AoA Estimation Using 5G gNB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-accuracy positioning has become a fundamental enabler for intelligent connected devices. Nevertheless, the present wireless networks still rely on model-driven approaches to achieve positioning functionality, which are susceptible to performance degradation in practical scenarios, primarily due to hardware impairments. Integrating artificial intelligence into the positioning framework presents a promising solution to revolutionize the accuracy and robustness of location-based services. In this study, we address this challenge by reformulating the problem of angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation into image reconstruction of spatial spectrum. To this end, we design a model-driven deep neural network (MoD-DNN), which can automatically calibrate the angular-dependent phase error. The proposed MoD-DNN approach employs an iterative optimization scheme between a convolutional neural network and a sparse conjugate gradient algorithm. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing spectrum calibration and AoA estimation.</description>

      <title>LoRaFlow: High-Quality Signal Reconstruction using Rectified Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LoRa technology, crucial for low-power wide-area networks, faces significant performance degradation at extremely low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We present LoRaFlow, a novel approach using rectified flow to reconstruct high-quality LoRa signals in challenging noise conditions. Unlike existing neural-enhanced methods focused on classification, LoRaFlow recovers the signal itself, maintaining compatibility with standard dechirp algorithms. Our method combines a hybrid neural network architecture, synthetic data generation, and robust augmentation strategies. This minimally invasive enhancement to LoRa infrastructure potentially extends operational range and reliability without overhauling existing systems. LoRaFlow opens new possibilities for robust IoT communications in harsh environments and its core methodology can be generalized to support various communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Functionality Prioritization in Multicast ISAC: Optimal Admission Control and Discrete-Phase Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the joint admission control and discrete-phase multicast beamforming design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, where sensing and communications functionalities have different hierarchies. Specifically, the ISAC system first allocates resources to the higher-hierarchy functionality and opportunistically uses the remaining resources to support the lower-hierarchy one. This resource allocation problem is a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). We propose an exact mixed-integer linear program (MILP) reformulation, leading to a globally optimal solution. In addition, we implemented three baselines for comparison, which our proposed method outperforms by more than 39%.</description>

      <title>Distributed Traffic Control in Complex Dynamic Roadblocks: A Multi-Agent Deep RL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) represent a transformative advancement in the transportation industry. These vehicles have sophisticated sensors, advanced algorithms, and powerful computing systems that allow them to navigate and operate without direct human intervention. However, AVs' systems still get overwhelmed when they encounter a complex dynamic change in the environment resulting from an accident or a roadblock for maintenance. The advanced features of Sixth Generation (6G) technology are set to offer strong support to AVs, enabling real-time data exchange and management of complex driving maneuvers. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework to improve AVs' decision-making in dynamic and complex Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) utilizing 6G-V2X communication. The primary objective is to enable AVs to avoid roadblocks efficiently by changing lanes while maintaining optimal traffic flow and maximizing the mean harmonic speed. To ensure realistic operations, key constraints such as minimum vehicle speed, roadblock count, and lane change frequency are integrated. We train and test the proposed MARL model with two traffic simulation scenarios using the SUMO and TraCI interface. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed model adapts to various traffic conditions and achieves efficient and robust traffic flow management. The trained model effectively navigates dynamic roadblocks, promoting improved traffic efficiency in AV operations with more than 70% efficiency over other benchmark solutions.</description>

      <title>Automotive Speed Estimation: Sensor Types and Error Characteristics from OBD-II to ADAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern on-road navigation systems heavily depend on integrating speed measurements with inertial navigation systems (INS) and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Telemetry-based applications typically source speed data from the On-Board Diagnostic II (OBD-II) system. However, the method of deriving speed, as well as the types of sensors used to measure wheel speed, differs across vehicles. These differences result in varying error characteristics that must be accounted for in navigation and autonomy applications. This paper addresses this gap by examining the diverse speed-sensing technologies employed in standard automotive systems and alternative techniques used in advanced systems designed for higher levels of autonomy, such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Autonomous Driving (AD), or surveying applications. We propose a method to identify the type of speed sensor in a vehicle and present strategies for accurately modeling its error characteristics. To validate our approach, we collected and analyzed data from three long real road trajectories conducted in urban environments in Toronto and Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The results underscore the critical role of integrating multiple sensor modalities to achieve more accurate speed estimation, thus improving automotive navigation state estimation, particularly in GNSS-denied environments.</description>

      <title>Linear Precoding Design for OTFS Systems in Time/Frequency Selective Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) has been shown as a promising modulation scheme for high mobility doubly-selective fading channels, its attainability of full diversity order in either time or frequency selective fading channels has not been clarified. By performing pairwise error probability (PEP) analysis, we observe that the original OTFS system can not always guarantee full exploitation of the embedded diversity in either time or frequency selective fading channels. To address this issue and further improve system performance, this work proposes linear precoding solutions based on algebraic number theory for OTFS systems over time and frequency selective fading channels, respectively. The proposed linear precoded OTFS systems can guarantee the maximal diversity and potential coding gains in time/frequency selective fading channels without any transmission rate loss and do not require the channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. Simulation results are finally provided to illustrate the superiority of our proposed precoded OTFS over both the original unprecoded and the existing phase rotation OTFS systems in time/frequency selective fading channels.</description>

      <title>Multipath Component-Aided Signal Processing for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal enabling technology for sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication system. The ISAC research in dense urban areas has been plaguing by severe multipath interference, propelling the thorough research of ISAC multipath interference elimination. However, transforming the multipath component (MPC) from enemy into friend is a viable and mutually beneficial option. In this paper, we preliminarily explore the MPC-aided ISAC signal processing and apply a space-time code to improve the ISAC performance. Specifically, we propose a symbol-level fusion for MPC-aided localization (SFMC) scheme to achieve robust and high-accuracy localization, and apply a Khatri-Rao space-time (KRST) code to improve the communication and sensing performance in rich multipath environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SFMC scheme has more robust localization performance with higher accuracy, compared with the existing state-of-the-art schemes. The proposed SFMC would benefit highly reliable communication and sub-meter level localization in rich multipath scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantum-MUSIC: Multiple Signal Classification for Quantum Wireless Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Quantum-MUSIC, the first multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm for quantum wireless sensing of multi-user. Since an atomic receiver for quantum wireless sensing can only measure the magnitude of a received signal, sensing performance degradation of traditional antenna-based signal processing algorithms is inevitable. To overcome this limitation, the proposed algorithm recovers the channel information and incorporates the traditional MUSIC algorithm, enabling the sensing of multi-user with magnitude-only measurement. Simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing MUSIC algorithm, validating the superior potential of quantum wireless sensing.</description>

      <title>Precoder Implementation and Optimization in 5G NR Massive MIMO Radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of 5G New Radio (NR) has brought significant improvements in signal strength and service quality for users. By integrating Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems into communications, multiple data streams can be transmitted simultaneously across multiple antennas. Additionally, the incorporation of precoding in MIMO systems enables enhanced data rates and spectral efficiency. In wireless networks, precoders are used to steer high-gain beams intended for specific users. This paper focuses on the implementation of 16, 32, and 64 channel linear precoders in the Remote Radio Head (RRH) of the indigenously developed 5G testbed at IIT Madras. These precoders include a memory module to store channel matrices and a multiplier module to perform matrix multiplications between the channel matrices and user data within a slot duration of 500 microseconds. The system demonstrates DSP utilization levels of 9.75%, 19.5%, and 39% for (16 x 8), (32 x 8), and (64 x 8) antenna-layer configurations, respectively, while maintaining Block RAM (BRAM) usage within 2.28%, 3.91%, and 7.16%. Additionally, a throughput of 1.2 Gbps with four active layers highlights the system's optimized performance under hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>SLoG-Net: Algorithm Unrolling for Source Localization on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel model-based deep learning solution for the inverse problem of localizing sources of network diffusion. Starting from first graph signal processing (GSP) principles, we show that the problem reduces to joint (blind) estimation of the forward diffusion filter and a sparse input signal that encodes the source locations. Despite the bilinear nature of the observations in said blind deconvolution task, by requiring invertibility of the diffusion filter we are able to formulate a convex optimization problem and solve it using the alternating-direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We then unroll and truncate the novel ADMM iterations to arrive at a parameterized neural network architecture for Source Localization on Graphs (SLoG-Net), that we train in an end-to-end fashion using labeled data. This supervised learning approach offers several advantages such as interpretability, parameter efficiency, and controllable complexity during inference. Our reproducible numerical experiments corroborate that SLoG-Net exhibits performance on par with the iterative ADMM baseline, but with markedly faster inference times and without needing to manually tune step-size or penalty parameters. Overall, our approach combines the best of both worlds by incorporating the inductive biases of a GSP model-based solution within a data-driven, trainable deep learning architecture for blind deconvolution of graph signals.</description>

      <title>Jointly optimal array geometries and waveforms in active sensing: New insights into array design via the Cram\'er-Rao bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates jointly optimal array geometry and waveform designs for active sensing. Specifically, we focus on minimizing the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRB) of the angle of a single target in white Gaussian noise. We first find that several array-waveform pairs can yield the same CRB by virtue of sequences with equal sums of squares, i.e., solutions to certain Diophantine equations. Furthermore, we show that under physical aperture and sensor number constraints, the CRB-minimizing receive array geometry is unique, whereas the transmit array can be chosen flexibly. We leverage this freedom to design a novel sparse array geometry that not only minimizes the single-target CRB given an optimal waveform, but also has a nonredundant and contiguous sum co-array, a desirable property when launching independent waveforms, with relevance also to the multi-target case.</description>

      <title>12-bit Delta-Sigma ADC operating at a temperature of up to 250C in Standard 0.18 $\mu$m SOI CMOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some applications require electronic systems to operate at extremely high temperature. Extending the operating temperature range of automotive-grade CMOS processes -- through the use of dedicated design techniques -- can provide an important cost-effective advantage. We present a second-order discrete-time delta-sigma analog-to-digital converter operating at a temperature of up to 250 $^\circ$C, well beyond the 175 $^\circ$C qualification temperature of the automotive-grade CMOS process used for its fabrication (XFAB XT018). The analog-to-digital converter incorporates design techniques that are effective in mitigating the adverse effects of the high temperature, such as increased leakage currents and electromigration. We use configurations of dummy transistors for leakage compensation, clock-boosting methods to limit pass-gate cross-talk, and we optimized the circuit architecture to ensure stability and accuracy at high temperature. Comprehensive measurements demonstrate that the analog-to-digital converter achieves a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 93 dB at 250 $^\circ$C, with an effective number of bits of 12, and a power consumption of only 44~mW. The die area of the converter is only 0.065~mm$^2$ and the area overhead of the high-temperature mitigation circuits is only 13.7%. The Schreier Figure of Merit is 140~dB at the maximum temperature of 250 $^\circ$C, proving the potential of the circuit for reliable operation in challenging applications such as gas and oil extraction and aeronautics.</description>

      <title>NeuroSleepNet: A Multi-Head Self-Attention Based Automatic Sleep Scoring Scheme with Spatial and Multi-Scale Temporal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Automatic sleep scoring is crucial for diagnosing sleep disorders. Existing frameworks based on Polysomnography often rely on long sequences of input signals to predict sleep stages, which can introduce complexity. Moreover, there is limited exploration of simplifying representation learning in sleep scoring methods. Methods: In this study, we propose NeuroSleepNet, an automatic sleep scoring method designed to classify the current sleep stage using only the microevents in the current input signal, without the need for past inputs. Our model employs supervised spatial and multi-scale temporal context learning and incorporates a transformer encoder to enhance representation learning. Additionally, NeuroSleepNet is optimized for balanced performance across five sleep stages by introducing a logarithmic scale-based weighting technique as a loss function. Results: NeuroSleepNet achieved similar and comparable performance with current state-of-the-art results. The best accuracy, macro-F1 score, and Cohen's kappa were 86.1 percent, 80.8 percent, and 0.805 for Sleep-EDF expanded; 82.0 percent, 76.3 percent, and 0.753 for MESA; 80.5 percent, 76.8 percent, and 0.738 for Physio2018; and 86.7 percent, 80.9 percent, and 0.804 for the SHHS database. Conclusion: NeuroSleepNet demonstrates that even with a focus on computational efficiency and a purely supervised learning approach, it is possible to achieve performance that is comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Significance: Our study simplifies automatic sleep scoring by focusing solely on microevents in the current input signal while maintaining remarkable performance. This offers a streamlined alternative for sleep diagnosis applications.</description>

      <title>Rethink Delay Doppler Channels and Time-Frequency Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we rethink delay Doppler channels (also called doubly selective channels). We prove that no modulation schemes can compensate a non-trivial Doppler spread well. This means that the current active OTFS (that is the same as VOFDM) cannot compensate a non-trivial Doppler spread. We then discuss some of the existing methods to deal with time-varying channels, in particular time-frequency (TF) coding in an OFDM system. TF coding is equivalent to space-time coding in the math part. We also summarize state of the art on space-time coding that was an active research topic over 10 years ago.</description>

      <title>Scalable Beamforming Design for Multi-RIS-Aided MU-MIMO Systems with Imperfect CSIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising solution for enhancing the capabilities of wireless communications. This paper presents a scalable beamforming design for maximizing the spectral efficiency (SE) of multi-RIS-aided communications through joint optimization of the precoder and RIS phase shifts in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems under imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). To address key challenges of the joint optimization problem, we first decompose it into two subproblems with deriving a proper lower bound. We then leverage a generalized power iteration (GPI) approach to identify a superior local optimal precoding solution. We further extend this approach to the RIS design using regularization; we set a RIS regularization function to efficiently handle the unitmodulus constraints, and also find the superior local optimal solution for RIS phase shifts under the GPI-based optimization framework. Subsequently, we propose an alternating optimization method. In particular, utilizing the block-diagonal structure of the matrices the GPI method, the proposed algorithm offers multi-RIS scalable beamforming as well as superior SE performance. Simulations validate the proposed method in terms of both the sum SE performance and the scalability.</description>

      <title>Confined Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for Sparse Random Combinatorial Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is a commonly used greedy algorithm for recovering sparse signals from compressed measurements. In this paper, we introduce a variant of the OMP algorithm to reduce the complexity of reconstructing a class of $K$-sparse signals $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ from measurements $\boldsymbol{y} = \boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{x}$, where $\boldsymbol{A} \in \{0,1\}^{m \times n}$ is a sparse random combinatorial matrix with $d~(d \leq m/2)$ ones per column. The proposed algorithm, referred to as the confined OMP algorithm, utilizes the properties of $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{A}$ to remove much of the redundancy in the dictionary (also referred to as $\boldsymbol{A}$) and thus fewer column indices of $\boldsymbol{A}$ need to be identified. To this end, we first define a confined set $\Gamma$ with $|\Gamma| \leq n$ and then prove that the support of $\boldsymbol{x}$ is a subset of $\Gamma$ with probability 1 if the distributions of non-zero components of $\boldsymbol{x}$ satisfy a certain condition. During the process of the confined OMP algorithm, the possibly chosen column indices are strictly confined into the confined set $\Gamma$. We further develop lower bounds on the probability of exact recovery of $\boldsymbol{x}$ using OMP algorithm and confined OMP algorithm with $K$ iterations, respectively. The obtained theoretical results of confined OMP algorithm can be used to optimize the column degree $d$ of $\boldsymbol{A}$. Finally, experimental results show that the confined OMP algorithm is more efficient in reconstructing a class of sparse signals compared to the OMP algorithm.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Wideband Near-Field Communications With Reconfigurable Refractive Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the growing demand for high data rates, cellular systems are expected to evolve towards higher carrier frequencies and larger antenna arrays, but conventional phased arrays face challenges in supporting such a prospection due to their excessive power consumption induced by numerous phase shifters required. Reconfigurable Refractive Surface (RRS) is an energy efficient solution to address this issue without relying on phase shifters. However, the increased radiation aperture size extends the range of the Fresnel region, leading the users to lie in the near-field zone. Moreover, given the wideband communications in higher frequency bands, we cannot ignore the frequency selectivity of the RRS. These two effects collectively exacerbate the beam-split issue, where different frequency components fail to converge on the user simultaneously, and finally result in a degradation of the data rate. In this paper, we investigate an RRS-based wideband near-field multi-user communication system. Unlike most existing studies on wideband communications, which consider the beam-split effect only with the near-field condition, we study the beam-split effect under the influence of both the near-field condition and the frequency selectivity of the RRS. To mitigate the beam-split effect, we propose a Delayed-RRS structure, based on which a beamforming scheme is proposed to optimize the user's data rate. Through theoretical analysis and simulation results, we analyze the influence of the RRS's frequency selectivity, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed beamforming scheme, and reveal the importance of jointly considering the near-field condition and the frequency selectivity of RRS.</description>

      <title>Power-Efficient Optimization for Coexisting Semantic and Bit-Based Users in NOMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication focuses on transmitting the meaning of data, aiming for efficient, relevant communication, while non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enhances spectral efficiency by allowing multiple users to share the same spectrum. Integrating semantic users into a NOMA network with bit-based users improves both transmission and spectrum efficiency. However, the performance metric for semantic communication differs significantly from that of traditional communication, posing challenges in simultaneously meeting individual user demands and minimizing transmission power, especially in scenarios with coexisting semantic and bit-based users. Furthermore, the different hardware architectures of semantic and bit-based users complicate the implementation of successive interference cancellation (SIC). To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a clustered framework to mitigate the complexity of SIC and two multiple access (MA) schemes, e.g., pure cluster-based NOMA (P-CNOMA) and hybrid cluster-based NOMA (H-CNOMA), to minimize the total transmission power. The P-CNOMA scheme can achieve the minimum transmission power, but may not satisfy the high quality of service (QoS) requirement. In contrast, H-CNOMA addresses these issues with a slight increase in power and a reduced semantic rate. These two schemes complement each other, enabling an adaptive MA selection mechanism that adapts to specific network conditions and user requirements.</description>

      <title>Fundamental MMSE-Rate Performance Limits of Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) demonstrates promise for 6G networks; yet its performance limits, which require addressing functional Pareto stochastic optimizations, remain underexplored. Existing works either overlook the randomness of ISAC signals or approximate ISAC limits from sensing and communication (SAC) optimum-achieving strategies, leading to loose bounds. In this paper, ISAC limits are investigated by considering a random ISAC signal designated to simultaneously estimate the sensing channel and convey information over the communication channel, adopting the modified minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE), a metric defined in accordance with the randomness of ISAC signals, and the Shannon rate as respective SAC metrics. First, conditions for optimal channel input and output distributions on the MMSE-Rate limit are derived employing variational approaches, leading to high-dimensional convolutional equations. Second, leveraging variational conditions, a Blahut-Arimoto-type algorithm is proposed to numerically determine optimal distributions and SAC performance, with its convergence to the limit proven. Third, closed-form SAC-optimal waveforms are derived, characterized by power allocation according to channel statistics/realization and waveform selection; existing methods to establish looser ISAC bounds are rectified. Finally, a compound signaling strategy is introduced for coincided SAC channels, which employs sequential SAC-optimal waveforms for channel estimation and data transmission, showcasing significant rate improvements over non-coherent "capacity". This study systematically investigates ISAC performance limits from joint estimation- and information-theoretic perspectives, highlighting key SAC tradeoffs and potential ISAC design benefits. The methodology readily extends to various metrics, such as estimation rate and the Cramer-Rao Bound.</description>

      <title>Time Difference of Arrival Source Localization: Exact Linear Solutions for the General 3D Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time difference of arrival (TDOA) problem admits exact, purely algebraic solutions for the situation in which there are 4 and 5 sensors and a single source whose position is to be determined in 3 dimensions. The solutions are exact in the sense that there is no least squares operation (i.e., projection) involved in the solution. The solutions involve no linearization or iteration, and are algebraically transparent via vector algebra in Cartesian coordinates. The solution with 5 sensors requires no resolution of sign ambiguities; the solution with 4 sensors requires resolution of one sign ambiguity. Solutions are effected using only TDOA and not, e.g., frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) or angle of arrival (AOA).
  We first present the 5-sensor solution and then follow with the 4-sensor scenario. Numerical experiments are presented showing the performance of the calculations in the case of no noise, before closing with conclusions. Performance of the calculations is exact within numerical error, and in the small fraction of cases in which source localization does not occur, it is driven by misidentification in resolution of sign ambiguity without priors. We therefore believe the calculations have substantial practical utility for their speed and exactness.</description>

      <title>ROME: Robust Model Ensembling for Semantic Communication Against Semantic Jamming Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, semantic communication (SC) has garnered increasing attention for its efficiency, yet it remains vulnerable to semantic jamming attacks. These attacks entail introducing crafted perturbation signals to legitimate signals over the wireless channel, thereby misleading the receivers' semantic interpretation. This paper investigates the above issue from a practical perspective. Contrasting with previous studies focusing on power-fixed attacks, we extensively consider a more challenging scenario of power-variable attacks by devising an innovative attack model named Adjustable Perturbation Generator (APG), which is capable of generating semantic jamming signals of various power levels. To combat semantic jamming attacks, we propose a novel framework called Robust Model Ensembling (ROME) for secure semantic communication. Specifically, ROME can detect the presence of semantic jamming attacks and their power levels. When high-power jamming attacks are detected, ROME adapts to raise its robustness at the cost of generalization ability, and thus effectively accommodating the attacks. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the robustness of the system, demonstrating its superiority in combating semantic jamming attacks via adaptive robustness. Simulation results show that the proposed ROME approach exhibits significant adaptability and delivers graceful robustness and generalization ability under power-variable semantic jamming attacks.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) enhance flexibility in beamforming gain and interference suppression by adjusting position within certain areas of the transceivers. In this paper, we propose an MA-assisted integrated sensing and communication framework, wherein MAs are deployed for reconfiguring the channel array responses at both the receiver and transmitter of a base station. Then, we develop an optimization framework aimed at maximizing the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming vector, the transmit beamforming matrix, and the positions of MAs while meeting the minimum SINR requirement for each user. To address this nonconvex problem involving complex coupled variables, we devise an alternating optimization-based algorithm that incorporates techniques including the Charnes-Cooper transform, second-order Taylor expansion, and successive convex approximation (SCA). Specifically, the closed form of the received vector and the optimal transmit matrix can be first obtained in each iteration. Subsequently, the solutions for the positions of the transmit and receive MAs are obtained using the SCA method based on the second-order Taylor expansion. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme has significant advantages over the other baseline schemes. In particular, the proposed scheme has the ability to match the performance of the fixed position antenna scheme while utilizing fewer resources.</description>

      <title>Towards Intelligent Antenna Positioning: Leveraging DRL for FAS-Aided ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) enable dynamic antenna positioning, offering new opportunities to enhance integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) performance. However, existing studies primarily focus on communication enhancement or single-target sensing, leaving multi-target scenarios underexplored. Additionally, the joint optimization of beamforming and antenna positions poses a highly non-convex problem, with traditional methods becoming impractical as the number of fluid antennas increases. To address these challenges, this letter proposes a block coordinate descent (BCD) framework integrated with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for intelligent antenna positioning. By leveraging the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, the proposed framework efficiently balances sensing and communication performance. Simulation results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preservation in MIMO-OFDM Localization Systems: A Beamforming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an uplink MIMO-OFDM localization scenario where a legitimate base station (BS) aims to localize a user equipment (UE) using pilot signals transmitted by the UE, while an unauthorized BS attempts to localize the UE by eavesdropping on these pilots, posing a risk to the UE's location privacy. To enhance legitimate localization performance while protecting the UE's privacy, we formulate an optimization problem regarding the beamformers at the UE, aiming to minimize the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for legitimate localization while constraining the CRB for unauthorized localization above a threshold. A penalty dual decomposition optimization framework is employed to solve the problem, leading to a novel beamforming approach for location privacy preservation. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach and demonstrate its superiority over existing benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ReFormer, a generative AI (GAI) model that can efficiently generate synthetic radio-frequency (RF) data, or RF fakes, statistically similar to the data it was trained on, or with modified statistics, in order to augment datasets collected in real-world experiments. For applications like this, adaptability and scalability are important issues. This is why ReFormer leverages transformer-based autoregressive generation, trained on learned discrete representations of RF signals. By using prompts, such GAI can be made to generate the data which complies with specific constraints or conditions, particularly useful for training channel estimation and modeling. It may also leverage the data from a source system to generate training data for a target system. We show how different transformer architectures and other design choices affect the quality of generated RF fakes, evaluated using metrics such as precision and recall, classification accuracy and signal constellation diagrams.</description>

      <title>Movable Superdirective Pairs: A Phase Shifter-Free Approach to mmWave Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a novel Movable Superdirective Pairs (MSP) approach that combines movable antennas with superdirective pair arrays to enhance the performance of millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications on the user side. By controlling the rotation angles and positions of superdirective antenna pairs, the proposed MSP approach maximizes the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of multipath signals without relying on phase shifters or attenuators. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional superdirective antennas, which are typically restricted to the endfire direction and suffer from reduced scanning bandwidth and increased complexity. An efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization and the gradient projection method is developed to solve the non-convex optimization problem of antennas' joint rotating positioning. Simulation results demonstrate that the MSP approach achieves significant performance gains over fixed-position array (FPA) employing Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC), while reducing system complexity and hardware costs.</description>

      <title>Addressing Challenges in Data Quality and Model Generalization for Malaria Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Malaria remains a significant global health burden, particularly in resource-limited regions where timely and accurate diagnosis is critical to effective treatment and control. Deep Learning (DL) has emerged as a transformative tool for automating malaria detection and it offers high accuracy and scalability. However, the effectiveness of these models is constrained by challenges in data quality and model generalization including imbalanced datasets, limited diversity and annotation variability. These issues reduce diagnostic reliability and hinder real-world applicability.
  This article provides a comprehensive analysis of these challenges and their implications for malaria detection performance. Key findings highlight the impact of data imbalances which can lead to a 20\% drop in F1-score and regional biases which significantly hinder model generalization. Proposed solutions, such as GAN-based augmentation, improved accuracy by 15-20\% by generating synthetic data to balance classes and enhance dataset diversity. Domain adaptation techniques, including transfer learning, further improved cross-domain robustness by up to 25\% in sensitivity.
  Additionally, the development of diverse global datasets and collaborative data-sharing frameworks is emphasized as a cornerstone for equitable and reliable malaria diagnostics. The role of explainable AI techniques in improving clinical adoption and trustworthiness is also underscored. By addressing these challenges, this work advances the field of AI-driven malaria detection and provides actionable insights for researchers and practitioners. The proposed solutions aim to support the development of accessible and accurate diagnostic tools, particularly for resource-constrained populations.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis and Optimization of STAR-RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems Relying on Imperfect Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems are investigated under spatially correlated fading channels using realistic imperfect hardware. Specifically, the transceiver distortions, \textcolor{black}{time-varying phase noise, and RIS phase shift errors} are considered. Upon considering imperfect hardware and pilot contamination, we derive a linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion-based cascaded channel estimator. Moreover, a closed-form expression of the downlink ergodic spectral efficiency (SE) is derived based on maximum ratio (MR) based transmit precoding and channel statistics, where both a finite number of access points (APs) and STAR-RIS elements as well as imperfect hardware are considered. Furthermore, by exploiting the ergodic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) among user equipment (UE), a max-min fairness problem is formulated for the joint optimization of the passive transmitting and reflecting beamforming (BF) at the STAR-RIS as well as of the power control coefficients. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed for solving the resultant problems, where iterative adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) and bisection methods are proposed for circumventing the non-convexity of the RIS passive BF and the quasi-concave power control sub-problems, respectively. Our simulation results illustrate that the STAR-RIS-aided CF-mMIMO system attains higher SE than its RIS-aided counterpart. The performance of different hardware parameters is also evaluated. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the SE of the worst UE can be significantly improved by exploiting the proposed AO-based algorithm compared to conventional solutions associated with random passive BF and equal-power scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) is regarded as a promising and revolutionary technology in 6G, aiming to transcend the constraints of ``Shannon's trap" by filtering out redundant information and extracting the core of effective data. Compared to traditional communication paradigms, SemCom offers several notable advantages, such as reducing the burden on data transmission, enhancing network management efficiency, and optimizing resource allocation. Numerous researchers have extensively explored SemCom from various perspectives, including network architecture, theoretical analysis, potential technologies, and future applications. However, as SemCom continues to evolve, a multitude of security and privacy concerns have arisen, posing threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of SemCom systems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the technologies that can be utilized to secure SemCom. Firstly, we elaborate on the entire life cycle of SemCom, which includes the model training, model transfer, and semantic information transmission phases. Then, we identify the security and privacy issues that emerge during these three stages. Furthermore, we summarize the techniques available to mitigate these security and privacy threats, including data cleaning, robust learning, defensive strategies against backdoor attacks, adversarial training, differential privacy, cryptography, blockchain technology, model compression, and physical-layer security. Lastly, this paper outlines future research directions to guide researchers in related fields.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems under Dual-polarized Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems under dual-polarized (DP) channels.
  Unlike the existing ISAC systems, which ignored polarization of electromagnetic waves, this study adopts DP base station (BS) and DP RIS to serve users with a pair of DP antennas.
  The achievable sum rate is maximized through jointly optimizing the beamforming matrix at the DP BS, and the reflecting coefficients at the DP RIS.
  To address this problem, we first utilize the weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) method to transform the objective function into a more tractable form, and then an alternating optimization (AO) method is employed to decouple the original problem into two subproblems.
  Due to the constant modulus constraint, the DP RIS reflection matrix optimization problem is addressed by the majorization-minimization (MM) method.
  For the DP beamforming matrix, we propose a penalty-based algorithm that can obtain a low-complexity closed-form solution.
  Simulation results validate the advantage of deploying DP transmit array and DP RIS in the considered ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>RealTime Health Monitoring Using 5G Networks: A Deep Learning-Based Architecture for Remote Patient Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote patient monitoring is crucial in modern healthcare, but current systems struggle with real-time analysis and prediction of vital signs. This paper presents a novel architecture combining deep learning with 5G network capabilities to enable real-time vital sign monitoring and prediction. The proposed system utilizes a hybrid CNN-LSTM model optimized for edge deployment, paired with 5G Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) for efficient data transmission. The architecture achieves end-to-end latency of 14.4ms while maintaining 96.5% prediction accuracy across multiple vital signs. Our system shows significant improvements over existing solutions, reducing latency by 47% and increasing prediction accuracy by 4.2% compared to current state-of-the-art systems. Performance evaluations conducted over three months with data from 1000 patients validate the system's reliability and scalability in clinical settings. The results demonstrate that integrating deep learning with 5G technology can effectively address the challenges of real-time patient monitoring, leading to early detection of deteriorating conditions and improved clinical outcomes. This research establishes a framework for reliable, real-time vital sign monitoring and prediction in digital healthcare.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient and Intelligent ISAC in V2X Networks with Spiking Neural Networks-Driven DRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal technology for enabling vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity, mobility, and security. However, designing efficient beamforming schemes to achieve accurate sensing and enhance communication performance in the dynamic and uncertain environments of V2X networks presents significant challenges. While AI technologies offer promising solutions, the energy-intensive nature of neural networks (NNs) imposes substantial burdens on communication infrastructures. This work proposes an energy-efficient and intelligent ISAC system for V2X networks. Specifically, we first leverage a Markov Decision Process framework to model the dynamic and uncertain nature of V2X networks. This framework allows the roadside unit (RSU) to develop beamforming schemes relying solely on its current sensing state information, eliminating the need for numerous pilot signals and extensive channel state information acquisition. To endow the system with intelligence and enhance its performance, we then introduce an advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on the Actor-Critic framework with a policy-clipping technique, enabling the joint optimization of beamforming and power allocation strategies to guarantee both communication rate and sensing accuracy. Furthermore, to alleviate the energy demands of NNs, we integrate Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) into the DRL algorithm. By leveraging discrete spikes and their temporal characteristics for information transmission, SNNs not only significantly reduce the energy consumption of deploying AI model in ISAC-assisted V2X networks but also further enhance algorithm performance. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with lower energy consumption, superior communication performance, and improved sensing accuracy.</description>

      <title>Semantics-Guided Diffusion for Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding in Wireless Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint source-channel coding (JSCC) offers a promising avenue for enhancing transmission efficiency by jointly incorporating source and channel statistics into the system design. A key advancement in this area is the deep joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC) technique that designs a direct mapping of input signals to channel symbols parameterized by a neural network, which can be trained for arbitrary channel models and semantic quality metrics. This paper advances the DeepJSCC framework toward a semantics-aligned, high-fidelity transmission approach, called semantics-guided diffusion DeepJSCC (SGD-JSCC). Existing schemes that integrate diffusion models (DMs) with JSCC face challenges in transforming random generation into accurate reconstruction and adapting to varying channel conditions. SGD-JSCC incorporates two key innovations: (1) utilizing some inherent information that contributes to the semantics of an image, such as text description or edge map, to guide the diffusion denoising process; and (2) enabling seamless adaptability to varying channel conditions with the help of a semantics-guided DM for channel denoising. The DM is guided by diverse semantic information and integrates seamlessly with DeepJSCC. In a slow fading channel, SGD-JSCC dynamically adapts to the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) directly estimated from the channel output, thereby eliminating the need for additional pilot transmissions for channel estimation. In a fast fading channel, we introduce a training-free denoising strategy, allowing SGD-JSCC to effectively adjust to fluctuations in channel gains. Numerical results demonstrate that, guided by semantic information and leveraging the powerful DM, our method outperforms existing DeepJSCC schemes, delivering satisfactory reconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Neural Inertial Regression Networks: A Data-Driven Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inertial sensors are integral components in numerous applications, powering crucial features in robotics and our daily lives. In recent years, deep learning has significantly advanced inertial sensing performance and robustness. Deep-learning techniques are used in different domains and platforms to enhance network performance, but no common benchmark is available. The latter is critical for fair comparison and evaluation in a standardized framework as well as development in the field. To fill this gap, we define and thoroughly analyze 13 data-driven techniques for improving neural inertial regression networks. A focus is placed on three aspects of neural networks: network architecture, data augmentation, and data preprocessing. Extensive experiments were made across six diverse datasets that were collected from various platforms including quadrotors, doors, pedestrians, and mobile robots. In total, over 1079 minutes of inertial data sampled between 120-200Hz were analyzed. Our results demonstrate that data augmentation through rotation and noise addition consistently yields the most significant improvements. Moreover, this study outlines benchmarking strategies for enhancing neural inertial regression networks.</description>

Abstract: In the past decade, the number of amateur drones is increasing, and this trend is expected to continue in the future. The security issues brought by abuse and misconduct of drones become more and more severe and may incur a negative impact to the society. In this paper, we leverage existing cellular multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) base station (BS) infrastructure, operating at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands, for drone detection in a device-free manner with the aid of one reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), deployed in the proximity of the BS. We theoretically examine the feasibility of drone detection with the aid of the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and validate via simulations that, the optimized deployment of an RIS can bring added benefits compared to RIS-free systems. In addition, the effect of RIS training beams, training overhead, and radar cross section, is investigated in order to offer theoretical design guidance for the proposed cellular RIS-based passive drone detection system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the potential of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in facilitating passive/device-free three-dimensional (3D) drone localization within existing cellular infrastructure operating at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies and employing multiple antennas at the transceivers. The developed localization system operates in the bi-static mode without requiring direct communication between the drone and the base station. We analyze the theoretical performance limits via Fisher information analysis and Cram\'er Rao lower bounds (CRLBs). Furthermore, we develop a low-complexity yet effective drone localization algorithm based on coordinate gradient descent and examine the impact of factors such as radar cross section (RCS) of the drone and training overhead on system performance. It is demonstrated that integrating RIS yields significant benefits over its RIS-free counterpart, as evidenced by both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>An LSTM Feature Imitation Network for Hand Movement Recognition from sEMG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface Electromyography (sEMG) is a non-invasive signal that is used in the recognition of hand movement patterns, the diagnosis of diseases, and the robust control of prostheses. Despite the remarkable success of recent end-to-end Deep Learning approaches, they are still limited by the need for large amounts of labeled data. To alleviate the requirement for big data, we propose utilizing a feature-imitating network (FIN) for closed-form temporal feature learning over a 300ms signal window on Ninapro DB2, and applying it to the task of 17 hand movement recognition. We implement a lightweight LSTM-FIN network to imitate four standard temporal features (entropy, root mean square, variance, simple square integral). We observed that the LSTM-FIN network can achieve up to 99\% R2 accuracy in feature reconstruction and 80\% accuracy in hand movement recognition. Our results also showed that the model can be robustly applied for both within- and cross-subject movement recognition, as well as simulated low-latency environments. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of the FIN modeling paradigm in data-scarce scenarios for sEMG signal processing.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based IRS Assisted NLoS DoA Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18306v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation in challenging Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) environments is crucial for various wireless applications. This paper presents a novel neural network architecture to address this challenge using an Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS). The key innovation is the introduction of a dedicated, learnable Neural Network (NN)-based IRS layer integrated within a carefully designed network structure. Unlike conventional neural network layers, this specialized layer incorporates sinusoidal weight constraints, where the phase arguments of these sinusoids are learned during training to directly emulate the phase shifts of the IRS elements. This allows the network to autonomously optimize the IRS configuration for enhanced DoA estimation, eliminating the need for separate IRS control algorithms. We adapt standard backpropagation to accommodate these constraints, ensuring effective training. Numerical simulations, conducted under various conditions and noise levels, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to traditional methods, highlighting its potential for significantly improved DoA estimation accuracy in complex IRS-assisted wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Aided Secure Full-Duplex Multi-User Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate physical layer security (PLS) for full-duplex (FD) multi-user systems. We consider a base station (BS) that operates in FD mode and transmits artificial noise (AN) to simultaneously protect uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmissions. Conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) at the FD BS struggle to fully exploit spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to improve signal reception and suppress interference. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel FD BS architecture equipped with multiple transmit and receive movable antennas (MAs). The MAs introduce the DoFs in antenna position optimization, which can improve the performance of secure communication systems. To serve users and counter the cooperative interception of multiple eavesdroppers (Eves), we formulate a sum of secrecy rates (SSR) maximization problem to jointly optimize the MA positions, the transmit, receive, and AN beamformers at the BS, and the UL powers. We propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which decomposes the original problem into three sub-problems, to solve the challenging non-convex optimization problem with highly coupled variables. Specifically, we propose the multi-velocity particle swarm optimization (MVPSO), which is an improved version of the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO), to simultaneously optimize all MA positions. The transmit/AN beamformers and the UL powers are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA). The optimal receive beamformer is derived as a closed-form solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and the advantages of MAs over conventional FPAs in enhancing the security of FD multi-user systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Machine Learning (ML) network based on transfer learning and transformer networks is applied to wave propagation models for complex indoor settings. This network is designed to predict signal propagation in environments with a variety of objects, effectively simulating the diverse range of furniture typically found in indoor spaces. We propose Attention U-Net with Efficient Networks as the backbone, to process images encoded with the essential information of the indoor environment. The indoor environment is defined by its fundamental structure, such as the arrangement of walls, windows, and doorways, alongside varying configurations of furniture placement. An innovative algorithm is introduced to generate a 3D environment from a 2D floorplan, which is crucial for efficient collection of data for training. The model is evaluated by comparing the predicted signal coverage map with ray tracing (RT) simulations. The prediction results show a root mean square error of less than 6 dB across all tested scenarios, with significant improvements observed when using a Double U-Net structure compared to a single U-Net model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11857v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offload computationally intensive tasks to multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, enabling applications within the vehicular metaverse, which transforms physical environment into the digital space enabling advanced analysis or predictive modeling. A core challenge is physical-to-virtual (P2V) synchronization through digital twins (DTs), reliant on MEC networks and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). To address this, we introduce radiance field (RF) delta video compression (RFDVC), which uses RF-encoder and RF-decoder architecture using distributed RFs as DTs storing photorealistic 3D urban scenes in compressed form. This method extracts differences between CAV-frame capturing actual traffic and RF-frame capturing empty scene from the same camera pose in batches encoded and transmitted over the MEC network. Experiments show data savings up to 71% against H.264 codec and 44% against H.265 codec under different conditions as lighting changes, and rain. RFDVC also demonstrates resilience to transmission errors, achieving up to +0.29 structural similarity index measure (SSIM) improvement at block error rate (BLER) = 0.35 in non-rainy and +0.25 at BLER = 0.2 in rainy conditions, ensuring superior visual quality compared to standard video coding (VC) methods across various conditions.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants have led to remarkable progress across various domains, demonstrating impressive capabilities and unprecedented potential. In the era of ubiquitous connectivity, leveraging communication networks to distribute intelligence is a transformative concept, envisioning AI-powered services accessible at the network edge. However, pushing large models from the cloud to resource-constrained environments faces critical challenges. Model inference on low-end devices leads to excessive latency and performance bottlenecks, while raw data transmission over limited bandwidth networks causes high communication overhead. This article presents AI Flow, a framework that streamlines the inference process by jointly leveraging the heterogeneous resources available across devices, edge nodes, and cloud servers, making intelligence flow across networks. To facilitate cooperation among multiple computational nodes, the proposed framework explores a paradigm shift in the design of communication network systems from transmitting information flow to intelligence flow, where the goal of communications is task-oriented and folded into the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through an image captioning use case, showcasing the ability to reduce response latency while maintaining high-quality captions. This article serves as a position paper for identifying the motivation, challenges, and principles of AI Flow.</description>

      <title>FOGNA: An effective Sum-Difference Co-Array Design Based on Fourth-Order Cumulants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Array structures based on the fourth-order difference co-array (FODCA) provide more degrees of freedom (DOF). However, since the growth of DOF is limited by a single case of fourth-order cumulant in FODCA, this paper aims to design a sparse linear array (SLA) with higher DOF via exploring different cases of fourth-order cumulants. This paper presents a mathematical framework based on fourth-order cumulant to devise a fourth-order extend co-array (FOECA), which is equivalent to FODCA. A novel SLA, namely fourth-order generalized nested array (FOGNA), is proposed based on FOECA to provide closed-form expressions for the sensor locations and enhance DOF to resolve more signal sources in direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. FOGNA is consisted of three subarrays, where the first is a concatenated nested array and the other two subarrays are SLA with big inter-spacing between sensors. When the total physical sensors of FOGNA are given, the number of sensors in each subarray is determined by the designed method, which can obtain the maximum DOF under the proposed array structure and derive closed-form expressions for the sensor locations of FOGNA. The proposed array structure not only achieves higher DOF than those of existing FODCAs but also reduces mutual coupling effects. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the superiority of FOGNA on DOA estimation performance and enhanced DOF over other existing FODCAs.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Bayesian Learning via Regularization, Confidence Minimization, and Selective Inference</title>

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) models in fields such as engineering is limited by the known difficulty of quantifying the reliability of an AI's decision. A well-calibrated AI model must correctly report its accuracy on in-distribution (ID) inputs, while also enabling the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. A conventional approach to improve calibration is the application of Bayesian ensembling. However, owing to computational limitations and model misspecification, practical ensembling strategies do not necessarily enhance calibration. This paper proposes an extension of variational inference (VI)-based Bayesian learning that integrates calibration regularization for improved ID performance, confidence minimization for OOD detection, and selective calibration to ensure a synergistic use of calibration regularization and confidence minimization. The scheme is constructed successively by first introducing calibration-regularized Bayesian learning (CBNN), then incorporating out-of-distribution confidence minimization (OCM) to yield CBNN-OCM, and finally integrating also selective calibration to produce selective CBNN-OCM (SCBNN-OCM). Selective calibration rejects inputs for which the calibration performance is expected to be insufficient. Numerical results illustrate the trade-offs between ID accuracy, ID calibration, and OOD calibration attained by both frequentist and Bayesian learning methods. Among the main conclusions, SCBNN-OCM is seen to achieve best ID and OOD performance as compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches at the cost of rejecting a sufficiently large number of inputs.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Fusion of Sparse Spatial Features for Integrated Sensing and Edge AI over Broadband Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 6G mobile networks feature two new usage scenarios -- distributed sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI). Their natural integration, termed integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), promises to create a platform that enables intelligent environment perception for wide-ranging applications. A basic operation in ISEA is for a fusion center to acquire and fuse features of spatial sensing data distributed at many edge devices (known as agents), which is confronted by a communication bottleneck due to multiple access over hostile wireless channels. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, called Spatial Over-the-Air Fusion (Spatial AirFusion), which exploits radio waveform superposition to aggregate spatially sparse features over the air and thereby enables simultaneous access. The framework supports simultaneous aggregation over multiple voxels, which partition the 3D sensing region, and across multiple subcarriers. It exploits both spatial feature sparsity with channel diversity to pair voxel-level aggregation tasks and subcarriers to maximize the minimum receive signal-to-noise ratio among voxels. Optimally solving the resultant mixed-integer problem of Voxel-Carrier Pairing and Power Allocation (VoCa-PPA) is a focus of this work. The proposed approach hinges on derivations of optimal power allocation as a closed-form function of voxel-carrier pairing and a useful property of VoCa-PPA that allows dramatic solution space reduction. Both a low-complexity greedy algorithm and an optimal tree-search algorithm are then designed for VoCa-PPA. The latter is accelerated with a customised compact search tree, node pruning and agent ordering. Extensive simulations using real datasets demonstrate that Spatial AirFusion significantly reduces computation errors and improves sensing accuracy compared with conventional over-the-air computation without awareness of spatial sparsity.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Autoencoder Framework for End-to-End Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of quantum machine learning to End-to-End (E2E) communication systems in wireless fading scenarios. We introduce a novel hybrid quantum-classical autoencoder architecture that combines parameterized quantum circuits with classical deep neural networks (DNNs). Specifically, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical autoencoder (QAE) framework to optimize the E2E communication system. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed hybrid system, and reveal that it is the first work that can achieve comparable block error rate (BLER) performance to classical DNN-based and conventional channel coding schemes, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Additionally, the proposed QAE exhibits steady and superior BLER convergence over the classical autoencoder baseline.</description>
