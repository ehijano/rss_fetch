      <title>BPS spectroscopy with reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply reinforcement learning (RL) to establish whether at a given position in the Coulomb branch of the moduli space of a 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ quantum field theory (QFT) the BPS spectrum is finite. If it is, we furthermore determine the full BPS spectrum at such point in moduli space. We demonstrate that using a RL model one can efficiently determine the suitable sequence of quiver mutations of the BPS quiver that will generate the full BPS spectrum. We analyse the performance of the RL model on random BPS quivers and show that it converges to a solution various orders of magnitude faster than a systematic brute-force scan. As a result, we show that our algorithm can be used to identify all minimal chambers of a given $\mathcal{N}=2$ QFT, a task previously intractable with computer scanning. As an example, we recover all minimal chambers of the $\text{SU}(2)$ $N_f = 4$ gauge theory, and discover new minimal chambers for theories that can be realized by IIB geometric engineering.</description>

      <title>The Double EFT Expansion in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to characterize the structure of higher-derivative corrections within low-energy Effective Field Theories (EFTs) arising from a UV-complete theory of quantum gravity. To this end, we use string theory as a laboratory and argue that such EFTs should exhibit a $\textit{double EFT expansion}$ involving higher-curvature operators. The $\textit{field-theoretic}$ expansion is governed by the mass of the lightest (tower of) new degrees of freedom, as expected from standard field theory considerations. Conversely, the $\textit{quantum-gravitational}$ expansion is suppressed relative to the Einstein-Hilbert term by the quantum gravity cutoff, $\Lambda_{\rm QG}$, above which no local gravitational EFT description remains valid. This structure becomes manifest in the so-called $\textit{asymptotic regime}$, where a hierarchy between the Planck scale and $\Lambda_{\rm QG}$ emerges, the latter identified herein as the species scale. Most notably, we demonstrate the features of the double EFT expansion through an amplitudes-based approach in (toroidal compactifications of) ten-dimensional Type IIA string theory, and via a detailed analysis of the supersymmetric black hole entropy in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravities derived from Type II Calabi-Yau compactifications. We provide further evidence for our proposal across various string theory setups, including Calabi-Yau compactifications of M/F-theory and Type II string theory. Finally, we explore the implications of this framework for the Wilson coefficients of the aforementioned higher-curvature operators, revealing potentially significant constraints in the asymptotic regime and highlighting a remarkable interplay with recent results from the S-matrix bootstrap program.</description>

      <title>Constraints from Entanglement Wedge Nesting for Holography at a Finite Cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore constraints that arise from associating an entanglement wedge (EW) to subregions of a cutoff boundary at a finite distance in AdS/CFT, using a subcritical end-of-the-world (ETW) brane acting as the cutoff. In particular, we consider the case of two intervals in the holographic dual to a BCFT, with one interval $A$ located at the asymptotic boundary and the second interval $B$ located on the ETW brane. We discuss in detail subtleties that arise near the RT end-points when defining the EW for this configuration, particularly in the connected phase. Entanglement wedge nesting (EWN) requires that $\mathcal{W}_E(A) \cup \mathcal{W}_E(B) \subseteq \mathcal{W}_E(A\cup B)$. We demonstrate that already in the simplest example of an AdS$_3$ bulk geometry, EWN can be violated even if $A$ and $B$ are spacelike separated through the bulk and instead we must require the stronger condition that $\mathcal{W}_E(A)$ be spacelike separated from $\mathcal{W}_E(B)$, which highlights the non-local nature of the cutoff theory. Our prescription to associate EWs to subregions on the ETW brane is different from the restricted maximin procedure in arXiv:2008.07022 but will agree within the subset of parameter space where EWN is respected. Additionally, we study EWN in a two sided BTZ black hole geometry with an ETW brane in one of the exteriors. In the BTZ black hole example we find that our condition for EWN disallows configurations where the RT surface goes from the brane to the black hole singularity.</description>

      <title>Bipartite expansion beyond biparticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently suggested bipartite analysis extends the Kauffman planar decomposition to arbitrary $N$, i.e. extends it from the Jones polynomial to the HOMFLY polynomial. This provides a generic and straightforward non-perturbative calculus in an arbitrary Chern--Simons theory. Technically, this approach is restricted to knots and links which possess bipartite realizations, i.e. can be entirely glued from antiparallel lock (two-vertex) tangles rather than single-vertex $R$-matrices. However, we demonstrate that the resulting positive decomposition (PD), i.e. the representation of the fundamental HOMFLY polynomials as positive integer polynomials of the three parameters $\phi$, $\bar\phi$ and $D$, exists for arbitrary knots, not only bipartite ones. This poses new questions about the true significance of bipartite expansion, which appears to make sense far beyond its original scope, and its generalizations to higher representations. We have provided two explanations for the existence of the PD for non-bipartite knots. An interesting option is to resolve a particular bipartite vertex in a not-fully-bipartite diagram and reduce the HOMFLY polynomial to a linear combination of those for smaller diagrams. If the resulting diagrams correspond to bipartite links, this option provides a PD even to an initially non-bipartite knot. Another possibility for a non-bipartite knot is to have a bipartite clone with the same HOMFLY polynomial providing this PD. We also suggest a promising criterium for the existence of a bipartite realization behind a given PD, which is based on the study of the precursor Jones polynomials.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative corrections in the semi-classical limit of double-scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the disk partition function of double-scaled SYK model (DSSYK) in the small $\lambda$ limit, where $\lambda=-\log q$ is the coupling of DSSYK. We find that the partition function receives non-perturbative corrections in $\lambda$, which can be resummed by the cubic power of the Dedekind eta function in a certain low temperature limit. We also discuss a possible bulk interpretation of our findings.</description>

      <title>Quark-Antiquark Potential as a Probe for Holographic Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent paper (Phys.Rev.Lett. 133 (2024) 12, 121601), a higher-order phase transition between the planar, charged, 5-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om-Anti-de Sitter black hole and a hairy black hole solution of the type IIB supergravity was investigated. Here, we set out to investigate these two phases of the theory by means of the holographic probe that describes a quark-antiquark in the dual gauge theory. We show that the study of the quark-antiquark potential turns out to be a useful method to investigate the change of behavior at different values of the parameter that controls the phase transition, this parameter being the ratio between the chemical potential and the temperature. In other words, the string probes detects the phase transition.</description>

      <title>The discussions on the universal relation between corrections to entropy and the extremality of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes under the GUP and EUP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the extremality relations by examining perturbative corrections to both the entropy of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes and their extremality bounds under the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) and the extended uncertainty principle (EUP) respectively. We argue that the corrected uncertainty principles including GUP and EUP violate the validity of extremality relations because no matching condition can be imposed to support the universal relation unless the influences from GUP and EUP disappear.</description>

      <title>Two-Measure Electroweak Standard Model. Some aspects of cosmological evolution and vacuum stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15623v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the FLRW universe, the scalar field \phi(t) obtained by cosmological averaging of the local Higgs field H(x) is considered as a classical field for which the SM quantization procedure is meaningless. When applying the Two-Measure theory (TMT) to study cosmology, the ratio \zeta of the measure densities is a scalar function, which: enters into all equations of motion. Through the constraint, $\zeta$ is defined as a function of \phi(t). During cosmological evolution, \zeta(\phi) changes from \zeta\approx 0 at the inflationary stage to \zeta=1 at the approaching vacuum stage. Each stage of the classical cosmological background is determined by the set \{\phi(t), {\rm curvature}, \zeta(\phi(t))\}. The Two-Measure SM (TMSM) is realized in the context of cosmology as a set of cosmologically modified copies of the GWS model. Each of the copies exists as a local quantum field theory defined on the classical cosmological background at the appropriate stage of its evolution. This basic idea is studied in detail for the stage of slow-roll inflation and for the stage of approaching vacuum. Due to the presence of \zeta(\phi(t)) in all equations of motion, all TMSM coupling constants turn out to be running (classical) TMT-effective parameters. During cosmological evolution, changing these parameters yields new results: the classical running TMT-effective Higgs selfcoupling increases from \lambda\sim 10^{-11} (which ensures consistency with Planck's CMB data at \xi=\frac{1}{6}) to \lambda\sim 0.1 near vacuum; the mass term in the Higgs potential changes sign from positive to negative, providing standard SSB; the classical running gauge and Yukawa coupling constants change by several orders of magnitude; the GWS theory is reproduced so that the fermion mass hierarchy is obtained quite naturally. 1-loop quantum corrections preserves the slow-roll inflation and does not violate the vacuum stability.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black holes in the presence of Thermal fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the thermodynamic properties and stability of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black holes, focusing on the effects of deformation ($\alpha$) and thermal correction parameters ($\beta_1$, $\beta_2$) on phase transitions and heat capacity. The results show that higher $\alpha$ values raise the Hawking-Page critical temperature, enhancing thermal stability. Thermal corrections significantly affect smaller black holes but minimally impact larger ones, leaving second-order phase transitions unchanged. Heat capacity analysis identifies stability regions, with sign changes marking instability. These findings highlight the role of deformation and thermal corrections in black hole stability, offering insights for extending our understanding of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermal correlator at null infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermal Carrollian correlators at null infinity in the real-time formalism. We derive the Feynman rules to calculate these correlators in the position space. We compute the bulk-to-bulk, bulk-to boundary and boundary-to-boundary propagators for massless scalar theory. Due to the doubling of the fields degrees of freedom, the number of each propagator is quadrupled. The bulk-to-boundary propagators have the form of (extended) Bose-Einstein distribution in the position space. Utilizing the contour integral of the propagators, we can transform the Feynman rules to momentum space. Interestingly, the external lines and the amplitude in the momentum space depend on the contour while Carrollian correlators in the position space are independent of the contour. We show how to compute four point correlators at finite temperature. The tree level correlators can be written as the summation of Barnes zeta functions and reduce to the ones in the zero temperature limit.</description>

      <title>Kac-Moody Algebras on Soft Group Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15892v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the so-called group geometric approach to (super)gravity and (super)string theories, any compact Lie group manifold $G_{c}$ can be smoothly deformed into a group manifold $G_{c}^{\mu }$ (locally diffeomorphic to $G_{c}$ itself), which is `soft', namely, based on a non-left-invariant, intrinsic one-form Vielbein $\mu $, which violates the Maurer-Cartan equations and consequently has a non-vanishing associated curvature two-form. Within the framework based on the above deformation (`softening'), we show how to construct an infinite-dimensional (infinite-rank), generalized Kac-Moody (KM) algebra associated to $G_{c}^{\mu }$, starting from the generalized KM algebras associated to $G_{c}$. As an application, we consider KM algebras associated to deformed manifolds such as the `soft' circle, the `soft' two-sphere and the `soft' three-sphere. While the generalized KM algebra associated to the deformed circle is trivially isomorphic to its undeformed analogue, and hence not new, the `softening' of the two- and three- sphere includes squashed manifolds (and in particular, the so-called Berger three-sphere) and yields to non-trivial results.</description>

      <title>Acceleration as refrigeration: Acceleration-induced spontaneous symmetry breaking in thermal medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that a uniform acceleration of matter produces an effect similar to cooling, thus leading, in particular, to the enhancement effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking. This conclusion is supported by the observation by Unruh and Weiss that thermal correlation functions computed at a temperature equal to the Unruh temperature are identical to the corresponding correlation functions in a Minkowski (zero-temperature) vacuum. We consider an example of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in a co-accelerating reference frame and show that the uniform acceleration of hot gas of interacting fermions enhances the mass gap generation and increases the critical temperature of the chiral transition. We derive a simple dependence of the critical temperature of a second-order phase transition on acceleration that, as we argue, should be applicable to a broad range of field theories.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Non-Singular Solutions in Effective Theory from Kaluza-Klein Unimodular Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unimodular theory incorporating the Kaluza-Klein construction in five dimensions leads, after reduction to four dimensions, to a new class of scalar-tensor theory. The vacuum cosmological solutions display a bouncing, non singular behavior. From the four dimensional point of view, the solutions are completely regular. However, the propagation of gravitational waves in this geometry displays the presence of instabilities which reflect some features of the original five dimensional structure. Comparison with a four dimensional quantum model with cosmological constant, which has a similar background behavior, is discussed.</description>

Abstract: We review some important facts about the structure of tensor products of finite dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras. This is done from the elementary standpoint of the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras in the scope of a masters thesis. We set the focus on drawing the line to the finite dimensional representation theory of quantum affine $\mathfrak{sl}_n$, the theory of q-characters, and introduce the so called snake modules together with their character formula.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the quasinormal modes exhibited by a massive scalar test field carrying an electric charge, oscillating in the outer region of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter black hole. We examine the quasinormal mode effective potential throughout the black hole mass-charge phase space, finding a single-peaked barrier potential on $r_+ &lt; r &lt; r_c$ for all non-extremised black hole solutions for $\ell \geq 1$. Unlike in the Schwarzschild background, increasing scalar field mass heightens the peak of this barrier potential, while increasing the scalar field charge suppresses it. We compute the corresponding quasinormal frequency spectrum using a WKB-based semi-classical method, where, like the Schwarzschild case, we observe anomalous QNM damping behaviour for small scalar field mass below some critical mass $\mu_{crit}$, which is $\ell$-independent for $q=0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a semiclassical study of the Mixmaster cosmology minimally coupled to a massive scalar field in the Hamiltonian formalism, with focus on three distinct scenarios: the classical cosmology coupled to the quantized scalar field, and "effective" cosmology, with spacetime discreteness corrections, coupled to the classical scalar field, and to the quantized scalar field. We find several results: (i) the effective cosmology undergoes several small bounces before expanding, with scalar field excitations rising through the bounce; (ii) anisotropies rise and fall as the universe undergoes a bounce, a feature that is enhanced with matter; (iii) Lyapunov exponents reveal that chaos is reduced in the effective systems compared to the classical case.</description>

      <title>Twisted intertwining operators and tensor products of (generalized) twisted modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the general twisted intertwining operators (intertwining operators among twisted modules) for a vertex operator algebra $V$. We give the skew-symmetry and contragredient isomorphisms between spaces of twisted intertwining operators and also prove some other properties of twisted intertwining operators. Using twisted intertwining operators, we introduce a notion of $P(z)$-tensor product of two objects for $z\in \mathbb{C}^{\times}$ in a category of suitable $g$-twisted $V$-modules for $g$ in a group of automorphisms of $V$ and give a construction of such a $P(z)$-tensor product under suitable assumptions. We also construct $G$-crossed commutativity isomorphisms and $G$-crossed braiding isomorphisms. We formulate a $P(z)$-compatibility condition and a $P(z)$-grading-restriction condition and use these conditions to give another construction of the $P(z)$-tensor product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalization of Birkhoff's theorem for higher dimensions in Lovelock gravity permits us to investigate the black hole solutions with horizon geometries of nonconstant curvature. We present a new class of exotic dyonic black holes in the context of Lovelock gravity and generalized quasitopological electromagnetism. First, we derive the polynomial equation that describes exotic dyonic black holes in Lovelock gravity with an arbitrary order. Next, the solutions that characterize dyonic exotic black holes of the Gauss-Bonnet and third order Lovelock gravities are worked out. Then we compute the basic thermodynamic quantities for these exotic dyonic black holes. It is also verified that these quantities satisfy the generalized first law and Smarr's relation. Furthermore, the impact of generalized quasitopological electromagnetism and topological parameters on the local stability of the resulting objects are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Dark Chiral Phase Transition Driven by Chemical Potential and its Gravitational Wave Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, for the first time, we explore the scenario that the dark-QCD sector has a large chemical potential $\mu$ (on the order of magnitude of temperature) of dark quarks. It leads to a complex-valued Polyakov loop and tilts the partial confinement effect, driving the dark-QCD phase transition to a first-order one in the early universe. We present a toy model via the Affleck-Dine mechanism that could generate degenerate dark quarks. Our study, in the framework of PNJL, focuses on the dynamical impacts of a large chemical potential on the chiral phase transition without turning on the KMT instanton term. We plot the phase diagram of the dark-QCD in the chiral limit. The resulting first-order phase transition actually refers to a chiral phase transition, with the transition to the confinement vacuum being a cross-over. Following the phase diagram, we find that increasing $\mu$ can considerably prolong the duration of the phase transition and also the release of latent heat, which together make the cosmic dark-QCD phase transition at the critical temperature above 1 GeV and below 100 GeV produce gravitational wave signal in the intermediate frequency band, which is well probable in space detectors such as BBO</description>

      <title>Three flavor QCD phase transition with M\"obius domain wall fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an updated study of the $N_f=3$ QCD phase transition using M\"{o}bius domain wall fermions. Simulations were performed on $N_t=12$ lattices with aspect ratios ranging from 2 to 4 for various quark masses, at a lattice spacing of $a=0.1361(20)$ fm, corresponding to a temperature of 121(2) MeV. To clarify the nature of the phase transition, a large-volume lattice, $48^3 \times 12\times 16$, was added to analyze the volume dependence of disconnected chiral susceptibility. By examining the chiral condensate, disconnected chiral susceptibility, and Binder cumulant, and incorporating results from $24^3 \times 12 \times 16$ and $36^3 \times 12 \times 16$ lattices reported in previous lattice proceedings, we identify a crossover at a quark mass of approximately $m_q^{\mathrm{\overline {MS}}}(2\, \mathrm{GeV}) \sim 4$ MeV at this temperature. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of residual chiral symmetry breaking on the chiral condensate and disconnected chiral susceptibility for different values of $L_s$.</description>

      <title>Improving accuracy of tree-tensor network approach by optimization of network structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods based on tensor networks have been extensively explored in the research of quantum many-body systems in recent years. It has been recognized that the ability of tensor networks to describe a quantum many-body state crucially depends on the spatial structure of the network. In the previous work, we proposed an algorithm based on tree tensor networks (TTNs) that automatically optimizes the structure of TTN according to the spatial profile of entanglement in the state of interest. In this paper, we precisely analyze how detailed updating schemes in the structural optimization algorithm affect its computational accuracy for the random XY-exchange model under random magnetic fields and the Richardson model. We then find that for the random XY model, on the one hand, the algorithm achieves improved accuracy, and the stochastic algorithm, which selects the local network structure probabilistically, is notably effective. For the Richardson model, on the other hand, the resulting numerical accuracy subtly depends on the initial TTN and the updating schemes. In particular, the algorithm without the stochastic updating scheme certainly improves the accuracy, while the one with the stochastic updates results in poor accuracy due to the effect of randomizing the network structure at the early stage of the calculation. These results indicate that the algorithm successfully improves the accuracy of the numerical calculations for quantum many-body states, while it is essential to appropriately choose the updating scheme as well as the initial TTN structure, depending on the systems treated.</description>

Abstract: We present systems of parabosons and parafermions in the context of Lie algebras, Lie superalgebras, $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie algebras and $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie superalgebras. For certain relevant $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie algebras and $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie superalgebras, some structure theory in terms of roots and root vectors is developed. The short root vectors of these algebras are identified with parastatistics operators. For the $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie algebra $so_q(2n+1)$, a system consisting of two ensembles of parafermions satisfying relative paraboson relations are introduced. For the $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie superalgebra $osp(1,0|2n_1,2n_2)$, a system consisting of two ensembles of parabosons satisfying relative parafermion relations are introduced.</description>

      <title>Ultra-cold neutrons in qBounce experiments as laboratory for test of chameleon field theories and cosmic acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerating expansion of the Universe, attributed to dark energy, has spurred interest in theories involving scalar fields such as chameleon field theories. These fields, which couple to matter with density-dependent effective mass, offer a promising explanation for cosmic acceleration. Experiments leveraging ultra-cold neutrons (UCNs) provide an innovative approach to testing these theories. The existence of a chameleon field, being responsible for the current phase of cosmic acceleration, is investigated by analysing a free fall of ultra-cold neutrons from the gap between two mirrors after their bouncing between these two mirrors. We analyse a deformation of the wave functions of the quantum gravitational states of ultra-cold neutrons, induced by a chameleon field, and find a new upper bound $\beta\leq6.5\times10^8$ on the chameleon-matter coupling constant $\beta$ from the unitarity condition. This result refines previous estimates and highlights the potential of ultra-cold neutron experiments as laboratories for exploring scalar field theories and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Stationary scalar clouds around a rotating BTZ-like black hole in the Einstein-bumblebee gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have studied stationary clouds of massive scalar fields around a rotating BTZ-like black hole in the Einstein-bumblebee gravity, by imposing the Robin type boundary conditions at the AdS boundary. We establish, by scanning the parameter space, the existence of \textit{fundamental} stationary scalar clouds ($i.e.$, the overtone number $n=0$). In particular, we observe that the Lorentz symmetry breaking parameter $s$ and the quantum number $k$ play an opposite role in determining scalar clouds, which indicates the existence of \textit{degenerate} scalar clouds. To illustrate the fact that scalar clouds may only be supported for the $n=0$ case, we have analyzed the impact of various parameters on scalar quasinormal modes. It is shown that the Lorentz symmetry breaking parameter $s$ does not change the superradiance condition, and superradiant instabilities only appear for the fundamental modes. Our work shows that the Lorentz symmetry breaking provides richer physics in stationary scalar clouds around black holes.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of QCD first-order phase transition from neutron star measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential hadron-to-quark phase transition in neutron stars has not been fully understood as the property of cold, dense, and strongly interacting matter cannot be theoretically described by the first-principle perturbative calculations, nor have they been systematically measured through terrestrial low-to-intermediate energy heavy-ion experiments. Given the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations, the equation of state (EoS) of the neutron star (NS) matter can be constrained by the observations of NS mass, radius, and tidal deformability. However, large observational uncertainties and the limited number of observations currently make it challenging to strictly reconstruct the EoS, especially to identify interesting features such as a strong first-order phase transition. In this work, we study the dependency of reconstruction quality of the phase transition on the number of NS observations of mass and radius as well as their uncertainty, based on a fiducial EoS. We conquer this challenging problem by constructing a neural network, which allows one to parameterize the EoS with minimum model-dependency, and by devising an algorithm of parameter optimization based on the analytical linear response analysis of the TOV equations. This work may pave the way for the understanding of the phase transition features in NSs using future $X$-ray and gravitational wave measurements.</description>

Abstract: This article is dedicated to the memory of Alexei Starobinsky. I begin with some recollections of him and then review the generalization of his wonderful stochastic formalism from scalar potential models to theories which interact with fermions and photons, and finally to theories with derivative interactions such as nonlinear sigma models and gravity. This entails effective potentials generated by the usual field-dependent masses, as well as by field-dependent field strengths, and by field-dependent Hubble parameters. I also discuss secular loop corrections which cannot be captured by stochastic techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measured standard model parameters indicate that we might live in a false Higgs vacuum, possibly with a very long lifetime. However, small black holes can serve as catalysers and significantly speed up the phase transition. In fact, bubbles of true vacuum might already exist in our universe. We calculate the spectrum of Higgs particles produced by such a bubble, and use event generators to study their decay and subsequent evolution of the decay products to obtain the spectrum of emitted photons and neutrinos as a long-range signature. If the propagation of the bubble walls slows down due to interaction with the surrounding matter and plasma, these signals can reach us before the bubble wall hits us, thus representing the signals of the doomsday.</description>

      <title>Using Wald-Gauss-Bonnet topological dark energy to simultaneously alleviate the $H_{0}$ and $\sigma_{8}$ tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present how Wald-Gauss-Bonnet topological dark energy can alleviate $H_{0}$ and $\sigma 8$ tensions simultaneously. This modified cosmological scenario is obtained by applying the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture to the Universe apparent horizon, employing the Wald-Gauss-Bonnet entropy instead of the standard Bekenstein Hawking one. Therefore, the modified Friedmann equations and the effective dark energy depend on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant and on measured astrophysical parameters such as the black-hole formation rate and the black-hole progenitors average mass. Wald-Gauss-Bonnet topological dark energy exhibits phantom behavior at intermediate redshifts for positive coupling constants, which is known to be a sufficient mechanism that can lead to the $H_{0}$ tension alleviation. Indeed, we show that for particular regions of the parameter space the scenario at hand does lead to higher $H_{0}$ values, and we verify this result performing a confrontation with observational data from Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) measurements. Additionally, analyzing the growth of structures and the evolution of the matter overdensity we show that the redshift behavior of the $f\sigma_{8}$ observable obtains smaller values than the ones arising in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and thus the scenario at hand can alleviate the $\sigma_{8}$ tension too. This is an advantage of Wald-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology, since the simultaneous alleviation of both tensions cannot be easily achieved within other entropic scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose a system of partial differential equations with constant coefficients describes a classical field theory. Einstein proposed a definition of the strength of such a theory and its degrees of freedom (DoF) based on the asymptotic number of free Taylor series coefficients of bounded degree in the general solution of the system. however, direct calculating the DoF is a nontrivial task. Here, we apply commutative algebra methods to this problem.
  We begin by interpreting the matrix of the system as a linear map between polynomial modules. First, we derive an explicit formula for the DoF as the multiplicity of a certain extension module. Second, we prove (for homogeneous and certain more general systems) another explicit formula for the DoF in terms of gauge symmetries and identities. A notable consequence of this formula is that two Hermitian conjugate systems have identical DoF.</description>

Abstract: Plasma kinetics, for both flat and curved spacetime, is conventionally performed on the mass shell, a 7--dimensional time-phase space with a Vlasov vector field, also known as the Liouville vector field. The choice of this time-phase space encodes the parameterisation of the underling 2nd order ordinary differential equations. By replacing the Vlasov vector on time-phase space with a bivector on an 8--dimensional sub-bundle of the tangent bundle, we create a parameterisation free version of Vlasov theory. This has a number of advantages, which include working for lightlike and ultra-relativistic particles, non metric connections, and metric-free and premetric theories. It also works for theories where no time-phase space can exist for topological topological reasons. An example of this is when we wish to consider all geodesics, including spacelike geodesics.
  We extend the particle density function to a 6--form on the subbundle of the tangent space, and define the transport equations, which correspond to the Vlasov equation. We then show how to define the corresponding 3--current on spacetime. We discuss the stress-energy tensor needed for the Einstein-Vlasov system.
  This theory can be generalised to create parameterisation invariant Vlasov theories for many 2nd order theories, on arbitrary manifolds. The relationship to sprays and semi-sprays is given and examples from Finsler geometry are also given.</description>

Abstract: We study the equation of state of three-dimensional compact U(1) gauge theory on the lattice by means of numerical simulations, and discuss the implications of our results for the spectrum of the theory, in connection with previous results from the literature. We also compare our findings to the case of non-Abelian gauge theories and comment on the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Large Language Models and the $O(N)$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit unprecedentedly rich scaling behaviors. In physics, scaling behavior is closely related to phase transitions, critical phenomena, and field theory. To investigate the phase transition phenomena in LLMs, we reformulated the Transformer architecture as an $O(N)$ model. Our study reveals two distinct phase transitions corresponding to the temperature used in text generation and the model's parameter size, respectively. The first phase transition enables us to estimate the internal dimension of the model, while the second phase transition is of \textit{higher-depth} and signals the emergence of new capabilities. As an application, the energy of the $O(N)$ model can be used to evaluate whether an LLM's parameters are sufficient to learn the training data.</description>

      <title>Twisted gauging and topological sectors in (2+1)d abelian lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a two-dimensional quantum lattice model with an abelian gauge theory interpretation, we investigate a duality operation that amounts to gauging its invertible 1-form symmetry, followed by gauging the resulting 0-form symmetry in a twisted way via a choice of discrete torsion. Using tensor networks, we introduce explicit lattice realisations of the so-called condensation defects, which are obtained by gauging the 1-form symmetry along submanifolds of spacetime, and employ the same calculus to realise the duality operators. By leveraging these tensor network operators, we compute the non-trivial interplay between symmetry-twisted boundary conditions and charge sectors under the duality operation, enabling us to construct isometries relating the dual Hamiltonians. Whenever a lattice gauge theory is left invariant under the duality operation, we explore the possibility of promoting the self-duality to an internal symmetry. We argue that this results in a symmetry structure that encodes the 2-representations of a 2-group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.13365v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reconsider the complete solution of the linear TBA equation describing the energy density of finite density states in the $O(N)$ nonlinear sigma models by the Wiener-Hopf method. We keep all perturbative and non-perturbative contributions and introduce a running coupling in terms of which all asymptotic series appearing in the problem can be represented as pure power series without logs. We work out the first non-perturbative contribution in the $O(3)$ case and show that (presumably because of the instanton corrections) resurgence theory fails in this example. Using the relation of the $O(3)$ problem to the coaxial disks capacitor problem we work out the leading non-perturbative terms for the latter and show that (at least to this order) resurgence theory, in particular the median resummation prescription, gives the correct answer. We demonstrate this by comparing the Wiener-Hopf results to the high precision numerical solution of the original integral equation.</description>

      <title>Generalized Toric Polygons, T-branes, and 5d SCFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 5d Superconformal Field Theories (SCFTs) are intrinsically strongly-coupled UV fixed points, whose realization hinges on string theoretic methods: they can be constructed by compactifying M-theory on local Calabi-Yau threefold singularities or alternatively from the world-volume of 5-brane-webs in type IIB string theory. There is a correspondence between 5-brane-webs and toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, however this breaks down when multiple 5-branes are allowed to end on a single 7-brane. In this paper, we extend this connection and provide a geometric realization of brane configurations including 7-branes. A web with 7-branes defines a so-called generalized toric polygon (GTP), which corresponds to combinatorial data that is obtained by removing vertices along external edges of a toric polygon. We identify the geometries associated to GTPs as non-toric deformations of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and provide a precise, algebraic description of the geometry, when 7-branes are introduced along a single edge. The key ingredients in our analysis are T-branes in a type IIA frame, which includes D6-branes. We show that performing Hanany-Witten moves for the 7-branes on the type IIB side corresponds to switching on semisimple vacuum expectation values on the worldvolume of D6-branes, which in turn uplifts to complex structure deformations of the Calabi-Yau geometries. We test the proposal by computing the crepant resolutions of the deformed geometries, thereby checking consistency with the expected properties of the SCFTs.</description>

      <title>Scalar Conformal Field Theories from Lattice Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss scalar conformal field theories (CFTs) that can be realized in structural phase transitions. The Landau condition and Lifshitz condition are reviewed, which are necessary conditions for a structural phase transition to be second order. We also review the perturbative analysis in $4-\epsilon$ expansion of the corresponding Landau actions, which were already analyzed thoroughly in the 80s. By identifying the global symmetries of these fixed points, it turns out that in perturbation theory only 6 different CFTs can be realized by commensurate structural phase transitions. ${\rm \textbf{Updated in version 2:}}$ We discuss how to classify all the phases of a Landau theory using the computer algebra system GAP. We also discuss the fully packed quantum loop model on the triangular lattice, where the Cubic CFT is realized.
  This is a lecture note based on a series of talks given by the author. The goal of the lecture note is to bridge the gap between condensed matter physicists and conformal field theorists. The note will be further updated in the future.</description>

      <title>Free field realisation of boundary vertex algebras for Abelian gauge theories in three dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the boundary vertex algebras of $A$-twisted $\mathcal{N}=4$ Abelian gauge theories in three dimensions. These are identified with the BRST quotient (semi-infinite cohomology) of collections of symplectic bosons and free fermions that reflect the matter content of the corresponding gauge theory. We develop various free field realisations for these vertex algebras which we propose to interpret in terms of their localisation on their associated varieties. We derive the free field realisations by bosonising the elementary symplectic bosons and free fermions and then calculating the relevant semi-infinite cohomology, which can be done systematically. An interesting feature of our construction is that for certain preferred free field realisations, the outer automorphism symmetry of the vertex algebras in question (which are identified with the symmetries of the Coulomb branch in the infrared) are made manifest.</description>

      <title>Berry Connections for 2d $(2,2)$ Theories, Monopole Spectral Data &amp; (Generalised) Cohomology Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Berry connections for supersymmetric ground states of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ GLSMs quantised on a circle, which are generalised periodic monopoles. Periodic monopole solutions may be encoded into difference modules, as shown by Mochizuki, or into an alternative algebraic construction given in terms of vector bundles endowed with filtrations. By studying the ground states in terms of a one-parameter family of supercharges, we relate these two different kinds of spectral data to the physics of the GLSMs. From the difference modules we derive novel difference equations for brane amplitudes, which in the conformal limit yield novel difference equations for hemisphere or vortex partition functions. When the GLSM flows to a nonlinear sigma model with K\"ahler target $X$, we show that the two kinds of spectral data are related to different (generalised) cohomology theories: the difference modules are related to the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$, whereas the vector bundles with filtrations are related to its equivariant K-theory.</description>

Abstract: We explore mathematical relationship between holographic Wilsonian renormalization group(HWRG) and stochastic quantization(SQ) motivated by the similarity of the monotonicity in RG flow with Langevin dynamics of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. We look at scalar field theory in AdS space with its generic mass, self-interaction, and boundary deformation in the momentum space. Identifying the stochastic time $t$ with radial coordinate $r$ in AdS, we establish maps between the fictitious time evolution of stochastic multi point correlation function and the radial evolution of multi-trace deformation, which respectively, express the relaxation process of Langevin dynamics and holographic RG flow. We especially consider marginal multi-trace deformation on the AdS boundary which is successfully captured by a Langevin dynamics of SQ.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05524v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spinning particle/defect geometries in the context of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. These solutions lie below the BTZ threshold, and can be obtained from identifications of AdS$_3$. We construct the Feynman propagator by solving the bulk equation of motion in the spinning particle geometry, summing over the modes of the fields and passing to the boundary. The quantization of the scalar fields becomes challenging when confined to the regions that are causally well-behaved. If the region containing closed timelike curves (CTCs) is included, the normalization of the scalar fields enjoys an analytical simplification and the propagator can be expressed as an infinite sum over image geodesics. In the dual CFT$_2$, the propagator can be recast as the HHLL four-point function, where by taking into account the $PSL (2,\mathbb{Z})$ modular images, we recover the bulk computation. We comment on the casual behavior of bulk geometries associated with single-trace operators of spin scaling with the central charge below the BTZ threshold.</description>

Abstract: The present paper is the first installment where, extending our previous work in pure Yang-Mills (YM) theory, we compute the generating functional of correlators of collinear twist-$2$ operators that enter the components of balanced superfields -- i.e., superfields with an equal number of dotted and undotted indices in their spinor representation -- in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SUSY SU($N$) YM theory in Minkowskian and Euclidean space-time, in the conformal limit and renormalization-group (RG) improved form, and to the leading and next-to-leading order in the large-$N$ expansion. Moreover, we compare our asymptotic RG-improved generating functional to the next-to-leading large-$N$ order with the corresponding nonperturbative object arising from the glueball/gluinoball one-loop effective action, which it should be asymptotic to at short distances because of the asymptotic freedom. Remarkably, we find that both have the structure of the logarithm of a functional superdeterminant. Hence, our large-$N$ computation sets strong ultraviolet asymptotic constraints on the nonperturbative solution of large-$N$ $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SUSY YM theory that may be a pivotal guide for the search of such a solution.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the shear viscoelasticity and the hydrodynamic modes in a holographic solid model with several sets of axions that all break the translations spontaneously on boundary. Comparing with the single-axion model, the shear modulus is enhanced at high temperatures and the shear viscosity is always suppressed in the presence of additional axions. However, the different sets of axions exhibit competitive relationship in determining the shear modulus at low temperatures. Furthermore, by calculating the black hole quasi-normal modes, it is found that adding more axions only increases the amount of diffusive modes. The number of the sound modes always remains unchanged.</description>

Abstract: We study supersymmetric Berry connections of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) quantized on a circle, which are periodic monopoles, with the aim to provide a fruitful physical arena for recent mathematical constructions related to the latter. These are difference modules encoding monopole solutions via a Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence established by Mochizuki. We demonstrate how the difference modules arise naturally by studying the ground states as the cohomology of a one-parameter family of supercharges. In particular, we show how they are related to one kind of monopole spectral data, a quantization of the Cherkis-Kapustin spectral curve, and relate them to the physics of the GLSM. By considering states generated by D-branes and leveraging the difference modules, we derive novel difference equations for brane amplitudes. We then show that in the conformal limit, these degenerate into novel difference equations for hemisphere partition functions, which are exactly calculable. When the GLSM flows to a nonlinear sigma model with K\"ahler target $X$, we show that the difference modules are related to the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$.</description>

Abstract: This study presents comprehensive examples of $\mathfrak{osp}(\mathcal{N}|2)$ Chern$\,-\,$Simons supergravity on $AdS_3$ for $\mathcal{N}&gt;2$. These formulations, which include the most general boundary conditions, represent extensions of previously discovered works $(\textit{Ozer and Filiz$,$Eur Phys J C 82(5):472, 2022})$ for $\mathcal{N}&lt;3$. In our work, we show that under the loosest set of boundary conditions, the asymptotic symmetry algebras consist of two copies of the $\mathfrak{osp}(3|2)_k$ and $\mathfrak{osp}(4|2)_k$ algebras. We subsequently restrict the gauge fields upon the boundary conditions to achieve supersymmetric extensions of the Brown$\,-\,$Henneaux boundary conditions. Based on these results, we finally find that the asymptotic symmetry algebras are two copies of the $\mathcal{N}=3$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal algebras for $\mathcal{N}=(3,3)$ and $\mathcal{N}=(4,4)$ extended higher$\,-\,$spin supergravity theory in $AdS_3$.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the path-integral quantisation of perturbative string theory and show equivalence between the Polyakov-type, Schild-type and Nambu-Goto-type formulations of critical type II superstring theory in the Minkowski and Euclidean signatures. Remarkably, we also find that the Minkowskian path integral realises causality in the sense that a string does not propagate between points at space-like separation, by giving careful consideration to the measure of the world-sheet metric. We also discuss matrix regularisation of the path integral for type IIB perturbative superstring theory. The obtained matrix models are the Euclidean IKKT matrix model and a modified Minkowskian IKKT model, depending on how the matrix regularisation is applied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10698v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note provides a comprehensive examination of the various approaches to formulating relativistic hydrodynamics, with a particular emphasis on the canonical approach. Relativistic hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of fluids in high-energy astrophysical phenomena and heavy-ion collisions. The canonical approach is explored in detail, highlighting its foundational principles, mathematical formulations, and practical implications in modeling relativistic fluid dynamics. Following this, we delve into the linear response theory, elucidating its relevance in the context of hydrodynamics. We analyze the response of relativistic fluids to external perturbations, discussing the theoretical framework and key results. This dual focus aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical applications, offering a robust perspective on the dynamic interplay between relativistic hydrodynamics and linear response theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the fermionic Schwinger effect in the presence of a constant magnetic field within $(1+3)-$dimensional Minkowski spacetime, considering both constant and pulsed electric fields. We analyze the correlations between Schwinger pairs for the vacuum and maximally entangled states of two fermionic fields. The correlations are quantified using entanglement entropy and Bell's inequality violation for the vacuum state, while Bell's inequality violation and mutual information are used for the maximally entangled state. One can observe the variation of the entanglement produced for fermionic modes with respect to different parameters. Additionally, we discuss the key differences from the behaviour of scalar fields in this context. This study offers deeper insights into quantum field theory and the dynamics of entanglement in the fermionic Schwinger effect.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of an interior planar AdS (anti-de Sitter) black hole, requiring unitarity in the natural time coordinate conjugate to the cosmological "constant of motion" appearing in unimodular gravity. Both the classical singularity and the horizon are replaced by a non-singular highly quantum region; semiclassical notions of spacetime evolution are only valid in an intermediate region. For the singularity, our results should be applicable to general black holes: unitarity in unimodular time always implies singularity resolution.</description>

      <title>Classical eikonal from Magnus expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a classical scattering problem, the classical eikonal is defined as the generator of the canonical transformation that maps in-states to out-states. It can be regarded as the classical limit of the log of the quantum S-matrix. In a classical analog of the Born approximation in quantum mechanics, the classical eikonal admits an expansion in oriented tree graphs, where oriented edges denote retarded/advanced worldline propagators. The Magnus expansion, which takes the log of a time-ordered exponential integral, offers an efficient method to compute the coefficients of the tree graphs to all orders. We exploit a Hopf algebra structure behind the Magnus expansion to develop a fast algorithm which can compute the tree coefficients up to the 12th order (over half a million trees) in less than an hour. In a relativistic setting, our methods can be applied to the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion for gravitational binaries in the worldline formalism. We demonstrate the methods by computing the 3PM eikonal and find agreement with previous results based on amplitude methods. Importantly, the Magnus expansion yields a finite eikonal, while the na\"ive eikonal based on the time-symmetric propagator is infrared-divergent from 3PM on.</description>

      <title>All Class $\mathcal{S}$ Theories of Type-$A$ Originate from Orbi-instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A surprising relation between 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ class $\mathcal{S}$ superconformal field theories of Type-$A$ and 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ orbi-instanton theories is investigated. We find that all of the theories in the former class can be obtained by a series of deformations of the 4d theories arising from compactifying the latter on a torus. This is demonstrated by examining Fayet--Iliopoulos (FI) deformations of the $E_8$-shaped magnetic quivers of the orbi-instanton theories whose body fits into the affine $E_8$ Dynkin diagram with a tail attached. Turning on FI parameters at the appropriate gauge groups leads, in stages, to $E_7$-shaped, $E_6$-shaped, and general star-shaped quivers, where the latter are magnetic quivers for the class $\mathcal{S}$ theory of Type-$A$ on a sphere with punctures. Deforming a suitable star-shaped quiver, one obtains a magnetic quiver of the Type-$A$ class $\mathcal{S}$ theory with general genus and an arbitrary number of punctures. Given such a theory, we also propose the inverse algorithm, thereby determining a parent orbi-instanton theory. This is achieved by uplifting the corresponding magnetic quiver step by step to the star-shaped, $E_6$-shaped, $E_7$-shaped, and $E_8$-shaped quivers, where at each step all of the underbalanced nodes, possessing non-zero FI parameters, are dualized. The latter $E_8$-shaped quiver then characterizes the 6d orbi-instanton theory from which the class $\mathcal{S}$ theory in question originates.</description>

Abstract: Massive higher-spin states/fields appear in the effective description of various systems from hadrons and nuclei to black holes, whenever the point-particle approximation is justified, as well as in the bottom-up approaches to the quantum gravity problem. In four dimensions the actions for massive higher-spin fields utilize either the Singh-Hagen/Zinoviev set of auxiliary fields or a single chiral field, which is an $sl(2,\mathbb{C})$ spin-tensor of type $(2s,0)$, generalizing the Chalmers-Siegel approach. We show that these two actions are on the opposite ends of a discrete family of actions where the physical field is a spin-tensor of type $(s+k,s-k)$. The $(2s-1,1)$- and $(2s-2,2)$-cases generalize the Proca and the Fierz-Pauli actions, respectively, to all spins. A similar family of second-order actions exists for fermionic higher-spin fields.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of Lorentz-Violating Yang-Mills theories: Gauge invariance and non-perturbative effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous investigations on the renormalizability properties of Lorentz-violating Yang-Mills (LVYM) theories in the Landau gauge have pointed out the necessity of the inclusion of a mass-like term for the gauge fields. If one aims at generalizing the theory to a more complicated gauge, such a mass-like term can bring severe issues regarding gauge-dependence of correlation functions of observables. We propose a Lorentz-violating Yang-Mills theory supplemented by a gauge-invariant mass term which generalizes the model in the Landau gauge. We discuss the foundational aspects of the model and highlight how it simplifies in the Landau gauge. Following the recent literature in pure Yang-Mills theories, we remark how the proposed massive extension of LVYM theories can be used as an effective model to access infrared properties within perturbation theory. Finally, we present a BRST-invariant formulation of the so-called Refined Gribov-Zwanziger action in the presence of Lorentz-violating terms in linear covariant gauges and the underlying tree-level gauge-field propagator which is enriched by the non-perturbative information carried by the elimination of Gribov copies.</description>

      <title>Sine-dilaton gravity vs double-scaled SYK: exploring one-loop quantum corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide non-trivial checks of the recently proposed duality between double-scaled SYK and a 2d dilaton gravity model with sine potential, studying the path integral at one-loop level. Specifically, we compute the logarithmic correction to the free energy of sine-dilaton gravity and, up to potential ordering ambiguities, we find a match with the corresponding quantity in double-scaled SYK. The computation relies on the description of sine-dilaton gravity in terms of a version of the q-Schwarzian theory, the quantum deformation of the standard Schwarzian model dual to JT gravity. A crucial aspect of the calculation is selecting the correct Hartle-Hawking vacuum for the gravitational theory, which implies a specific choice of boundary conditions for the one-loop determinant, computed using a generalization of the Gel'fand-Yaglom's theorem. We also evaluate the gravitational one-loop correction to the boundary to boundary propagator of a non-minimally coupled matter field in the bulk theory, showing a perfect agreement with the corresponding quantum correction of matter correlators in double-scaled SYK.</description>

Abstract: Generating functions $h_r(\tau)$ of D4-D2-D0 BPS indices, appearing in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIA string theory and identical to rank 0 Donaldson-Thomas invariants, are known to be higher depth mock modular forms satisfying a specific modular anomaly equation, with depth determined by the D4-brane charge $r$. We develop a method to solve the anomaly equation for arbitrary charges, in terms of indefinite theta series. This allows us to find the generating functions up to modular forms that can be fixed by computing just a finite number of Fourier coefficients of $h_r$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the properties of a set of free double-tensor multiplets in $N=2$ supersymmetry, focusing on their behavior within rigid superspace. These multiplets can be obtained from hypermultiplets by Hodge-dualizing half of their scalars, and feature an off-shell matching of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. Despite this fact, the supersymmetry algebra results to close only on-shell. Our analysis is conducted both in superspace, using the geometric (rheonomic) approach, and in spacetime, comparing how our results are obtained in the two approaches. Notably, the cohomology of superspace requires that the scalars Hodge-dual to the antisymmetric tensors crucially contribute to the superspace description of the tensors super-field strengths. This shows an inherent non-locality of the theory, already in the free case, which however does not forbid a Lagrangian description.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of information scrambling and decoherence in the integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth of information scrambling, captured by out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), is a central indicator of the nature of many-body quantum dynamics. Here, we compute analytically the complete time dependence of the OTOC for an integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, $N$ Majoranas with random two-body interactions of infinite range, coupled to a Markovian bath at finite temperature. In the limit of no coupling to the bath, the time evolution of scrambling experiences different stages. For $t \lesssim \sqrt{N}$, after an initial polynomial growth, the OTOC approaches saturation in a power-law fashion with oscillations superimposed. At $t \sim \sqrt{N}$, the OTOC reverses trend and starts to decrease linearly in time. The reason for this linear decrease is that, despite being a subleading $1/N$ effect, the OTOC in this region is governed by the spectral form factor of the antisymmetric couplings of the SYK model. The linear decrease stops at $t \sim 2N$, the Heisenberg time, where saturation occurs. The effect of the environment is an overall exponential decay of the OTOC for times longer than the inverse of the coupling strength to the bath. The oscillations at $t \lesssim \sqrt{N}$ indicate lack of thermalization -- a desired feature for a better performance of quantum information devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the causal structure of Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS), including shock wave perturbations, in $D&gt;3$ using reflected null ray trajectories, either through the interior black hole or the exterior de Sitter region. Specifically, we compute the quasinormal mode frequencies in the eikonal, high-frequency, limit, by identifying the `critical time', for arbitrary values of the black hole mass. We emphasize the important role of the static sphere proper time normalization and related boundary conditions. The computed critical times indicate the presence of singularities in the late-time, large mass, scalar field correlator in SdS, which should be resolved by introducing complex geodesics consistent with interior black hole and exterior de Sitter effective thermofield double states. In addition we relate the critical time to a diverging holographic complexity observable and compute the `switchback' delay by adding a pair of shock wave perturbations for arbitrary values of the mass of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Background subtraction method is not only much simpler, but also as applicable as covariant counterterm method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the criterion for the applicability of the background subtraction method, not only the finiteness condition of the resulting Hamiltonian but also the condition for the validity of the first law of black hole thermodynamics can be reduced to the form amenable to much simpler analysis at infinity by using the covariant phase space formalism. With this, we further establish that the background subtraction method is as applicable as the covariant counterterm method not only to Einstein's gravity, but also to its higher derivative corrections for black hole thermodynamics in both asymptotically flat and AdS spacetimes. In addition, our framework also provides us with the first derivation of the universal expression of the Gibbs free energy in terms of the Euclidean on-shell action beyond Einstein's gravity. Among others, our findings have a far reaching impact on the relevant calculations in the Euclidean approach to black hole thermodynamics, where the well justified and much simpler background subtraction method is supposed to be the favored choice compared to the covariant counterterm method.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of Mixed State in Thermal CFT$_2$</title>

Abstract: Using the subtraction approach, we give the bipartite mixed state entanglement entropy in thermal $\text{CFT}_2$. With these entanglement entropies, we examine a proposed phase transition of entanglement wedge cross section derived from the perspective of bulk investigation in the literature. We clarify the proposed phase transition is an illusion caused by confusion between different configurations. In the thermofield double state, we show a horizon-crossing feature in two-sided entanglement configuration.</description>

      <title>Universal Gravitational Wave Signatures of Cosmological Solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological solitonic objects such as monopoles, cosmic strings, domain walls, oscillons and Q-balls often appear in theories of the early Universe. We demonstrate that such scenarios are generically accompanied by a novel production source of gravitational waves stemming from soliton isocurvature perturbations. The resulting induced universal gravitational waves (UGWs) reside at lower frequencies compared to gravitational waves typically associated with soliton formation. We show that UGWs from axion-like particle (ALP) oscillons, originating from ALP misalignment, extend the frequency range of produced gravitational waves by more than two orders of magnitude regardless of the ALP mass and decay constant and can be observable in upcoming gravitational wave experiments. UGWs open a new route for gravitational wave signatures in broad classes of cosmological theories.</description>

      <title>The Timescales of Quantum Breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the inevitable existence of quantum effects, a classical description generically breaks down after a finite quantum break-time $t_q$. We aim to find criteria for determining $t_q$. To this end, we construct a new prototype model that features numerous dynamically accessible quantum modes. Using explicit numerical time evolution, we establish how $t_q$ depends on the parameters of the system such as its particle number $N$. The presence of a classical instability leads to $t_q \sim \ln N$ or $t_q\sim \sqrt{N}$. In the stable case, we observe $t_q\sim N$, although full quantum breaking may not take place at all. We find that the different regimes merge smoothly with $t_q\sim N^\gamma$ ($0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$). As an outlook, we point out possibilities for transferring our results to black holes and expanding spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Axion-like Universal Gravitational Wave Interpretation of Pulsar Timing Array Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formation of cosmological solitons is generically accompanied by production of gravitational waves (GWs), with a universal GW background expected at frequency scales below that of non-linear dynamics. Beginning with a general phenomenological description of GWs associated with soliton formation, we demonstrate that universal GW background from axion-like particle (ALP) solitonic oscillons provides a viable interpretation to the recent NANOGrav 15 year pulsar timing array data, which does not suffer from the overproduction of primordial black holes. We show that pulsar timing array data displays preference for models where formed solitons do not strongly interact or cluster. Coincidence observations with Nancy Roman telescope will allow to discriminate between distinct scenarios of cosmological solitons.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic aspects of FLRW Universe in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an FLRW model, thermodynamic phase transitions are investigated in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity framework. Using the work density, the equation of state is derived, and the criticality conditions are employed to determine the critical points where possible phase transitions occur. The appearance of phase transitions strongly depends on the space-time dimension $n$. In this concern, for $n=5$, there is an ``inverted'' first-order phase transition, where the Gibbs free energy presents a swallow-tail behavior. On the other hand, for $n=6$, the system does not exhibit first order phase transition. In such a case, the Gibbs free energy presents a cusp with stable and unstable branches. For the present study, the mentioned phenomena are present for an expanding cosmology, where the matter distribution filling the Universe corresponds to a speculative matter distribution with an equation of state parameter greater than one. Interestingly, there are no phase transitions for dimensions greater than $n=6$, nor for expanding or contracting cosmological scenarios. To gain more insights into the system, the microstructure is analyzed using thermodynamic geometry to quantify the normalized scalar curvature. This invariant shows that an attractive interaction dominates the phase-transition region. Additionally, the topological thermodynamic analysis was performed employing Duan's off-shell map. This study reveals that for $n=5$ we observe a winding number interchange twice, indicating an unstable small/large branch phase transition through an intermediate stable phase. For $n=6$ the number of exotic defects is one. Consequently, we observe a stable small branch and an unstable large branch.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbol letters are crucial for analytically calculating Feynman integrals in terms of iterated integrals. We present a novel method to construct the symbol letters for a given integral family without prior knowledge of the canonical differential equations. We provide a program package implementing our algorithm, and demonstrate its effectiveness in solving non-trivial problems with multiple loops and legs. Using our method, we successfully bootstrap the canonical differential equations for a two-loop five-point family with two external masses and for a three-loop four-point family with two external masses, which were previously unknown in the literature. We anticipate that our method can be applied to a wide range of cutting-edge calculations in the future.</description>

      <title>Topological Portal to the Dark Sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unique topological portal between quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and a dark sector characterized by a global symmetry breaking, which connects three QCD to two dark pions. When gauged, it serves as the leading portal between the two sectors, providing an elegant, self-consistent scenario of light thermal inelastic dark matter. The inherent antisymmetrization leads to diminished annihilations at later times and suppressed direct detection. However, novel collider signatures offer tremendous prospects for discovery at Belle II.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nonlinear dynamics of a rolling axion during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spectator axion-gauge sector, minimally coupled to the inflaton, with the axion experiencing a momentary stage of fast roll during cosmological inflation, can generate unique signatures in primordial density fluctuations and the gravitational wave background. We present the first lattice simulation of this system using a novel hybrid numerical scheme. This approach solves the fully nonlinear dynamics of the axion-gauge sector while treating the gravitational interaction between the axion and inflaton linearly. Initially, we test the validity of the WKB approximation in the linear regime. We then investigate strong backreaction dynamics within the axion-gauge sector. Our findings reveal that backreaction significantly suppresses the growth of the gauge field and the amplitude of scalar perturbations. The simulation also allows us to analyze the non-Gaussianity of scalar fluctuations, including higher-order statistics. We show that, although non-Gaussianity is suppressed by strong backreaction, it remains higher than in the minimal model where the axion coincides with the inflaton. Our results highlight the need for simulations to make robust predictions to test against data from gravitational wave interferometers and large-scale structure surveys.</description>

Abstract: We consider $N$ two-dimensional Ising models coupled in presence of quenched disorder and use scale invariant scattering theory to exactly show the presence of a line of renormalization group fixed points for any fixed value of $N$ other than 1. We show how this result relates to perturbative studies and sheds light on numerical simulations. We also observe that the limit $N\to 1$ may be of interest for the Ising spin glass, and point out potential relevance for nonuniversality in other contexts of random criticality.</description>

      <title>A Novel Finite Fractional Fourier Transform and its Quantum Circuit Implementation on Qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new number theoretic definition of discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFrFT) . In this approach the DFrFT is defined as the $N \times N$ dimensional unitary representation of the generator of the arithmetic rotational group $SO_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_N]$, which is the finite set of $\bmod N$ integer, $2\times 2$ matrices acting on the points of the discrete toroidal phase space lattice $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$, preserving the euclidean distance $\bmod N$. We construct explicitly, using techniques of the Finite Quantum Mechanics (FQM), the $p^n$ dimensional unitary matrix representation of the group $SO_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}]$ and especially we work out in detail the one which corresponds to the generator. This is our definition of the arithmetic fractional Fourier transform (AFrFT). Following this definition, we proceed to the construction of efficient quantum circuits for the AFrFT, on sets of $n$ $p$-dimensional qudits with $p$ a prime integer, by introducing novel quantum subcircuits for diagonal operators with quadratic phases as well as new quantum subcircuits for multipliers by a constant. The quantum subcircuits that we introduce provide a set capable to construct quantum circuits for any element of a more general group, the group of Linear Canonical Transformations (LCT), $SL_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_N]$ of the toroidal phase space lattice. As a byproduct, extensions of the diagonal and multiplier quantum circuits for both the qudit and qubit case are given, which are useful alone in various applications. Also, we analyze the depth, width and gate complexity of the efficient AFrFT quantum circuit and we estimate its gate complexity which is of the order $O(n^2)$, its depth which is of the order $O(n)$ with depth $n$, while at the same time it has a structure permitting local interactions between the qudits.</description>

      <title>Field redefinition and its impact in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the impact of field redefinition on the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic hydrodynamics. We observe that the spectrum of hydrodynamics modes is never affected by the local field redefinition, however, the spectrum of the non-hydrodynamic modes is affected. Through an appropriate all-order redefinition, non-hydrodynamic modes can be eliminated, leading to a new frame where the spectrum contains only hydrodynamic modes. We also observe that the resulting stress-energy tensor may have an infinite series in momentum space, with a convergence radius linked to the eliminated non-hydrodynamic mode. In certain special cases, higher-order terms in the stress-energy tensor under field redefinition may cancel, indicating that non-hydrodynamic modes are mere artefacts of the fluid variable choice and hold no physical significance, even if they appear to violate physical constraints. Using a special toy example, we find a criterion to distinguish between physical and unphysical non-hydrodynamic modes.</description>

Abstract: We study the infrared structure of the Standard Model (SM) restricted to the first generation of fermions, including the full SM gauge group, up to three-loop order, and determine the resulting cusp and collinear anomalous dimensions for all gauge groups and particles of the theory. We observe that starting from three loops, the resulting cusp anomalous dimensions include terms involving two distinct couplings, contrary to previous claims in the literature. We give a detailed explanation of this observation and explore the origin of these terms. We provide a supplementary file where all infrared anomalous dimensions calculated in this work are collected. Our results are consistent with the existing literature wherever comparisons are possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a purely gravitational origin of observed baryon asymmetry and dark matter (DM) abundance from asymmetric Hawking radiation of light primordial black holes (PBH) in presence of a non-zero chemical potential, originating from the space-time curvature. Considering the PBHs are described by a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m metric, and are produced in a radiation dominated Universe, we show, it is possible to simultaneously explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry along with right DM abundance satisfying bounds from big bang nucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave background and gravitational wave energy density due to PBH density fluctuation. We also obtain the parameter space beyond the semiclassical approximation, taking into account the quantum effects on charged PBH dynamics due to memory burden.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of domain walls formed through the spontaneous breaking of an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a scalar field, focusing on their collapse under the influence of quantum and thermal corrections induced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating Yukawa coupling to Dirac fermions in the thermal bath. The thermal effects render the potential bias between the true and false vacua temperature-dependent and may lead to notable variations in the annihilation temperature of domain walls, in addition to the shift caused by temperature-independent quantum corrections. These modifications could substantially alter the gravitational wave spectrum produced by collapsing domain walls, potentially providing observable signatures for future gravitational wave detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Formed during Magneto-Hydrodynamic Turbulence in Early Universe as Dominant Part of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) offer a compelling candidate for dark matter. Within the framework of the Standard Model, the production of PBHs through well-tested physical processes is highly worthy of investigations. This work highlights the role of turbulences in the very early universe in sustaining intense and persistent fluctuations of energy or mass density, which could provide a natural mechanism for PBH formations in the primordial universe. We analyze the mass range and abundance of PBHs produced in the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence induced by the first-order electroweak phase transition. Remarkably, without invoking any new physics beyond the Standard Model, we find that the mass range of the produced PBHs falls within the only allowed "asteroid mass" window, and within natural parameter regions their abundance can be sufficiently large. These findings strongly suggest that PBHs produced in the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the early universe could comprise the dominant part of dark matter.</description>
