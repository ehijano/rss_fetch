      <title>A novel non-specular mechanism for chaotic ray scattering of internal waves in 3D anisotropic stadiums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluids, subject to symmetry breaking by stratification support propagation of anisotropic internal waves - IWs. In the vertical plane, rays representing energy paths obey a non-specular reflection law, as their inclination is solely dictated by their frequency. Although satisfying the linear Poincare equation, in basins having sloping walls, ray dynamics exhibits nonlinear effects such as convergence onto wave-attractors. In contrast, in the horizontal plane of a basin with vertical walls IWs reflect specularly, and follow chaotic ray paths. Here we present a novel analysis of these competing effects in a 3D IW ray billiard of a stadium having sloping walls. We show and explain how varying the walls slope, shifts the ray dynamics between regimes of near-ergodicity, chaotic scattering, and non-chaotic scattering with self-similar patterns, despite the basin being closed. The rich results stemming from the interplay between elliptical ergodicity and hyperbolic focusing relate to a broader context of physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Sustaining the dynamics of Kuramoto model by adaptable reservoir computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scenario frequently encountered in real-world complex systems is the temporary failure of a few components. For systems whose functionality hinges on the collective dynamics of the interacting components, a viable approach to dealing with the failures is replacing the malfunctioning components with their backups, so that the collective dynamics of the systems can be precisely maintained for a duration long enough to resolve the problem. Here, taking the paradigmatic Kuramoto model as an example and considering the scenario of oscillator failures, we propose substituting the failed oscillators with digital twins trained by the data measured from the system evolution. Specifically, leveraging the technique of adaptable reservoir computer (RC) in machine learning, we demonstrate that a single, small-size RC is able to substitute any oscillator in the Kuramoto model such that the time evolution of the synchronization order parameter of the repaired system is identical to that of the original system for a certain time period. The performance of adaptable RC is evaluated in various contexts, and it is found that the sustaining period is influenced by multiple factors, including the size of the training dataset, the overall coupling strength of the system, and the number of substituted oscillators. Additionally, though the synchronization order parameter diverges from the ground truth in the long-term running, the functional networks of the oscillators are still faithfully sustained by the machine substitutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reliable understanding of the Earth system is essential for the life quality of modern society. Natural hazards are the cause of most life and resource losses. The ability to define the conditions for a sustainable development of humankind, to keep the Earth system within the boundaries of habitable states, or to predict critical transitions and events in the dynamics of the Earth system are crucial to mitigate and adapt to Earth system related events and changes (e.g., volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, climate change) and to avert the disastrous consequences of natural hazards. In this chapter, we discuss key concepts from nonlinear physics and show that they enable us to treat challenging problems of Earth sciences which cannot be solved by classic methods. In particular, the concepts of multi-scaling, recurrence, synchronization, and complex networks have become crucial in the very last decades for a substantially more profound understanding of the dynamics of earthquakes, landslides, or (palaeo-)climate. They can even provide a significantly improved prediction of several high-impact extreme events. Additionally, crucial open challenges in the realm of methodological nature and applications to Earth sciences are given.</description>

      <title>A posteriori closure of turbulence models: are symmetries preserved ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence modeling remains a longstanding challenge in fluid dynamics. Recent advances in data-driven methods have led to a surge of novel approaches aimed at addressing this problem. This work builds upon our previous study (arXiv:2411.13194), where we introduced a new closure for a shell model of turbulence using an a posteriori (or solver-in-the-loop) approach. Unlike most deep learning-based models, our method explicitly incorporates physical equations into the neural network framework, ensuring that the closure remains constrained by the underlying physics benefiting from enhanced stability and generalizability. In this paper, we further analyze the learned closure, probing its capabilities and limitations. In particular, we look at joint probability density functions to assess whether cross-correlations are well preserved or if just the mean behavior is captured. Additionally, we investigate the scale invariance of multipliers - ratios between adjacent shells - within the inertial range. Although our model excels in reproducing high-order observables such as flatness, it breaks this known symmetry near the cutoff, indicating a fundamental limitation. We discuss the implications of these findings for subgrid-scale modeling in 3D turbulence and outline directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Vortex transition and thermal mixing by pitching a perforated flexible panel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective transport of heat and mass is crucial to both industrial applications and physiological processes. Recent research has evaluated the benefit of using flexible reeds for triggering the vortex induced vibration to enhance mixing, as opposed to traditional techniques like rigid blender or static meshes. Inspired by the soft, porous, and moving fish gill lamellae, we proposed a new concept of thermal dispenser that prescribes active pitching motion to the leading edge of an otherwise passively flapping perforated panel. Experimental measurements revealed drastic differences between the steady leaky flow wake behind a statically deflected perforated panel and the periodic shedding wakes with complex vortex structure transitions behind an actuated perforated panel with or without chord-wise flexibility. A semi-empirical simulation of the thermal convection and diffusion takes the experimentally obtained velocity as input and yields the temperature results. Vortex dynamics, Lagrangian coherent structures, and thermal mixing behaviors were analyzed and compared to elucidate the effects of kinematics, perforation, and flexibility on the wake mode transitions, lateral entrainment mixing, and overall heating. Our work provides a foundational understanding of the fluid-structure interactions of perforated bendable panels under active control which has not been described before in the intermediate Reynolds number range. It provides insights for developing an innovative bio-inspired heat or mass dispenser potentially suitable for subtle and small scale applications.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Dynamics and Universality of 4D Quantum Vortices and Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of quantum vortices provides critical insights into non-equilibrium dynamics across diverse physical systems. While previous research has focused on point-like vortices in two dimensions(2D) and line-like vortices in three dimensions(3D), quantum vortices in four spatial dimensions(4D) are expected to take the form of extended vortex surfaces, thereby fundamentally enriching dynamics. Here, we conduct a comprehensive numerical study of 4D quantum vortices and turbulence. Using a special visualization scheme, we discovered the decay of topological numbers that does not exist in low dimensions, as well as the high-dimensional counterpart of the vortex reconnection process. We further explore quench dynamics across phase transitions in four dimensions and verify the applicability of the higher-dimensional Kibble-Zurek mechanism, including both slow and fast quenches. Our simulations provide numerical evidence of quantum turbulence in four dimensions, characterized by universal power-law behavior: vortex decay scaling as $t^{-1}$, an energy spectrum consistent with the classical Kolmogorov law $k^{-5/3}$, and a velocity distribution exhibiting a distinct $v^{-3}$ tail. These findings reveal universal principles governing topological defects in higher dimensions, broadening our understanding of quantum physics in high-dimensional spaces and offering insights for future experimental realizations using synthetic dimensions.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization in Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) paradox, namely the lack of equipartition in the evolution of a normal mode in a nonlinear chain on unexpectedly long times, is arguably the most famous numerical experiment in the history of physics. Since seventy years after its publication, most studies in FPUT chains still focus on long wavelength initial states similar to the original paper. It is shown here that all characteristic features of the FPUT paradox are rendered even more striking if short(er) wavelength modes are evolved instead. Since not every normal mode leads to equipartition, we also provide a simple technique to predict which modes, and in what order, are excited starting from an initial mode (root) in $\alpha$-FPUT chains. The excitation sequences associated with a root are then shown to spread energy at different speeds, leading to prethermalization regimes that become longer as a function of mode excitation number. This effect is visible in observables such as mode energies and spectral entropies and, surprisingly, also in the time evolution of invariant quantities such as Lyapunov times and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies. Our findings generalize the original FPUT experiment, provide an original look at the paradox's source, and enrich the vast literature dedicated to studying equipartition in classical many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Abundance of weird quasiperiodic attractors in piecewise linear discontinuous maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a class of $n$-dimensional, $n\geq2$, piecewise linear discontinuous maps that can exhibit a new type of attractor, called a weird quasiperiodic attractor. While the dynamics associated with these attractors may appear chaotic, we prove that chaos cannot occur. The considered class of $n$-dimensional maps allows for any finite number of partitions, separated by various types of discontinuity sets. The key characteristic, beyond discontinuity, is that all functions defining the map have the same real fixed point. These maps cannot have hyperbolic cycles other than the fixed point itself. We consider the two-dimensional case in detail. We prove that in nongeneric cases, the restriction, or the first return, of the map to a segment of straight line is reducible to a piecewise linear circle map. The generic attractor, different from the fixed point, is a weird quasiperiodic attractor, which may coexist with other attractors or attracting sets. We illustrate the existence of these attractors through numerous examples, using functions with different types of Jacobian matrices, as well as with different types of discontinuity sets. In some cases, we describe possible mechanisms leading to the appearance of these attractors. We also give examples in the three-dimensional space. Several properties of this new type of attractor remain open for further investigation.</description>

      <title>A mechanism for growth of topological entropy and global changes of the shape of chaotic attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theoretical and numerical understanding of the key concept of topological entropy is an important problem in dynamical systems. Most studies have been carried out on maps (discrete-time systems). We analyse a scenario of global changes of the structure of an attractor in continuous-time systems leading to an unbounded growth of the topological entropy of the underlying dynamical system. As an example, we consider the classical Roessler system. We show that for an explicit range of parameters a chaotic attractor exists. We also prove the existence of a sequence of bifurcations leading to the growth of the topological entropy. The proofs are computer-aided.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in swarm optimization algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural systems often exhibit chaotic behavior in their space-time evolution. Systems transiting between chaos and order manifest a potential to compute, as shown with cellular automata and artificial neural networks. We demonstrate that swarms optimisation algorithms also exhibit transitions from chaos, analogous to motion of gas molecules, when particles explore solution space disorderly, to order, when particles follow a leader, similar to molecules propagating along diffusion gradients in liquid solutions of reagents. We analyse these `phase-like' transitions in swarm optimization algorithms using recurrence quantification analysis and Lempel-Ziv complexity estimation. We demonstrate that converging and non-converging iterations of the optimization algorithms are statistically different in a view of applied chaos, complexity and predictability estimating indicators.</description>

      <title>Model Reduction of a Flexible Nonsmooth Oscillator Recovers its Entire Bifurcation Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the reduced order modeling of a nonlinear flexible oscillator in which a Bernoulli-Euler beam is subjected to a position-triggered kick force and a piecewise restoring force at its tip. The resulting nonsmooth boundary conditions can generally be expected to excite many degrees of freedom. The system is modeled as piecewise linear with different boundary conditions determining different regions of a hybrid phase space. With kick strength as parameter, its bifurcation diagram is found to exhibit a range of periodic and chaotic behaviors. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to estimate the system's intrinsic dimensionality. However, conventional POD's purely statistical analysis of spatial covariance does not guarantee accuracy of reduced order models (ROMs). We therefore augment POD by employing a previously-developed energy closure criterion that selects ROM dimension by ensuring approximate energy balance on the reduced subspace. This physics-based criterion yields accurate ROMs with 8 degrees of freedom. Remarkably, we find that ROMs formulated at particular values of the kick strength can nevertheless reconstruct the entire bifurcation structure of the original nonlinear structural system. We thus show that energy closure analysis reliably yields effective dimension estimates and, thereby, ROMs that are robust across stability transitions, including even period doubling cascades to chaos.</description>

      <title>Modal interactions between a linear oscillator and a nonlinear absorber: multiscale energy transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16869v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considerable attention has been given to the use of a nonlinear energy sink (NES) as a nonlinear absorber. The NES is an efficient passive control device, which has been the focus of extensive research. This paper uses the Complexification-Averaging/Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (CX-A/GSPT) to investigate the multiscale energy transfers in a forced two-DOF system coupled to a grounded NES (GNES) with both nonlinear grounded stiffness and damping. Due to the coexistence of fundamental resonance and internal resonance in the system, complex modal interactions occur between the linear oscillator (LO) and the GNES. In addition, the ratio of the mass of the GNES and the LO can be seen as a perturbation. This may lead to the occurrence of multiscale dynamics and energy transfers in the system. By using the CX-A method, the slow flow equations of the system can be obtained. Further application of GSPT can obtain the critical manifold that is equivalent to the so-called slow invariant manifold (SIM). With different values of nonlinear grounded stiffness and damping, the critical manifolds have different structures. These critical manifolds can capture diverse types of system responses. Moreover, Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is used to analyze the time-frequency-energy relationship of system response. With different parameters, the instantaneous frequencies of the responses of the LO and GNES show a completely different change. The Hilbert spectrums confirm the occurrence of complex modal interactions and different time-scale energy transfers in the system.</description>

      <title>Solver-in-the-loop approach to closure of shell models of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies an a posteriori data-driven approach (known as solver-in-the-loop) for sub-grid modeling of a shell model for turbulence. This approach takes advantage of the differentiable physics paradigm of deep learning, allowing a neural network model to interact with the differential equation solver over time during the training process. The closure model is, then, naturally exposed to equations-informed input distributions by accounting for prior corrections over the temporal evolution in training. Such a characteristic makes this approach depart from the conventional a priori instantaneous training paradigm and often leads to a more accurate and stable closure model. Our study demonstrates that the closure learned via this a posteriori approach is able to reproduce high-order statistical moments of interest also in closures of high Reynolds number turbulence. Moreover, we investigate the performance of the learned model by experimenting with the effect of unrolling in time, which has remained for the most part unexplored in the literature. Finally, we discuss potential extensions of this approach to Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Sequential data assimilation for PDEs using shape-morphing solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shape-morphing solutions (also known as evolutional deep neural networks, reduced-order nonlinear solutions, and neural Galerkin schemes) are a new class of methods for approximating the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). Here, we introduce a sequential data assimilation method for incorporating observational data in a shape-morphing solution (SMS). Our method takes the form of a predictor-corrector scheme, where the observations are used to correct the SMS parameters using Newton-like iterations. Between observation points, the SMS equations (a set of ordinary differential equations) are used to evolve the solution forward in time. We prove that, under certain conditions, the data assimilated SMS (DA-SMS) converges uniformly towards the true state of the system. We demonstrate the efficacy of DA-SMS on three examples: the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a two-dimensional advection-diffusion equation. Our numerical results suggest that DA-SMS converges with relatively sparse observations and a single iteration of the Newton-like method.</description>
