      <title>Convergence of space-time occupation measures of stochastic processes and its application to collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new perspective on positive continuous additive functionals (PCAFs) of Markov processes, which we call space--time occupation measures (STOMs). This notion provides a natural generalization of classical occupation times and occupation measures, and offers a unified framework for studying their convergence. We analyze STOMs via so-called smooth measures associated with PCAFs through the Revuz correspondence. We establish that if the underlying spaces, the processes living on them, their heat kernels, and the associated smooth measures converge, and if the corresponding potentials of these measures satisfy a uniform decay condition, then the associated PCAFs and STOMs also converge in suitable Gromov--Hausdorff-type topologies.
  We then apply this framework to the analysis of collisions of independent stochastic processes. Specifically, by exploiting the STOM formulation, we introduce the notion of collision measures, which record both the collision sites and times of two processes, and prove general convergence theorems for these measures. The abstract results are further specialized to random walks on electrical networks via the theory of resistance metric spaces, leading to concrete scaling limits for collision measures of random walks on critical random graphs, such as critical Galton--Watson trees, critical Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graphs, and the uniform spanning tree.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for random walks on dihedral groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the random walk on a finite dihedral group $G$ driven by the uniform measure on $k$ independently and uniformly chosen elements. We show that the walk exhibits cutoff with high probability throughout nearly the entire regime $1 \ll \log k \ll \log |G|$, and determine the precise cutoff time. Interestingly, this mixing time differs from the entropic time that characterizes cutoff behavior for random walks on Abelian groups. When $k \gg \log|G|$ and $\log k \ll \log|G|$, cutoff occurs with high probability on random Cayley graphs of virtually Abelian groups. The analysis develops techniques for obtaining sharper entropic estimates of an auxiliary process on high-dimensional lattices with dependent coordinates, which may also prove useful for related models in broader contexts.</description>

      <title>Mixing time and isoperimetry in random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the mixing time of the simple random walk on the giant component of supercritical $d$-dimensional random geometric graphs generated by the unit intensity Poisson Point Process in a $d$-dimensional cube of volume $n$. With $r_g$ denoting the threshold for having a giant component, we show that for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$ and any $r \ge (1+\epsilon)r_g$, the mixing time of the giant component is with high probability $\Theta(n^{2/d}/r^{2})$, thereby closing a gap in the literature. The main tool is an isoperimetric inequality which holds, w.h.p., for any large enough vertex set, a result which we believe is of independent interest. Our analysis also implies that the relaxation time is of the same order.</description>

      <title>Geometric Interpretation of Brownian Motion on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified geometric framework for Brownian motion on manifolds, encompassing intrinsic Riemannian manifolds, embedded submanifolds, and Lie groups. The approach constructs the stochastic differential equation by injecting noise along each axis of an orthonormal frame and designing the drift term so that the resulting generator coincides with the Laplace--Beltrami operator. Both Stratonovich and It\^{o} formulations are derived explicitly, revealing the geometric origin of curvature-induced drift. The drift is shown to correspond to the covariant derivatives of the frame fields for intrinsic manifolds, the mean curvature vector for embedded manifolds, and the adjoint-trace term for Lie groups, which vanishes for unimodular cases. The proposed formulation provides a geometrically transparent and mathematically consistent foundation for diffusion processes on nonlinear configuration spaces.</description>

      <title>Classification for dynamics of Markov chains on non-negative integers with arbitrary transition rates and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-time Markov chains on non-negative integers can be used for modeling biological systems, population dynamics, and queueing models. Qualitative behaviors of birth-and-death models, typical examples of such one-dimensional continuous-time Markov chains, have been substantially studied. For one-dimensional Markov chains with polynomial transition rates, recent studies provided criteria for their long-term behavior. In this paper, we provide a classification of Markov chains on non-negative integers when the transition rates are arbitrary functions. The criteria are written with asymptotics of the transition rates. This classification implies their dynamical properties, including explosivity, recurrence, positive recurrence, and exponential ergodicity. As an application, we derive a complete classification (if and only if conditions) for those dynamical features when the transition rates have certain expansion forms, which include all rational functions, so that our classifications cover mass-action kinetics, Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and Haldane equations. Our classification solely relies on easily computable quantities: the maximal degree of the expansion of the transition rates, the mean and the variance of the transition rates. We demonstrate the utility of this classification framework using the approximation of high-dimensional mass-action systems by a one-dimensional reaction system with general rational kinetics.</description>

      <title>Counterexample to majority optimality in NICD with erasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We asked GPT-5 Pro to look for counterexamples among a public list of open problems (the Simons ``Real Analysis in Computer Science'' collection). After several numerical experiments, it suggested a counterexample for the Non-Interactive Correlation Distillation (NICD) with erasures question: namely, a Boolean function on 5 bits that achieves a strictly larger value of $\mathbb{E}|f(z)|$ than the 5-bit majority function when the erasure parameter is $p=0.40.$ In this very short note we record the finding, state the problem precisely, give the explicit function, and verify the computation step by step by hand so that it can be checked without a computer. In addition, we show that for each fixed odd $n$ the majority is optimal (among unbiased Boolean functions) in a neighborhood of $p=0$. We view this as a little spark of an AI contribution in Theoretical Computer Science: while modern Large Language Models (LLMs) often assist with literature and numerics, here a concrete finite counterexample emerged.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Stationary Solutions to McKean-Vlasov Equations with Applications to Noisy Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations on the circle. Our main contributions stem from observing an exact equivalence between solutions of the stationary McKean-Vlasov equation and an infinite-dimensional quadratic system of equations over Fourier coefficients, which allows explicit characterization of the stationary states in a sequence space rather than a function space. This framework provides a transparent description of local bifurcations, characterizing their periodicity, and resonance structures, while accommodating singular potentials. We derive analytic expressions that characterize the emergence, form and shape (supercritical, critical, subcritical or transcritical) of bifurcations involving possibly multiple Fourier modes and connect them with discontinuous phase transitions. We also characterize, under suitable assumptions, the detailed structure of the stationary bifurcating solutions that are accurate upto an arbitrary number of Fourier modes. At the global level, we establish regularity and concavity properties of the free energy landscape, proving existence, compactness, and coexistence of globally minimizing stationary measures, further identifying discontinuous phase transitions with points of non-differentiability of the minimum free energy map. As an application, we specialize the theory to the Noisy Mean-Field Transformer model, where we show how changing the inverse temperature parameter $\beta$ affects the geometry of the infinitely many bifurcations from the uniform measure. We also explain how increasing $\beta$ can lead to a rich class of approximate multi-mode stationary solutions which can be seen as `metastable states'. Further, a sharp transition from continuous to discontinuous (first-order) phase behavior is observed as $\beta$ increases.</description>

      <title>Memory-Dependent FPK Equations for Nonlinear SDOF Oscillators Under Fractional Gaussian Noise Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the probabilistic responses of nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom oscillators under fractional Gaussian noise (FGN) excitation. Unlike Gaussian white noise, FGN exhibits persistent correlations and memory effects, making conventional Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation methods inapplicable. To address this, we develop memory-dependent FPK (memFPK) equations based on fractional Wick-Ito-Skorohod calculus, capable of capturing the joint probability of system responses. A discretized local mean method (DLMM) is proposed to estimate the memory-dependent diffusion coefficient, and a finite difference scheme solves the memFPK equation numerically. Validation through linear and nonlinear examples shows excellent agreement with analytical or Monte Carlo solutions. This framework provides a practical tool for analyzing non-Markovian stochastic dynamics, with potential extensions to multidimensional and parametric FGN problems.</description>

      <title>Topics in Probability, Parametric Estimation and Stochastic Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We begin our journey by recalling the fundamentals of Probability Theory that underlie one of its most significant applications to real-world problems: Parametric Estimation. Throughout the text, we systematically develop this theme by presenting and discussing the main tools it encompasses (concentration inequalities, limit theorems, confidence intervals, maximum likelihood, least squares, and hypothesis testing) always with an eye toward both their theoretical underpinnings and practical relevance. While our approach follows the broad contours of conventional expositions, we depart from tradition by consistently exploring the geometric aspects of probability, particularly the invariance properties of normally distributed random vectors. This geometric perspective is taken further in an extended appendix, where we introduce the rudiments of Brownian motion and the corresponding stochastic calculus, culminating in It\^o's celebrated change-of-variables formula. To highlight its scope and elegance, we present some of its most striking applications: the sharp Gaussian concentration inequality (a central example of the "concentration of measure phenomenon"), the Feynman-Kac formula (used to derive a path integral representation for the Laplacian heat kernel), and, as a concluding delicacy, the Black-Scholes strategy in Finance.</description>

      <title>Sharp Phase Transitions for k-Fold Coverage Using Morse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for studying random k-coverage, using Morse theory for the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) distance function. We prove a sharp phase transition for the number of critical points of the k-NN distance function, from which we conclude a phase transition for k-coverage. In addition, in the critical window our new framework enables us to prove a Poisson process approximation (in both location and size) for the last uncovered regions.</description>

      <title>Long time behaviour of one facilitated kinetically constrained models: results and open problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetically constrained models (KCMs) are interacting particle systems introduced in the '80s by physicists to have accessible stochastic models with glassy-type dynamics. The key mechanism behind the complex evolution of these otherwise simple models is the so-called dynamical facilitation, a feature embedded into the models via appropriate kinetic constraints. KCMs are reversible with respect to a Bernoulli product measure, and the analysis of their stationary evolution has witnessed significant progress in the last decade. Unfortunately, in the interesting regime when the equilibrium density of the facilitating vertices is small, many fundamental questions concerning the non-stationary evolution of even the simplest models remain unsolved. In this paper, we discuss some of these questions, along with partial new results and conjectures, for the one facilitated model and its variants, as well as for the biased annihilating branching process.</description>

      <title>Stochastic evolution equations with nonlinear diffusivity, recent progress and critical cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short survey article stems from recent progress on critical cases of stochastic evolution equations in variational formulation with additive, multiplicative or gradient noises. Typical examples appear as the limit cases of the stochastic porous medium equation, stochastic fast- and super fast-diffusion equations, self-organized criticality, stochastic singular $p$-Laplace equations, and the stochastic total variation flow, among others. We present several different notions of solutions, results on convergence of solutions depending on a parameter, and homogenization. Furthermore, we provide some references hinting at the recent progress in regularity results, long-time behavior, ergodicity, and numerical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the Gaussian free field on the metric graph of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ ($d\ge 3$), we consider the heterochromatic two-arm probability, i.e., the probability that two points $v$ and $v'$ are contained in distinct clusters of opposite signs with diameter at least $N$. For all $d\ge 3$ except the critical dimension $d_c=6$, we prove that this probability is asymptotically proportional to $N^{-[(\frac{d}{2}+1)\land 4]}$. Furthermore, we prove that conditioned on this two-arm event, the volume growth of each involved cluster is comparable to that of a typical (unconditioned) cluster; precisely, each cluster has a volume of order $M^{(\frac{d}{2}+1)\land 4}$ within a box of size $M$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study a condition introduced by Gordin and Lif{\v s}ic in 1981 to establish the Central Limit Theorem for additive functionals of stationary Markov chains with normal transition operator. In the more general setting of strictly stationary sequences satisfying the Gordin-Lif{\v s}ic condition, we give sufficient (and sometimes also necessary) conditions for partial sums to be approximated in L2 by a martingale with stationary increments. Various types of L2 approximations are described, leading to different versions of the central limit theorem (annealed, quenched, functional form...). The optimality of the conditions is discussed, and an application to the class of semi-linear processes is presented.</description>

      <title>Separation and cut edge in macroscopic clusters for metric graph Gaussian free fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for the Gaussian free field (GFF) on the metric graph of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (for all $d\ge 3$ except the critical dimension $d_c=6$), with uniformly positive probability there exist two distinct sign clusters of diameter at least $cN$ within a box of size $N$ such that their graph distance is less than $N^{-[(d-2)\vee (2d-8)]}$. This phenomenon contrasts sharply with the two-dimensional case, where the distance between two macroscopic clusters is typically on the order of their diameters, following from the basic property of the scaling limit ``conformal loop ensembles'' $\mathrm{CLE}_4$ (Sheffield-Werner'2001).
  As a byproduct, we derive that the number of pivotal edges for the one-arm event (i.e., the sign cluster containing the origin has diameter at least $N$) is typically of order $N^{(\frac{d}{2}-1)\land 2}$. This immediately implies that for the incipient infinite cluster (IIC) of the metric graph GFF, the dimension of cut edges (i.e., edges whose removal leads to disconnection of the IIC) equals $(\frac{d}{2}-1)\land 2$. Translated in the language of critical loop soups (whose clusters by the isomorphism theorem, have the same distribution as GFF sign clusters), this leads to the analogous estimates where the counterpart of a pivotal edge is a pivotal loop at scale $1$. This result hints at the new and possibly surprising idea that already in dimension $3$, microscopic loops (even those at scale $1$) play a crucial role in the construction of macroscopic loop clusters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of understanding the scaling limit of metric graph critical loop soup clusters and its relation to loop soups in the continuum appears to be one of the subtle cases that reveal interesting new scenarios about scaling limits, with mixture of macroscopic and microscopic randomness. In the present paper, we show that in three dimensions, scaling limits of the metric graph clusters are strictly larger than the clusters of the limiting continuum Brownian loop soup. We actually show that the upper box counting dimension of the latter clusters is strictly smaller than $5/2$, while that of the former is $5/2$.</description>

      <title>Beneath the kinetic interpretation of noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion theory establishes a fundamental connection between stochastic differential equations and partial differential equations. The solution of a partial differential equation known as the Fokker-Planck equation describes the probability density of the stochastic process that solves a corresponding stochastic differential equation. The kinetic interpretation of noise refers to a prospective notion of stochastic integration that would connect a stochastic differential equation with a Fokker-Planck equation consistent with the Fick law of diffusion, without introducing correction terms in the drift. This work is devoted to identifying the precise conditions under which such a correspondence can occur. One of these conditions is a structural constraint on the diffusion tensor, which severely restricts its possible form and thereby renders the kinetic interpretation of noise a non-generic situation. This point is illustrated through a series of examples. Furthermore, the analysis raises additional questions, including the possibility of defining a stochastic integral inspired by numerical algorithms, the behavior of stochastic transport equations in heterogeneous media, and the development of alternative models for anomalous diffusion. All these topics are addressed using stochastic analytical tools similar to those employed to study the main problem: the existence of the kinetic interpretation of noise.</description>

      <title>The Rightmost Particle of the Contact Process on Dynamic Random Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of the rightmost occupied site in two models: the Spont process and the contact process with inherited sterility, in dimension 1. Both can be viewed as contact processes evolving in dynamic random environments, where the environment may itself depend on the state of the process. In the Spont process, blocking particles appear spontaneously, while in the inherited sterility model, sterile sites arise as offspring of occupied ones. Each model presents distinct mathematical challenges: the Spont process lacks self-duality, whereas the inherited sterility process is non-attractive. We establish a law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for the position of the rightmost occupied site. Our approach is based on the construction of a sequence of renewal times, defined through a detailed analysis of active infection paths. These results are obtained in the supercritical regime of the Spont process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inversion statistic of random permutations under the family~$(\p_\theta)_{\theta \ge 0}$ of Ewens sampling distributions on~$S_n$. We obtain an exact formula for the expected number of inversions under~$\p_\theta$. In particular, we show that this expected number of inversions is decreasing in the tilting parameter~$\theta$ and that it is convex in~$\theta$ for~$n \ge 5$ only. Further, we derive an exact formula for the probability that a specific pair of indices~$(i,j) \in \{1,\dots,n\}^2$ is inverted and show that this probability is decreasing in~$\theta$ if and only if~$\abs j-i\abs \ge 2$ holds.</description>

Abstract: We prove that under the domination condition: ${\cal{E}}^{-\mu,-\nu}[-\xi|{\cal{F}}_t]\leq\rho_t(\xi)\leq{\cal{E}}^{\mu,\nu}[-\xi|{\cal{F}}_t],\ \forall\xi\in \mathcal{L}^{\exp}_T$ (resp. $L^2(\mathcal{F}_T)$), where ${\cal{E}}^{\mu,\nu}$ is the $g$-expectation with generator $\mu|z|+\nu|z|^2, \mu\geq0, \nu\geq0$, the dynamic convex (resp. coherent) risk measure $\rho$ admits a representation as a $g$-expectation, whose generator $g$ is convex (resp. sublinear) in the variable $z$ and has a quadratic (resp. linear) growth. As an application, we show that such dynamic convex (resp. coherent) risk measure $\rho$ admits a dual representation, where the penalty term (resp. the set of probability measures) is characterized by the corresponding generator $g$.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Solving Infinitely Many LQ Mean Field Games In Hilbert Spaces: The Power of Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional mean-field game (MFG) solvers operate on an instance-by-instance basis, which becomes infeasible when many related problems must be solved (e.g., for seeking a robust description of the solution under perturbations of the dynamics or utilities, or in settings involving continuum-parameterized agents.). We overcome this by training neural operators (NOs) to learn the rules-to-equilibrium map from the problem data (``rules'': dynamics and cost functionals) of LQ MFGs defined on separable Hilbert spaces to the corresponding equilibrium strategy. Our main result is a statistical guarantee: an NO trained on a small number of randomly sampled rules reliably solves unseen LQ MFG variants, even in infinite-dimensional settings. The number of NO parameters needed remains controlled under appropriate rule sampling during training.
  Our guarantee follows from three results: (i) local-Lipschitz estimates for the highly nonlinear rules-to-equilibrium map; (ii) a universal approximation theorem using NOs with a prespecified Lipschitz regularity (unlike traditional NO results where the NO's Lipschitz constant can diverge as the approximation error vanishes); and (iii) new sample-complexity bounds for $L$-Lipschitz learners in infinite dimensions, directly applicable as the Lipschitz constants of our approximating NOs are controlled in (ii).</description>

      <title>Distances between non-symmetric convex bodies: optimal bounds up to polylog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the non-symmetric Banach-Mazur distance between two convex bodies $K_1, K_2 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies $$ d_{BM}(K_1, K_2) \leq C n \cdot \log^{\alpha} (n+1), $$ for universal constants $C, \alpha &gt; 0$. This improves upon the earlier bound $C n^{4/3} \log^{\alpha} (n+1)$ due to Rudelson. Up to polylogarithmic factors, our estimate is optimal and it also matches the optimal bound in the centrally-symmetric case which is realized in the John position, as proven by Gluskin. The bound above for the Banach-Mazur distance is attained when both bodies are in a ``random isotropic position'', that is, in isotropic position after a random rotation. Our proof is based on an $M$-bound in the isotropic position, which complements E. Milman's $M^*$-bound. In addition, we consider the partial containment distance $d_{PC}(K_1, K_2)$ between two convex bodies $K_1, K_2 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, where the Banach-Mazur requirement to contain $100\%$ of the other body is relaxed to $99\%$-containment. We prove that for any pair of convex bodies $K_1, K_2 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, $$ d_{PC}(K_1, K_2) \leq C \log^{\alpha} (n+1), $$ and that any isotropic position of $K_1$ and $K_2$ yields this polylogarithmic bound for $d_{PC}$.</description>

      <title>Consumption-Investment Problem in Rank-Based Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a consumption-investment problem in a multi-asset market where the returns follow a generic rank-based model. Our main result derives an HJB equation with Neumann boundary conditions for the value function and proves a corresponding verification theorem. The control problem is nonstandard due to the discontinuous nature of the coefficients in rank-based models, requiring a bespoke approach of independent mathematical interest. The special case of first-order models, prescribing constant drift and diffusion coefficients for the ranked returns, admits explicit solutions when the investor is either (a) unconstrained, (b) abides by open market constraints or (c) is fully invested in the market. The explicit optimal strategies in all cases are related to the celebrated solution to Merton's problem, despite the intractability of constraint (b) in that setting.</description>

      <title>Controlled rough SDEs, pathwise stochastic control and dynamic programming principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stochastic optimal control of rough stochastic differential equations (RSDEs). This is in the spirit of the pathwise control problem (Lions--Souganidis 1998, Buckdahn--Ma 2007; also Davis--Burstein 1992), with renewed interest and recent works drawing motivation from filtering, SPDEs, and reinforcement learning. Results include regularity of rough value functions, validity of a rough dynamic programming principles and new rough stability results for HJB equations, removing excessive regularity demands previously imposed by flow transformation methods. Measurable selection is used to relate RSDEs to "doubly stochastic" SDEs under conditioning. In contrast to previous works, Brownian statistics for the to-be-conditioned-on noise are not required, aligned with the "pathwise" intuition that these should not matter upon conditioning. Depending on the chosen class of admissible controls, the involved processes may also be anticipating. The resulting stochastic value functions coincide in great generality for different classes of controls. RSDE theory offers a powerful and unified perspective on this problem class.</description>

      <title>Convergence from the Log-Gamma Polymer to the Directed Landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the log-gamma sheet and the log-gamma landscape in terms of the 2-parameter and 4-parameter free energy of the log-gamma polymer model and prove that they converge to the Airy sheet and the directed landscape, which are central objects in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. Our proof of convergence to the Airy sheet relies on the invariance of free energy through the geometric RSK correspondence and the monotonicity of the free energy. To upgrade the convergence to the directed landscape, tail bounds in both spatial and temporal directions are required. However, due to the lack of scaling invariance in the discrete log-gamma polymer--unlike the Brownian setting of the O'Connell-Yor model--existing on-diagonal fluctuation bounds are insufficient. We therefore develop new off-diagonal local fluctuation estimates for the log-gamma polymer.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a multidimensional risk model with a common renewal process and in the presence of a constant interest force. The claim sizes are independent and identically distributed random vectors, with the distribution of dependent components belonging to the class of multivariate subexponential distributions. We establish locally uniform asymptotic estimations for the entrance probability of the discounted aggregate claims into some rare sets, and further derive asymptotic estimations uniformly over all the time horizons. Furthermore, we present some distribution examples that belong to these multivariate heavy-tailed distribution classes, which are not restricted only to the case of multivariate regular variation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adapted Wasserstein ($AW$) distance refines the classical Wasserstein ($W$) distance by incorporating the temporal structure of stochastic processes. This makes the $AW$-distance well-suited as a robust distance for many dynamic stochastic optimization problems where the classical $W$-distance fails. However, estimating the $AW$-distance is a notably challenging task, compared to the classical $W$-distance. In the present work, we build a sharp estimate for the $AW$-distance in terms of the $W$-distance, for smooth measures. This reduces estimating the $AW$-distance to estimating the $W$-distance, where many well-established classical results can be leveraged. As an application, we prove a fast convergence rate of the kernel-based empirical estimator under the $AW$-distance, which approaches the Monte-Carlo rate ($n^{-1/2}$) in the regime of highly regular densities. These results are accomplished by deriving a sharp bi-Lipschitz estimate of the adapted total variation distance by the classical total variation distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interacting random matrix systems are fundamental to modern theoretical physics and data science, yet a unified framework for their analysis has been lacking. This work introduces such a universal framework, built upon two novel concepts: the Dyson Trace Flow characterizing macroscopic fluctuations, and the Multivariate Dynamic Coupled Semicircle Law describing the collective spectral behavior of multiple interacting matrix processes. We establish the stochastic evolution of eigenvalues under asymmetric coupling and prove the mathematical well-posedness of the theory. A large deviation principle is derived, enabling the calculation of rare event probabilities. The framework is extended to nonlinear and non-reciprocal interactions, revealing universal phenomena including exceptional points, bistability, and novel scaling laws. A striking connection to quantum chaos is unveiled through a holographic correspondence with wormhole geometries. By generalizing classical random matrix theory, this work provides powerful tools for understanding neural networks and complex quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Linear Functionals of Online SGD in High-dimensional Linear Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09727v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has emerged as the quintessential method in a data scientist's toolbox. Using SGD for high-stakes applications requires, however, careful quantification of the associated uncertainty. Towards that end, in this work, we establish a high-dimensional Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for linear functionals of online SGD iterates for overparametrized least-squares regression with non-isotropic Gaussian inputs. We first show that a bias-corrected CLT holds when the number of iterations of the online SGD, $t$, grows sub-linearly in the dimensionality, $d$. In order to use the developed result in practice, we further develop an online approach for estimating the variance term appearing in the CLT, and establish high-probability bounds for the developed online estimator. Together with the CLT result, this provides a fully online and data-driven way to numerically construct confidence intervals. This enables practical high-dimensional algorithmic inference with SGD and to the best of our knowledge, is the first such result.</description>

Abstract: We consider a fractional nonlinear wave equations (fNLW) with a general power-type nonlinearity, on the two-dimensional torus. Our main goal is to construct invariant global-in-time Gibbs dynamics for a renormalized fNLW. We first construct the Gibbs measure associated with this equation by using the variational approach of Barashkov and Gubinelli. We then prove almost sure local well-posedness with respect to Gibbsian initial data, by exploiting the second order expansion. Finally, we extend solutions globally in time using Bourgain's invariant measure argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03720v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Plancherel-Rotach type asymptotics of the biorthogonal polynomials associated to the biorthogonal ensemble with the joint probability density function \begin{equation*}
  \frac{1}{C} \prod_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq n} (\lambda_j -\lambda_i)(f(\lambda_j) - f(\lambda_i)) \prod^n_{j = 1} W^{(n)}_{\alpha}(\lambda_j) d\lambda_j, \end{equation*} where \begin{align*} f(x) = {}&amp; \sinh^2(\sqrt{x}), &amp; W^{(n)}_{\alpha}(x) = {}&amp; x^{\alpha} h(x) e^{-nV(x)}. \end{align*} In the special case that the potential function $V$ is linear, this biorthogonal ensemble arises in the quantum transport theory of disordered wires. We analyze the asymptotic problem via $2$-component vector-valued Riemann-Hilbert problems, and solve it under the one-cut regular with a hard edge condition. We use the asymptotics of biorthogonal polynomials to establish sine universality for the correlation kernel in the bulk, and provide a central limit theorem with a specific variance for holomorphic linear statistics.
  As an application of our theories, we establish the Ohm's law (1.12) and universal conductance fluctuation (1.13) for the disordered wire model, thereby rigorously confirming predictions from experimental physics [Washburn-Webb86].</description>

      <title>Mahler's problem and Turyn polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mahler's problem asks for the largest possible value of the Mahler measure, normalized by the $L_2$ norm, of a polynomial with $\pm1$ coefficients and large degree. We establish a new record value in this problem exceeding $0.95$ by analyzing certain Turyn polynomials, which are defined by cyclically shifting the coefficients of a Fekete polynomial by a prescribed amount. It was recently established that the distribution of values over the unit circle of Fekete polynomials of large degree is effectively modeled by a particular random point process. We extend this analysis to the Turyn polynomials, and determine expressions for the asymptotic normalized Mahler measure of these polynomials, as well as for their normalized $L_q$ norms. We also describe a number of calculations on the corresponding random processes, which indicate that the Turyn polynomials where the shift is approximately $1/4$ of the length have Mahler measure exceeding $95\%$ of their $L_2$ norm. Further, we show that these asymptotic values are not disturbed by a small change to make polynomials having entirely $\pm1$ coefficients, which establishes the result on Mahler's problem. We also estimate that the limiting value of the normalized $L_1$ norm of these polynomials exceeds $0.977$, in connection with a question of Newman.</description>

      <title>Transition of $\alpha$-mixing in Random Iterations with Applications in Queuing Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05056v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear time series models with exogenous regressors are essential in econometrics, queuing theory, and machine learning, though their statistical analysis remains incomplete. Key results, such as the law of large numbers and the functional central limit theorem, are known for weakly dependent variables. We demonstrate the transfer of mixing properties from the exogenous regressor to the response via coupling arguments. Additionally, we study Markov chains in random environments with drift and minorization conditions, even under non-stationary environments with favorable mixing properties, and apply this framework to single-server queuing models.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gradient descent in high dimensions for multi-spiked tensor PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the high-dimensional dynamics of online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for the multi-spiked tensor model. This multi-index model arises from the tensor principal component analysis (PCA) problem with multiple spikes, where the goal is to estimate $r$ unknown signal vectors within the $N$-dimensional unit sphere through maximum likelihood estimation from noisy observations of a $p$-tensor. We determine the number of samples and the conditions on the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) required to efficiently recover the unknown spikes from natural random initializations. We show that full recovery of all spikes is possible provided a number of sample scaling as $N^{p-2}$, matching the algorithmic threshold identified in the rank-one case [Ben Arous, Gheissari, Jagannath 2020, 2021]. Our results are obtained through a detailed analysis of a low-dimensional system that describes the evolution of the correlations between the estimators and the spikes, while controlling the noise in the dynamics. We find that the spikes are recovered sequentially in a process we term "sequential elimination": once a correlation exceeds a critical threshold, all correlations sharing a row or column index become sufficiently small, allowing the next correlation to grow and become macroscopic. The order in which correlations become macroscopic depends on their initial values and the corresponding SNRs, leading to either exact recovery or recovery of a permutation of the spikes. In the matrix case, when $p=2$, if the SNRs are sufficiently separated, we achieve exact recovery of the spikes, whereas equal SNRs lead to recovery of the subspace spanned by them.</description>

      <title>Continuity of the Distribution Function of the argmax of a Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certain extremum estimators have asymptotic distributions that are non-Gaussian, yet characterizable as the distribution of the $\argmax$ of a Gaussian process. This paper presents high-level sufficient conditions under which such asymptotic distributions admit a continuous distribution function. The plausibility of the sufficient conditions is demonstrated by verifying them in three examples, namely maximum score estimation, empirical risk minimization, and threshold regression estimation. In turn, the continuity result buttresses several recently proposed inference procedures whose validity seems to require a result of the kind established herein. A notable feature of the high-level assumptions is that one of them is designed to enable us to employ the Cameron-Martin theorem. In a leading special case, the assumption in question is demonstrably weak and appears to be close to minimal.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and turnpike properties of linear-quadratic mean field control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of solutions to linear-quadratic mean field stochastic optimal control problems. By formulating an ergodic control framework, we characterize the convergence between the finite time horizon control problem and its ergodic counterpart. Leveraging these convergence results, we establish the turnpike property for the optimal pairs, demonstrating that solutions to the finite time horizon control problem remain exponentially close to the ergodic equilibrium except near the temporal boundaries. This result reveals the intrinsic connection between long-term dynamics and their asymptotic behavior in mean field control systems.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Flow: Stability and Convergence for Stochastic Gradient Descent with Decaying Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present article studies the minimization of convex, L-smooth functions defined on a separable real Hilbert space. We analyze regularized stochastic gradient descent (reg-SGD), a variant of stochastic gradient descent that uses a Tikhonov regularization with time-dependent, vanishing regularization parameter. We prove strong convergence of reg-SGD to the minimum-norm solution of the original problem without additional boundedness assumptions. Moreover, we quantify the rate of convergence and optimize the interplay between step-sizes and regularization decay. Our analysis reveals how vanishing Tikhonov regularization controls the flow of SGD and yields stable learning dynamics, offering new insights into the design of iterative algorithms for convex problems, including those that arise in ill-posed inverse problems. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical experiments on image reconstruction and ODE-based inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Evanescent random walker on networks: Hitting times, budget renewal, and survival dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a mortal random walker evolving with discrete time on a network, where transitions follow a degree-biased Markovian navigation strategy. The walker starts with a random initial budget $T_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and must maintain a strictly positive budget to remain alive. Each step incurs a unit cost, decrementing the budget by one; the walker perishes (is ruined) upon depletion of the budget. However, when the walker reaches designated target nodes, the budget is renewed by an independent and identically distributed (IID) copy of its initial value. The degree bias is tuned to either favor or disfavor visits to these target nodes. Our model exhibits connections with stochastic resetting. The evolution of the budget can be interpreted as a deterministic drift on the integer line toward negative values, where the walker is intermittently reset to positive IID random positions and dies at the first hit of the origin. The first part of the paper focuses on the target-hitting statistics of an immortal Markovian walker. We analyze the \textit{target hitting counting process} (THCP) for an arbitrary set of target nodes. Within this framework, the second part of the paper addresses the dynamics of the evanescent walker. We derive analytical results for arbitrary configurations of target nodes, including the evanescent propagator matrix, the survival probability, the mean residence time on a set of nodes during the walker's lifetime, and the expected lifetime itself. Additionally, we compute the expected number of target hits (i.e., budget renewals) in a lifetime of the walker and related distributions. We explore both analytically and numerically various scenarios affecting the life expectancy of the walker.</description>

      <title>A Note on Subadditivity of Value at Risks (VaRs): A New Connection to Comonotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a new property of value at risk (VaR), which is a standard risk measure that is widely used in quantitative financial risk management. We show that the subadditivity of VaR for given loss random variables holds for any confidence level if and only if those are comonotonic. This result also gives a new equivalent condition for the comonotonicity of random vectors.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence of trained single layer neural networks to Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantitative convergence of shallow neural networks trained via gradient descent to their associated Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit.
  While previous work has established qualitative convergence under broad settings, precise, finite-width estimates remain limited, particularly during training.
  We provide explicit upper bounds on the quadratic Wasserstein distance between the network output and its Gaussian approximation at any training time $t \ge 0$, demonstrating polynomial decay with network width.
  Our results quantify how architectural parameters, such as width and input dimension, influence convergence, and how training dynamics affect the approximation error.</description>

      <title>Parameter-related strong convergence rate of an Euler's type method for time-changed stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An Euler's type method with the equidistant step size is proposed for a class of time-changed stochastic differential equations driven by the multiplicative noise and the strong convergence rate that is related to the parameter of the time changing process is obtained. Such a observation of the convergence rate is significantly different from those existing results that employ methods with the random step size. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.</description>
