      <title>Magnetic ground state and strain-mediated chiral-like atomic distortions behavior in two-dimensional rectangular spin lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy originating from spin-orbit coupling, magnetoelastic coupling is generally reported in easy-plane magnets with rectangular lattice where the easy magnetization is coupled with the lattice direction, while the acquisition of a novel coupling, beyond the easy-plane ferromagnets, in two-dimensional (2D) materials remains unknown. Here, by employing the density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate this feasibility with the discovery of long-range ferromagnetic ordering and elastic strain-mediated chiral-like atomic distortions behavior in a newly tetragonal As-Fe-As trilayer (t-FeAs monolayer), which shows large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, robust ferromagnetic ordering, and in-plane ferroelasticity. We firstly point out that obvious limits exist when using the four magnetic configurations to determine the magnetic ground state for a rectangular spin lattice even if more exchange interaction parameters are included. A four-state mapping analysis is carefully examined for t-FeAs, where the calculated Curie temperature, Tc, is 435 K, which is higher than most reported 2D magnets, and can be further tuned by appropriate strains. Intriguingly, the chiral-like atomic distortion behavior of the Fe sub-layer is scanning tunneling microscopy characterizable, which can switch the magnetization axis between the out-of-plane and in-plane direction. This unusual finding of ferroelastic manipulation of both the atomic displacement and spin properties makes t-FeAs a promising candidate for future spintronics and also provides the possibility for exploring unprecedented coupling physics.</description>

      <title>Initial electron thermalization in metals measured by attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding initial electron thermalization has relevance to both fundamental scientific knowledge and application to the construction of novel devices. In this study, attosecond transient absorption is used to directly measure initial electron thermalization times of 38 $\pm$ 8 fs, 15 $\pm$ 3 fs, 4.2 $\pm$ 1 fs, and 2.0 $\pm$ 0.3 fs for Mg, Pt, Fe, and Co, respectively. Through time dependent density function theory calculations, it is shown that the fast electron thermalization observed in Fe and Co is correlated with a strong local field effect. We find that a simple analytical model can be used to calculate the initial electron thermalization time measured by the transient extreme ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy method performed here. Our results suggest that the most significant contributions to the initial electron thermalization times are the basic metal properties of the density of states volume available for scattering and screened electron interaction. Many-body effects contribute less, but still significantly to the initial electron thermalization time. Ultimately the information gained through this study shows the unique view that attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy contributes to unraveling and monitoring electron dynamics and its connection to many-body effects in metals and beyond.</description>

      <title>Capillary Flow Printing of Submicron Carbon Nanotube Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although printed transistors have a wide range of applications, the limited resolution of printing techniques (10-30 um) has been a barrier to advancement and scaling, particularly down to submicron dimensions. While previous works have shown creative approaches to realizing submicron channel lengths with printing, reliance on chemical processes unique to specific inks or tedious post-processing limit their applicability. Here, we report the use of capillary flow printing (CFP) to repeatably create fully printed submicron carbon nanotube thin-film transistors (CNT-TFTs) without chemical modification or physical manipulation post-printing. The versatility of this printing technique is demonstrated by printing conducting, semiconducting, and insulating inks on several types of substrates (SiO2, Kapton, and paper) and through the fabrication of various TFT device (contacting/gating) architectures. Notably, CFP of these CNT-TFTs yielded on-currents of 1.12 mA/mm when back gated on Si/SiO2, and 490 uA/mm when side gated through ion gel on Kapton, demonstrating the strong transistor performance achievable with CFP. Mechanical bending and sweep rate resilience of devices printed on Kapton show the wide utility of CFP-fabricated devices for flexible applications. This work highlights the ability of CFP as a viable fabrication method for submicron electronics through cleanroom-free printing techniques.</description>

      <title>Large geometric polarization and magnetic behavior in the multiferroic quasi-2D SrNiF$_4$ fluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decades, multifunctional single-crystals that show, for example, multiferroic and magnetoelectric responses have attracted considerable attention due to the potential applications and physical phenomena involved in the entanglement of the ferroic orders. This paper investigates the structural, ferroelectric, and magnetic properties of the unexplored layered SrNiF$_4$ fluoride compound. We show that, in terms of the vibrational phonon modes, this fluoride compound shows a tangible ferroelectric behavior with a spontaneous polarization as large as $P_s$ = 14.8 $\mu$C$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$ standing as one of the largest among its family. Besides, based on our findings such ferroelectric polarization presents a geometric origin that is strongly entangled with the octahedral rotations within the $\Gamma_2^-$ phonon mode and enhanced by the structure's $\Gamma_1^+$ mode. We also observed that the spontaneous polarization is coupled to the noncollinear $G$-type antiferromagnetic ordering in the structure allowing a switching of the weak antiferromagnetic component when the polarization is reversed.</description>

      <title>Restructuring disorder: Transformation from the antiferromagnetic order in Fe2VSi to the ferromagnetic state in FeRuVSi by substitution of a non-magnetic element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The delicate nature of the half-metallic ferromagnetic (HMF) property in Heusler alloys is often compromised by inherent structural disorder within the systems. Fe2VSi is a prime example, where such disorder prevents the realization of the theoretically proposed HMF state as the anti-site disorder leads to the formation of two anti-parallel magnetic lattices resulting in antiferromagnetic order. In this study, we propose an innovative and simple strategy to prevent this atomic disorder by replacing 50% of the magnetic element Fe by a large, isoelectronic, non-magnetic element, Ru. In this way, one of the magnetic sublattices of the antiferromagnetic lattice ceases to order while ferromagnetic order is restored, an essential criterion for exhibiting HMF properties. Through various experimental measurements and theoretical calculations, we have shown that such partial replacement of Fe by Ru prevents the cross-site substitution of V/Si sites and the system regains its ferromagnetic order. Our theoretical calculations suggest that a perfect structural arrangement in Fe and Ru would have restored the HMF property in FeRuVSi. However, the local atomic disorder of Fe and Ru was found to decrease the spin polarization value. The present work sheds light on the complex interplay between structural disorder and magnetic properties in Heusler alloys and provides insights for future design strategies in the pursuit of robust half-metallic ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Randomness in atomic disorder and consequent squandering of spin-polarization in a ferromagnetically fragile quaternary Heusler alloy FeRuCrSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ru$_{2-x}$Fe$_x$CrSi ( 0 $&lt;$ x $&lt;$1) system is theoretically predicted to be one of the very few known examples of robust half-metallic ferromagnet with 100\% spin polarization. Since Cr is considered to be the main contributor to magnetism, the Fe/Ru substitution is not expected to disturb its magnetic properties any significantly, and hence all Fe-containing members of the series are predicted to follow Slater-Pauling rule with a saturation magnetic moment of 2 ${\mu_B}$/f.u. However, contrarily to the theoretical expectations, some experiments rather show a linear variation of the saturation magnetization and Curie temperature with Fe (\textit{x}) substitution. The equiatomic member FeRuCrSi of this family is also considered as a technologically important material, where the band structure calculations suggest the material to be spin gapless semiconductor. Through our in-depth structural analysis of FeRuCrSi using X-ray diffraction, extended X-ray absorption fine structure and $^{57}$Fe M\"{o}ssbauer spectrometry, we found a random disorder between Fe and Ru sites, while the magnetic moment in this system is actually contributed by Fe atoms, questioning the very basic foundation of the half-metallic character proposed by all theoretical calculations on Ru$_{2-x}$Fe$_x$CrSi series. Our M\"{o}ssbauer result also envisions a rather rare scenario where the main physical properties are intricately correlated to the chemistry of the material in the form of random atomic disorder on a localised scale.</description>

      <title>Magnetic geometry to quantum geometry nonlinear transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear transports (NLTs) have garnered broad attention based on their topological origin in quantum geometry. When quantum geometry meets magnetic geometry in magnets, their crossover excites diverse phenomena particularly related to antiferromagnetic spintronics. However, very few material platforms have been predicted and experimentally verified to date, where spin-orbit coupling (SOC) plays an indispensable role in generating NLTs. Therefore, to boost antiferromagnetic spintronics affected by the dual effect of quantum geometry and magnetic geometry, a material database of antiferromagnets (AFMs) with magnetic geometry driven quantum geometry and more significant NLT effects is urgently needed. Here, we integrate the state-of-the-art spin space group theory into the symmetry analysis of NLT tensors. By completely disentangling SOC effects, we find that collinear and coplanar magnetic geometry can only induce NLT driven by Berry curvature dipole, and noncoplanar one may trigger NLT driven by dipoles of Berry curvature, inverse mass, and quantum metric. Remarkably, a materials database of 260 AFMs with SOC-free NLT effects is established. Several prototypical material candidates are presented by first-principle calculations, including collinear AFM VNb$_{3}$S$_{6}$ and coplanar AFM Ca$_{2}$Cr$_{2}$O$_{5}$ with NLT driven by Berry curvature dipole, and a room-temperature noncoplanar AFM CrSe with NLTs driven by inverse mass dipole and quantum metric dipole. Our work not only provides a universal theoretical framework for studying various magnetism-driven transport effects, but also predicts broad, experimentally accessible material platforms for antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity of Double Polymorph Ga2O3 Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently discovered double gamma/beta ({\gamma}/\b{eta}) polymorph Ga2O3 structures constitute a class of novel materials providing an option to modulate functional properties across interfaces without changing chemical compositions of materials, in contrast to that in conventional heterostructures. In this work, for the first time, we investigate thermal transport in such homo-interface structures as an example of their physical properties. Specifically, the cross-plane thermal conductivity (k) was measured by femtosecond laser-based time-domain thermoreflectance with MHz modulation rates, effectively obtaining depth profiles of the thermal conductivity across the {\gamma}/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 structures. In this way, the thermal conductivity of {\gamma}-Ga2O3 k=1.84{\div}2.11 W m-1K-1 was found to be independent of the initial \b{eta}-substrates orientations, in accordance with the cubic spinel structure of the {\gamma}-phase and consistently with the molecular dynamics simulation data. In its turn, the thermal conductivity of monoclinic \b{eta}-Ga2O3 showed a distinct anisotropy, with values ranging from 10 W m-1K-1 for [201] to 20 Wm-1K-1 for [010] orientations. Thus, for double {\gamma}/\b{eta} Ga2O3 polymorph structures formed on [010] \b{eta}-substrates, there is an order of magnitude difference in thermal conductivity across the {\gamma}/\b{eta} interface, which potentially can be exploited in thermal energy conversion applications.</description>

      <title>Cooperative CO$_2$ capture via oxalate formation on metal-decorated graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CO$_2$ capture using carbon-based materials, particularly graphene and graphene-like materials, is a promising strategy to deal with CO$_2$ emissions. However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the molecular-level interaction between CO$_2$ molecules and graphene, particularly, in terms of chemical bonding and electron transfer. In this work, we employ random structure search and density functional theory to understand the adsorption of CO$_2$ molecules on Ca, Sr, Na, K, and Ti decorated graphene surfaces. Compared to the pristine material, we observe enhanced CO$_2$ adsorption on the decorated graphene surfaces. Particularly on group 2 metals and titanium decorated graphene, CO$_2$ can be strongly chemisorbed as a bent CO$_2$ anion or as an oxalate, depending on the number of CO$_2$ molecules. Electronic structure analysis reveals the adsorption mechanism to involve an ionic charge transfer from the metal adatom to the adsorbed CO$_2$. Overall, this study suggests that reducing CO$_2$ to oxalate on group 2 metals and titanium metal-decorated graphene surfaces is a potential strategy for CO$_2$ storage.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Topological Dirac and Dirac Nodal line semimetal in SrCaP belonging to Nodal line semimetal family SrCaX(X= Bi, Sb, As, P)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nodal line semimetals represent precursor states for various topological phases, exhibiting intrinsic topological characteristics and intriguing properties. These materials host rare and distinctive topological features, which can give rise to exotic phenomena, thereby garnering significant attention in both fundamental research and technological applications. In this study, we conduct ab-initio calculations to explore the properties of SrCaX (X = Bi, Sb, As, P), identifying these as multiple Dirac nodal line semimetals protected by Z2 quantized Berry phases and manifesting multiple drum-head-like surface states. The nodal lines in these compounds are situated at the M point when kz = 0 and at the A point when kz = {\pi}. Notably, SrCaX family exhibits a unique characteristic wherein they host both type II Dirac point and topological nodal line semimetal within a single crystal structure, hence providing an excellent platform for studying the interplay between different topological properties. Additionally, in SrCaP topological Dirac semimetal, Type II Dirac point and topological nodal line semimetal features coexist in a single crystal. These special features in this series of materials make them ideal candidates for further investigation by experimental means.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air pollution and greenhouse emissions are a significant problem across various sectors, urging the need for advanced technologies to detect and capture harmful gases. In recent years, two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted an increasing attention due to their large surface-to-volume ratio and reactivity. Herein, we investigate the potential of single-layer CrSBr for gas sensing and capturing by means of first-principles calculations. We explore the adsorption behaviour of different pollutant gases (H$_2$S, NH$_3$, NO, NO$_2$, CO and CO$_2$) on this 2D ferromagnet and the impact of intrinsic defects on its magnetic properties. Interestingly, we find that Br vacancies enhance the adsorption of NH$_3$, NO and NO$_2$ and induces a selective frequency shift on the magnon dispersion. This work motivates the creation of novel magnonic gas sensing devices based on 2D van der Waals magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Quadruple-well ferroelectricity and moderate switching barrier in defective wurtzite {\alpha}-Al3S3: a first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wurtzite-type ferroelectrics are highly promising for next-generation microelectronic devices due to their ferroelectric properties and integration with exiting semiconductors. However, their high coercive fields, which are close to breakdown electric fields, need to be lowered. To deal with this issue and secure device reliability, much effort has been devoted to exploring novel wurtzite compounds with lower polarization switching barriers and implementing doping strategies. Here, we report first-principles calculations on polarization switching in cation-vacancy ordered wurtzite {\alpha}-Al2S3, unveiling its uniaxial quadruple-well ferroelectricity and moderate switching barrier, 51 meV/cation, which is much lower than that of conventional wurtzite ferroelectrics. There are three important features relevant to the Al vacancies leading to the uncommon quadruple-well ferroelectricity and the moderate switching barrier: mitigation of cation-cation repulsion, structural flexibility that alleviates an in-plane lattice expansion, and formation of {\sigma}-like bonding states consisting of Al 3pz and S 3pz orbitals. Biaxial compressive strain and Ga doping lower the switching barriers by up to 40%. This study encourages experimental investigation of the ferroelectric properties for defective wurtzite {\alpha}-Al2S3 as a new promising material with unconventional and intriguing ferroelectricity and suggests a potential strategy for reducing switching barriers in wurtzite ferroelectrics: introducing cation vacancies.</description>

      <title>Fully spin-polarized two dimensional polar semi-metallic phase in Eu substituted GdI$_2$ monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of seemingly mutually exclusive properties such as ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity and metallicity in atomically thin materials is the requirement of the hour in electronics as the Moore's law faces an impending end. Only a few 2D multiferroic materials have been predicted/realized so far. The polar metals with simultaneous presence of polarity and conductivity are also equally rare. Here, we predict, based on first-principles calculations that an Eu-substituted rare-earth halide GdI$_2$ monolayer showcases ferromagnetism, ferroelasticity while being polar and a fully spin-polarized semi-metal at the same time. The ferroelasticity and polarity are shown to be coupled making it possible to switch the polar direction using external mechanical stress. Further, it is observed that, an application of biaxial tensile strain of $5\%$ causes the spin easy-axis to shift from out-of-plane to in-plane direction. Thus spin easy axis gets coupled with the direction of polarization in the strained monolayer making the switching of magnetization also possible using external strain. Simultaneous coexistence and coupling of the ferroic orders in a metallic 2D material makes the Eu substituted GdI$_2$ monolayer an incredibly rare material for nano-electronics and spintronics applications.</description>

Abstract: In this article we report the structural stability of Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ cubic pyrochlore with pressure using x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence, x-ray absorption and ab-initio calculations. Our studies establish a phase transformation in Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ from ambient cubic phase to high-pressure orthorhombic (cotunnite) phase, initiated at ~40 GPa. The transformation is sluggish and it does not complete even at the highest measured pressure in our study i.e. ~60.0 GPa. This is further supported by the first principle calculations which reveal that cotunnite phase is energetically more stable than the ambient phase above ~53 GPa. After complete release of pressure, the high-pressure cotunnite phase is retained while the fraction of untransformed pyrochlore phase becomes amorphous. Furthermore, the EXAFS data of the recovered sample at L3 edge of Er3+ ion show an increase in the coordination number of cations from eight at ambient to nine in the high-pressure phase. The mechanism of structural transformation is explained in terms of accumulation of cation antisite defects and subsequent disordering of cations and anions in their respective sublattice. The amorphization of the pyrochlore phase upon release is interpreted as the inability of accommodating the point defects at ambient conditions, which are formed in the pyrochlore lattice under compression.</description>

      <title>Sub-nanometer depth resolution and single dopant visualization achieved by tilt-coupled multislice electron ptychography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-space imaging of three-dimensional atomic structures is a critical yet challenging task in materials science. Although scanning transmission electron microscopy has achieved sub-angstrom lateral resolution through techniques like electron ptychography1,2, depth resolution remains limited to only 2 to 3 nanometers with a single projection setup3,4. Attaining better depth resolution typically necessitates large sample tilt angles and many projections, as seen in atomic electron tomography5,6. Here, we develop a new algorithm based on multislice electron ptychography which couples only a few projections at small tilt angles, but is sufficient to improve the depth resolution by more than threefold to the sub-nanometer scale, and potentially to the atomic level. This technique maintains high resolving power for both light and heavy atoms, and significantly improves the visibility of single dopants. We are thus able to experimentally detect dilute substitutional praseodymium dopants in a brownmillerite oxide, Ca2Co2O5, in three dimensions and observe the accompanying lattice distortion. This technique requires only a moderate level of data acquisition or processing, and can be seamlessly integrated into electron microscopes equipped with conventional components.</description>

      <title>Ring states in topological materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ingap states are commonly observed in semiconductors and are often well characterized by a hydrogenic model within the effective mass approximation. However, when impurities are strong, they significantly perturb all momentum eigenstates, leading to deep-level bound states that reveal the global properties of the unperturbed band structure. In this work, we discover that the topology of band wavefunctions can impose zeros in the impurity-projected Green's function within topological gaps. These zeros can be interpreted as spectral attractors, defining the energy at which ingap states are pinned in the presence of infinitely strong local impurities. Their pinning energy is found by minimizing the level repulsion of band eigenstates onto the ingap state. We refer to these states as ring states, marked by a mixed band character and a node at the impurity site, guaranteeing their orthogonality to the bare impurity eigenstates and a weak energy dependence on the impurity strength. We show that the inability to construct symmetric and exponentially localized Wannier functions ensures topological protection of ring states. Linking ring states together, the edge or surface modes can be recovered for any topologically protected phase. Therefore, ring states can also be viewed as building blocks of boundary modes, offering a framework to understand bulk-boundary correspondence.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Prediction of Tensor Material Properties of Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional machine learning methods applied to the material sciences have often predicted invariant, scalar properties of material systems to great effect. Newer, coordinate equivariant models promise to provide a coordinate system dependent output in a well defined manner, but recent applications often neglect a direct prediction of directional (i.e. coordinate system dependent) quantities and instead are used to predict still just invariant quantities. This component-wise prediction of tensorial properties is achieved by decomposing tensors into harmonic subspaces via a \textit{tensor spherical harmonic decomposition}, by which we may also associate arbitrary tensors with the irreducible representations of the rotation group. This essentially allows us to read off tensors component-wise from the output representations of these equivariant models. In this work, we present results for the prediction of various material property tensors directly from crystalline structures. Namely, given some material's crystalline structure, we may predict tensor components of dielectric, piezoelectric, and elasticity tensors directly from the output of a $SE(3)$ equivariant model.</description>

      <title>Time reversal symmetry breaking and zero magnetic field Josephson diode effect in Dirac semimetal Cd3As2-mediated asymmetric SQUIDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A zero-magnetic-field Josephson diode effect (JDE) is observed in an asymmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) mediated by Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. Herein it is shown that phase coupling between the surface and bulk superconducting channels, a unique phenomenon recently identified in the observations of fractional Josephson effect and Leggett modes in Cd3As2, can break time reversal symmetry (TRS) and, therefore, give rise to the zero-field JDE. It is identified that the efficiency of the JDE can be readily controlled by varying the geometry of the Josephson junction (JJ) arms in the SQUIDs, thus providing an explanation of different JDE behaviors in two SQUIDs examined in this work. Our results are anticipated to have important implications in superconducting electronic circuit applications.</description>

      <title>Correlated Electronic Structure and Incipient Flat Bands of the Kagome Superconductor CsCr3Sb5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome materials exhibit many novel phenomena emerging from the interplay between lattice geometry, electronic structure, and topology. A prime example is the vanadium-based kagome materials AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs) with superconductivity and unconventional charge-density wave (CDW). More interestingly, the substitution of vanadium by chromium further introduces magnetism and enhances the correlation effect in CsCr3Sb5 which likewise exhibits superconductivity under pressure and competing density-wave state. Here we systematically investigate the electronic structure of CsCr3Sb5 using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (APRES) and ab-initio calculations. Overall, the measured electronic structure agrees with the theoretical calculation. Remarkably, Cr 3d orbitals exhibit incoherent electronic states and contribute to incipient flat bands close to the Fermi level. The electronic structure shows a minor change across the magnetic transition at 55 K, suggesting a weak interplay between the local magnetic moment and itinerant electrons. Furthermore, we reveal a drastic enhancement of the electron scattering rate across the magnetic transition, which is relevant to the semiconducting-like transport property of the system at high temperatures. Our results suggest that CsCr3Sb5 is a strongly correlated Hund's metal with incipient flat bands near the Fermi level, which provides an electronic basis for understanding its novel properties in comparison to the non-magnetic and weakly correlated AV3Sb5.</description>

      <title>Phonon heat conduction across slippery interfaces in twisted graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interlayer rotation in van der Waals (vdW) materials offers great potential for manipulating phonon dynamics and heat flow in advanced electronics with ever higher compactness and power density. However, despite extensive theoretical efforts in recent years, experimental measurements remain scarce especially due to the critical challenges of preparing single-crystalline twisted interfaces and probing interfacial thermal transport with sufficient resolution. Here, we exploited the intrinsic twisted interfaces in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). By developing novel experimental schemes based on microfabricated mesas, we managed to achieve simultaneous mechanical characterizations and thermal measurements. In particular, we pushed the HOPG mesas with a microprobe to identify and rotate single-crystalline intrinsic interfaces owing to their slippery nature as is well known in structural superlubricity. Remarkably, we observed over 30-fold suppression of thermal conductance for the slippery interfaces by using epitaxial graphite as a control. Nonetheless, the interfacial conductance remains around 600 $\mathrm{MWm^{-2}K^{-1}}$ which surpasses the highest values for artificially stacked vdW structures by more than five times. Further, atomic simulations revealed the predominant role of the transverse acoustic phonons. Together, our findings highlight a general physical picture that directly correlates interfacial thermal transport with sliding resistance, and lay the foundation for twist-enabled thermal management which are particularly beneficial to twistronics and slidetronics.</description>

Abstract: The structural analogue of iron-based superconductors the BaMn$_2$P$_2$ and BaMn$_2$As$_2$ compounds under hydrostatic pressure upto 140 GPa were studied within the framework of DFT+U. The transition from an antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator to an antiferromagnetic metal is observed under pressure of 6.4 GPa for BaMn$_2$P$_2$ and 8.3 GPa for BaMn$_2$As$_2$. This second order phase transition to the AFM metallic state provides an appropriate normal state for possible superconductivity in these materials. Moreover, a further increase in pressure leads to a series of first order magnetostructural phase transitions between different antiferromagnetic phases, then to a ferromagnetic metal and finally to a nonmagnetic metal. In case of doping these compounds could potentially be a superconductors under pressure (above 6-8 GPa) with critical temperature growing under pressure.</description>

      <title>Modeling the spatial resolution of magnetic solitons in Magnetic Force Microscopy and the effect on their sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explored theoretically the spatial resolution of magnetic solitons and the variations of their sizes when subjected to a Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) measurement. Next to tip-sample separation, we considered reversal in the magnetization direction of the tip, showing that the magnetic soliton size measurement can be strongly affected by the magnetization direction of the tip. In addition to previous studies that only consider thermal fluctuations, we developed a theoretical method to obtain the minimum observable length of a magnetic soliton and its length variation due to the influence of the MFM tip by minimizing the soliton's magnetic energy. Our model uses analytical and numerical calculations and prevents overestimating the characteristic length scales from MFM images. We compared our method with available data from MFM measurements of domain wall widths, and we performed micromagnetic simulations of a skyrmion-tip system, finding a good agreement for both attractive and repulsive domain wall profile signals and for the skyrmion diameter in the presence of the magnetic tip. Our results provide significant insights for a better interpretation of MFM measurements of different magnetic solitons and will be helpful in the design of potential reading devices based on magnetic solitons as information carriers.</description>

      <title>Giant and anisotropic enhancement of spin-charge conversion in double Rashba interface graphene-based quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ever-increasing demand for efficient data storage and processing has fueled the search for novel memory devices. Spintronics offers an alternative fast and efficient solution using spin-to-charge interconversion. In this work, we demonstrate a remarkable thirty-four-fold increase in spin-to-charge current conversion when incorporating a 2D epitaxial graphene monolayer between iron and platinum layers by exploring spin-pumping on-chip devices. Furthermore, we find that the spin conversion is also anisotropic. We attribute this enhancement and anisotropy to the asymmetric Rashba contributions driven by an unbalanced spin accumulation at the differently hybridized top and bottom graphene interfaces, as highlighted by ad-hoc first-principles theory. The improvement in spin-to-charge conversion as well as its anisotropy reveals the importance of interfaces in hybrid 2D-thin film systems opening up new possibilities for engineering spin conversion in 2D materials, leading to potential advances in memory, logic applications, or unconventional computing.</description>

Abstract: Phonon dispersion is widely used to elucidate the vibrational properties of materials. As an emerging technique, momentum-resolved vibrational spectroscopy in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) offers an unparalleled approach to explore q-dependent phonon behavior at local structures. In this study, we systematically investigate the phonon dispersion of monolayer graphene across several Brillouin zones (BZs) using momentum-resolved vibrational spectroscopy and find that the optical phonon signals vanish at the {\Gamma} points with indices (hk0) satisfying h+2k=3n (n denoted integers). Theoretical analysis reveals that the observed phenomena arise from the complete destructive interference of the scattered waves from different basis atoms. This observation, corroborated by the study of diamond, should be a general characteristic of materials composed of symmetrically equivalent pairs of the same elements. Moreover, our results emphasize the importance of multiple scattering in interpreting the vibrational signals in bulk materials. We demonstrate that the systematic absences and dynamic effects, which have not been much appreciated before, offer new insights into the experimental assessment of local vibrational properties of materials.</description>

Abstract: Materials characterization using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) requires indexing the orientation of the measured region from Kikuchi patterns. The quality of Kikuchi patterns can degrade due to pattern overlaps arising from two or more orientations, in the presence of defects or grain boundaries. In this work we employ constrained non-negative matrix factorization to segment a microstructure with small grain misorientations,&lt; 1 degree, and predict the amount of pattern overlap. First we implement the method on mixed simulated patterns - that replicates a pattern overlap scenario, and demonstrate the resolution limit of pattern mixing or factorization resolution using a weight metric. Subsequently, we segment a single-crystal dendritic microstructure and compare the results with high resolution EBSD. By utilizing weight metrics across a low angle grain boundary we demonstrate how very small misorientations/low-angle grain boundaries can be resolved at a pixel level. Our approach constitutes a versatile and robust tool, complementing other fast indexing methods for microstructure characterization.</description>

Abstract: We provide a method for calculating anharmonic lattice dynamics, by building a surrogate model based on Gaussian Processes (GPs). Due to the underlying Gaussian form of a GP, the model is infinitely differentiable. This allows us to train the model trained directly on forces (the derivative of PESs) reducing the evaluations required for a given accuracy. We can extend this differentiation to directly calculate second and third order force-constants using automatic differentiation (AD). For the five model materials we study, we find that the force-constants are in close agreement with a standard finite-displacement approach. Our method appears to be linear scaling in the number of atoms at predicting both second and third-order (anharmonic) force-constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with $T_\mathrm{c} \simeq 80~\mathrm{K}$ under high pressure opens up a new route to high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity. This material realizes a bilayer square lattice model featuring a strong interlayer hybridization unlike many unconventional superconductors. A key question in this regard concerns how electronic correlations driven by the interlayer hybridization affect the low-energy electronic structure and the concomitant superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate using a cluster dynamical mean-field theory that the interlayer electronic correlations (IECs) induce a Lifshitz transition resulting in a change of Fermi surface topology. By solving an appropriate gap equation, we further show that the leading pairing instability, $s \pm$-wave, is enhanced by the IECs. The underlying mechanism is the quenching of a strong ferromagnetic channel, resulting from the Lifshitz transition driven by the IECs. Based on this picture, we provide a possible reason of why superconductivity emerges only under high pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystal defects can highlight interesting quantum features by coupling to the low-energy Hamiltonian $H$. Here we show that independently of this $H$ coupling, topological crystalline defects can generate new features by directly modifying the response theory of electric field probes such as Raman scattering. To show this we consider an antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 model $H_{spin}$ on a zigzag chain. Crystalline domain walls between two zigzag domains appear as at most local defects in $H_{spin}$, but as topological (not locally creatable) defects in the Raman operator $R$ of inelastic photon scattering. Using time evolving block decimation (TEBD) numerics, mean field, and bosonization, we show that a finite density of crystalline domain walls shifts the entire Raman signal to produce an effective gap. This lattice-defect-induced Raman gap closes and reopens in applied magnetic fields. We discuss the effect in terms of photons sensing the lattice defects within $R$ as spin-dimerization domain walls, with $Z_2$ character, and a resulting shift of the probed wavevector from $q=0$ to $\pi+\delta q$, giving an $\textit{O}(1)$ change in contrast to local defects. The magneto-Raman singularity from topological lattice defects here relies on the $H_{spin}$ spinon liquid state, suggesting future applications using lattice topological defects to modify response-theory operators independently of $H$ and thereby generate new probes of quantum phases.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of graphene led to a burst in search for 2D materials originating from layered atomic crystals coupled by van der Waals force. While bulk bismuth crystals share this layered crystal structure, unlike other group V members of the periodic table, its interlayer bonds are stronger such that traditional mechanical cleavage and exfoliation techniques have shown to be inefficient. In this work, we present a novel mechanical cleavage method for exfoliating bismuth by utilizing the stress concentration effect induced by micro-trench SiO2 structures. As a result, the exfoliated bismuth flakes can achieve thicknesses down to the sub-10 nm range which are analyzed by AFM and Raman spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: Strong laser pulses can control superconductivity, inducing non-equilibrium transient pairing by leveraging strong-light matter interaction. Here we demonstrate theoretically that equilibrium ground-state phonon-mediated superconductive pairing can be affected through the vacuum fluctuating electromagnetic field in a cavity. Using the recently developed $\textit{ab initio}$ quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory approximation, we specifically investigate the phonon-mediated superconductive behavior of MgB$_2$ under different cavity setups and find that in the strong-light matter coupling regime its superconducting transition temperature can be enhanced by $\approx 73\%$ ($\approx 40\%$) in an in-plane (out-of-plane) polarized cavity. The results highlight that strong-light matter coupling in extended systems can profoundly alter material properties in a non-perturbative way by modifying their electronic structure and phononic dispersion at the same time. Our findings indicate a pathway to the experimental realization of light-controlled superconductivity in solid-state materials at equilibrium via cavity-material engineering.</description>

      <title>Spectral scheme for atomic structure calculations in density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a spectral scheme for atomic structure calculations in pseudopotential Kohn-Sham density functional theory. In particular, after applying an exponential transformation of the radial coordinates, we employ global polynomial interpolation on a Chebyshev grid, with derivative operators approximated using the Chebyshev differentiation matrix, and integrations using Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the scheme through spin-polarized and unpolarized calculations for representative atoms, while considering local, semilocal, and hybrid exchange-correlation functionals. In particular, we find that $\mathcal{O}$(200) grid points are sufficient to achieve an accuracy of 1 microhartree in the eigenvalues for optimized norm conserving Vanderbilt pseudopotentials spanning the periodic table from atomic number $Z = 1$ to $83$.</description>
