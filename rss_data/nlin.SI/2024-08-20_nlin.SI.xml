      <title>The modified Toda hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, modified Toda (mToda) equation is generalized to form an integrable hierarchy in the framework of Sato theory, which is therefore called mToda hierarchy. Inspired by the fact that Toda hierarchy is 2--component generalization of usual KP hierarchy, mToda hierarchy is constructed from bilinear equations of 2--component 1st modified KP hierarchy, where we provide the corresponding equivalence with Lax formulations. Then it is demonstrated that there are Miura links between Toda and mToda hierarchies, which means the definition of mToda hierarchy here is reasonable. Finally, Darboux transformations of the Toda and mToda hierarchies are also constructed by using the aforementioned Miura links.</description>

      <title>Toda Darboux transformations and vacuum expectation values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determinant formulas for vacuum expectation values $\langle s+k+n-m,-s|e^{H(\mathbf{t})}\beta_m^{*}\cdots\beta_1^{*}\beta_n\cdots\beta_1g|k\rangle $ are given by using Toda Darboux transformations. Firstly notice that 2--Toda hierarchy can be viewed as the 2--component bosonizations of fermionic KP hierarchy, then two elementary Toda Darboux transformation operators $T_{+}(q)=\Lambda(q)\cdot\Delta\cdot q^{-1}$ and $T_{-}(r)=\Lambda^{-1}(r)^{-1}\cdot\Delta^{-1}\cdot r$ are constructed from the changes of Toda (adjoint) wave functions by using 2--component boson--fermion correspondence. Based on this, the above vacuum expectation values now can be realized as the successive applications of Toda Darboux transformations. So the corresponding determinant formulas can be derived from the determinant representations of Toda Darboux transformations. Finally by similar methods, we also give the determinant formulas for $\langle n-m|e^{\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{x})}\beta_m^{*}\cdots\beta_1^{*}\beta_n\cdots\beta_1g|k\rangle $ related with KP tau functions.</description>

      <title>Integrability of Generalised Skew-Symmetric Replicator Equations via Graph Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that there is a one-to-one mapping between oriented directed graphs and zero-sum replicator dynamics (Lotka-Volterra equations) and that furthermore these dynamics are Hamiltonian in an appropriately defined nonlinear Poisson bracket. In this paper, we investigate the problem of determining whether these dynamics are Liouville-Arnold integrable, building on prior work graph in graph decloning by Evripidou et al. [J. Phys. A., 55:325201, 2022] and graph embedding by Paik and Griffin [Phys. Rev. E. 107(5): L052202, 2024]. Using the embedding procedure from Paik and Griffin, we show (with certain caveats) that when a graph producing integrable dynamics is embedded in another graph producing integrable dynamics, the resulting graph structure also produces integrable dynamics. We also construct a new family of graph structures that produces integrable dynamics that does not arise either from embeddings or decloning. We use these results to classify the dynamics generated by almost all oriented directed graphs on six vertices, with three hold-out graphs that generate integrable dynamics and are not part of a natural taxonomy arising from known families and graph operations. These hold-out graphs suggest more structure is available to be found. Moreover, the work suggests that oriented directed graphs leading to integrable dynamics may be classifiable in an analogous way to the classification of finite simple groups, creating the possibility that there is a deep connection between integrable dynamics and combinatorial structures in graphs.</description>

      <title>The evolution of spectral data for nonlinear Klein-Gordon models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the breaking of integrability in the integrals of motion of a sine-Gordon-like system. The class of quasi-integrable models, discussed in the literature, inherits some of the integrable properties they are associated with. Our strategy, to investigate the problem through a deformation of the so-called inverse scattering method, has proven to be useful in the discussion of generic nonlinear Klein-Gordon potentials, as well as in particular cases presented here.</description>

      <title>Triple critical point and emerging temperature scales in $SU(N)$ ferromagnetism at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Abelian ferromagnet recently introduced by the authors, consisting of atoms in the fundamental representation of $SU(N)$, is studied in the limit where $N$ becomes large and scales as the square root of the number of atoms $n$. This model exhibits additional phases, as well as two different temperature scales related by a factor $N\!/\!\ln N$. The paramagnetic phase splits into a "dense" and a "dilute" phase, separated by a third-order transition and leading to a triple critical point in the scale parameter $n/N^2$ and the temperature, while the ferromagnetic phase exhibits additional structure, and a new paramagnetic-ferromagnetic metastable phase appears at the larger temperature scale. These phases can coexist, becoming stable or metastable as temperature varies. A generalized model in which the number of $SU(N)$-equivalent states enters the partition function with a nontrivial weight, relevant, e.g., when there is gauge invariance in the system, is also studied and shown to manifest similar phases, with the dense-dilute phase transition becoming second-order in the fully gauge invariant case.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Field Sigma Models and Yang-Baxter Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the Yang-Baxter deformation with higher-spin auxiliary field deformations to construct a multi-parameter family of integrable deformations of the principal chiral model on a Lie group $G$ with semi-simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Our construction produces one integrable deformation for each pair $(\mathcal{R}, E)$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is an antisymmetric bilinear operator on $\mathfrak{g}$ obeying the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation and $E$ is a function of several variables. We show that every model in this family is (weakly) classically integrable by exhibiting a Lax representation for its equations of motion.</description>

      <title>Polynuclear growth and the Toda lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the polynuclear growth model is a completely integrable Markov process in the sense that its transition probabilities are given by Fredholm determinants of kernels produced by a scattering transform based on the invariant measures modulo the absolute height, continuous time simple random walks. From the linear evolution of the kernels, it is shown that the $n$-point distributions are determinants of $n\times n$ matrices evolving according to the two dimensional non-Abelian Toda lattice.</description>
