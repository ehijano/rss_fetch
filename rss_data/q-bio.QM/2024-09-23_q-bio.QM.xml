      <title>CMINNs: Compartment Model Informed Neural Networks -- Unlocking Drug Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PKPD) modeling, which plays a pivotal role in the drug development process, traditional models frequently encounter difficulties in fully encapsulating the complexities of drug absorption, distribution, and their impact on targets. Although multi-compartment models are frequently utilized to elucidate intricate drug dynamics, they can also be overly complex. To generalize modeling while maintaining simplicity, we propose an innovative approach that enhances PK and integrated PK-PD modeling by incorporating fractional calculus or time-varying parameter(s), combined with constant or piecewise constant parameters. These approaches effectively model anomalous diffusion, thereby capturing drug trapping and escape rates in heterogeneous tissues, which is a prevalent phenomenon in drug dynamics. Furthermore, this method provides insight into the dynamics of drug in cancer in multi-dose administrations. Our methodology employs a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and fractional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (fPINNs), integrating ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with integer/fractional derivative order from compartmental modeling with neural networks. This integration optimizes parameter estimation for variables that are time-variant, constant, piecewise constant, or related to the fractional derivative order. The results demonstrate that this methodology offers a robust framework that not only markedly enhances the model's depiction of drug absorption rates and distributed delayed responses but also unlocks different drug-effect dynamics, providing new insights into absorption rates, anomalous diffusion, drug resistance, peristance and pharmacokinetic tolerance, all within a system of just two (fractional) ODEs with explainable results.</description>

      <title>Natural Language Processing Methods for the Study of Protein-Ligand Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have ignited interest in developing effective methods for predicting protein-ligand interactions (PLIs) given their relevance to drug discovery and protein engineering efforts and the ever-growing volume of biochemical sequence and structural data available. The parallels between human languages and the "languages" used to represent proteins and ligands have enabled the use of NLP machine learning approaches to advance PLI studies. In this review, we explain where and how such approaches have been applied in the recent literature and discuss useful mechanisms such as long short-term memory, transformers, and attention. We conclude with a discussion of the current limitations of NLP methods for the study of PLIs as well as key challenges that need to be addressed in future work.</description>

      <title>pAE: An Efficient Autoencoder Architecture for Modeling the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus by Integrating Feedforward and Feedback Streams in Human Visual System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The visual cortex is a vital part of the brain, responsible for hierarchically identifying objects. Understanding the role of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) as a prior region of the visual cortex is crucial when processing visual information in both bottom-up and top-down pathways. When visual stimuli reach the retina, they are transmitted to the LGN area for initial processing before being sent to the visual cortex for further processing. In this study, we introduce a deep convolutional model that closely approximates human visual information processing. We aim to approximate the function for the LGN area using a trained shallow convolutional model which is designed based on a pruned autoencoder (pAE) architecture. The pAE model attempts to integrate feed forward and feedback streams from/to the V1 area into the problem. This modeling framework encompasses both temporal and non-temporal data feeding modes of the visual stimuli dataset containing natural images captured by a fixed camera in consecutive frames, featuring two categories: images with animals (in motion), and images without animals. Subsequently, we compare the results of our proposed deep-tuned model with wavelet filter bank methods employing Gabor and biorthogonal wavelet functions. Our experiments reveal that the proposed method based on the deep-tuned model not only achieves results with high similarity in comparison with human benchmarks but also performs significantly better than other models. The pAE model achieves the final 99.26% prediction performance and demonstrates a notable improvement of around 28% over human results in the temporal mode.</description>

      <title>Towards the Discovery of Down Syndrome Brain Biomarkers Using Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain imaging has allowed neuroscientists to analyze brain morphology in genetic and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Down syndrome, pinpointing regions of interest to unravel the neuroanatomical underpinnings of cognitive impairment and memory deficits. However, the connections between brain anatomy, cognitive performance and comorbidities like Alzheimer's disease are still poorly understood in the Down syndrome population. The latest advances in artificial intelligence constitute an opportunity for developing automatic tools to analyze large volumes of brain magnetic resonance imaging scans, overcoming the bottleneck of manual analysis. In this study, we propose the use of generative models for detecting brain alterations in people with Down syndrome affected by various degrees of neurodegeneration caused by Alzheimer's disease. To that end, we evaluate state-of-the-art brain anomaly detection models based on Variational Autoencoders and Diffusion Models, leveraging a proprietary dataset of brain magnetic resonance imaging scans. Following a comprehensive evaluation process, our study includes several key analyses. First, we conducted a qualitative evaluation by expert neuroradiologists. Second, we performed both quantitative and qualitative reconstruction fidelity studies for the generative models. Third, we carried out an ablation study to examine how the incorporation of histogram post-processing can enhance model performance. Finally, we executed a quantitative volumetric analysis of subcortical structures. Our findings indicate that some models effectively detect the primary alterations characterizing Down syndrome's brain anatomy, including a smaller cerebellum, enlarged ventricles, and cerebral cortex reduction, as well as the parietal lobe alterations caused by Alzheimer's disease.</description>

      <title>Geometric Self-Supervised Pretraining on 3D Protein Structures using Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein representation learning aims to learn informative protein embeddings capable of addressing crucial biological questions, such as protein function prediction. Although sequence-based transformer models have shown promising results by leveraging the vast amount of protein sequence data in a self-supervised way, there is still a gap in exploiting the available 3D protein structures. In this work, we propose a pre-training scheme going beyond trivial masking methods leveraging 3D and hierarchical structures of proteins. We propose a novel self-supervised method to pretrain 3D graph neural networks on 3D protein structures, by predicting the distances between local geometric centroids of protein subgraphs and the global geometric centroid of the protein. By considering subgraphs and their relationships to the global protein structure, our model can better learn the geometric properties of the protein structure. We experimentally show that our proposed pertaining strategy leads to significant improvements up to 6\%, in the performance of 3D GNNs in various protein classification tasks. Our work opens new possibilities in unsupervised learning for protein graph models while eliminating the need for multiple views, augmentations, or masking strategies which are currently used so far.</description>

      <title>Prediction of causal genes at GWAS loci with pleiotropic gene regulatory effects using sets of correlated instrumental variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multivariate Mendelian randomization (MVMR) is a statistical technique that uses sets of genetic instruments to estimate the direct causal effects of multiple exposures on an outcome of interest. At genomic loci with pleiotropic gene regulatory effects, that is, loci where the same genetic variants are associated to multiple nearby genes, MVMR can potentially be used to predict candidate causal genes. However, consensus in the field dictates that the genetic instruments in MVMR must be independent, which is usually not possible when considering a group of candidate genes from the same locus. We used causal inference theory to show that MVMR with correlated instruments satisfies the instrumental set condition. This is a classical result by Brito and Pearl (2002) for structural equation models that guarantees the identifiability of causal effects in situations where multiple exposures collectively, but not individually, separate a set of instrumental variables from an outcome variable. Extensive simulations confirmed the validity and usefulness of these theoretical results even at modest sample sizes. Importantly, the causal effect estimates remain unbiased and their variance small when instruments are highly correlated. We applied MVMR with correlated instrumental variable sets at risk loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for coronary artery disease using eQTL data from the STARNET study. Our method predicts causal genes at twelve loci, each associated with multiple colocated genes in multiple tissues. However, the extensive degree of regulatory pleiotropy across tissues and the limited number of causal variants in each locus still require that MVMR is run on a tissue-by-tissue basis, and testing all gene-tissue pairs at a given locus in a single model to predict causal gene-tissue combinations remains infeasible.</description>
