      <title>The Maximum Black Hole Mass at Solar Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse current knowledge and uncertainties in detailed stellar evolution and wind modelling to evaluate the mass of the most massive stellar black hole (BH) at solar metallicity. Contrary to common expectations that it is the most massive stars that would produce the most massive BHs, we find that the maximum $M_{\rm BH}^{\rm Max} \simeq 30 \pm 10\,M_{\odot}$ is found in the canonical intermediate range between $M_{\rm ZAMS} \simeq 30$ and $50\,M_{\odot}$ instead. The prime reason for this seemingly counter-intuitive finding is that very massive stars (VMS) have increasingly high mass-loss rates, leading to substantial mass evaporation before they expire as stars, ending as lighter BHs than their canonical O-star counterparts.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Analysis of a Magnetic Island Observed by WISPR on Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the identification and physical analysis of a possible magnetic island feature seen in white-light images observed by the Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) on board the Parker Solar Probe (Parker). The island is imaged by WISPR during Parker's second solar encounter on 2019 April 06, when Parker was ~38 solar radii from the Sun center. We report that the average velocity and acceleration of the feature are approximately 334 km s and -0.64 m s-2. The kinematics of the island feature, coupled with its direction of propagation, indicate that the island is likely entrained in the slow solar wind. The island is elliptical in shape with a density deficit in its center, suggesting the presence of a magnetic guide field. We argue that this feature is consistent with the formation of this island via reconnection in the current sheet of the streamer. The feature's aspect ratio (calculated as the ratio of its minor to major axis) evolves from an elliptical to a more circular shape that approximately doubles during its propagation through WISPR's field of view. The island is not distinct in other white-light observations from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) coronagraphs, suggesting that this is a comparatively faint heliospheric feature and that viewing perspective and WISPR's enhanced sensitivity are key to observing the magnetic island.</description>

      <title>A kinematical study of the launching region of the blueshifted HH 46/47 outflow with SINFONI K-band observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying outflows is important as they may significantly contribute to angular momentum removal from the star/disk system, affecting disk evolution and planet formation. To investigate the different outflow components; the collimated jet, wide-angled molecular outflow, and outflow cavity, of the Class I HH 46/47 outflow system. We focus on their kinematics. We present Near Infrared (NIR) K-band integral field observations of the blue-shifted HH 46/47 outflow base obtained using VLT/SINFONI with an angular resolution of 0".81. Our analysis focuses on [Fe II], H2 1-0 S(1), and, Br-gamma emission. We employ a wavelength recalibration technique based on OH telluric lines to probe the kinematics of the wide-angled flow with an accuracy of 1 km/s - 3 km/s. A velocity gradient of 10 km/s transverse to the outflow direction is confirmed in the wide-angled H2 outflow cavity. The H2 cavity peaks at radial velocities of -15 km/s to -30 km/s, and the atomic jet at v = -210 km/s. The outflow exhibits a layered structure; the high-velocity [Fe II] and Br-gamma jet is surrounded by a wide-angled H2 outflow cavity, which is in turn nested within the continuum emission and CO molecular outflow. The continuum emission and H2 outflow cavity are asymmetric with respect to the jet axis. We propose that the origin of the asymmetries and the velocity gradient detected in the wide-angled H2 cavity, is due to a wide-angled outflow or successive jet bowshocks expanding into an inhomogeneous ambient medium, or the presence of a secondary outflow. We eliminate outflow rotation as an exclusive origin of this velocity gradient due to large specific angular momenta values, J(r)= 3000 - 4000 km/s au calculated from 1" to 2" along the outflow. The observations reveal the complexities inherent in outflow systems, and the risk of attributing transverse velocity gradients solely to rotation.</description>

      <title>Thirty Two New Bright ZZ Ceti Stars from TESS: Adding Cycles 4 and 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing all 120 s and 20 s light curves obtained by the TESS satellite up to Sector 69 - the end of the fifth year of observations - for all known white dwarfs and white dwarf candidates up to G=17.5 mag, we report the discovery of 32 new pulsating DA white dwarf stars. For all objects, we obtained the period spectra and performed a seismological analysis using full evolutionary models to estimate the structural parameters, such as effective temperature, stellar mass, and hydrogen envelope mass. The median stellar mass for the pulsators from asteroseismology is 0.609 Msun, in agreement with the median value from photometric and spectroscopic determinations, 0.602 Msun, excluding the low and extremely-low mass objects. Finally, we found rotational-splitting multiplets for 9 stars, which led to rotation periods between 4 h and 1 d.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of two dwarf novae: CRTS J080846.2+313106 and V416 Dra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of two non-magnetic cataclysmic variables, namely CRTS J080846.2+313106 and V416 Dra. CRTS J080846.2+313106 has been found to vary with a period of 4.9116$\pm$0.0003 h, which was not found in earlier studies and is provisionally suggested as the orbital period of the system. In both long-period systems, the observed dominant signal at second harmonic of the orbital frequency and the orbital modulation during quiescence are suggestive of ellipsoidal variation from changing aspects of the secondary, with an additional contribution from the accretion stream or hotspot. However, during the outburst, the hotspot itself is overwhelmed by the increased brightness, which is possibly associated with the accretion disc. The mid-eclipse phase for V416 Dra occurs earlier and the width of the eclipse is greater during outbursts compared to quiescence, suggesting an increased accretion disc radius during outbursts. Furthermore, the investigation of accretion disc eclipse in V416 Dra implies that a total disc eclipse is possible during quiescence, whereas the disc seems to be partially obscured during outbursts, which further signifies that the disc may grow in size as the outburst progresses. Optical spectra of CRTS J080846.2+313106 and V416 Dra are typical of dwarf novae during quiescence, and they both show a significant contribution from the M2-4V secondary. The light curve patterns, orbital periods, and spectra observed in both systems look remarkably similar, and seem to resemble the characteristics of U Gem-type dwarf novae.</description>

      <title>Dust formation during the interaction of binary stars by common envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed numerical simulations of the common envelope (CE) interaction between two intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and their low-mass companions. For the first time, formation and growth of dust in the envelope is calculated explicitly. We find that the first dust grains appear as early as $\sim$1-3 yrs after the onset of the CE, and are smaller than grains formed later. As the simulations progress, a high-opacity dusty shell forms, resulting in the CE photosphere being up to an order of magnitude larger than it would be without the inclusion of dust. At the end of the simulations, the total dust yield is $0.0082~M_{\odot}$ ($0.022~M_{\odot}$) for a CE with a $1.7~M_{\odot}$ ($3.7~M_{\odot}$) AGB star. Dust formation does not substantially lead to more mass unbinding or substantially alter the orbital evolution.</description>

      <title>Searching for stellar cycles on low mass stars using TESS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have searched for stellar activity cycles in late low mass M dwarfs (M0--M6) located in the TESS north and south continuous viewing zones using data from sectors 1--61 (Cycle 1 to part way through Cycle 5). We utilise TESS-SPOC data which initially had a cadence of 30 min but reducing to 10 min in Cycles 3. In addition, we require each star to be observed in at least 6 sectors in each North/South Cycle: 1,950 low mass stars meet these criteria. Strong evidence was seen in 245 stars for a very stable photometric variation which we assume to be a signature of the stars rotation period. We did a similar study for Solar-like stars and found that 194 out of 1432 stars had a very stable modulation. We then searched for evidence of a variation in the rotational amplitude. We found 26 low mass stars showed evidence of variability in their photometric amplitude and only one Solar-like star. Some show a monotonic trend over 3--4 yrs whilst other show shorter term variations. We determine the predicted cycle durations of these stars using the relationship found by Irving (2023} using an estimate of the stars Rossby number. Finally we find a marginally statistically significant correlation between the range in the rotational amplitude modulation and the rotation period.</description>

      <title>The Solar and Geomagnetic Storms in May 2024: A Flash Data Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In May 2024, the scientific community observed intense solar eruptions that resulted in an extreme geomagnetic storm and auroral extension, highlighting the need to document and quantify these events. This study mainly focuses on their quantification. The source active region (AR 13664) evolved from 113 to 2761 millionths of the solar hemisphere between 4 May and 14 May 2024. AR 13664's magnetic free energy surpassed 1033 erg on 7 May 2024, triggering 12 X-class flares. Multiple interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) came out from this AR, accelerating solar energetic particles toward Earth. At least four ICMEs seemingly piled up to disturb the interplanetary space, according to the satellite data and interplanetary scintillation data. The shock arrival at 17:05 UT on 10 May 2024 significantly compressed the magnetosphere down to ~ 5.04 R_E, and triggered a deep Forbush decrease. GOES satellite data and ground-based neutron monitors confirmed a ground-level enhancement from 2 UT to 10 UT on 11 May 2024. The ICMEs induced extreme geomagnetic storms, peaking at a Dst index of -412 nT at 2 UT on 11 May 2024, marking the sixth-largest storm since 1957. The AE and AL indices showed extreme auroral extensions that located the AE/AL stations into the polar cap. We gathered auroral records at that time and reconstructed the equatorward boundary of the visual auroral oval to 29.8{\deg} invariant latitude. We compared naked-eye and camera auroral visibility, providing critical caveats on their difference. We also confirmed global enhancements of storm-enhanced density of the ionosphere.</description>

      <title>Direct Imaging of a Prolonged Plasma/Current Sheet and Quasiperiodic Magnetic Reconnection on the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is widely believed to be the fundamental process in the solar atmosphere that underlies magnetic energy release and particle acceleration. This process is responsible for the onset of solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and other explosive events (e.g., jets). Here, we report direct imaging of a prolonged plasma/current sheet along with quasiperiodic magnetic reconnection in the solar corona using ultra-high-resolution observations from the 1.6-meter Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at BBSO and Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA). The current sheet appeared near a null point in the fan-spine topology and persisted over an extended period (~20 hours). The length and apparent width of the current sheet were about 6 arcsec and 2 arcsec respectively, and the plasma temperature was ~10-20 MK. We observed quasiperiodic plasma inflows and outflows (bidirectional jets with plasmoids) at the reconnection site/current sheet. Furthermore, quasiperiodic reconnection at the long-lasting current sheet produced recurrent eruptions (small flares and jets) and contributed significantly to the recurrent impulsive heating of the active region. Direct imaging of a plasma/current sheet and recurrent null-point reconnection for such an extended period has not been reported previously. These unprecedented observations provide compelling evidence that supports the universal model for solar eruptions (i.e., the breakout model) and have implications for impulsive heating of active regions by recurrent reconnection near null points. The prolonged and sustained reconnection for about 20 hours at the breakout current sheet provides new insights into the dynamics and energy release processes in the solar corona.</description>

      <title>Multipoint study of the rapid filament evolution during a confined C2 flare on 28 March 2022, leading to eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the rapid filament evolution in AR 12975 during a confined C2 flare on 28 March 2022, which led to an eruptive M4 flare 1.5 h later. It is characterized by the breakup of the filament, the disappearance of its southern half, and the flow of the remaining plasma into a longer channel with a topology similar to an EUV hot channel during the flare. Our multipoint study takes advantage of Solar Orbiter's position at 0.33 AU and 83. 5{\deg} west of the Sun-Earth line. STIX and EUI onboard Solar Orbiter observed the event at the limb. AIA and HMI onboard SDO provided on-disk observations from which we derived DEM maps and NLFF magnetic field extrapolations. We find that both filament channels likely existed in close proximity before the flare. Based on field structures associated with AIA 1600 {\AA} flare ribbons and kernels, we propose a loop-loop reconnection scenario between field lines that surround and pass beneath the shorter filament channel, and field lines following a portion of the longer channel. Reconnection occurs in an essentially vertical current sheet at a PIL below the breakup region, leading to the formation of the flare loop arcade and the EUV hot channel. The scenario is supported by concentrated currents and free magnetic energy built up by antiparallel flows along the PIL before the flare. The reconnection probably propagated to involve the original filament itself, leading to its breakup and reformation. The reconnection geometry provides a general mechanism for the formation of the long filament channel and realizes the concept of tether cutting, which was active throughout the filament's rise phase, lasting from at least 30 min before the C2 flare until the eruption. The C2 flare represents a period of fast reconnection during this otherwise more steady process, during which most of the original filament was reconnected and joined the longer channel.</description>

      <title>The neutron star mass, distance, and inclination from precision timing of the brilliant millisecond pulsar J0437$-$4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of neutron stars enables the otherwise impossible study of fundamental physical processes. Timing of binary radio pulsars is particularly powerful, as it enables precise characterization of their (three-dimensional) positions and orbits. PSR J0437$-$4715 is an important millisecond pulsar for timing array experiments and is also a primary target for the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER). The main aim of the NICER mission is to constrain the neutron star equation of state by inferring the compactness ($M_p/R$) of the star. Direct measurements of the mass $M_p$ from pulsar timing therefore substantially improve constraints on the radius $R$, and the equation of state. Here we use observations spanning 26 years from Murriyang, the 64-m Parkes radio telescope, to improve the timing model for this pulsar. Among the new precise measurements are the pulsar mass $M_p=1.418\pm 0.044$ M$_{\odot}$, distance $D=156.96 \pm 0.11$ pc, and orbital inclination angle $i=137.506 \pm 0.016^\circ$, which can be used to inform the X-ray pulse profile models inferred from NICER observations. We demonstrate that these results are consistent between multiple data sets from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), each modelled with different noise assumptions. Using the longest available PPTA data set, we measure an apparent second derivative of the pulsar spin frequency and discuss how this can be explained either by kinematic effects due to the proper motion and radial velocity of the pulsar, or excess low-frequency noise such as a gravitational-wave background.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the role of merger histories in the population of Insitu stars: linking IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to H3 survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We undertake a comprehensive investigation into the distribution of insitu stars within Milky Way-like galaxies, leveraging TNG50 simulations and comparing their predictions with data from the H3 survey. Our analysis reveals that 28% of galaxies demonstrate reasonable agreement with H3, while only 12% exhibit excellent alignment in their profiles, regardless of the specific spatial cut employed to define insitu stars. To uncover the underlying factors contributing to deviations between TNG50 and H3 distributions, we scrutinize correlation coefficients among internal drivers(e.g., virial radius, star formation rate [SFR]) and merger-related parameters (such as the effective mass-ratio, mean distance, average redshift, total number of mergers, average spin-ratio and maximum spin alignment between merging galaxies). Notably, we identify significant correlations between deviations from observational data and key parameters such as the median slope of virial radius, mean SFR values, and the rate of SFR change across different redshift scans. Furthermore, positive correlations emerge between deviations from observational data and parameters related to galaxy mergers. We validate these correlations using the Random Forest Regression method. Our findings underscore the invaluable insights provided by the H3 survey in unraveling the cosmic history of galaxies akin to the Milky Way, thereby advancing our understanding of galactic evolution and shedding light on the formation and evolution of Milky Way-like galaxies in cosmological simulations.</description>

Abstract: Interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and dense circumstellar medium (CSM) with a flat density structure ($\rho \propto r^{-s}, s &lt; 1.5$) was recently proposed as a possible mechanism behind interacting SNe that exhibit exceptionally long rise times exceeding 100 days. In such a configuration, the interaction luminosity keeps rising until the reverse shock propagates into the inner layers of the SN ejecta. We investigate the light curves of SNe interacting with a flatly distributed CSM in detail, incorporating the effects of photon diffusion inside the CSM into the model. We show that three physical processes - the shock breakout, the propagation of the reverse shock into the inner ejecta, and the departure of the shock from the dense CSM - predominantly determine the qualitative behaviour of the light curves. Based on the presence and precedence of these processes, the light curves of SNe interacting with flatly distributed CSM can be classified into five distinct morphological classes. We also show that our model can qualitatively reproduce doubly peaked SNe whose peaks are a few tens of days apart, such as SN 2005bf and SN 2022xxf. Our results show that the density distribution of the CSM is an important property of CSM that contributes to the diversity in light curves of interacting SNe.</description>

      <title>The [Y/Mg] chemical clock in the Galactic Disk: The influence of metallicity and Galactic population in the solar neighbourhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar ages are an important parameter to study the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. In recent years, several studies have established the existence of a relationship between chemical clocks and stellar ages. The [Y/Mg] clock is a promising technique, but there are still several open questions, such as its validity for metal-poor stars and differences between the thin and thick disk populations. Our aim is to study the behaviour of the [Y/Mg] chemical clock with stellar ages and the effect of metallicity and population on this chemical clock for a sample of solar-type disk stars. We have derived the precise stellar atmospheric parameters as well as the elemental abundances of Mg and Y through line-by-line differential spectroscopic analysis for a sample of 48 metal-poor solar-type stars based on high-quality, high-resolution ESO/HARPS spectra. From the high-precision Gaia astrometric data, stellar masses and ages were estimated through isochrone-fitting. A joint analysis of our sample, together with a sample of 185 solar-twins and analogues from our previous works, is performed to calibrate the [Y/Mg] chemical clock in the Galactic disk for $-$0.71 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $&lt;$ +0.34. Open clusters and stars with asteroseismic ages have been used to validate our relations. Two different populations could be clearly seen in the [Mg/Fe] - [Fe/H] plane - the thick and thin disks. We found a metallicity-dependent, strong anti-correlation between the [Y/Mg] ratio and stellar ages of our sample. For the first time in the literature, we report similar correlations for the thin and thick disk stars. The [Y/Mg] relation(s) found here for solar-type stars is compatible with the literature using solar-twins. Our relation provides higher accuracy and precision of 0.45 and 0.99 Gyr, respectively, comparable with the best accuracy achieved for the solar-twins till date.</description>

      <title>ALMA-IMF XIV: Free-Free Templates Derived from H$41\alpha$ and Ionized Gas Content in Fifteen Massive Protoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the H$41\alpha$ recombination line to create templates of the millimeter free-free emission in the ALMA-IMF continuum maps, which allows to separate it from dust emission. This method complements spectral-index information and extrapolation from centimeter wavelength maps. We use the derived maps to estimate the properties of up to 34 HII regions across the ALMA-IMF protoclusters. The hydrogen ionizing-photon rate $Q_0$ and spectral types follow the evolutionary trend proposed by Motte et al. The youngest protoclusters lack detectable ionized gas, followed by protoclusters with increasing numbers of OB stars. The total $Q_0$ increases from $\sim 10^{45}$ s$^{-1}$ to $&gt; 10^{49}$ s$^{-1}$. We used the adjacent He$41\alpha$ line to measure the relative number abundances of helium, finding values consistent with the Galactic interstellar medium, although a few outliers are discussed. A search for sites of maser amplification of the H$41\alpha$ line returned negative results. We looked for possible correlations between the electron densities ($n_e$), emission measures (EM), and $Q_0$ with HII region size $D$. The latter are the better correlated, with $Q_0 \propto D^{2.49\pm0.18}$. This favors interpretations where smaller ultracompact HII regions are not necessarily the less dynamically evolved versions of larger ones, but rather are ionized by less massive stars. Moderate correlations were found between dynamical width $\Delta V_\mathrm{dyn}$ with $D$ and $Q_0$. $\Delta V_\mathrm{dyn}$ increases from about one to two times the ionized-gas sound speed. Finally, an outlier HII region south of W43-MM2 is discussed. We suggest that this source could harbor an embedded stellar or disk wind.</description>

      <title>Black hole X-ray binary A0620$\unicode{x2013}$00 in quiescence: hints of Faraday rotation of near-infrared and optical polarization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present simultaneous high-precision optical polarimetric and near-infrared (NIR) to ultraviolet (UV) photometric observations of low-mass black hole X-ray binary A0620$\unicode{x2013}$00 in the quiescent state. Subtracting interstellar polarization, estimated from a sample of field stars, we derive the intrinsic polarization of A0620$\unicode{x2013}$00. We show that the intrinsic polarization degree (PD) is variable with the orbital period with the amplitude of $\sim0.3\%$ at least in the $R$ band, where the signal-to-noise ratio of our observations is the best. It implies that some fraction of the optical polarization is produced by scattering of stellar radiation off the matter that follows the black hole in its orbital motion. In addition, we see a rotation of the orbit-average intrinsic polarization angle (PA) with the wavelength from $164\deg$ in the $R$ to $180\deg$ in the $B$ band. All of the above, combined with the historical NIR to optical polarimetric observations, shows the complex behavior of average intrinsic polarization of A0620$\unicode{x2013}$00 with the PA making continuous rotation from infrared to blue band by $\sim56\deg$ in total, while the PD $\sim1\%$ remains nearly constant over the entire spectral range. The spectral dependence of the PA can be described by Faraday rotation with the rotation measure of RM=$-0.2$ rad $\mu$m$^{-2}$, implying a few Gauss magnetic field in the plasma surrounding the black hole accretion disk. However, our preferred interpretation for the peculiar wavelength dependence is the interplay between two polarized components with different PAs. Polarimetric measurements in the UV range can help distinguishing between these scenarios.</description>

      <title>The ESO SupJup Survey II: The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of three young brown dwarfs with CRIRES$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young brown dwarfs exhibit atmospheric characteristics similar to those of super-Jupiters, providing a unique opportunity to study planetary atmospheres. The ESO SupJup Survey, utilizing CRIRES$^+$ on the Very Large Telescope, aims to assess the role of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C as a formation tracer. We present observations of three young brown dwarfs: 2MASS J12003792-7845082, TWA 28, and 2MASS J08561384-1342242, with the goal of constraining their chemical compositions, thermal profiles, surface gravities, spin rotations, and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C. Atmospheric retrievals of CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra were conducted using the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS coupled with the Bayesian inference algorithm MultiNest, resulting in a detailed characterization of the atmospheres of these objects. We report the volume mixing ratios of main molecular and atomic species, including the novel detection of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in a brown dwarf's atmosphere, and determine $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values of $81^{+28}_{-19}$ and $79^{+20}_{-14}$ in the atmospheres of TWA 28 and J0856, respectively, with strong significance ($&gt;3\sigma$). Tentative evidence ($\sim 2\sigma$) of $^{13}$C in J1200 was found, with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = $114^{+69}_{-33}$, along with $^{18}$O detected at moderate significance in J0856 (3.3$\sigma$) and TWA 28 (2.1$\sigma$). The retrieved thermal profiles indicate hot atmospheres (2300-2600 K) with low surface gravities and slow spins, consistent with young objects. The consistent carbon isotope ratios among the three objects, showing no significant deviation from the local ISM, suggest a fragmentation-based formation mechanism similar to star formation. The tentative detection of $^{18}$O in two objects highlights the potential of high-resolution spectroscopy to probe additional isotope ratios, such as $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O, in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters.</description>

      <title>Discovery of MgS and NaS in the Interstellar Medium and tentative detection of CaO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first detection of the metal-bearing molecules sodium sulfide (NaS) and magnesium sulfide (MgS) and the tentative detection of calcium monoxide (CaO) in the interstellar medium (ISM) towards the Galactic Center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. The derived column densities are (5.0+-1.1) x $10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, (6.0+-0.6) x $10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, and (2.0+-0.5) x $10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. This translates into fractional abundances with respect to H$_2$ of (3.7+-1.0) x $10^{-13}$, (4.4+-0.8) x $10^{-13}$, and (1.5+-0.4) x $10^{-13}$, respectively. We have also searched for other Na-, Mg- and Ca-bearing species towards this source but none of them have been detected and thus we provide upper limits for their abundances. We discuss the possible chemical routes involved in the formation of these molecules containing metals under interstellar conditions. Finally, we compare the ratio between sulfur-bearing and oxygen-bearing molecules with and without metals, finding that metal-bearing sulfur molecules are much more abundant than metal-bearing oxygen ones, in contrast with the general trend found in the ratios between other non metal- oxygen- and sulfur-bearing molecules. This further strengthen the idea that sulfur may be little depleted in G+0.693-0.027 as a result of the low velocity shocks present in this source sputtering large amounts of material from dust grains.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Fine-Features of Nuclear Equation of State from Future Neutron Star Radius Measurements to 0.1km Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To more precisely constrain the Equation of State (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich nuclear matter, future high-precision X-ray and gravitational wave observatories are proposed to measure the radii of neutron stars (NSs) with an accuracy better than about 0.1 km. However, it remains unclear what particular aspects (other than the stiffness generally spoken of in the literature) of the EOS and to what precision they will be better constrained. In this work, within a Bayesian framework using a meta-model EOS for NSs, we infer the posterior probability distribution functions (PDFs) of incompressibility $K_{0}$ and skewness $J_{0}$ of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) as well as the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ characterizing the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, respectively, from mean values of NS radii consistent with existing observations and an expected accuracy $\Delta R$ ranging from about 1.0 km to 0.1 km. We found that (1) the $\Delta R$ has little effect on inferring the stiffness of SNM at suprasaturation densities, (2) smaller $\Delta R$ reveals more accurately not only the PDFs but also pairwise correlations among parameters characterizing high-density $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, (3) a double-peak feature of the PDF($K_{\rm{sym}}$) corresponding to the strong $K_{\rm{sym}}-J_{\rm{sym}}$ and $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ anti-correlations is revealed when $\Delta R$ is less than about 0.2 km, (4) the high-precision radius measurement for canonical NSs is more useful than that for massive ones for constraining the EOS of nucleonic matter around (2-3) times the saturation density of SNM.</description>

      <title>High-resolution Elemental Abundance Measurements of Cool JWST Planet Hosts Using AutoSpecFit: An Application to the Sub-Neptune K2-18b's Host M dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an in-depth, high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of the M dwarf K2-18 that hosts a sub-Neptune exoplanet in its habitable zone. We show our technique to accurately normalize the observed spectrum, which is crucial for a proper spectral fitting. We also introduce a new automatic, line-by-line model-fitting code, AutoSpecFit, that performs an iterative ${\chi}^{2}$ minimization process to measure individual elemental abundances of cool dwarfs. We apply this code to the star K2-18, and measure the abundance of 10 elements - C, O, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, and Fe. We find these abundances moderately supersolar, except for Fe with a slightly subsolar abundance. The accuracy of the inferred abundances is limited by the systematic errors due to uncertain stellar parameters. We also derive the abundance ratios associated with several planet-building elements such as Al/Mg, Ca/Mg, Fe/Mg, and (a solar-like) C/O=0.568 $\pm$ 0.026, which can be used to constrain the chemical composition and the formation location of the exoplanet. On the other hand, the planet K2-18 b has attracted considerable interest, given the JWST measurements of its atmospheric composition. Early JWST studies reveal an unusual chemistry for the atmosphere of this planet, which is unlikely to be driven by formation in a disk of unusual composition. The comparison between the chemical abundances of K2-18 b from future JWST analyses and those of the host star can provide fundamental insights into the formation of this planetary system.</description>

      <title>Understanding the effects of spacecraft trajectories through solar coronal mass ejection flux ropes using 3DCOREweb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of spacecraft positioning and trajectory on in situ signatures of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Employing the 3DCORE model, a 3D flux rope model that can generate in situ profiles for any given point in space and time, we conduct forward modeling to analyze such signatures for various latitudinal and longitudinal positions, with respect to the flux rope apex, at 0.8~au. Using this approach, we explore the appearance of the resulting in situ profiles for different flux rope types, with different handedness and inclination angles, for both high and low twist CMEs. Our findings reveal that CMEs exhibit distinct differences in signatures between apex hits and flank encounters, with the latter displaying elongated profiles with reduced rotation. However, constant, non-rotating in situ signatures are only observed for flank encounters of low twist CMEs, suggesting the existence of untwisted magnetic field lines within CME legs. Additionally, our study confirms the unambiguous appearance of different flux rope types in in situ signatures, contributing to the broader understanding and interpretation of observational data. Given the model assumptions, this may refute trajectory effects to be the cause for mismatching flux rope types as identified in solar signatures. While acknowledging limitations inherent in our model, such as the assumption of constant twist and non-deformable torus-like shape, we still draw relevant conclusions within the context of global magnetic field structures of CMEs and the potential for distinguishing flux rope types based on in situ observations.</description>

      <title>Spin-Flavor Precession Phase Effects in Supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06926v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the phase effects driven by neutrino magnetic moment for Majorana neutrinos in a core collapse supernova. A neutrino with a large magnetic moment is emitted in a superposition of energy eigenstates from the neutrinosphere. These energy eigenstates can interfere to create a phase effect at a partially adiabatic spin flavor precession (SFP) resonance. We examine the dependence of the SFP phase effect on the size of the neutrino magnetic moment as well as its variation with the post bounce time. In particular, at late post-bounce times the SFP resonance becomes wider and eventually overlaps with the Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) resonance. At this point, Landau-Zener criteria for adiabaticity can no longer be applied to individual resonances, but we show that SFP phase effect is still present after the overlap. We also discuss the observability of the SFP phase effect at late post bounce times where it is more likely to make an impact. Our analysis for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) reveals that at low energies event rates do not fluctuate despite the presence of a sizable SFP phase effect. We find larger event rate fluctuations at high energies, but these fluctuations are also erased in the energy spectra of the observed charged leptons. A more refined treatment of electron fraction and the inclusion of neutrino-neutrino interactions may change our conclusions for observability in future studies.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Radiation Hydrodynamics Simulations of Supernova 1987A Shock Breakout</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shock breakout is the first electromagnetic signal from supernovae (SNe), which contains important information on the explosion energy and the size and chemical composition of the progenitor star. This paper presents the first two-dimensional (2D) multi-wavelength radiation hydrodynamics simulations of SN 1987A shock breakout by using the $\texttt{CASTRO}$ code with the opacity table, $\texttt{OPAL}$, considering eight photon groups from infrared to X-ray. To investigate the impact of the pre-supernova environment of SN 1987A, we consider three possible circumstellar medium (CSM) environments: a steady wind, an eruptive mass loss, and the existence of a companion star. In sum, the resulting breakout light curve has an hour duration and its peak luminosity of $\sim 6\times 10^{46}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ then following a decay rate of $\sim 3.5\,\rm{mag\,hour^{-1}}$ in X-ray. The dominant band transits to UV around 3 hours after the initial breakout, and its luminosity has a decay rate of $\sim 1.5\,\rm{mag\,hour^{-1}}$ that agrees well with the observed shock breakout tail. The detailed features of breakout emission are sensitive to the pre-explosion environment. Furthermore, our 2D simulations demonstrate the importance of multidimensional mixing and its impacts on shock dynamics and radiation emission. The mixing emerging from the shock breakout may lead to a global asymmetry of SN ejecta and affect its later supernova remnant formation.</description>

      <title>Eddington envelopes: The fate of stars on parabolic orbits tidally disrupted by supermassive black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stars falling too close to massive black holes in the centres of galaxies can be torn apart by the strong tidal forces. Simulating the subsequent feeding of the black hole with disrupted material has proved challenging because of the range of timescales involved. Here we report a set of simulations that capture the relativistic disruption of the star, followed by one year of evolution of the returning debris stream. These reveal the formation of an expanding asymmetric bubble of material extending to hundreds of astronomical units -- an outflowing Eddington envelope with an optically thick inner region. Such envelopes have been hypothesised as the reprocessing layer needed to explain optical/UV emission in tidal disruption events, but never produced self-consistently in a simulation. Our model broadly matches the observed light curves with low temperatures, faint luminosities, and line widths of 10,000--20,000 km/s.</description>

Abstract: Context. The star-black hole (S-BH) binary known as Gaia BH3, discovered by the Gaia Collaboration is chemically and kinematically associated with the metal-poor ED-2 stream in the Milky Way halo.
  Aims. We explore the possibility that Gaia BH3 was assembled dynamically in the progenitor globular cluster (GC) of the ED-2 stream.
  Methods. We used a public suite of star-by-star dynamical Monte Carlo models to identify S-BH binaries in GCs with different initial masses and (half-mass) radii.
  Results. We show that a likely progenitor of the ED-2 stream was a relatively low-mass ($\lesssim10^5M_\odot$) GC with an initial half-mass radius of ~4 pc. Such a GC can dynamically retain a large fraction of its BH population and dissolve on the orbit of ED-2. From the suite of models we find that GCs produce ~ 3 - 30 S-BH binaries, approximately independent of initial GC mass and inversely correlated with initial cluster radius. Scaling the results to the Milky Way GC population, we find that ~75% of the S-BH binaries formed in GCs are ejected from their host GC, all in the early phases of evolution ($\lesssim1$ Gyr); these are expected to no longer be close to streams. The ~25% of S-BH binaries retained until dissolution are expected to form part of streams, such that for an initial mass of the progenitor of ED-2 of a few $10^4M_\odot$, we expect ~2-3 S-BH to end up in the stream. GC models with metallicities similar to Gaia BH3 ($\lesssim1\%$ solar) include S-BH binaries with similar BH masses ($\gtrsim30M_\odot$), orbital periods, and eccentricities.
  Conclusions. We predict the Galactic halo contains of order $10^5$ S-BH binaries that formed dynamically in GCs, a fraction of which may readily be detected in Gaia DR4. The detection of these sources provides valuable tests of BH dynamics in clusters and the possible role in formation of gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>Approaching the conformal limit of quark matter with different chemical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the influence of different chemical potentials (baryon, charged, strange, and neutrino) on how and how fast a free gas of quarks in the zero-temperature limit reaches the conformal limit. We discuss the influence of non-zero masses, the inclusion of leptons, and different constraints, such as charge neutrality, zero-net strangeness, and fixed lepton fraction. We also investigate for the first time how the symmetry energy of the system under some of these conditions approaches the conformal limit. Finally, we briefly discuss what kind of corrections are expected from perturbative QCD as one goes away from the conformal limit.</description>
