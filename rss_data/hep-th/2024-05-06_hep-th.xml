      <title>Gluon Mass Generation from Renormalons and Resurgence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a link between the concepts of infrared renormalons, infrared fixed point, and dynamical nonperturbative mass generation of gluons in pure Yang-Mills theories. By utilizing recent results in the resurgent analysis of renormalons through non-linear ordinary differential equations, we develop a new description for the gluon propagator, thereby realizing the Schwinger mechanism. Specifically, this approach leads to a nonperturbative, dynamic mass generation for Yang-Mills gauge bosons in the deep infrared region, a phenomenon closely associated with color confinement. Furthermore, we present arguments about the limit of applicability of the Borel-Ecalle resummation of the renormalons by comparing it with the Kallen-Lehman representation of the gluon propagator.</description>

      <title>Celestial strings: field theory, conformally soft limits, and mapping the worldsheet onto the celestial sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the celestial correlators corresponding to tree-level 5-gluon amplitudes in the type I superstring theory. Since celestial correlation functions are obtained by integrating over the full range of energies, there is no obvious analog of the $\alpha' \to 0$ limit in this basis. This is manifestly shown by a factorization of the $\alpha '$ dependence in the celestial string amplitudes. Consequently, the question arises as to how the field theory limit is recovered from string theory in the celestial basis. This problem has been addressed in the literature for the case of 4-gluon amplitudes at tree level, where the forward scattering limit of the stringy factor was identified as a limit in which celestial Yang-Mills 4-point function is recovered. Here, we extend the analysis to the case with five gluons, for which the string moduli space allows for more types of limits, thus allowing to investigate this aspect in more detail. Based on celestial data only, we study the regime in which one arrives at the correct celestial field theory limit. We also study other properties of the celestial string amplitudes, namely, the conformally soft theorem, effective field theory expansion in the conformal basis, and a map that arises in the regime of high-energy/large-scaling dimension that connects the punctured string worldsheet to the insertion of primary operators in the celestial CFT for the massless $n$-point string amplitude.</description>

      <title>A chiral limit for Chern-Simons-matter theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large N quasi-fermionic Chern-Simons-matter theories have an approximate higher-spin symmetry that strongly constrains their correlation functions. In particular, the 3-point functions for generic spins are combinations of 3 structures (with specific dependence on the positions and helicities), and the coupling-dependence of the coefficient of each structure is uniquely determined. In the past few years, several relations between different structures were found. In this paper we show that all the relations between the structures follow from (or, conversely, they imply) a specific form written by Skvortsov for the vertices of the dual higher-spin gravity theory on four-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, when written in spinor-helicity variables. The dual bulk theory has a specific limit where it simplifies and becomes a "chiral higher-spin gravity theory", and we discuss what can be said about this limit in the dual Chern-Simons-matter theories, where it involves an analytic continuation to complex couplings.</description>

      <title>A Walk Through $Spin(1,d+1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct unitary irreducible representation of the de Sitter group, that forms the basis for the study of $dS_{d+1}$ QFT. Using the intertwining kernel analysis, we discuss bosonic symmetric tensor, and fermionic higher-spinors. Particular care is given to the structure and construction of exceptional series and fermionic operators. We discuss the discrete series, and explain how and why the exceptional series give rise to seemingly non-invariant correlators in de Sitter. Using tools from Clifford analysis, we show that for $d&gt;3$, there are no exceptional fermionic representations, and so no unitary (higher)-gravitino fields. We also consider the structure of representations for $d=3$ and $d=2$, as relevant for the study of $dS_4$, the only space allowing for unitary gravitino and its generalisation, and of $dS_3$.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov exponents and geodesic stability of Schwarzschild black hole in the non-coomutative gauge theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of geodesic motion for both massive and massless particles using Lyapunov exponents in the non-commutative (NC) Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) via the gauge theory of gravity. As a first step, we investigate the both time-like and null radial motion of particles, the mean result in NC geometry shows that the particles take infinity proper time to reach the NC singularity (infinite time affine parameter framework for photons). The proper/coordinate time of Lyapunov exponents and their ratio of time-like geodesic for the circular motion of this black hole shows a new behavior, which describes a new range of stable circular orbits between unstable ones. Then we analyze the circular motion of photons, where the result shows a new photon sphere near the event horizon which is not allowed in the commutative case, and the Lyapunov exponent is expressed in this geometry, where this confirms the instability of the outer photon sphere and the stability of the inner one. Finally, we check the effect of the non-commutativity on the shadow radius of the SBH, where we show the similarity between the non-commutativity and the black hole mass.</description>

      <title>"Observables" in de Sitter Quantum Gravity: in Perturbation Theory and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A review of some errors made by the author and others in their search for quantum models of gravity in cosmological space-times that asymptote to de Sitter (dS) space in the future. The "static de Sitter Hamiltonian", which measures the energy of localized objects in a static patch, is not a conserved quantity. The static time translation diffeomorphism of eternal dS space is a gauge symmetry, and the static energy is an approximate property of meta-stable constrained states. It's not clear whether a theoretical model has to have a time independent Hamiltonian at all, but if it does, its eigenvalues are, {\it in principle}, not accessible to measurement by local detectors.</description>

      <title>Stability of Axion-Saxion wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider the perturbative stability of Euclidean axion wormholes. The quadratic action that governs linear perturbations is derived directly in Euclidean gravity. We demonstrate explicitly that a stability analysis in which one treats the axion as a normal two-form gauge field is equivalent to one performed in the Hodge-dual formulation, where one considers the axion as a scalar with a wrong-sign kinetic term. Both analyses indicate that axion wormholes are perturbatively stable, even in the presence of a massless dilaton, or saxion, field that couples to the axion.</description>

      <title>Lectures on Resurgence in Integrable Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been recently considerable progress in understanding the nature of perturbation theory in UV free and gapped $2d$ integrable field theories with renormalon singularities. Thanks to Bethe ansatz and large $N$ techniques, non-perturbative corrections can also be computed and lead to the reconstruction of the trans-series for the free energy in presence of a chemical potential. This is an ideal arena to test resurgence in QFT and determine if and how the exact result can be reconstructed from the knowledge of the perturbative series only. In these notes we give a pedagogical introduction to this subject starting from the basics. In the first lecture we give an overview of applications in QFT of Borel resummations before the advent of resurgence. The second lecture introduces the key concepts of resurgence and finally in the third lecture we discuss a specific application in the context of the principal chiral field model. Extended version of three lectures given at IHES and review talks given at Les Diablerets and Mainz, in 2023.</description>

      <title>Comparing the decoherence effects due to black holes versus ordinary matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently a certain thought experiment was discussed which involves the decoherence of a quantum system due to a black hole. Here we show how this phenomenon is consistent with standard ideas about quantum black holes. In other words, modeling the black hole as a quantum system at finite temperature one obtains the same answer. We demonstrate this by analyzing the problem in terms of an effective theory that can apply both for the black hole case and for an ordinary matter system, showing that the same qualitative effect is present for ordinary matter at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Reviving Horndeski after GW170817 by Kaluza-Klein compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of Horndeski theory/ Galileons for late time cosmology is heavily constrained by the strict coincidence in the speed of propagation of gravitational and electromagnetic waves. These constraints presuppose that the minimally coupled photon is not modified, not even at the scales where General Relativity (GR) may need modification. We find that the 4D Galileon obtained from a Kaluza-Klein compactification of its higher dimensional version is a natural unified modification of GR and electromagnetism with automatically "luminal" gravitational waves. This property follows without any fine tuning of Galileon potentials for a larger class of theories than previously thought. In particular, the $G_4$ potential is not constrained by the speed test and $G_5$ may also be present. In other words, some Galileon models that have been ruled out since the event GW170817 are, in fact, not necessarily constrained if they arise in 4D from compactifications of their higher dimensional Galileon counterparts. Besides their compelling luminality, the resulting vector Galileons are naturally $U(1)$ gauge invariant.</description>

      <title>Modified $f(Q)$ gravity models and their cosmological consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider three different $f(Q)$ models, such as power-law, exponential, and logarithmic, to study which model better mimics $\Lambda$CDM evolution theoretically. Henceforth, we determine solutions to the $f(Q)$ gravity field equations in the isotropic and homogeneous universe. Since all the models contain two model parameters, we reduce the degrees of freedom using the first Friedman equation at the present time. Further, we check the behavior of cosmological parameters using the obtained solution to the field equations and compare it with the $\Lambda$CDM model. As a result, the power-law model shows a good match with $\Lambda$CDM model for $\lambda=-1$ and $\lambda=-2$, while the exponential model behaves well for the range $5\le \beta&lt;11$, and the logarithmic model matches for $3.8&lt;\gamma&lt;4.4$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Freezing in Exactly Solvable Models of Driven Chaotic Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive, non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However, in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals. The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a high-frequency expansion.</description>

      <title>Spectral form factor in chaotic, localized, and integrable open quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the spectral statistics of open quantum many-body systems (OQMBS) as signatures of quantum chaos (or the lack thereof), using the dissipative spectral form factor (DSFF), a generalization of the spectral form factor to complex spectra. We show that the DSFF of chaotic OQMBS generically displays the $\textit{quadratic}$ ramp-plateau behaviour of the Ginibre ensemble from random matrix theory, in contrast to the linear ramp-plateau behaviour of the Gaussian ensemble in closed quantum systems. Furthermore, in the presence of many-body interactions, such RMT behaviour emerges only after a time scale $\tau_{\mathrm{dev}}$, which generally increases with system size for sufficiently large system size, and can be identified as the non-Hermitian analogue of the $\textit{many-body Thouless time}$. The universality of the random matrix theory behavior is demonstrated by surveying twelve models of OQMBS, including random Kraus circuits (quantum channels) and random Lindbladians (Liouvillians) in several symmetry classes, as well as Lindbladians of paradigmatic models such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK), XXZ, and the transverse field Ising models. We devise an unfolding and filtering procedure to remove variations of the averaged density of states which would otherwise hide the universal RMT-like signatures in the DSFF for chaotic OQMBS. Beyond chaotic OQMBS, we study the spectral statistics of non-chaotic OQMBS, specifically the integrable XX model and a system in the many-body localized (MBL) regime in the presence of dissipation, which exhibit DSFF behaviours distinct from the ramp-plateau behaviour of random matrix theory. Lastly, we study the DSFF of Lindbladians with the Hamiltonian term set to zero, i.e. only the jump operators are present, and demonstrate that the results of RMT universality and scaling of many-body Thouless time survive even without coherent evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study universal chaotic dynamics of a large class of periodically driven critical systems described by spatially inhomogeneous conformal field theories. By employing an effective curved spacetime approach, we show that the onset of quantum chaotic correlations, captured by the Lyapunov exponent of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), is set by the Hawking temperature of emergent Floquet horizons. Furthermore, scrambling of quantum information is shown to be strongly inhomogeneous, leading to transitions from chaotic to non-chaotic regimes by tuning driving parameters. We finally use our framework to propose a concrete protocol to simulate and measure OTOCs in quantum simulators, by designing an efficient stroboscopic backward time evolution.</description>

      <title>On the (in)consistency of perturbation theory at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known difficulty of perturbative approaches to quantum field theory at finite temperature is the necessity to address theoretical constraints that are not present in the vacuum theory. In this work, we use lattice simulations of scalar correlation functions in massive $\phi^{4}$ theory to analyse the extent to which these constraints affect the perturbative predictions. We find that the standard perturbative predictions deteriorate even in the absence of infrared divergences at relatively low temperatures, and that this is directly connected to the analytic structure of the propagators used in the expansion. This suggests that the incorporation of non-perturbative thermal effects in the propagators is essential for a consistent perturbative formulation of scalar quantum field theories at finite temperature. By utilising the spectral constraints imposed on finite-temperature correlation functions, we explore how these effects manifest themselves in the lattice data, and discuss why the presence of distinct thermoparticle excitations provides a potential resolution to these issues.</description>

      <title>The effective field theory of multi-field inflationary fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build an effective field theory of multi-field inflationary fluctuations based on the adiabatic perturbation and on any number of matter fluctuations in the non-adiabatic sector, without imposing extra symmetries on the latter. Focusing on terms with at most two derivatives in fields' fluctuations, we argue that taking the decoupling limit -- in which gravitational interactions are neglected -- is justified in a quasi de Sitter spacetime with slow-varying Hubble scale. With these working hypotheses, we find simple forms of multi-field mixings (quadratic order) and interactions (cubic order). We explain how to break degeneracies amongst various terms, and we compare the predictions of the effective field theory to those of non-linear sigma models of inflation and more general multi-field Lagrangian in the traditional model approach. We stress that several multi-field cubic interactions are dictated by non-linearly realised spacetime symmetries and are therefore given in terms of parameters already present in the quadratic action. We propose various directions to systematically explore the phenomenology generic to multi-field inflation and beyond the lamppost of known models.</description>

      <title>Relic gravitons and non-stationary processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stationary processes do not accurately describe the diffuse backgrounds of relic gravitons whose correlations are homogeneous in space (i.e. only dependent upon the distance between the two spatial locations) but not in time. The symmetries of the autocorrelations ultimately reflect the quantum mechanical origin of the diffuse backgrounds and lead to non-stationary observables at late time. In particular, large oscillations are believed to arise in the spectral energy density that is customarily (but approximately) related to the tensor power spectrum. When the full expression of the spectral energy density is employed the amplitudes of oscillation are instead suppressed in the large-scale limit and the non-stationary features of the late-time signal practically disappear. For similar reasons the relations between the spectral energy density and the spectral amplitude are ambiguous in the presence of non-stationary features. While it is debatable if the non-stationary features are (or will be) directly detectable, we argue that the spectral amplitude following from the Wiener-Khintchine theorem is generally inappropriate for a consistent description of the relic signal. Nevertheless the strong oscillatory behaviour of the late-time observables is naturally smeared out provided the spectral energy density is selected as pivotal variable.</description>

      <title>Natural disorder distributions from measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider scenarios where the dynamics of a quantum system are partially determined by prior local measurements of some interacting environmental degrees of freedom. The resulting effective system dynamics are described by a disordered Hamiltonian, with spacetime-varying parameter values drawn from distributions that are generically neither flat nor Gaussian. This class of scenarios is a natural extension of those where a fully non-dynamical environmental degree of freedom determines a universal coupling constant for the system. Using a family of quasi-exactly solvable anharmonic oscillators, we consider environmental ground states of nonlinearly coupled degrees of freedom, unrestricted by a weak coupling expansion, which include strongly quantum non-Gaussian states. We derive the properties of distributions for both quadrature and photon number measurements. Measurement-induced disorder of this kind is likely realizable in laboratory quantum systems and, given a notion of naturally occurring measurement, suggests a new class of scenarios for the dynamics of quantum systems in particle physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Unitarity in the non-relativistic regime and implications for dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unitarity sets upper limits on partial-wave elastic and inelastic cross-sections, which are often violated by perturbative computations. We discuss the dynamics underlying these limits in the non-relativistic regime, namely long-range interactions, and show how the resummation of the elastic 2-particle-irreducible diagrams arising from squaring inelastic processes unitarizes inelastic cross-sections. Our results are model-independent, apply to all partial waves, and affect elastic and inelastic cross-sections, with extensive implications for new physics scenarios, including dark-matter freeze-out and self-interactions.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics on a noncommutative plane through the lens of deformation quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A gauge invariant mathematical formalism based on deformation quantization is outlined to model an $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric system of a spin $1/2$ charged particle placed in a nocommutative plane under the influence of a vertical uniform magnetic field. The noncommutative involutive algebra $(C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{2})[[\vartheta]],*^r)$ of formal power series in $\vartheta$ with coefficients in the commutative ring $C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ was employed to construct the relevant observables, viz., SUSY Hamiltonian $H$, supercharge operator $Q$ and its adjoint $Q^{\dag}$ all belonging to the $2\times 2$ matrix algebra $\mathcal{M}_{2}(C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{2})[[\vartheta]],*^r)$ with the help of a family of gauge-equivalent star products $*^{r}$. The energy eigenvalues of the SUSY Hamiltonian all turned out to be independent of not only the gauge parameter $r$ but also the noncommutativity parameter $\vartheta$. The nontrivial Fermionic ground state was subsequently computed associated with the zero energy which indicates that supersymmetry remains unbroken in all orders of $\vartheta$. The Witten index for the noncommutative SUSY Landau problem turns out to be $-1$ corroborating the fact that there is no broken supersymmetry for the model we are considering.</description>

Abstract: In this letter we use the thermodynamics of a passive fluid to constrain transport in the corresponding active fluid which is subsequently described by the Toner-Tu equations. Acknowledging that the system fundamentally breaks boost symmetry we compel what were previously entirely phenomenological parameters in the Toner-Tu model to satisfy precise relationships among themselves. Consequently, we determine exact scalings for the transport coefficients under dynamical renormalisation group flow that reproduce the results of recent simulations.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the problem of classification and explicit construction of the conformal three-point correlation functions of currents of arbitrary integer spin in arbitrary dimensions. For the conserved currents, we set up the equations for the conservation conditions and solve them completely for some values of spins, confirming the earlier counting of the number of independent structures matching them with the higher-spin cubic vertices in one higher dimension. The general solution for the correlators of conserved currents we delegate to a follow-up work.</description>

      <title>A Long Exact Sequence in Symmetry Breaking: order parameter constraints, defect anomaly-matching, and higher Berry phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study defects in symmetry breaking phases, such as domain walls, vortices, and hedgehogs. In particular, we focus on the localized gapless excitations which sometimes occur at the cores of these objects. These are topologically protected by an 't Hooft anomaly. We classify different symmetry breaking phases in terms of the anomalies of these defects, and relate them to the anomaly of the broken symmetry by an anomaly-matching formula. We also derive the obstruction to the existence of a symmetry breaking phase with a local defect. We obtain these results using a long exact sequence of groups of invertible field theories, which we call the "symmetry breaking long exact sequence" (SBLES). The mathematical backbone of the SBLES is studied in a companion paper. Our work further develops the theory of higher Berry phase and its bulk-boundary correspondence, and serves as a new computational tool for classifying symmetry protected topological phases.</description>

      <title>Complexity in Tame Quantum Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the notion that physical systems can contain only a finite amount of information or complexity, we introduce a framework that allows for quantifying the amount of logical information needed to specify a function or set. We then apply this methodology to a variety of physical systems and derive the complexity of parameter-dependent physical observables and coupling functions appearing in effective Lagrangians. In order to implement these ideas, it is essential to consider physical theories that can be defined in an o-minimal structure. O-minimality, a concept from mathematical logic, encapsulates a tameness principle. It was recently argued that this property is inherent to many known quantum field theories and is linked to the UV completion of the theory. To assign a complexity to each statement in these theories one has to further constrain the allowed o-minimal structures. To exemplify this, we show that many physical systems can be formulated using Pfaffian o-minimal structures, which have a well-established notion of complexity. More generally, we propose adopting sharply o-minimal structures, recently introduced by Binyamini and Novikov, as an overarching framework to measure complexity in quantum theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paradigmatic example of deconfined quantum criticality is the Neel-VBS phase transition. The continuum description of this transition is the $N=2$ case of the $CP^{N-1}$ model, which is a field theory of $N$ complex scalars in 3d coupled to an Abelian gauge field with $SU(N)\times U(1)$ global symmetry. Lattice studies and duality arguments suggest the global symmetry of the $CP^1$ model is enhanced to $SO(5)$. We perform a conformal bootstrap study of $SO(5)$ invariant fixed points with one relevant $SO(5)$ singlet operator, which would correspond to two relevant $SU(2)\times U(1)$ singlets, i.e. a tricritical point. We find that the bootstrap bounds are saturated by four different predictions from the large $N$ computation of monopole operator scaling dimensions, which were recently shown to be very accurate even for small $N$. This suggests that the Neel-VBS phase transition is described by this bootstrap bound, which predicts that the second relevant singlet has dimension $\approx 2.36$.</description>

      <title>The Baker-Coon-Romans $N$-point amplitude and an exact field theory limit of the Coon amplitude</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $N$-point Coon amplitude discovered first by Baker and Coon in the 1970s and then again independently by Romans in the 1980s. This Baker-Coon-Romans (BCR) amplitude retains several properties of tree-level string amplitudes, namely duality and factorization, with a $q$-deformed version of the string spectrum. Although the formula for the $N$-point BCR amplitude is only valid for ${q &gt; 1}$, the four-point case admits a straightforward extension to all ${q \geq 0}$ which reproduces the usual expression for the four-point Coon amplitude. At five points, there are inconsistencies with factorization when pushing ${q &lt; 1}$. Despite these issues, we find a new relation between the five-point BCR amplitude and Cheung and Remmen's four-point basic hypergeometric amplitude, placing the latter within the broader family of Coon amplitudes. Finally, we compute the $q \to \infty$ limit of the $N$-point BCR amplitudes and discover an exact correspondence between these amplitudes and the field theory amplitudes of a scalar transforming in the adjoint representation of a global symmetry group with an infinite set of non-derivative single-trace interaction terms. This correspondence at $q = \infty$ is the first definitive realization of the Coon amplitude (in any limit) from a field theory described by an explicit Lagrangian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the implication of the distance and the cobordism conjecture on the 6-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory compactified on $S^2$. In this toy model, the radion potential is stabilized by the conspiracy of the curvature of $S^2$ and the flux through $S^2$ parametrized by $f$, and uplifted by the positive 6-dimensional cosmological constant parametrized by $\lambda$. When $\lambda=0$, the radion is stabilized at the anti-de Sitter (AdS) vacuum, which cannot be interpolated to the Minkowski vacuum since the Kaluza-Klein (KK) tower descends from UV in the vanishing limit of the 4-dimensional cosmological constant. For nonzero $\lambda$ which realizes the metastable de Sitter (dS) vacuum, as well as the AdS and the Minkowski vacuum, such an obstruction can be found provided the combination $f^2\lambda$ is fixed and the limit $\lambda\to 0$ is taken. Moreover, the 6-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory allows the transition between vacua through the nucleation of the bubble. In this case, the values of the 4-dimensional cosmological constant inside and outside the bubble are different as $f$ is changed at the bubble wall, while $\lambda$ remains unchanged. Regarding the AdS vacuum with the vanishing curvature radius as the `nothing', we find that the transition from the metastable dS vacuum to the nothing is not prevented by the descent of the KK tower since $f^2\lambda$ is not fixed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following a recent proposal to describe inelastic eikonal scattering processes in terms of gravitationally dressed elastic eikonal amplitudes, we motivate a collinear double graviton dressing and investigate its properties. This is derived from a generalized Wilson line operator in the worldline formalism by integrating over fluctuations of the eikonal trajectories of external particles in gravitationally interacting theories. The dressing can be expressed as a product of exponential terms -- a coherent piece with contributions to all odd orders in the gravitational coupling constant and a term quadratic in graviton modes, with the former providing classical gravitational wave observables. In particular, the coherent dressing involves $\mathcal{O}(\kappa^3)$ subleading double graviton corrections to the Weinberg soft factor. We use this dressing to derive expressions for the waveform, radiative momentum spectrum and angular momentum. In a limiting case of the waveform, we derive the nonlinear memory effect resulting from the emission of nearly soft gravitons from a scattering process.</description>

Abstract: We study thermodynamic phase transitions between integrable and chaotic dynamics. We do so by analyzing models that interpolate between the chaotic double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) and the integrable $p$-spin systems, in a limit where they are described by chord diagrams. We develop a path integral formalism by coarse graining over the diagrams, which we use to argue that the system has two distinct phases: one is continuously connected to the chaotic system, and the other to the integrable. They are separated by a line of first order transition that ends at a critical point.</description>

Abstract: We study transitions from chaotic to integrable Hamiltonians in the double scaled SYK and $p$-spin systems. The dynamics of our models is described by chord diagrams with two species. We begin by developing a path integral formalism of coarse graining chord diagrams with a single species of chords, which has the same equations of motion as the bi-local ($G\Sigma$) Liouville action, yet appears otherwise to be different and in particular well defined. We then develop a similar formalism for two types of chords, allowing us to study different types of deformations of double scaled SYK and in particular a deformation by an integrable Hamiltonian. The system has two distinct thermodynamic phases: one is continuously connected to the chaotic SYK Hamiltonian, the other is continuously connected to the integrable Hamiltonian, separated at low temperature by a first order phase transition. We also analyze the phase diagram for generic deformations, which in some cases includes a zero-temperature phase transition.</description>

Abstract: Nucleation rate computations are of broad importance in particle physics and cosmology. Perturbative calculations are often used to compute the nucleation rate $\Gamma$, but these are incomplete. We perform nonperturbative lattice simulations of nucleation in a scalar field theory with a tree-level barrier, computing a final result extrapolated to the thermodynamic and continuum limits. Although the system in question should be well-described by a complete one-loop perturbative calculation, we find only qualitative agreement with the full perturbative result, with a 20% discrepancy in $|\log \Gamma|$. Our result motivates further testing of the current nucleation paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by a network of cosmic strings using six millisecond pulsars from Data Release 2 (DR2) of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA). We perform a Bayesian analysis considering two models for the network of cosmic string loops, and compare it to a simple power-law model which is expected from the population of supermassive black hole binaries. Our main strong assumption is that the previously reported common red noise process is a SGWB. We find that the one-parameter cosmic string model is slightly favored over a power-law model thanks to its simplicity. If we assume a two-component stochastic signal in the data (supermassive black hole binary population and the signal from cosmic strings), we get a $95\%$ upper limit on the string tension of $\log_{10}(G\mu) &lt; -9.9$ ($-10.5$) for the two cosmic string models we consider. In extended two-parameter string models, we were unable to constrain the number of kinks. We test two approximate and fast Bayesian data analysis methods against the most rigorous analysis and find consistent results. These two fast and efficient methods are applicable to all SGWBs, independent of their source, and will be crucial for analysis of extended data sets.</description>

      <title>Entanglement negativity between separated regions in quantum critical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15273v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement between disjoint subregions in quantum critical systems through the lens of the logarithmic negativity. We work with systems in arbitrary dimensions, including conformal field theories and their corresponding lattice Hamiltonians, as well as resonating valence-bond states. At small separations, the logarithmic negativity is big and displays universal behavior, but we show non-perturbatively that it decays faster than any power at large separations. This can already be seen in the minimal setting of single-spin subregions. The corresponding absence of distillable entanglement at large separations generalizes the 1d result, and indicates that quantum critical groundstates do not possess long-range bipartite entanglement, at least for bosons. For systems with fermions, a more suitable definition of the logarithmic negativity exists that takes into account fermion parity, and we show that it decays algebraically. Along the way we obtain general results for the moments of the partially transposed density matrix.</description>

      <title>The effective potential of composite operator in the first order region of QCD phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to determine the effective potential of QCD from the gap equation, by introducing the homotopy method between the solutions of the equation of motion. Via this method, the effective potential beyond the bare vertex approximation is obtained, which then generalizes the Cornwall, Jackiw and Tomboulis (CJT) effective potential for the bilocal composite operators. Moreover, the extended effective potential is set to be a function of self energy instead of the propagator, which is the key point for the potential to be bounded from below. We then investigate the extended effective potential in the cases of phase transition of the QCD vacuum with a small current quark mass, and the first-order phase transition of QCD at finite temperature and high baryon chemical potential. In the former case, the effective potential shows as an inflection point at the critical mass where the multiple solutions of the Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) vanishes, which is consistent with that obtained by solving the DSE directly. For the latter case, the in-medium properties, such as the latent heat and the difference of trace anomaly, of QCD is obtained.</description>

      <title>Inner bounding the quantum entropy cone with subadditivity and subsystem coarse grainings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show via explicit construction that all the extreme rays of both the three-party quantum entropy cone and the four-party stabilizer entropy cone can be obtained from subsystem coarse grainings of specific higher-party quantum states, namely extreme states characterized by saturating a (non-trivial) maximal set of instances of subadditivity. This suggests that the study of the ``subadditivity cone'', and the set of its extreme rays realizable in quantum mechanics, provides a powerful tool for deriving inner bounds for the quantum and stabilizer entropy cones, as well as constraints on new inequalities for the von Neumann entropy.</description>

      <title>Quantum particle localization observables on Cauchy surfaces of Minkowski spacetime and their causal properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13894v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a general notion of spatial localization on spacelike smooth Cauchy surfaces of quantum systems in Minkowski spacetime. The notion is constructed in terms of a coherent family of normalized POVMs, one for each said Cauchy surface. We prove that a family of POVMs of this type automatically satisfies a causality condition which generalizes Castrigiano's one and implies it when restricting to flat spacelike Cauchy surfaces. As a consequence no conflict with Hegerfeldt's theorem arises. We furthermore prove that such families of POVMs do exist for massive Klein-Gordon particles, since some of them are extensions of already known spatial localization observables. These are constructed out of positive definite kernels or are defined in terms of the stress-energy tensor operator. Some further features of these structures are investigated, in particular, the relation with the triple of Newton-Wigner selfadjoint operators and a modified form of Heisenberg inequality in the rest $3$-spaces of Minkowski reference frames</description>

      <title>Infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections: Quasinormal modes and late-time behavior of D-dimensional regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07848v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Bueno, Cano, and Hennigar [arXiv:2403.04827] proposed a generic approach for incorporating an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections into the Einstein theory. In this study, we compute quasinormal modes for certain regular D-dimensional black holes resulting from this infinite series of higher-curvature corrections, specifically focusing on the $D$-dimensional extensions of the Bardeen and Hayward black holes. We demonstrate that while the fundamental mode is minimally affected by moderate coupling constants, the higher overtones exhibit significant sensitivity even to small coupling values, yielding unconventional modes characterized by vanishing real oscillation frequencies. When comparing the frequencies derived from the metric truncated at several orders of higher-curvature corrections with those resulting from the infinite series of terms, we observe a rapid convergence of the frequencies to their limit for the complete regular black hole. This validates the extensive research conducted on specific theories with a finite number of higher-curvature corrections, such as the Lovelock theory.</description>

      <title>Exotic tetraquarks at the HL-LHC with JETHAD: A high-energy viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the semi-inclusive hadroproduction of a neutral hidden-flavor tetraquark with light and heavy quark flavor at the HL-LHC, accompanied by another heavy hadron or a light-flavored jet. We make use of the novel TQHL1.0 determinations of leading-twist fragmentation functions to describe the formation mechanism of a tetraquark state within the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD. This framework builds on the basis of a spin-physics inspired model, taken as a proxy for the lowest-scale input of the constituent heavy-quark fragmentation channel. Then, all parton-to-tetraquark fragmentation functions are consistently obtained via the above-threshold DGLAP evolution in a variable-flavor number scheme. We provide predictions for a series of differential distributions calculated by the hands of the JETHAD method well-adapted to NLL/NLO+ hybrid-factorization studies, where the resummation of next-to-leading energy logarithms and beyond is included in the collinear picture. We provide corroborating evidence that high-energy observables sensitive to semi-inclusive tetraquark emissions at the HL-LHC exhibit a fair stability under radiative corrections as well as MHOU studies. Our analysis constitutes a prime contact point between QCD resummations and the exotic matter.</description>

      <title>The effects of Lorentz violation on unitarity in $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated two distinct models incorporating LIV with nonminimal coupling in scattering processes of $e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$. We verified that employing the model with dual electromagnetic tensor $(\tilde{F}_{\mu\nu})$ led to violations of unitarity in both vector and axial scenarios. Conversely, utilizing the model with nonminimal coupling with $(F_{\mu\nu})$ preserved unitarity in both vector and axial cases. Consequently, this could hold promising implications, considering that the nonminimal coupling model with dual electromagnetic tensor $\tilde {F}_{\mu\nu}$ appeared potentially superior to the electromagnetic tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$. Hence, we anticipate that these findings might offer a valuable roadmap for further exploration into the investigation of CPT and Lorentz breaking phenomena, with phenomenological implications that are certainly not trivial.</description>
