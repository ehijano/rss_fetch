      <title>Quantum Digital Twins for Uncertainty Quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern supercomputers can handle resource-intensive computational and data-driven problems in various industries and academic fields. These supercomputers are primarily made up of traditional classical resources comprising CPUs and GPUs. Integrating quantum processing units with supercomputers offers the potential to accelerate and manage computationally intensive subroutines currently handled by CPUs or GPUs. However, the presence of noise in quantum processing units limits their ability to provide a clear quantum advantage over conventional classical resources. Hence, we develop and construct "quantum digital twins," virtual versions of quantum processing units. To demonstrate the potential benefit of quantum digital twins, we create and deploy hybrid quantum ensembles on five quantum digital twins that emulate parallel quantum computers since hybrid quantum ensembles are suitable for distributed computing. Our study demonstrates that quantum digital twins assist in analyzing the actual quantum device noise on real-world use cases and emulate parallel quantum processing units for distributed computational tasks to obtain quantum advantage as early as possible.</description>

      <title>Hybrid model of the kernel method for quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of quantum machine learning is a promising way to lead to a revolution in intelligent data processing methods. In this way, a hybrid learning method based on classic kernel methods is proposed. This proposal also requires the development of a quantum algorithm for the calculation of internal products between vectors of continuous values. In order for this to be possible, it was necessary to make adaptations to the classic kernel method, since it is necessary to consider the limitations imposed by the Hilbert space of the quantum processor. As a test case, we applied this new algorithm to learn to classify whether new points generated randomly, in a finite square located under a plane, were found inside or outside a circle located inside this square. It was found that the algorithm was able to correctly detect new points in 99% of the samples tested, with a small difference due to considering the radius slightly larger than the ideal. However, the kernel method was able to perform classifications correctly, as well as the internal product algorithm successfully performed the internal product calculations using quantum resources. Thus, the present work represents a contribution to the area, proposing a new model of machine learning accessible to both physicists and computer scientists.</description>

      <title>On computational complexity of unitary and state design properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity theory perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We provide a quantum algorithm for computing the frame potential and show that 1. exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard, 2. for state vectors, it is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete to decide whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values, if the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits, and 3. both for state vectors and unitaries, it is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. As the frame potential is closely related to the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), our result implies that computing the OTOCs with exponential accuracy is also hard. Second, we address promise problems to decide whether a given set is a good or bad approximation to a $t$-design and show that this problem is in $\textsf{PP}$ for any constant $t$ and is $\textsf{PP}$-hard for $t=1,2$ and $3$. Remarkably, this is the case even if a given set is promised to be either exponentially close to or worse than constant away from a $1$-design. Our results illustrate the computationally hard nature of unitary and state designs.</description>

      <title>Many-body quantum catalysts for transforming between phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A catalyst is a substance that enables otherwise impossible transformations between states of a system, without being consumed in the process. In this work, we apply the notion of catalysts to many-body quantum physics. In particular, we construct catalysts that enable transformations between different symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of matter using symmetric finite-depth quantum circuits. We discover a wide variety of catalysts, including GHZ-like states which spontaneously break the symmetry, gapless states with critical correlations, topological orders with symmetry fractionalization, and spin-glass states. These catalysts are all united under a single framework which has close connections to the theory of quantum anomalies, and we use this connection to put strong constraints on possible pure- and mixed-state catalysts. We also show how the catalyst approach leads to new insights into the structure of certain phases of matter, and to new methods to efficiently prepare SPT phases with long-range interactions or projective measurements.</description>

      <title>Hybrid cat-transmon architecture for scalable, hardware-efficient quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative cat qubits are a promising physical platform for quantum computing, since their large noise bias can enable more hardware-efficient quantum error correction. In this work we theoretically study the long-term prospects of a hybrid cat-transmon quantum computing architecture where dissipative cat qubits play the role of data qubits, and error syndromes are measured using ancillary transmon qubits. The cat qubits' noise bias enables more hardware-efficient quantum error correction, and the use of transmons allows for practical, high-fidelity syndrome measurement. While correction of the dominant cat Z errors with a repetition code has recently been demonstrated in experiment, here we show how the architecture can be scaled beyond a repetition code. In particular, we propose a cat-transmon entangling gate that enables the correction of residual cat X errors in a thin rectangular surface code, so that logical error can be arbitrarily suppressed by increasing code distance. We numerically estimate logical memory performance, finding significant overhead reductions in comparison to architectures without biased noise. For example, with current state-of-the-art coherence, physical error rates of $10^{-3}$ and noise biases in the range $10^{3} - 10^{4}$ are achievable. With this level of performance, the qubit overhead required to reach algorithmically-relevant logical error rates with the cat-transmon architecture matches that of an unbiased-noise architecture with physical error rates in the range $10^{-5} - 10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>Non-binary artificial neuron with phase variation implemented on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first artificial quantum neuron models followed a similar path to classic models, as they work only with discrete values. Here we introduce an algorithm that generalizes the binary model manipulating the phase of complex numbers. We propose, test, and implement a neuron model that works with continuous values in a quantum computer. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our model may work in a hybrid training scheme utilizing gradient descent as a learning algorithm. This work represents another step in the direction of evaluation of the use of artificial neural networks efficiently implemented on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Storage and retrieval of two unknown unitary channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the fundamental task of converting $n$ uses of an unknown unitary transformation into a quantum state (i.e., storage) and later retrieval of the transformation. Specifically, we consider the case where the unknown unitary is selected with equal prior probability from two options. First, we prove that the optimal storage strategy involves the sequential application of the $n$ uses of the unknown unitary, and it produces the optimal state for discrimination between the two possible unitaries. Next, we show that incoherent "measure-and-prepare" retrieval achieves the maximum fidelity between the retrieved operation and the original (qubit) unitary. We then identify the retrieval strategy that maximizes the probability of successfully and perfectly retrieving the unknown transformation. In the regime in which the fidelity between the two possible unitaries is large the probability of success scales as $ P_{succ} = 1 - \mathcal{O}(n^{-2} ) $, which is a quadratic improvement with respect to the case in which the unitaries are drawn from the entire unitary group $U(d)$ with uniform prior probability. Finally, we present an optical experiment for this approach and assess the storage and retrieval quality using quantum tomography of states and processes. The results are discussed in relation to non-optimal measure-and-prepare strategy, highlighting the advantages of our protocol.</description>

      <title>Optical forces on atoms subject to higher-order Poincar{\'e} vortex modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of atoms with higher-order Poincar\'e optical vortex modes of order $m\geq 0$ is explored for light close to resonance with atomic dipole transitions. It is well-known that atoms subject to optical vortex modes experience both translational and rotational forces acting on the atomic centre of mass, leading to atom dynamics and atom trapping. Here we consider the optical forces on atoms immersed in general paraxial higher-order Poincar\'e optical vector modes. The coupling to atoms gives rise to wide-ranging scenarios involving such modes in which any specific polarisation is within a spectrum of wave polarisation and all the interactions are treatable within a single formulation. We show that this gives rise to a variety of physical situations, governed by the mode order $m$, the polarisation represented by the angular coordinates of the mode on the surface of the unit Poincar\'e sphere, the atomic transitions involved, and their selection rules. We present the analytical steps leading to the optical forces on sodium atoms and display their variations in various situations.</description>

      <title>Coherence Preserving Leakage Detection and Cooling in Alkaline Earth Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically trapped atoms in arrays of optical tweezers have emerged as a powerful platform for quantum information processing given the recent demonstrations of high-fidelity quantum logic gates and on-demand reconfigurable geometry. Both in gate operations and atomic transport, additional errors will occur due to leakage out of the computation space, atomic motional heating, or loss of an atom out of a trap completely. In this work, we address these error channels in a unified manner through laser fluorescence that can detect and cool the atom without disturbing the quantum information encoded therein. As only the electrons in the atom couple directly to the laser field, such quantum nondemolition (QND) processes are made possible by encoding quantum information in the nuclear spin of alkaline earth-like atoms and avoiding the effects of the hyperfine interaction which couples it to the electrons. By detuning a fluorescence laser off-resonantly from the $\mathrm{^1S_0} \rightarrow \mathrm{^1P_1}$ transition, far compared to the (small) hyperfine spitting, optical pumping between nuclear states falls off rapidly with detuning, scaling as $~1/\Delta^4$. In contrast, Rayleigh scattering falls off as $~1/\Delta^2$. We also consider a resonant leakage detection protocol off the $^1\mathrm{P}_1$ line. This is achieved by disabling the hyperfine coupling via a strong AC stark effect and canceling the residual lightshifts via dressing. The same scheme can be used to recool the atoms towards the vibrational ground state for the quantum information encoded in the ground state of alkaline earth atoms while preserving the coherence. These advances could significantly improve the prospect of neutral atoms for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>An algebraic interpretation of Pauli flow, leading to faster flow-finding algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-way model of quantum computation is an alternative to the circuit model. A one-way computation is driven entirely by successive adaptive measurements of a pre-prepared entangled resource state. For each measurement, only one outcome is desired; hence a fundamental question is whether some intended measurement scheme can be performed in a robustly deterministic way. So-called flow structures witness robust determinism by providing instructions for correcting undesired outcomes. Pauli flow is one of the broadest of these structures and has been studied extensively. It is known how to find flow structures in polynomial time when they exist; nevertheless, their lengthy and complex definitions often hinder working with them.
  We simplify these definitions by providing a new algebraic interpretation of Pauli flow. This involves defining two matrices arising from the adjacency matrix of the underlying graph: the flow-demand matrix $M$ and the order-demand matrix $N$. We show that Pauli flow exists if and only if there is a right inverse $C$ of $M$ such that the product $NC$ forms the adjacency matrix of a directed acyclic graph. From the newly defined algebraic interpretation, we obtain $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ algorithms for finding Pauli flow, improving on the previous $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ bound for finding generalised flow, a weaker variant of flow, and $\mathcal{O}(n^5)$ bound for finding Pauli flow. We also introduce a first lower bound for the Pauli flow-finding problem, by linking it to the matrix invertibility and multiplication problems over $\mathbb{F}_2$.</description>

      <title>Enhancing non-classical correlations for light scattered by an ensemble of cold two-level atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the enhancement of quantum correlations for biphotons generated via spontaneous four-wave mixing in an ensemble of cold two-level atoms. This enhancement is based on the filtering of the Rayleigh linear component of the spectrum of the two emitted photons, favoring the quantum-correlated sidebands reaching the detectors. We provide direct measurements of the unfiltered spectrum presenting its usual triplet structure, with Rayleigh central components accompanied by two peaks symmetrically located at the detuning of the excitation laser with respect to the atomic resonance. The filtering of the central component results in a violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to $4.8 \pm 1.0 \leq 1$ for a detuning of 60 times the atomic linewidth, representing an enhancement by a factor of four compared with the unfiltered quantum correlations observed at the same conditions.</description>

      <title>Real classical shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently learning expectation values of a quantum state using classical shadow tomography has become a fundamental task in quantum information theory. In a classical shadows protocol, one measures a state in a chosen basis $\mathcal{W}$ after it has evolved under a unitary transformation randomly sampled from a chosen distribution $\mathcal{U}$. In this work we study the case where $\mathcal{U}$ corresponds to either local or global orthogonal Clifford gates, and $\mathcal{W}$ consists of real-valued vectors. Our results show that for various situations of interest, this ``real'' classical shadow protocol improves the sample complexity over the standard scheme based on general Clifford unitaries. For example, when one is interested in estimating the expectation values of arbitrary real-valued observables, global orthogonal Cliffords decrease the required number of samples by a factor of two. More dramatically, for $k$-local observables composed only of real-valued Pauli operators, sampling local orthogonal Cliffords leads to a reduction by an exponential-in-$k$ factor in the sample complexity over local unitary Cliffords. Finally, we show that by measuring in a basis containing complex-valued vectors, orthogonal shadows can, in the limit of large system size, exactly reproduce the original unitary shadows protocol.</description>

      <title>Linear and non-linear relational analyses for Quantum Program Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase folding optimization is a circuit optimization used in many quantum compilers as a fast and effective way of reducing the number of high-cost gates in a quantum circuit. However, existing formulations of the optimization rely on an exact, linear algebraic representation of the circuit, restricting the optimization to being performed on straightline quantum circuits or basic blocks in a larger quantum program.
  We show that the phase folding optimization can be re-cast as an \emph{affine relation analysis}, which allows the direct application of classical techniques for affine relations to extend phase folding to quantum \emph{programs} with arbitrarily complicated classical control flow including nested loops and procedure calls. Through the lens of relational analysis, we show that the optimization can be powered-up by substituting other classical relational domains, particularly ones for \emph{non-linear} relations which are useful in analyzing circuits involving classical arithmetic. To increase the precision of our analysis and infer non-linear relations from gate sets involving only linear operations -- such as Clifford+$T$ -- we show that the \emph{sum-over-paths} technique can be used to extract precise symbolic transition relations for straightline circuits. Our experiments show that our methods are able to generate and use non-trivial loop invariants for quantum program optimization, as well as achieve some optimizations of common circuits which were previously attainable only by hand.</description>

      <title>Efficient Detection of Strong-To-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking via the R\'enyi-1 Correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) has recently emerged as a universal feature of quantum mixed-state phases of matter. While various information-theoretic diagnostics have been proposed to define and characterize SWSSB phases, relating these diagnostics to observables which can be efficiently and scalably probed on modern quantum devices remains challenging. Here we propose a new observable for SWSSB in mixed states, called the R\'enyi-1 correlator, which naturally suggests a potential route towards scalably detecting SWSSB phases in experiment. Specifically, if the canonical purification (CP) of a given mixed state can be reliably prepared, then SWSSB in the mixed state can be detected via ordinary two-point correlation functions in the CP state. We discuss several simple examples of CP states which can be efficiently prepared on quantum devices, and whose reduced density matrices exhibit SWSSB. The R\'enyi-1 correlator also satisfies several useful theoretical properties: it naturally inherits a stability theorem recently proven for the closely-related fidelity correlator, and it directly defines SWSSB as a particular pattern of ordinary spontaneous symmetry breaking in the CP state.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and reconfigurable graph state generation with a single solid-state quantum emitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computing offers a promising route towards scalable, universal photonic quantum computation. This approach relies on the deterministic and efficient generation of photonic graph states in which many photons are mutually entangled with various topologies. Recently, deterministic sources of graph states have been demonstrated with quantum emitters in both the optical and microwave domains. In this work, we demonstrate deterministic and reconfigurable graph state generation with optical solid-state integrated quantum emitters. Specifically, we use a single semiconductor quantum dot in a cavity to generate caterpillar graph states, the most general type of graph state that can be produced with a single emitter. By using fast detuned optical pulses, we achieve full control over the spin state, enabling us to vary the entanglement topology at will. We perform quantum state tomography of two successive photons, measuring Bell state fidelities up to 0.80$\pm$0.04 and concurrences up to 0.69$\pm$0.09, while maintaining high photon indistinguishability. This simple optical scheme, compatible with commercially available quantum dot-based single photon sources, brings us a step closer to fault-tolerant quantum computing with spins and photons.</description>

      <title>Quantum logic for state preparation, readout, and leakage detection with binary subspace measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a general technique for using quantum logic spectroscopy to perform quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements that determine which of two subspaces a logic ion is in. We then show how to use the scheme to perform high fidelity state preparation and measurement (SPAM) and non-destructive leakage detection, as well as how this would reduce the engineering task associated with building larger quantum computers. Using a magnetic field gradient, we can apply a geometric phase interaction to map the magnetic sensitivity of the logic into onto the spin-flip probability of a readout ion. In the `low quantization field' regime, where the Zeeman splitting of the sublevels in the hyperfine ground state manifold are approximately integer multiples of each other, we show how to we can use the technique to distinguish between $2^{K}$ hyperfine sublevels in only $K$ logic/readout measurement sequences--opening the door for efficient state preparation of the logic ion. Finally, we show how the binary nature of the scheme, as well as its potential for high QND purity, let us improve SPAM fidelities by detecting and correcting errors rather than preventing them.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected Bell-cat states in a simple spin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the topological properties of the so-called central spin model that consists of $N$ identical spins coupled to a single distinguishable central spin which arises in physical systems such as circuit-QED and bosonic Josephson junctions coupled to an impurity atom. The model closely corresponds to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model except that the chain of sites in the SSH model is replaced by a chain of states in Fock space specifying the magnetization. We find that the model accommodates topologically protected eigenstates that are `Bell-cat' states consisting of a Schr\"{o}dinger cat state of the $N$ spins that is maximally entangled with the central spin, and show how this state can be adiabatically created and moved along the chain by driving the central spin. We visualize the Bell-cat states by plotting their Wigner function and also show their robustness against random noise by solving the master equation for the density matrix.</description>

      <title>Learning State Preparation Circuits for Quantum Phases of Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body ground state preparation is an important subroutine used in the simulation of physical systems. In this paper, we introduce a flexible and efficient framework for obtaining a state preparation circuit for a large class of many-body ground states. We introduce polynomial-time classical algorithms that take reduced density matrices over $\mathcal{O}(1)$-sized balls as inputs, and output a circuit that prepares the global state. We introduce algorithms applicable to (i) short-range entangled states (e.g., states prepared by shallow quantum circuits in any number of dimensions, and more generally, invertible states) and (ii) long-range entangled ground states (e.g., the toric code on a disk). Both algorithms can provably find a circuit whose depth is asymptotically optimal. Our approach uses a variant of the quantum Markov chain condition that remains robust against constant-depth circuits. The robustness of this condition makes our method applicable to a large class of states, whilst ensuring a classically tractable optimization landscape.</description>

      <title>QUEST-A: Untrained Filtering with Trained Focusing led to Enhanced Quantum Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum architecture search (QAS) represents a fundamental challenge in quantum machine learning, with SOTA methods primarily categorized into training-free and gradient-guided approaches. However, treating QAS solely as either a discrete pruning process or a continuous optimization problem fails to balance accuracy and efficiency. This work decomposes QAS into two alternately solved subproblems: optimal circuit structure retrieval and parameter optimization. Based on this insight, we propose Quantum Untrained-Explored Synergistic Trained Architecture (QUEST-A), which implements rapid architecture pruning through inherent circuit properties and develops focused optimization with parameter reuse strategies. QUEST-A unifies discrete structure search and continuous parameter optimization within an evolutionary framework that integrates rapid pruning and fine-grained optimization. Experiments demonstrate QUEST-A's superiority over existing methods: enhancing model expressivity in signal representation, maintaining high performance across varying complexities in image classification, and achieving order-of-magnitude precision improvements in variational quantum eigensolver tasks. These results validate QUEST-A's effectiveness and provide transferable methodologies for QAS.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Secret Sharing Networks with Linear Bell-State Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum secret sharing (QSS) plays a pivotal role in multiparty quantum communication, ensuring the secure distribution of private information among multiple parties. However, the security of QSS schemes can be compromised by attacks exploiting imperfections in measurement devices. Here, we propose a reconfigurable approach to implement QSS based on measurement-device-independent (MDI) principles, utilizing linear two-photon Bell state analysis.By employing single-qubit conjugate operations for encoding private information, our approach offers reconfigurability, allowing for the inclusion of additional quantum network nodes without sacrificing efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robust security of our MDI-QSS scheme against inter-eavesdropping by dishonest participants and establish lower bounds for secure communication among three legitimate parties. This work presents a flexible configuration for implementing multiparty secure quantum communication with imperfect measurement devices and represents a significant advancement in the development of secure quantum communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Work Extraction from a Controlled Quantum Emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how an external driving field can control the amount of extractable work from a quantum emitter, a two-level quantum system (TLS) interacting with a photonic environment. In this scenario, the TLS functions as a quantum battery, interacting with the photonic bath that discharges it while the control field recharges it. Ergotropy serves as our measure of the extractable work from the quantum system. We systematically analyze how the ergotropy of the system evolves as it interacts with the photonic bath under the control of either a continuous driving field or a periodic pulse sequence. The coherent and incoherent contributions to the total ergotropy for various initial states are calculated. The role of detuning between the driving field and the emission frequency of the TLS, as well as the initial state of the system in work extraction, are investigated for continuous and periodic pulse-driving fields. We show that detuning has little impact on work extraction for a system that is driven by a periodic sequence of instantaneous pulses. However, for a continuously driven system, as the system approaches its steady state, ergotropy increases with detuning increases.</description>

      <title>Comparing the performance of practical two-qubit gates for individual ${}^{171}$Yb ions in yttrium orthovanadate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate three schemes for implementing Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates between individual ytterbium (Yb) rare-earth ions doped into yttrium orthovanadate (YVO$_4$ or YVO). Specifically, we investigate the CNOT gates based on magnetic dipolar interactions between Yb ions, photon scattering off a cavity, and a photon interference-based protocol, with and without an optical cavity. We introduce a theoretical framework for precise computations of gate infidelity, accounting for noise effects. We then compute the gate fidelity of each scheme to evaluate the feasibility of their experimental implementation. Based on these results, we compare the performance of the gate schemes and discuss their respective advantages and disadvantages. We conclude that the probabilistic photon interference-based scheme offers the best fidelity scaling with cooperativity and is superior with the current technology of Yb values, while photon scattering is nearly deterministic but slower with less favourable fidelity scaling as a function of cooperativity. The cavityless magnetic dipolar scheme provides a fast, deterministic gate with high fidelity if close ion localization can be realized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a polynomial time algorithm that, given copies of an unknown quantum state $\vert\psi\rangle=U\vert 0^n\rangle$ that is prepared by an unknown constant depth circuit $U$ on a finite-dimensional lattice, learns a constant depth quantum circuit that prepares $\vert\psi\rangle$. The algorithm extends to the case when the depth of $U$ is $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$, with a quasi-polynomial run-time. The key new idea is a simple and general procedure that efficiently reconstructs the global state $\vert\psi\rangle$ from its local reduced density matrices. As an application, we give an efficient algorithm to test whether an unknown quantum state on a lattice has low or high quantum circuit complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum error correction, the Petz transpose channel serves as a perfect recovery map when the Knill-Laflamme conditions are satisfied. Notably, while perfect recovery is generally infeasible for most quantum channels of finite dimension, the transpose channel remains a versatile tool with near-optimal performance in recovering quantum states. This work introduces and proves, for the first time, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the strict optimality of the transpose channel in terms of channel fidelity. The violation of this condition can be easily characterized by a simple commutator that can be efficiently computed. We provide multiple examples that substantiate our new findings.</description>

      <title>Entanglement scaling and criticality of quantum many-body systems in canonical quantization picture using tensor network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating strongly-correlated quantum systems in continuous space belongs to the most challenging and long-concerned issues in quantum physics. This work investigates the quantum entanglement and criticality of the ground-state wave-functions of infinitely-many coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs). The essential task involves solving a set of partial differential equations (Schr\"odinger equations in the canonical quantization picture) with infinitely-many variables, which currently lacks valid methods. By extending the imaginary-time evolution algorithm with translationally-invariant functional tensor network, we simulate the ground state of iCQOs with the presence of two- and three-body couplings. We determine the range of coupling strengths where there exists a real ground-state energy (dubbed as physical region). With two-body couplings, we reveal the logarithmic scaling law of entanglement entropy (EE) and the polynomial scaling law of correlation length against the virtual bond dimension $\chi$ at the dividing point of physical and non-physical regions. These two scaling behaviors are signatures of criticality, according to the previous results in quantum lattice models, but were not reported in continuous-space quantum systems. The scaling coefficients result in a central charge $c=1$, indicating the presence of free boson conformal field theory (CFT). With three-body couplings where there exist no analytical nor numerical results, we show the breakdown of CFT at the dividing point even with an extremely small strength of three-body terms. Our work uncovers the scaling behaviors of EE in the continuous-space quantum many-body systems, providing numerical evidences for the efficiency of tensor networks in representing the continuous-space quantum many-body ground states in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Restoring Kibble-Zurek Scaling and Defect Freezing in Non-Hermitian Systems under Biorthogonal Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics provides an effective description of open and nonequilibrium systems and hosts many novel and intriguing phenomena such as exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effect. Despite extensive theoretical and experimental studies, however, how to properly deal with the nonadiabatic dynamics in driven non-Hermitian quantum system is still under debate. Here, we develop a theoretical framework based on time-dependent biorthogonal quantum formalism by redefining the associated state to obtain the gauge-independent transition probability, and study the nonadiabatic dynamics of a linearly driven non-Hermitian system. In contrast to the normalization method that leads to a modified Kibble-Zurek scaling behavior, our approach predicts that the defect production at exceptional points exhibits power-law scaling behaviors conforming to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. In the fast quench regime, universal scaling behaviors are also found with respect to the initial quenching parameter, which can be explained by the impulse-adiabatic approximation. Moreover, as trespassing the PT -broken region, the phenomenon of defect freezing, i.e., violation of adiabaticity, is observed.</description>

      <title>One-dimension Periodic Potentials in Schr\"odinger Equation Solved by the Finite Difference Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional Kronig-Penney potential in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, a standard periodic potential in quantum mechanics textbooks known for generating band structures, is solved by using the finite difference method with periodic boundary conditions. This method significantly improves the eigenvalue accuracy compared to existing approaches such as the filter method. The effects of the width and height of the Kronig-Penney potential on the eigenvalues and wave functions are then analyzed. As the potential height increases, the variation of eigenvalues with the wave vector slows down. Additionally, for higher-order band structures, the magnitude of the eigenvalue significantly decreases with increasing potential width. Finally, the Dirac comb potential, a periodic $\delta$ potential, is examined using the present framework. This potential corresponds to the Kronig-Penney potential's width and height approaching zero and infinity, respectively. The numerical results obtained by the finite difference method for the Dirac comb potential are also perfectly consistent with the analytical solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise phase measurements by interferometers are crucial in science for detecting subtle changes, such as gravitational waves. However, phase sensitivity is typically limited by the standard quantum limit (SQL) with uncorrelated particles N. This limit can be surpassed using quantum correlations, but achieving high-quality correlations in large systems is challenging. Here, we propose and demonstrate an atom-light hybrid quantum interferometry whose sensitivity is enhanced beyond the SQL with atom-light quantum correlation and newly developed phase comb superposition via atomic-memory-assisted multiple quantum amplification. Finally, a phase sensitivity beyond the SQL of up to $8.3\pm 0.2$ dB is achieved, especially at $N=4 \times10^{13}/s$, resulting in both atomic and optical phase sensitivities of $6\times10^{-8} rad/\sqrt{Hz}$. This technique can advance sensitive quantum measurements in various fields.</description>

Abstract: Verifying the violation of Bell's inequality is one of the most representative methods to demonstrate that entangled photon pairs prepared in a quantum optics-based system exhibit quantum properties. While experiments on Bell inequality violations have been theoretically well-established and extensively conducted to implement various quantum information technologies in laboratory settings, mathematical modeling for accurately predicting the distribution of high-intensity entangled photon pairs in high-loss environments remains an issue that requires further research. As the brightness of the entangled photon pairs increases, the influence of multi-photon effects becomes more significant, leading to a decrease in the CHSH value $S$ and also a reduction in the standard deviation of the CHSH value $\Delta S$. Therefore, a new analysis of the $(S-2)/\Delta S$ value is required to more precisely confirm the degree of CHSH inequality violation including the reliability of $S$. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to predict the $(S-2)/\Delta S$ value as a function of the brightness of the entangled photon pair source, and we also suggest the need to optimize the brightness of this source. Additionally, we provide experimental evidence supporting this model. The experiment confirms that when the mean photon number is $\mu=0.026$ in an entanglement distribution setup with a total loss of $-19.03$ dB, the CHSH value drops to 2.69, while the $(S-2)/\Delta S$ value increases to 60.95.</description>

      <title>Entangling distant systems via universal nonadiabatic passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive universal nonadiabatic passages in an $M+N$-dimensional discrete system, where $M$ and $N$ denote the degrees of freedom for the assistant and working subspaces, respectively, that could be separated due to rotation or energy. A systematic method is provided to construct parametric ancillary bases for the nonadiabatic passages, which can set up connection between arbitrary initial and target states. In applications, a transitionless dynamics determined by the von Neumann equation with the time-dependent system Hamiltonian can be formulated to entangle distant qubits, as a vital prerequisite for the practical quantum networks. Using tunable longitudinal interaction between two distant qubits, the superconducting system evolves to the single-excitation Bell state with a fidelity as high as $F=0.997$ from the ground state. When the longitudinal interaction is switched off, the single-excitation Bell state can be further converted to the double-excitation Bell state with $F=0.982$ by parametric driving. Moreover, our protocol can be adapted to generate the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state for $N$ qubits with $N$ steps. Our work develops a full-fledged theory for nonadiabatic state engineering in quantum information processing, which is flexible in target selection and robust against the external noise.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal machine regimes in the transverse-field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Errors in Analog Quantum Simulation by Hamiltonian Reshaping or Hamiltonian Rescaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating quantum many-body systems is crucial for advancing physics and chemistry but poses substantial challenges for classical computers. Quantum simulations overcome these limitations, with analog simulators offering unique advantages over digital methods, such as lower systematic errors and reduced circuit depth, making them efficient for studying complex quantum phenomena. However, unlike their digital counterparts, analog quantum simulations face significant limitations due to the absence of effective error mitigation techniques. This work introduces two novel error mitigation strategies -- Hamiltonian reshaping and Hamiltonian rescaling -- in analog quantum simulation for tasks like eigen-energy evaluation. Hamiltonian reshaping uses random unitary transformations to generate new Hamiltonians with identical eigenvalues but varied eigenstates, allowing error reduction through averaging. Hamiltonian rescaling mitigates errors by comparing eigenvalue estimates from energy-scaled Hamiltonians. Numerical calculations validate both methods, demonstrating their significant practical effectiveness in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Assessing non-Gaussian quantum state conversion with the stellar rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State conversion is a fundamental task in quantum information processing. Quantum resource theories allow to analyze and bound conversions that use restricted sets of operations. In the context of continuous-variable systems, state conversions restricted to Gaussian operations are crucial for both fundamental and practical reasons -- particularly in state preparation and quantum computing with bosonic codes. However, previous analysis did not consider the relevant case of approximate state conversion. In this work, we introduce a framework for assessing approximate Gaussian state conversion by extending the stellar rank to the approximate stellar rank, which serves as an operational measure of non-Gaussianity. We derive bounds for Gaussian state conversion under both approximate and probabilistic conditions, yielding new no-go results for non-Gaussian state preparation and enabling a reliable assessment of the performance of generic Gaussian conversion protocols.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new classical simulation algorithm based on non-signaling polytopes of multipartite Bell scenarios, capable of simulating universal measurement-based quantum computation with single-qubit Pauli measurements. In our model, the simultaneous presence of non-stabilizerness and entanglement is necessary for quantum speedup. The region of quantum states that can be efficiently simulated includes the Bell polytope and extends beyond what is currently achievable by sampling algorithms based on phase space methods.</description>

      <title>Testing the Wineland Criterion with Finite Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wineland parameter aims at detecting metrologically useful entangled states, called spin-squeezed states, from expectations and variances of total angular momenta. Efficient strategies for estimating this parameter in practice have yet to be determined. We here formulate the question of whether a state is spin-squeezed according to the Wineland parameter as an hypothesis test and assess the relevance of experimental outcomes by deriving upper and lower bounds on the p-value. By applying our statistical test to data obtained in multiple experiments, we are unable to reject the hypothesis that non-spin squeezed states were measured with a p-value of 5% or less in most cases. We also find an explicit non-spin squeezed state according to the Wineland parameter reproducing most of the observed results with a p-value exceeding 5%. Our results provide a rigorous method to establish robust statistical evidence of spin squeezing from the Wineland parameter in future experiments, accounting for finite-size effects.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Transmission in Hybrid Atomic Ensemble-Optomechanical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate perfect optical nonreciprocal transmission in a hybrid optomechanical system that incorporates an atomic ensemble. By introducing complex coupling strengths between the atomic ensemble and a mechanical oscillator, nonreciprocity is induced through interference between distinct optical pathways. The nonreciprocal transmission is governed by the real and imaginary components of the coupling constants, along with the relative phase differences between the optomechanical couplings. Our analysis reveals that, with precise tuning of system parameters, such as coupling strengths, detuning, and phase differences, perfect nonreciprocity can be achieved. We derive the conditions necessary for optimal nonreciprocal transmission and demonstrate its dependence on the complex nature of the coupling. These findings offer valuable insights for designing nonreciprocal optical devices, including isolators and circulators, with potential applications in quantum communication, signal processing, and photonics.</description>

      <title>Detrimental non-Markovian errors for surface code memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers hinges on effective quantum error correction protocols, whose performance significantly relies on the nature of the underlying noise. In this work, we directly study the structure of non-Markovian correlated errors and their impact on surface code memory performance. Specifically, we compare surface code performance under non-Markovian noise and independent circuit-level noise, while keeping marginal error rates constant. Our analysis shows that while not all temporally correlated structures are detrimental, certain structures, particularly multi-time "streaky" correlations affecting syndrome qubits and two-qubit gates, can severely degrade logical error rate scaling. Furthermore, we discuss our results in the context of recent quantum error correction experiments on physical devices. These findings underscore the importance of understanding and mitigating non-Markovian noise toward achieving practical, fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Skyrmions in general quantum channels: topological noise rejection and the discretization of quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topology of a pure state of two entangled photons is leveraged to provide a discretization of quantum information. Since discrete signals are inherently more resilient to the effects of perturbations, this discrete class of entanglement observables may offer an advantage against noise. Establishing this is the primary objective of this paper. We develop a noise model that exploits the specific form of such topological wave functions - an entangled state of two photons with one in an orbital angular momentum state and the other in a polarization state. We show that noise affecting both photons can be recast as a position-dependent perturbation affecting only the photon in the polarization state. This approach allows us to utilize both the language and concepts used in studying noisy qubits, as well as recent advances in quantum polarimetry. By adding noise to a finite-dimensional Hilbert space of polarization states, we can describe the noise using quantum operations expressed through appropriate Krauss operators, whose structure is determined by quantum polarimetry. For non-depolarizing noise, we provide an argument based on homotopic maps that demonstrates the topology's resilience to noise. For depolarizing noise, numerical studies using the quantum channel description show that the discrete entanglement signal remains completely resilient. Finally, we identify sources of local noise that can destabilize the topology. This foundational work establishes a framework for understanding how topology enhances the resilience of quantum information, directly impacting the distribution of information through entanglement in noisy environments, such as quantum computers and quantum networks.</description>

      <title>UniqueQMA vs QMA: oracle separation and eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-standing open question of the power of unique witness in quantum protocols, which asks if UniqueQMA, a variant of QMA whose accepting witness space is 1-dimensional, is equal to QMA. We show a quantum oracle separation between UniqueQMA and QMA via an extension of the Aaronson-Kuperberg's QCMA vs QMA oracle separation. In particular, we show that any UniqueQMA protocol must make $\Omega(\sqrt{D})$ queries to a subspace phase oracle of unknown dimension $\leq D$ to "find" the subspace. This presents an obstacle to relativizing techniques in resolving this question (unlike its classical analogue - the Valiant-Vazirani theorem - which is essentially a black-box reduction) and suggests the need to study the structure of the ground space of local Hamiltonians in distilling a potential unique witness. Our techniques also yield a quantum oracle separation between QXC, the class characterizing quantum approximate counting, and QMA.
  Very few structural properties are known that place the complexity of local Hamiltonians in UniqueQMA. We expand this set of properties by showing that the ground energy of local Hamiltonians that satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) can be estimated through a UniqueQMA protocol. Specifically, our protocol can be viewed as a quantum expander test in a low energy subspace of the Hamiltonian and verifies a unique entangled state in two copies of the subspace. This allows us to conclude that if UniqueQMA $\neq$ QMA, then QMA-hard Hamiltonians must violate ETH under adversarial perturbations (more accurately, under the quantum PCP conjecture if ETH only applies to extensive energy subspaces). Our results serve as evidence that chaotic local Hamiltonians, such as the SYK model, contain polynomial verifiable quantum states in their low energy regime and may be simpler than general local Hamiltonians if UniqueQMA $\neq$ QMA.</description>

      <title>The non-Hermitian skin effect: A perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian (NH) skin effect is a truly NH feature, which manifests itself as an accumulation of states, known as skin states, on the boundaries of a system. In this perspective, we discuss several aspects of the NH skin effect focusing on the most interesting facets of this phenomenon. Non-normality and non-reciprocity are reviewed as necessary requirements to see the NH skin effect. We further discuss the NH skin effect as a topological effect that can be seen as a manifestation of a truly NH bulk-boundary correspondence, and show how topological boundary states can be distinguished from skin states. As most theoretical work has focused on studying the NH skin effect in the one-dimensional single-particle picture, recent developments of studying this effect in higher dimensions as well as in the many-body case are also highlighted. Lastly, experimental realizations and applications of the NH skin effect are reviewed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient compilation method for distributed quantum computing (DQC) using the Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) architecture. By exploiting the LNN topology's symmetry, we optimize quantum circuit compilation for High Local Connectivity, Sparse Full Connectivity (HLC-SFC) algorithms like Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). We also utilize dangling qubits to minimize non-local interactions and reduce SWAP gates. Our approach significantly decreases compilation time, gate count, and circuit depth, improving scalability and robustness for large-scale quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Time evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method in a non-diagonal basis set based on derivative of the path integral expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method is a powerful tool for simulating open system quantum dynamics. Typically, it is used in problems with diagonal system-bath coupling, where analytical expressions for discretized influence functional are available. In this work, we aim to address issues related to off-diagonal coupling by extending the TEMPO algorithm to accommodate arbitrary basis sets. The proposed approach is based on computing the derivative of the discretized path integral expression of a generalized influence functional when increasing one time step, which yields an equation of motion valid for non-diagonal basis set and arbitrary number of non-commuting baths. The generalized influence functional is then obtained by integrating the resulting differential equation. Applicability of the the new method is then tested by simulating one- and two- qubit systems coupled to both Z- and X-type baths.</description>

      <title>Approaching energy quantum limit detection of microwave photons with Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon detection is an energy quantum limit detection (EQLD) of a significantly weak electromagnetic wave. Given the sensitivity of the conventional electromagnetic induction microwave receiver working at room-temperature is very limited, due to the significantly strong thermal noise, here we analyze the possibility of approaching the EQLD of the weak microwave signal by using a current-biased Josephson Junction (CBJJ) detector. By numerically simulating the dynamics for the phase particle of the CBJJ, we propose an approach to describe the discriminability between the probabilistically escaped events of the phase particle with and without the microwave current driving, by measuring the minimum $d_{\rm KC}$-index. We predicate that, the experimentally demonstrated CBJJ detectors possess the ability to resolve about a dozen photons. The feasibility of the desired EQLD of microwave signal by using the CBJJ detector is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Space-bounded quantum interactive proof systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two models of space-bounded quantum interactive proof systems, ${\sf QIPL}$ and ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$. The ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$ model, a space-bounded variant of quantum interactive proofs (${\sf QIP}$) introduced by Watrous (CC 2003) and Kitaev and Watrous (STOC 2000), restricts verifier actions to unitary circuits. In contrast, ${\sf QIPL}$ allows logarithmically many intermediate measurements per verifier action (with a high-concentration condition on yes instances), making it the weakest model that encompasses the classical model of Condon and Ladner (JCSS 1995).
  We characterize the computational power of ${\sf QIPL}$ and ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$. When the message number $m$ is polynomially bounded, ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L} \subsetneq {\sf QIPL}$ unless ${\sf P} = {\sf NP}$:
  - ${\sf QIPL}$ exactly characterizes ${\sf NP}$.
  - ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$ is contained in ${\sf P}$ and contains ${\sf SAC}^1 \cup {\sf BQL}$, where ${\sf SAC}^1$ denotes problems solvable by classical logarithmic-depth, semi-unbounded fan-in circuits.
  However, this distinction vanishes when $m$ is constant. Our results further indicate that intermediate measurements uniquely impact space-bounded quantum interactive proofs, unlike in space-bounded quantum computation, where ${\sf BQL}={\sf BQ_{\rm U}L}$.
  We also introduce space-bounded unitary quantum statistical zero-knowledge (${\sf QSZK_{\rm U}L}$), a specific form of ${\sf QIP_{\rm U}L}$ proof systems with statistical zero-knowledge against any verifier. This class is a space-bounded variant of quantum statistical zero-knowledge (${\sf QSZK}$) defined by Watrous (SICOMP 2009). We prove that ${\sf QSZK_{\rm U}L} = {\sf BQL}$, implying that the statistical zero-knowledge property negates the computational advantage typically gained from the interaction.</description>

      <title>Interactive proofs for verifying (quantum) learning and testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of testing and learning from data in the presence of resource constraints, such as limited memory or weak data access, which place limitations on the efficiency and feasibility of testing or learning. In particular, we ask the following question: Could a resource-constrained learner/tester use interaction with a resource-unconstrained but untrusted party to solve a learning or testing problem more efficiently than they could without such an interaction? In this work, we answer this question both abstractly and for concrete problems, in two complementary ways: For a wide variety of scenarios, we prove that a resource-constrained learner cannot gain any advantage through classical interaction with an untrusted prover. As a special case, we show that for the vast majority of testing and learning problems in which quantum memory is a meaningful resource, a memory-constrained quantum algorithm cannot overcome its limitations via classical communication with a memory-unconstrained quantum prover. In contrast, when quantum communication is allowed, we construct a variety of interactive proof protocols, for specific learning and testing problems, which allow memory-constrained quantum verifiers to gain significant advantages through delegation to untrusted provers. These results highlight both the limitations and potential of delegating learning and testing problems to resource-rich but untrusted third parties.</description>

      <title>Nonstabilizerness Enhances Thrifty Shadow Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shadow estimation is a powerful approach for estimating the expectation values of many observables. Thrifty shadow estimation is a simple variant that is proposed to reduce the experimental overhead by reusing random circuits repeatedly. Although this idea is so simple, its performance is quite elusive. In this work we show that thrifty shadow estimation is effective on average whenever the unitary ensemble forms a 2-design, in sharp contrast with the previous expectation. In thrifty shadow estimation based on the Clifford group, the variance is inversely correlated with the degree of nonstabilizerness of the state and observable, which is a key resource in quantum information processing. For fidelity estimation, it decreases exponentially with the stabilizer 2-R\'{e}nyi entropy of the target state, which endows the stabilizer 2-R\'{e}nyi entropy with a clear operational meaning. In addition,we propose a simple circuit to enhance the efficiency, which requires only one layer of $T$ gates and is particularly appealing in the NISQ era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases are useful throughout quantum physics, both in a foundational context and for applications. To date, it remains unknown if complete sets of mutually unbiased bases exist in Hilbert spaces of dimensions different from a prime power, i.e. in composite dimensions such as six or ten. Fourteen mathematically equivalent formulations of the existence problem are presented. We comprehensively summarise analytic, computer-aided and numerical results relevant to the case of composite dimensions. Known modifications of the existence problem are reviewed and potential solution strategies are outlined.</description>

      <title>Improving the accuracy of circuit quantization using the electromagnetic properties of superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum information processing with superconducting qubits have fueled a growing demand for scaling and miniaturizing circuit layouts. Despite significant progress, accurately predicting the Hamiltonian of complex circuits remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose an improved method for quantizing superconducting circuits that incorporates material- and geometry-dependent kinetic inductance. Our approach models thin superconducting films as equivalent reactive boundary elements, seamlessly integrating into the conventional circuit quantization framework without adding computational complexity. As a proof of concept, we experimentally verify our method using planar superconducting quantum devices made of 35 nm-thick disordered niobium films, known to exhibit large kinetic inductance values. We demonstrate significantly improved accuracy in predicting the Hamiltonian based solely on the chip layout and material properties of the superconducting films and Josephson junctions, with discrepancies in mode frequencies remaining below 2%. Our method enables systematic studies of superconducting devices based on disordered thin films or compact, fine-pitched elements and, more broadly, facilitates the precise engineering of superconducting quantum circuits at scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2D toric code is a prototypical example that exhibits non-trivial topological properties and a ground state possessing a non-trivial topological order. Until now, all the cases studied in the literature have been in the stable equilibrium regime, leaving the relaxation towards this state unexplored. In the present work, the dynamics of the toric code towards stable equilibrium is explored within the steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamic (SEAQT) framework. Under these dynamics, information correlations such as the relative entropy, logarithmic negativity, magnetization, coherent information, and geometric entropy are described out of equilibrium, permitting a connection to be made between the out-of-equilibrium dynamics and these information measures.</description>

      <title>Non-linear sigma models for non-Hermitian random matrices in symmetry classes AI$^{\dagger}$ and AII$^{\dagger}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry of non-Hermitian matrices underpins many physical phenomena. In particular, chaotic open quantum systems exhibit universal bulk spectral correlations classified on the basis of time-reversal symmetry$^{\dagger}$ (TRS$^{\dagger}$), coinciding with those of non-Hermitian random matrices in the same symmetry class. Here, we analytically study the spectral correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices in the presence of TRS$^{\dagger}$ with signs $+1$ and $-1$, corresponding to symmetry classes AI$^{\dagger}$ and AII$^{\dagger}$, respectively. Using the fermionic replica non-linear sigma model approach, we derive $n$-fold integral expressions for the $n$th moment of the one-point and two-point characteristic polynomials. Performing the replica limit $n\to 0$, we qualitatively reproduce the density of states and level-level correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices with TRS$^{\dagger}$.</description>

      <title>Natural gradient and parameter estimation for quantum Boltzmann machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal states play a fundamental role in various areas of physics, and they are becoming increasingly important in quantum information science, with applications related to semi-definite programming, quantum Boltzmann machine learning, Hamiltonian learning, and the related task of estimating the parameters of a Hamiltonian. Here we establish formulas underlying the basic geometry of parameterized thermal states, and we delineate quantum algorithms for estimating the values of these formulas. More specifically, we prove formulas for the Fisher--Bures and Kubo--Mori information matrices of parameterized thermal states, and our quantum algorithms for estimating their matrix elements involve a combination of classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. These results have applications in developing a natural gradient descent algorithm for quantum Boltzmann machine learning, which takes into account the geometry of thermal states, and in establishing fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a Hamiltonian, when given access to thermal-state samples. For the latter task, and for the special case of estimating a single parameter, we sketch an algorithm that realizes a measurement that is asymptotically optimal for the estimation task. We finally stress that the natural gradient descent algorithm developed here can be used for any machine learning problem that employs the quantum Boltzmann machine ansatz.</description>

      <title>More global randomness from less random local gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random circuits giving rise to unitary designs are key tools in quantum information science and many-body physics. In this work, we investigate a class of random quantum circuits with a specific gate structure. Within this framework, we prove that one-dimensional structured random circuits with non-Haar random local gates can exhibit substantially more global randomness compared to Haar random circuits with the same underlying circuit architecture. In particular, we derive all the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second-moment operators for these structured random circuits under a solvable condition, by establishing a link to the Kitaev chain, and show that their spectral gaps can exceed those of Haar random circuits. Our findings have applications in improving circuit depth bounds for randomized benchmarking and the generation of approximate unitary 2-designs from shallow random circuits.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Verified Quantum Computation with an Ion-Trap Quantum Processing Unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and experimentally demonstrate a novel approach to verification and benchmarking of quantum computing, implementing it on an ion-trap quantum computer. Unlike previous information-theoretically secure verification protocols, which typically require quantum communication between client and server, our approach is implemented entirely on-chip. This eliminates the need for a quantum client and significantly enhances practicality.
  We perform tomography to justify the additionally required assumption that the noise is independent of the secret used to prepare the Server's single-qubit states. We quantify the soundness error which may be caused by residual secret dependencies. We demonstrate our protocol on the 20-qubit Quantinuum H1-1 ion-trap quantum processing unit, using qubit measurements and resets to construct measurement patterns with up to 52 vertices. To our knowledge, these are the largest verified measurement-based quantum computations performed to date.
  Our results pave the way for more accessible and efficient verification and benchmarking strategies in near-term quantum devices, enabling robust performance assessment without the added cost of external quantum infrastructure.</description>

      <title>From broadband biphotons to frequency combs via spectral compression with time-varying cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biphoton frequency combs are promising resources for quantum networking due in large part to their compatibility with the telecommunication infrastructure. In this work, we propose a method to periodically compress broadband frequency-entangled photons into biphoton frequency combs by utilizing time-varying linear cavities. Our approach hinges on rapid modulation of the input cavity coupling, yielding high spectral purity in each output comb line similar to that achieved with narrowband filters, but without the associated loss in flux. We examine the dependence of spectral purity and compression on coupling strength, cavity loss, and switching speed, finding realistic regimes supporting purities in excess of 0.999 and peak enhancement factors of 100 and beyond.</description>

      <title>Untelegraphable Encryption and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of untelegraphable encryption (UTE), founded on the no-telegraphing principle, which allows an encryptor to encrypt a message such that a binary string representation of the ciphertext cannot be decrypted by a user with the secret key, a task that is classically impossible. This is a natural relaxation of unclonable encryption, inspired by the recent work of Nehoran and Zhandry (ITCS 2024), who showed a computational separation between the no-cloning and no-telegraphing principles. In this work, we define and construct UTE information-theoretically in the plain model. Building off this, we give several applications of UTE and study the interplay of UTE with UE and well-studied tasks in quantum state learning, yielding the following contributions:
  - A construction of collusion-resistant UTE from standard secret-key encryption. We additionally show that hyper-efficient shadow tomography (HEST) is impossible assuming collusion-resistant UTE exists. By considering a relaxation of collusion-resistant UTE, we are able to show the impossibility of HEST assuming only pseudorandom state generators (which may not imply one-way functions). This almost completely answers an open inquiry of Aaronson (STOC 2019).
  - A construction of UTE from a one-shot message authentication code in the classical oracle model, such that there is an explicit attack that breaks UE security for an unbounded polynomial number of decryptors.
  - A construction of everlasting secure collusion-resistant UTE, where the decryptor adversary can run in unbounded time, in the quantum random oracle model (QROM), and formal evidence that a construction in the plain model is a challenging task. We additionally show that HEST with unbounded post-processing time is impossible in the QROM.
  - Constructions (and definitions) of untelegraphable secret sharing and untelegraphable functional encryption.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for testing low stabilizer complexity states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizer states are fundamental families of quantum states with crucial applications such as error correction and simulation of quantum circuits. In this paper, we study the problem of testing how close or far a quantum state is to a stabilizer state. We make two contributions: First, we improve the state-of-the-art parameters for the tolerant testing of stabilizer states. In particular, we show that there is an efficient quantum primitive to distinguish if the maximum fidelity of a quantum state with a stabilizer state is $\geq \epsilon_1$ or $\leq \epsilon_2$, given one of them is the case, provided that $\epsilon_2 \leq \epsilon_1^{O(1)}$. Previously, the best bound known for this problem assumed $\epsilon_2 \leq e^{- 1/\epsilon^{O(1)}_1}$ \cite{arunachalam2024tolerant} and assumed a conjecture in additive combinatorics; improved bounds only existed for phase states. Our result does not rely on any conjectures. Our proof technique extends the toolsets developed in \cite{arunachalam2024tolerant} by applying a random Clifford map which balances the characteristic function of a quantum state, enabling the use of standard proof techniques from higher-order Fourier analysis for Boolean functions \cite{hatami2019higher, Samorodnitsky2007}, where improved testing bounds are available.
  Second, we study the problem of testing low stabilizer rank states. We show that if for an infinite family of quantum states stabilizer rank is lower than a constant independent of system size, then stabilizer fidelity is lower bounded by an absolute constant. Using a result of \cite{grewal2022low}, one of the implications of this result is that low approximate stabilizer rank states are not pseudo-random.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scrambling unitary dynamics in a quantum system transmutes local quantum information into a non-local web of correlations which manifests itself in a complex spatio-temporal pattern of entanglement. In such a context, we show there can exist three distinct dynamical phases characterised by qualitatively different forms of quantum correlations between two disjoint subsystems of the system. Transitions between these phases are driven by the relative sizes of the subsystems and the degree scrambling that the dynamics effects. Besides a phase which has no quantum correlations as manifested by vanishing entanglement between the parts and a phase which has non-trivial quantum correlations quantified by a finite entanglement monotone, we reveal a new phase transition within the entangled phase which separates phases wherein the quantum correlations are invisible or visible to measurements on one of the subsystems. This is encoded in the qualitatively different properties of the ensemble of states on one of the subsystems conditioned on the various measurement outcomes on the other subsystem. This provides a new characterisation of entanglement phases in terms of their response to measurements instead of the more ubiquitous measurement-induced entanglement transitions. Our results have implications for the kind of tasks that can be performed using measurement feedback within the framework of quantum interactive dynamics.</description>

      <title>Error Threshold of SYK Codes from Strong-to-Weak Parity Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) codes are fundamentally linked to quantum phases of matter: the degenerate ground state manifold corresponds to the code space, while topological excitations represent error syndromes. Building on this concept, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, characterized by its extensive quasi-ground state degeneracy, serves as a constant rate approximate QEC code. In this work, we study the impacts of decoherence on the information-theoretic capacity of SYK models and their variants. Such a capacity is closely tied to traversable wormholes via its thermofield double state, which theoretically enables the teleportation of information across a black hole. We calculate the coherent information in the maximally entangled quasi-ground state space of the SYK models under the fermion parity breaking and parity conserving noise. Interestingly, we find that under the strong fermion parity symmetric noise, the mixed state undergoes the strong to weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of fermion parity, which also corresponds to the information-theoretic transition. Our results highlight the degradation of wormhole traversability in realistic quantum scenarios, as well as providing critical insights into the behavior of approximate constant-rate QEC codes under decoherence.</description>

      <title>Spread Complexity Rate as Proper Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a precise relation between the rate of complexity of quantum states excited by local operators in two-dimensional conformal field theories and the radial momentum of particles in 3-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetimes. Similar relations have been anticipated based on qualitative models for operator growth. Here, we make this correspondence sharp with two key ingredients: the precise definition of quantum complexity given by the spread complexity of states, and the match of its growth rate to the bulk momentum measured in the proper radial distance coordinate.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a study of the complexity of quantum field theories (QFTs) by proposing a measure of information contained in a QFT and its observables. We show that from minimal assertions, one is naturally led to measure complexity by two integers, called format and degree, which characterize the information content of the functions and domains required to specify a theory or an observable. The strength of this proposal is that it applies to any physical quantity, and can therefore be used for analyzing complexities within an individual QFT, as well as studying the entire space of QFTs. We discuss the physical interpretation of our approach in the context of perturbation theory, symmetries, and the renormalization group. Key applications include the detection of complexity reductions in observables, for example due to algebraic relations, and understanding the emergence of simplicity when considering limits. The mathematical foundations of our constructions lie in the framework of sharp o-minimality, which ensures that the proposed complexity measure exhibits general properties inferred from consistency and universality.</description>

      <title>Flavor Patterns of Fundamental Particles from Quantum Entanglement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, which controls flavor mixing between the three generations of quark fermions, is a key input to the Standard Model of particle physics. In this paper, we identify a surprising connection between quantum entanglement and the degree of quark mixing. Focusing on a specific limit of $2 \to 2$ quark scattering mediated by electroweak bosons, we find that the quantum entanglement generated by scattering is minimized when the CKM matrix is almost (but not exactly) diagonal, in qualitative agreement with observation. With the discovery of neutrino masses and mixings, additional angles are needed to parametrize the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix in the lepton sector. Applying the same logic, we find that quantum entanglement is minimized when the PMNS matrix features two large angles and a smaller one, again in qualitative agreement with observation, plus a hint for suppressed CP violation. We speculate on the (unlikely but tantalizing) possibility that minimization of quantum entanglement might be a fundamental principle that determines particle physics input parameters.</description>

      <title>Acceleration-induced transport of quantum vortices in joined atomtronic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent currents--inviscid quantized flow around an atomic circuit--are a crucial building block of atomtronic devices. We investigate how acceleration influences the transfer of persistent currents between two density-connected, ring-shaped atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, joined by a tunable weak link that controls system topology. We find that the acceleration of this system modifies both the density and phase dynamics between the rings, leading to a bias in the periodic vortex oscillations studied in T. Bland et al., Phys. Rev. Research 4, 043171 (2022). Accounting for dissipation suppressing such vortex oscillations, the acceleration facilitates a unilateral vortex transfer to the leading ring. We analyze how this transfer depends on the weak-link amplitude, the initial persistent current configuration, and the acceleration strength and direction. Characterization of the sensitivity to these parameters paves the way for a new platform for acceleration measurements.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Matrix Product Operator: A Multi-Dimensionally Integrable Machine Learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range. Our Python implementation is available at https://github.com/KenHino/Pompon.</description>

      <title>Quantum Deep Equilibrium Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The feasibility of variational quantum algorithms, the most popular correspondent of neural networks on noisy, near-term quantum hardware, is highly impacted by the circuit depth of the involved parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs). Higher depth increases expressivity, but also results in a detrimental accumulation of errors. Furthermore, the number of parameters involved in the PQC significantly influences the performance through the necessary number of measurements to evaluate gradients, which scales linearly with the number of parameters.
  Motivated by this, we look at deep equilibrium models (DEQs), which mimic an infinite-depth, weight-tied network using a fraction of the memory by employing a root solver to find the fixed points of the network. In this work, we present Quantum Deep Equilibrium Models (QDEQs): a training paradigm that learns parameters of a quantum machine learning model given by a PQC using DEQs. To our knowledge, no work has yet explored the application of DEQs to QML models. We apply QDEQs to find the parameters of a quantum circuit in two settings: the first involves classifying MNIST-4 digits with 4 qubits; the second extends it to 10 classes of MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR. We find that QDEQ is not only competitive with comparable existing baseline models, but also achieves higher performance than a network with 5 times more layers. This demonstrates that the QDEQ paradigm can be used to develop significantly more shallow quantum circuits for a given task, something which is essential for the utility of near-term quantum computers.

      <title>Integral quantization based on the Heisenberg-Weyl group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a relativistic framework of integral quantization applied to the motion of spinless particles in the four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The proposed scheme is based on coherent states generated by the action of the Heisenberg-Weyl group and has been motivated by the Hamiltonian description of the geodesic motion in General Relativity. We believe that this formulation should also allow for a generalization to the motion of test particles in curved spacetimes. A key element in our construction is the use of suitably defined positive operator-valued measures. We show that this approach can be used to quantize the one-dimensional nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator, recovering the standard Hamiltonian as obtained by the canonical quantization. Our formalism is then applied to the Hamiltonian associated with the motion of a relativistic particle in the Minkowski spacetime. A direct application of our model, including a computation of transition amplitudes between states characterized by fixed positions and momenta, is postponed to a forthcoming article.</description>

      <title>Impact of micromotion on the excitation of Rydberg states of ions in a Paul trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapped ions are among the most advanced platforms for quantum simulation and computation. Their capabilities can be further augmented by making use of electronically highly excited Rydberg states, which enable the realization of long-ranged electric dipolar interactions. Most experimental and theoretical studies so far focus on the excitation of ionic Rydberg states in linear Paul traps, which generate confinement by a combination of static and oscillating electric fields. These two fields need to be carefully aligned to minimize so-called micromotion, caused by the time-dependent electric field. The purpose of this work is to systematically understand the qualitative impact of micromotion on the Rydberg excitation spectrum, when the symmetry axes of the two electric fields do not coincide. Considering this scenario is not only important in the case of possible field misalignment, but becomes inevitable for Rydberg excitations in 2D and 3D ion crystals. We develop a minimal model describing a single trapped Rydberg ion, which we solve numerically via Floquet theory and analytically using a perturbative approach. We calculate the excitation spectra and analyze in which parameter regimes addressable and energetically isolated Rydberg lines persist, which are an important requirement for conducting coherent manipulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is a contribution to the proceedings of the 33rd/35th International Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics (ICGTMP, Group33/35) held in Cotonou, Benin, July 15-19, 2024. The stability of matter is an old and mathematically difficult problem, relying both on the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics and on the exclusion principle of quantum statistics. We consider here the stability of the self-interacting almost-bosonic anyon gas, generalizing the Gross-Pitaevskii / nonlinear Schr\"odinger energy functionals to include magnetic self interactions. We show that there is a type of supersymmetry in the model which holds only for higher values of the magnetic coupling but is broken for lower values, and that in the former case supersymmetric ground states exist precisely at even-integer quantized values of the coupling. These states constitute a manifold of explicit solitonic vortex solutions whose densities solve a generalized Liouville equation, and can be regarded as nonlinear generalizations of Landau levels. The reported work is joint with Alireza Ataei and Dinh-Thi Nguyen and makes an earlier analysis of self-dual abelian Chern-Simons-Higgs theory by Jackiw and Pi, Hagen, and others, mathematically rigorous.</description>

      <title>The time-dependent bivariational principle: Theoretical foundation for real-time propagation methods of coupled-cluster type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time propagation methods for chemistry and physics are invariably formulated using variational techniques. The time-dependent bivariational principle (TD-BIVP) is known to be the proper framework for coupled-cluster type methods, and is here studied from a differential geometric point of view. It is demonstrated how two distinct classical Hamilton's equations of motion arise from considering the real and imaginary parts of the action integral. The latter is new, and can in principle be used to develop novel propagation methods. Conservation laws and Poisson brackets are introduced, completing the analogy with classical mechanics. An overview of established real-time propagation methods is given in the context of our formulation of the TD-BIVP, namely time-dependent traditional coupled-cluster theory, orbital-adaptive coupled-cluster theory, time-dependent orthogonal optimized coupled-cluster theory, and equation-of-motion coupled cluster theory.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing electronic phases of matter using photonic correlation functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past couple of decades, there have been significant advances in measuring quantum properties of light, such as quadratures of squeezed light and single-photon counting. Here, we explore whether such tools can be leveraged to probe electronic correlations in the many-body quantum regime. Specifically, we show that it is possible to probe certain spin, charge, and topological orders in an electronic system by measuring the quadrature and correlation functions of photons scattered off it. We construct a mapping from the correlation functions of the scattered photons to those of a correlated insulator, particularly for Mott insulators described by a single-band Hubbard model at half-filling. We show how frequency filtering before photodetection plays a crucial role in determining this mapping. If the ground state of the insulator is a gapped spin liquid, we show that a $G^{(2)}$ (two-photon coherence) measurement can detect the presence of anyonic excitations with fractional mutual statistics. We also show that homodyne measurements can be used to detect expectation values of static spin chirality operators on both the kagome and triangular lattices, thus being useful in detecting chiral spin liquids. Moreover, a slew of hitherto unmeasured spin-spin and spin-charge correlation functions of the material can be extracted from photonic correlations. This work opens up access to probe correlated materials, beyond the linear response paradigm, by detecting quantum properties of scattered light.</description>

      <title>A Cryogenic Memristive Neural Decoder for Fault-tolerant Quantum Error Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural decoders for quantum error correction (QEC) rely on neural networks to classify syndromes extracted from error correction codes and find appropriate recovery operators to protect logical information against errors. Its ability to adapt to hardware noise and long-term drifts make neural decoders a promising candidate for inclusion in a fault-tolerant quantum architecture. However, given their limited scalability, it is prudent that small-scale (local) neural decoders are treated as first stages of multi-stage decoding schemes for fault-tolerant quantum computers with millions of qubits. In this case, minimizing the decoding time to match the stabilization measurements frequency and a tight co-integration with the QPUs is highly desired. Cryogenic realizations of neural decoders can not only improve the performance of higher stage decoders, but they can minimize communication delays, and alleviate wiring bottlenecks. In this work, we design and analyze a neural decoder based on an in-memory computation (IMC) architecture, where crossbar arrays of resistive memory devices are employed to both store the synaptic weights of the neural decoder and perform analog matrix-vector multiplications. In simulations supported by experimental measurements, we investigate the impact of TiOx-based memristive devices' non-idealities on decoding fidelity. We develop hardware-aware re-training methods to mitigate the fidelity loss, restoring the ideal decoder's pseudo-threshold for the distance-3 surface code. This work provides a pathway to scalable, fast, and low-power cryogenic IMC hardware for integrated fault-tolerant QEC.</description>

Abstract: We analytically derive the diffusion coefficients that drive a system of $N$ coupled harmonic oscillators to an equilibrium state exhibiting persistent correlations. It is shown that the main effect of the latter consists in a renormalization of the natural frequencies and the friction coefficients of the oscillators. We find that the Einstein relation may be satisfied at low temperatures with frequency-dependent effective friction coefficients, provided that the physical constraints are fulfilled. We also investigate the entanglement evolution in a bipartite bosonic Bogoliubov system initially prepared in a thermal squeezed state. It is found that, in contrast to what one may expect, strong coupling slows down the entanglement sudden death, and for initially separable states, entanglement generation may occur.</description>

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are trained using historical data to classify new, unseen data. However, traditional computing resources often struggle to handle the immense amount of data, commonly known as Big Data, within a reasonable time frame. Quantum Computing (QC) provides a novel approach to information processing, offering the potential to process classical data exponentially faster than classical computing through quantum algorithms. By mapping Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithms into the quantum mechanical domain, we can potentially achieve exponential improvements in data processing speed, reduced resource requirements, and enhanced accuracy and efficiency. In this article, we delve into both the QC and ML fields, exploring the interplay of ideas between them, as well as the current capabilities and limitations of hardware. We investigate the history of quantum computing, examine existing QML algorithms, and present a simplified procedure for setting up simulations of QML algorithms, making it accessible and understandable for readers. Furthermore, we conduct simulations on a dataset using both traditional machine learning and quantum machine learning approaches. We then compare their respective performances by utilizing a quantum simulator.</description>

Abstract: An accessible tabletop source for the production of entangled x rays is crucial for the field of high-energy quantum optics. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the entanglement and polarization of the two photons emitted by an electron in an intense laser wave (nonlinear double-Compton scattering), by working within the framework of strong-field QED. By identifying contributions to the emission probability stemming from the electron being either on-shell or off-shell between the two-photon emissions, we show that the entangled photons are generated via the off-shell contribution for moderate beam energies, which are realizable on a tabletop setup. We propose an experiment to produce and isolate pairs of entangled x rays, through spectral filtering.</description>

      <title>Unmasking the Polygamous Nature of Quantum Nonlocality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics imposes limits on the statistics of certain observables. Perhaps the most famous example is the uncertainty principle. Similar trade-offs also exist for the simultaneous violation of multiple Bell inequalities. In the simplest case of three observers, it has been shown that if two observers violate a Bell inequality then none of them can violate any Bell inequality with the third observer, a property called monogamy of Bell violations. Forms of Bell monogamy have been linked to the no-signalling principle and the inability of simultaneous violations of all inequalities is regarded as their fundamental property. Here we show that the Bell monogamy does not hold universally and that in fact the only monogamous situation exists for only three observers. Consequently, the nature of quantum nonlocality is truly polygamous. We present a systematic methodology for identifying quantum states, measurements and tight Bell inequalities that do not obey the monogamy principle for any number of more than three observers. The identified polygamous inequalities enable any subset of $(N-1)$ observers to reveal nonlocality, which is also shown experimentally by measuring Bell-type correlations of six-photon Dicke states. Our findings may be exploited for multiparty quantum key distribution as well as simultaneous self-testing of multiple nodes in quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: An universal approximation technique for analysis of different characteristics of states of composite infinite-dimensional quantum systems is proposed and used to prove general results concerning the properties of correlation and entanglement measures in such systems. Then these results are applied to the study of three important characteristics: the relative entropy of $\pi$-entanglement, the Rains bound (the unregularized and regularized versions of both characteristics are considered) and the conditional entanglement of mutual information.
  In particular, we analyse continuity and convexity properties of the above entanglement measures, prove several results simplifying their definitions and establish a finite-dimensional approximation property for these characteristics that allows us to generalize to the infinite-dimensional case the results proved in the finite-dimensional settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Successful implementations of quantum technologies require protocols and algorithms that use as few quantum resources as possible. However, many important quantum operations, such as continuous rotation gates in quantum computing or broadband pulses in NMR or MRI applications, can only be implemented approximately using finite quantum resources. This work develops an approach that enables -- at the cost of a modestly increased measurement repetition rate -- exact implementations on average. One proceeds by first building a library of a large number of different approximations to the desired gate operation; by randomly selecting these operations according to a pre-optimised probability distribution, one can on average implement the desired operation with a rigorously controllable approximation error. The approach relies on sophisticated tools from convex optimisation to efficiently find optimal probability distributions. A diverse spectrum of applications are demonstrated as (a) exactly synthesising rotations in fault-tolerant quantum computers using only low T-count circuits and (b) synthesising broadband and band-selective pulses of superior performance in quantum optimal control with (c) further applications in NMR or MRI. The approach is very general and a broad spectrum of practical applications in quantum technologies are explicitly demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Quantum approximate optimization algorithm with random and subgraph phase operators</title>

Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising quantum algorithm that can be used to approximately solve combinatorial optimization problems. The usual QAOA ansatz consists of an alternating application of the cost and mixer Hamiltonians. In this work, we study how using Hamiltonians other than the usual cost Hamiltonian, dubbed custom phase operators, can affect the performance of QAOA. We derive an expected value formula for QAOA with custom phase operators at $p = 1$ and show numerically that some of these custom phase operators can achieve higher approximation ratio than the original algorithm implementation. Out of all the graphs tested at $p=1$, 0.036\% of the random custom phase operators, 75.9\% of the subgraph custom phase operators, 95.1\% of the triangle-removed custom phase operators, and 93.9\% of the maximal degree edge-removed custom phase operators have a higher approximation ratio than the original QAOA implementation. Furthermore, we numerically simulate these phase operators for $p=2$ and $p=3$ levels of QAOA and find that there exist a large number of subgraph, triangle-removed, and maximal degree edge-removed custom phase operators that have a higher approximation ratio than QAOA at the same depth. These findings open up the question of whether better phase operators can be designed to further improve the performance of QAOA.</description>

      <title>Computable and noncomputable in the quantum domain: statements and conjectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant advances in the development of computing devices based on quantum effects and the demonstration of their use to solve various problems have rekindled interest in the nature of the "quantum computational advantage." Although various attempts to quantify and characterize the nature of the quantum computational advantage have previously been made, this question largely remains open. Indeed, there is no universal approach that allows determining the scope of problems whose solution can be accelerated by quantum computers, in theory of in practice. In this paper, we consider an approach to this question based on the concept of complexity and reachability of quantum states. On the one hand, the class of quantum states that are of interest for quantum computing must be complex, i.e., not amenable to simulation by classical computers with less than exponential resources. On the other hand, such quantum states must be reachable on a practically feasible quantum computer. This means that the unitary operation that transforms the initial quantum state into the desired one must be decomposable into a sequence of one- and two-qubit gates of a length that is at most polynomial in the number of qubits. By formulating several statements and conjectures, we discuss the question of describing a class of problems whose solution can be accelerated by a quantum computer.</description>

Abstract: Classical algorithms for market equilibrium computation such as proportional response dynamics face scalability issues with Internet-based applications such as auctions, recommender systems, and fair division, despite having an almost linear runtime in terms of the product of buyers and goods. In this work, we provide the first quantum algorithm for market equilibrium computation with sub-linear performance. Our algorithm provides a polynomial runtime speedup in terms of the product of the number of buyers and goods while reaching the same optimization objective value as the classical algorithm. Numerical simulations of a system with 16384 buyers and goods support our theoretical results that our quantum algorithm provides a significant speedup.</description>

      <title>Bipartite entanglement of noisy stabilizer states through the lens of stabilizer codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stabilizer states are a prime resource for a number of applications in quantum information science, such as secret-sharing and measurement-based quantum computation. This motivates us to study the entanglement of noisy stabilizer states across a bipartition. We show that the spectra of the corresponding reduced states can be expressed in terms of properties of an associated stabilizer code. In particular, this allows us to show that the coherent information is related to the so-called syndrome entropy of the underlying code. We use this viewpoint to find stabilizer states that are resilient against noise, allowing for more robust entanglement distribution in near-term quantum networks. We specialize our results to the case of graph states, where the found connections with stabilizer codes reduces back to classical linear codes for dephasing noise. On our way we provide an alternative proof of the fact that every qubit stabilizer code is equivalent up to single-qubit Clifford gates to a graph code.</description>

Abstract: This study presents a machine-learning-based procedure to automate the charge tuning of semiconductor spin qubits with minimal human intervention, addressing one of the significant challenges in scaling up quantum dot technologies. This method exploits artificial neural networks to identify noisy transition lines in stability diagrams, guiding a robust exploration strategy leveraging neural networks' uncertainty estimations. Tested across three distinct offline experimental datasets representing different single quantum dot technologies, the approach achieves over 99% tuning success rate in optimal cases, where more than 10% of the success is directly attributable to uncertainty exploitation. The challenging constraints of small training sets containing high diagram-to-diagram variability allowed us to evaluate the capabilities and limits of the proposed procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical systems are typically assumed to evolve relative to an external, real-valued time parameter. This seemingly innocent assumption is problematic because the time parameter is not physical. For instance, it is not an observable of any physical system. In quantum theory, this problem is solved by a construction due to Page &amp; Wootters (1984), in which the universe is in a stationary state so that the external time parameter is irrelevant. Instead, a subsystem of the Page-Wootters universe will 'evolve' according to the Schr\"odinger equation because it is entangled with another system, aptly called a 'clock'. It is often assumed necessary for the clock to be a dynamically isolated system, as this is one of the assumptions that Page &amp; Wootters make in their original formulation. This apparently prevents the clock from being measured, as a measurement would require it to interact with another system. In this work, we show that while isolation is a sufficient condition for the Page-Wootters construction, it is not a necessary one. Because interactions between the clock and other systems are allowed, it is possible to measure clock time. We also discuss clock synchronisation.</description>

Abstract: We numerically investigate the robustness against various perturbations of measurement-induced phase transition in monitored quantum Ising models in the no-click limit, where the dynamics is described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We study perturbations that break the integrability and/or the symmetry of the model, as well as modifications in the measurement protocol, characterizing the resulting chaos and lack of integrability through the Dissipative Spectral Form Factor (DSFF). We show that while the measurement-induced phase transition and its properties appear to be broadly insensitive to lack of integrability and breaking of the $\mathbb{Z_2}$ symmetry, a modification of the measurement basis from the transverse to the longitudinal direction makes the phase transition disappear altogether.</description>

      <title>The Cram\'{e}r-Rao approach and global quantum estimation of bosonic states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state estimation is a fundamental task in quantum information theory, where one estimates real parameters continuously embedded in a family of quantum states. In the theory of quantum state estimation, the widely used Cram\'er Rao approach which considers local estimation gives the ultimate precision bound of quantum state estimation in terms of the quantum Fisher information. However practical scenarios need not offer much prior information about the parameters to be estimated, and the local estimation setting need not apply. In general, it is unclear whether the Cram\'er-Rao approach is applicable for global estimation instead of local estimation. In this paper, we find situations where the Cram\'er-Rao approach does and does not work for quantum state estimation problems involving a family of bosonic states in a non-IID setting, where we only use one copy of the bosonic quantum state in the large number of bosons setting. Our result highlights the importance of caution when using the results of the Cram\'er-Rao approach to extrapolate to the global estimation setting.</description>

Abstract: What would be a reasonable definition of the conditional entropy of bipartite quantum processes, and what novel insight would it provide? We develop this notion using four information-theoretic axioms and define the corresponding quantitative formulas. Our definitions of the conditional entropies of channels are based on the generalized state and channel divergences, for instance, quantum relative entropy. We find that the conditional entropy of quantum channels has potential to reveal insights for quantum processes that aren't already captured by the existing entropic functions, entropy or conditional entropy, of the states and channels. The von Neumann conditional entropy $S[A|B]_{\mathcal{N}}$ of the channel $\mathcal{N}_{A'B'\to AB}$ is based on the quantum relative entropy, with system pairs $A',A$ and $B',B$ being nonconditioning and conditioning systems, respectively. We identify a connection between the underlying causal structure of a bipartite channel and its conditional entropy. In particular, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a bipartite quantum channel $\mathcal{N}_{A'B'\to AB}$ in terms of its von Neumann conditional entropy $S[A|B]_{\mathcal{N}}$, to have no causal influence from $A'$ to $B$. As a consequence, if $S[A|B]_{\mathcal{N}}&lt; -\log|A|$ then the channel necessarily has causal influence (signaling) from $A'$ to $B$. Our definition of the conditional entropy establishes the strong subadditivity of the entropy for quantum channels. We also study the total amount of correlations possible due to quantum processes by defining the multipartite mutual information of quantum channels.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Power of QAC0 with Barely Superlinear Ancillae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ is the family of constant-depth polynomial-size quantum circuits consisting of arbitrary single qubit unitaries and multi-qubit Toffoli gates. It was introduced by Moore [arXiv: 9903046] as a quantum counterpart of $\mathrm{AC}^0$, along with the conjecture that $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuits can not compute PARITY. In this work we make progress on this longstanding conjecture: we show that any depth-$d$ $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuit requires $n^{1+3^{-d}}$ ancillae to compute a function with approximate degree $\Theta(n)$, which includes PARITY, MAJORITY and $\mathrm{MOD}_k$. We further establish superlinear lower bounds on quantum state synthesis and quantum channel synthesis. This is the first superlinear lower bound on the super-linear sized $\mathrm{QAC}^0$. Regarding PARITY, we show that any further improvement on the size of ancillae to $n^{1+\exp(-o(d))}$ would imply that PARITY $\not\in$ QAC0. These lower bounds are derived by giving low-degree approximations to $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuits. We show that a depth-$d$ $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuit with $a$ ancillae, when applied to low-degree operators, has a degree $(n+a)^{1-3^{-d}}$ polynomial approximation in the spectral norm. This implies that the class $\mathrm{QLC}^0$, corresponding to linear size $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuits, has approximate degree $o(n)$. This is a quantum generalization of the result that $\mathrm{LC}^0$ circuits have approximate degree $o(n)$ by Bun, Robin, and Thaler [SODA 2019]. Our result also implies that $\mathrm{QLC}^0\neq\mathrm{NC}^1$.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced synchronization in coupled quantum oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamics of a pair of coupled quantum oscillators coupled to a common correlated dissipative environment. The resulting equations of motion for both the operator moments and covariances can be integrated analytically using the Lyapunov equations. We find that for fully correlated and fully anti-correlated environments, the oscillators relax into a phase-synchronized state that persists for long times when the two oscillators are nearly resonant and (essentially) forever if the two oscillators are in resonance. This can be traced to the symmetry of the Lindblad dissipator, which can lead to strong damping in one region of state space and under damping in others. In the extreme cases of fully correlated or fully anti-correlated environments, specific regions of state space are fully decoupled from the environment. We also show that the environmental noise correlation leads to quantum entanglement, and all the correlations between the two oscillators are purely quantum mechanical in origin. This work provides a robust mathematical foundation for understanding how long-lived exciton coherences can be linked to vibronic correlation effects.</description>

      <title>Quantum implementation of non-unitary operations with biorthogonal representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the contemporary advances in quantum implementation of non-unitary operations, we propose a new dilation method based on the biorthogonal representation of the non-unitary operator, mapping it to an isomorphic unitary matrix in the orthonormal computational basis. The proposed method excels in implementing non-unitary operators whose eigenvalues have absolute values exceeding one, when compared to other dilation and decomposition techniques. Unlike the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) method, which becomes less efficient as the number of unitary summands grows, the proposed technique is optimal for small-dimensional non-unitary operators regardless of the number of unitary summands. Thus, it can complement the LCU method for implementing general non-unitary operators arising in positive only open quantum systems and pseudo-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distinction between pure states and mixed states is a kernel ingredient of what is considered to be the standard formulation of quantum mechanics and plays today a kernel role in foundational debates about the meaning of quantum probability, the separability of quantum systems, the definition and measure of entanglement, etc. In this work we attempt to expose the many inconsistencies introduced by this distinction and the serious consequences this has for many ongoing research programs within quantum physics which apply these notions uncritically.</description>

      <title>An occupation number quantum subspace expansion approach to compute the single-particle Green function: an opportunity for noise filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to compute the Green function for strongly correlated electrons on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The technique consists in the construction of a non-orthogonal excitation basis composed of a set of single-particle excitations generated by occupation number operators. The excited sectors of the Hamiltonian in this basis can then be measured on the quantum device and a classical post-processing procedure yields the Green function in the Lehmann representation. The technique allows for noise filtering, a useful feature for NISQ devices. To validate the approach, we carry out a set of proof-of-principle calculations on the single-band Hubbard model on IBM quantum hardware. For a 2 site system we find good agreement between the results of quantum simulations and the exact result for the local spectral function. This proof-of-principle also shows that the noise filtering provides a reliable way to get rid of satellite peaks present in the spectral weight obtained from a NISQ device. A simulation of a 4 site system carried out on classical hardware suggests that the approach can achieve similar accuracy for larger systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of complex correlated quantum systems such as random circuit networks is governed by the dynamical buildup of both entanglement and entropy. We here introduce a real-time field theory approach -- essentially a fusion of the $G \Sigma$-functional of the SYK-model and the field theory of disordered systems -- enigneered to microscopically describe the full range of such crossover dynamics: from initial product states to a maximum entropy ergodic state. To showcase this approach in the simplest nontrivial setting, we consider a tensor product of coupled random matrices, and compare to exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Universality and two-body losses: lessons from the effective non-Hermitian dynamics of two particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the late-time dynamics of two particles confined in one spatial dimension and subject to two-body losses. The dynamics is exactly described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that can be analytically studied both in the continuum and on a lattice. The asymptotic decay rate and the universal power-law form of the decay of the number of particles are exactly computed in the whole parameter space of the problem. When in the initial state the two particles are far apart, the average number of particles in the setup decays with time $t$ as $t^{-1/2}$; a different power law, $t^{-3/2}$, is found when the two particles overlap in the initial state. These results are valid both in the continuum and on a lattice, but in the latter case a logarithmic correction appears.</description>

      <title>Neural Pfaffians: Solving Many Many-Electron Schr\"odinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural wave functions accomplished unprecedented accuracies in approximating the ground state of many-electron systems, though at a high computational cost. Recent works proposed amortizing the cost by learning generalized wave functions across different structures and compounds instead of solving each problem independently. Enforcing the permutation antisymmetry of electrons in such generalized neural wave functions remained challenging as existing methods require discrete orbital selection via non-learnable hand-crafted algorithms. This work tackles the problem by defining overparametrized, fully learnable neural wave functions suitable for generalization across molecules. We achieve this by relying on Pfaffians rather than Slater determinants. The Pfaffian allows us to enforce the antisymmetry on arbitrary electronic systems without any constraint on electronic spin configurations or molecular structure. Our empirical evaluation finds that a single neural Pfaffian calculates the ground state and ionization energies with chemical accuracy across various systems. On the TinyMol dataset, we outperform the `gold-standard' CCSD(T) CBS reference energies by 1.9m$E_h$ and reduce energy errors compared to previous generalized neural wave functions by up to an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium Polarization in Medium from Open Quantum Systems and Chromomagnetic Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spin-dependent in-medium dynamics of quarkonia by using the potential nonrelativistic QCD (pNRQCD) and the open quantum system framework. We consider the pNRQCD Lagrangian valid up to the order $\frac{r}{M^0}=r$ and $\frac{r^0}{M}=\frac{1}{M}$ in the double power counting. By considering the Markovian condition and applying the Wigner transformation upon the diagonal spin components of the quarkonium density matrix with the semiclassical expansion, we systematically derive the Boltzmann transport equation for quarkonia with polarization dependence in the quantum optical limit. Unlike the spin-independent collision terms governed by certain chromoelectric field correlators, new gauge invariant correlators of chromomagnetic fields determine the recombination and dissociation terms with polarization dependence at the order we are working. We also derive a Lindblad equation describing the in-medium transitions between spin-singlet and spin-triplet heavy quark-antiquark pairs in the quantum Brownian motion limit. The Lindblad equation is governed by new transport coefficients defined in terms of the chromomagnetic field correlators. Our formalism is generic and valid for both weakly coupled and strongly coupled quark gluon plasmas. It can be further applied to study spin alignment of vector quarkonia in heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Stiffness and Flat-Band Superconductivity in Magic-Angle Graphene Probed by cQED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is a topic of keen interest in moir\'e systems research, and it may provide insight into the pairing mechanism of other strongly correlated materials such as high-$T_{\mathrm{c}}$ superconductors. Here, we use DC-transport and microwave circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) to measure directly the superfluid stiffness of superconducting MATBG via its kinetic inductance. We find the superfluid stiffness to be much larger than expected from conventional Fermi liquid theory; rather, it is comparable to theoretical predictions involving quantum geometric effects that are dominant at the magic angle. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness follows a power-law, which contraindicates an isotropic BCS model; instead, the extracted power-law exponents indicate an anisotropic superconducting gap, whether interpreted within the Fermi liquid framework or by considering quantum geometry of flat-band superconductivity. Moreover, a quadratic dependence of the superfluid stiffness on both DC and microwave current is observed, which is consistent with Ginzburg-Landau theory. Taken together, our findings indicate that MATBG is an unconventional superconductor with an anisotropic gap and strongly suggest a connection between quantum geometry, superfluid stiffness, and unconventional superconductivity in MATBG. The combined DC-microwave measurement platform used here is applicable to the investigation of other atomically thin superconductors.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of a Quantum-Optimal Coronagraph Using Spatial Mode Sorters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental demonstration of an ideal direct imaging coronagraph design capable of achieving the quantum limits of exoplanet detection and localization by using spatial mode filtering. Our benchtop experimental implementation performs a forward and inverse pass through a free-space programmable spatial mode sorter configured to isolate photons in a point spread function (PSF)-adapted mode basis. During the forward pass, the fundamental mode is rejected, effectively eliminating light from an on-axis point-like star. On the inverse pass, the remaining modes are coherently recombined, enabling direct imaging of a faint companion. Our experimental system is able to localize an artificial exoplanet at sub-diffraction distances from its host star with a 1000:1 star-planet contrast ratio. The ability to resolve faint companions of a host star at sub-diffraction scale is crucial to further the discovery of exoplanets predicted to reside in the sub-diffraction regime. These exoplanets are currently beyond the reach of state-of-the-art coronagraphs, which typically have an inner working angle (IWA) larger than the diffraction scale. Furthermore, our coronagraph architecture is potentially capable of measuring higher-fidelity spectrographs of exoplanets using spatial-spectral mode demultiplexing.</description>

      <title>Crystallinity in Niobium oxides: A pathway to mitigate Two-Level System Defects in Niobium 3D Resonator for quantum applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials imperfections in Nniobium based superconducting quantum circuits, in particular, two-level-system (TLS) defects, are a major source of decoherence, ultimately limiting the performance of quantum computation and sensing. Thus, identifying and understanding the microscopic origin of possible TLS defects in these devices and developing strategies to eliminate them is key to superconducting qubit performance improvement. In this paper, we demonstrate the reduction of two-level system losses in three-dimensional superconducting radio frequency (SRF) niobium resonators by a 10-hour high vacuum (HV) heat treatment at 650{\deg}C, even after exposure to air and high pressure rinsing (HPR). By probing the effect of this annealing on niobium samples using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we witness an alteration of the native oxide composition re-grown after air exposure and HPR and the creation of nano-scale crystalline oxide regions, which correlates with the measured tenfold quality factor enhancement at low fields of the 1.3 GHz niobium resonator.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce QICS (Quantum Information Conic Solver), an open-source primal-dual interior point solver fully implemented in Python, which is focused on solving optimization problems arising in quantum information theory. QICS has the ability to solve optimization problems involving the quantum relative entropy, noncommutative perspectives of operator convex functions, and related functions. It also includes an efficient semidefinite programming solver which exploits sparsity, as well as support for Hermitian matrices. QICS is also currently supported by the Python optimization modelling software PICOS. This paper aims to document the implementation details of the algorithm and cone oracles used in QICS, and serve as a reference guide for the software. Additionally, we showcase extensive numerical experiments which demonstrate that QICS outperforms state-of-the-art quantum relative entropy programming solvers, and has comparable performance to state-of-the-art semidefinite programming solvers.</description>
