      <title>Diffusion properties of small-scale fractional transport models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08068v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic transport due to a velocity field modeled by the superposition of small-scale divergence free vector fields activated by Fractional Gaussian Noises (FGN) is numerically investigated. We present two non-trivial contributions: the first one is the definition of a model where different space-time structures can be compared on the same ground: this is achieved by imposing the same average kinetic energy to a standard Ornstein-Uhlenbeck approximation, then taking the limit to the idealized white noise structure. The second contribution, based on the previous one, is the discover that a mixing spatial structure with persistent FGN in the Fourier components induces a classical Brownian diffusion of passive particles, with suitable diffusion coefficient; namely, the memory of FGN is lost in the space complexity of the velocity field.</description>

      <title>On a structure preserving closure of Langevin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a particle system obeying overdamped Langevin dynamics, we demonstrate that it is always possible to construct a thermodynamically consistent macroscopic model which obeys a gradient flow with respect to its non-equilibrium free energy. To do so, we significantly extend the recent Stochastic Thermodynamics with Internal Variables (STIV) framework, a method for producing macroscopic thermodynamic models far-from-equilibrium from the underlying mesoscopic dynamics and an approximate probability density of states parameterized with so-called internal variables. Though originally explored for Gaussian probability distributions, we here allow for an arbitrary choice of the approximate probability density while retaining a gradient flow dynamics. This greatly extends its range of applicability and automatically ensures consistency with the second law of thermodynamics, without the need for secondary verification. We demonstrate numerical convergence, in the limit of increasing internal variables, to the true probability density of states for both a multi-modal relaxation problem, a protein diffusing on a strand of DNA, and for an externally driven particle in a periodic landscape. Finally, we provide a reformulation of STIV with the quasi-equilibrium approximations in terms of the averages of observables of the mesostate, and show that these, too, obey a gradient flow.</description>

      <title>Pilot-waves and copilot-particles: A novel approach to objective collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extension of Schr\"odinger's equation that incorporates the macroscopic measurement-induced wavefunction collapse phenomenon. Our approach relies on a hybrid between Bohm-de Broglie pilot-wave and objective collapse theories. The Bohmian particle is guided by the wavefunction and, conversely, the wavefunction gradually localizes towards the particle's position. As long as the particle can visit any state, as in a typical microscopic system, the localization effect does not favor any particular quantum state and, on average, the usual Schr\"odinger-like time evolution results. However, when the wavefunction develops spatially well-separated lobes, as would happen during a macroscopic measurement, the Bohmian particle can remain trapped in one lobe, and the wavefunction eventually localizes there. The end result, in macroscopic systems, is a wavefunction collapse that is consistent with Born's rule. We illustrate the theory with a simple double-slit experiment simulation.</description>

      <title>Anomaly, Class Division, and Decoupling in Wealth Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic inequality is shaped by the agent-network structure, the interaction between agents, and the individual agent's ability. We provide a comprehensive picture of anomalous diffusion, economic class division, and bimodal wealth distribution in an agent-based model, where the allocation of heterogeneous agent abilities/growth rates is tuned in sparse regular networks.In particular, we focus on the statistical characteristics of logarithmic scaled normalized wealth distributions with two ability parameters, assortativity $\mathcal{A}$ and concentration $\mathcal{R}$. For the set of $(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{R})$, temporal behaviors of log-wealth distributions reveal that the decoupling between different ability groups depends primarily on $\mathcal{R}$ and long-term inequality depends mainly on $\mathcal{A}$. In other words, class division and decoupling are driven by $\mathcal{R}$, while the super-diffusive nature in the leading class is driven by $\mathcal{A}$. Our findings highlight that hierarchical segregation of abilities, rather than ability differences alone, is a key driver of economic class stratification. Finally, our model provides a minimal, yet powerful framework for understanding the bimodal global income distribution observed over the past half century and highlights the critical role of network-level segregation in shaping economic inequality.</description>

      <title>Nucleation kinetics in phase transformations with spatially correlated nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions ruled by nucleation and growth can occur by nonrandom arrangement of nuclei. This is verified, for instance, in thin film growth at solid surfaces by vapor condensation or by electrodeposition where, around each nucleus, a depletion zone of reactants sets up within which nucleation is prevented. In this contribution, a theoretical approach for the kinetics of phase transition with spatially correlated nuclei by progressive nucleation is developed. The work focuses on the rate of formation of the actual nuclei, a quantity that is necessary for describing the transformation kinetics. The approach is based on correlation functions and applied to treat hard-sphere interaction between nuclei. Computations have been performed for 2D and 3D growths by truncation of the series expansion in correlation functions up to second order terms. It is shown that the nucleation kinetics undergoes a transition from a typical Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA) behavior to one that is like the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (KJMA) kinetics. The time evolution of the volume fraction of the new phase is found to depend slightly on correlation radius. Such behavior is explained by the partial balancing between the reduction in nucleation density and the decrease in impingement events, which have opposite effects on the kinetics.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion with stochastic energy renewals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of intermittent energy injections on a Brownian particle, modeled as stochastic renewals of its kinetic energy to a fixed value. Between renewals, the particle follows standard underdamped Langevin dynamics. For energy renewals occurring at a constant rate, we find non-Boltzmannian energy distributions that undergo a shape transition driven by the competition between the velocity relaxation timescale and the renewal timescale. In the limit of rapid renewals, the dynamics mimics one-dimensional run-and-tumble motion, while at finite renewal rates, the effective diffusion coefficient exhibits non-monotonic behavior. To quantify the system's departure from equilibrium, we derive a modified fluctuation-response relation and demonstrate the absence of a consistent effective temperature. The dissipation is characterized by deviations from equilibrium-like response, captured via the Harada-Sasa relation. Finally, we extend the analysis to non-Poissonian renewal processes and introduce a dimensionless conversion coefficient that quantifies the thermodynamic cost of diffusion.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium fluctuation-response relations for state-current correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08877v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, novel exact identities known as Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs) have been derived for nonequilibrium steady states of Markov jump processes. These identities link the fluctuations of state or current observables to a combination of responses of these observables to perturbations of transition rates. Here, we complement these results by deriving analogous FRRs applicable to mixed covariances of one state and one current observable. We further derive novel Inverse FRRs expressing individual state or current response in terms of a combination of covariances rather than vice versa. Using these relations, we demonstrate that the breaking of the Onsager symmetry can occur only in the presence of state-current correlations. On the practical side, we demonstrate the applicability of FRRs for simplifying calculations of fluctuations in large Markov networks, we use them to explain the behavior of fluctuations in quantum dot devices or enzymatic reaction schemes, and discuss their potential relevance for model inference.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis and Random Matrix Theory Universality in Few-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Feingold-Peres model as an example, which is a well-known paradigm of quantum chaos. Using semiclassical analysis and numerical simulations, we study the statistical properties of observables in few-body systems with chaotic classical limits and the emergence of random matrix theory universality. More specifically, we focus on: 1) the applicability of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in few-body systems and the dependence of its form on the effective Planck constant and 2) the existence of a universal random matrix theory description of observables when truncated to a small microcanonical energy window. Our results provide new insights into the established field of few-body quantum chaos and help bridge it to modern perspectives, such as the general eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH).</description>

      <title>Mixed phases in feedback Ising models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mean-field Ising models whose coupling depends on the magnetization via a feedback function. We identify mixed phases (MPs) and show that they can be stable at zero temperature for sufficiently strong feedback. Moreover, stable MPs are always super-stable with perturbation decaying linearly in time. We argue that such feedback Ising models (FIMs) provide a useful framework for phase transformations between aligned phases via stable and unstable intermediate phases in multistable systems. We also analyze the dynamical behavior of FIMs driven by a time-varying magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Long-range dispersal promotes spatial synchrony but reduces the length and time scales of synchronous fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronous oscillations of spatially disjunct populations are widely observed in ecology. Even in the absence of spatially synchronized exogenous forces, metapopulations may synchronize via dispersal. For many species, most dispersal is local, but rare long-distance dispersal events also occur. While even small amounts of long-range dispersal are known to be important for processes like invasion and spatial spread rates, their potential influence on population synchrony is often overlooked, since local dispersal on its own can be strongly synchronizing. In this work, we investigate the effect of random, rare, long-range dispersal on the spatial synchrony of a metapopulation and find profound effects not only on synchrony but also on properties of the resulting spatial patterns. While controlling for the overall amount of emigration from each local subpopulation, we vary the fraction of dispersal that occurs locally (to nearest neighbors) versus globally (to random locations, irrespective of distance). Using a metric that measures the instantaneous level of global synchrony, we show that this form of long-range dispersal significantly favors the spatially synchronous state and homogenizes the population by decreasing the size of clusters of subpopulations that are out of phase with the rest of the metapopulation. Moreover, the addition of non-local dispersal significantly decreases the equilibration time of the metapopulation.</description>

      <title>Correcting a noisy quantum computer using a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers require error correction to achieve universal quantum computing. However, current decoding of quantum error-correcting codes relies on classical computation, which is slower than quantum operations in superconducting qubits. This discrepancy makes the practical implementation of real-time quantum error correction challenging. In this work, we propose a decoding scheme that leverages the operations of the quantum circuit itself. Given a noisy quantum circuit $A$, we train a decoding quantum circuit $B$ using syndrome measurements to identify the logical operators needed to correct errors in circuit $A$. The trained quantum circuit $B$ can be deployed on quantum devices, such as superconducting qubits, to perform real-time decoding and error correction. Our approach is applicable to general quantum codes with multiple logical qubits and operates efficiently under various noise conditions, and the decoding speed matches the speed of the quantum circuits being corrected. We have conducted numerical experiments using surface codes up to distance 7 under circuit-level noise, demonstrating performance on par with the classical minimum-weight perfect matching algorithm. Interestingly, our method reveals that the traditionally classical task of decoding error-correcting codes can be accomplished without classical devices or measurements. This insight paves the way for the development of self-correcting quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a tight-binding model that hosts both a quasi-periodic nature and marcoscopically-dengenerate zero-energy modes. The model can be regarded as a counterpart of the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper (AAH) model, which is a paradigmatic example of the quasi-periodic tight-binding model. Our main focus is on the many-body state where the flat-band-like degenerate zero-energy modes are fully occupied. We find a characteristic sublattice dependence of the particle density distribution. Further, by analyzing the hyperuniformity of the particle density distribution, we find that it belongs to the class-I hyperuniform distribution, regardless of the model parameter. We also show that, upon changing the parameter, the finite-energy modes exhibit the same extended-to-localized transition as that for the original AAH model.</description>

      <title>Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>

Abstract: A number of new functionalities have been added to the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) since it was last reviewed in this journal in 2002. ATAT can now handle multicomponent multisublattice alloy systems, nonconfigurational sources of entropy (e.g. vibrational and electronic entropy), Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS) generation, tensorial cluster expansion construction and includes interfaces for multiple atomistic or ab initio codes. This paper presents an overview of these features geared towards the practical use of the code. The extensions to the cluster expansion formalism needed to cover multicomponent multisublattice alloys are also formally demonstrated.</description>

Abstract: Multiplayer games on graphs are at the heart of theoretical descriptions of key evolutionary processes that govern vital social and natural systems. However, a comprehensive theoretical framework for solving multiplayer games with an arbitrary number of strategies on graphs is still missing. Here, we solve this by drawing an analogy with the Balls-and-Boxes problem, based on which we show that the local configuration of multiplayer games on graphs is equivalent to distributing $k$ identical co-players among $n$ distinct strategies. We use this to derive the replicator equation for any $n$-strategy multiplayer game under weak selection, which can be solved in polynomial time. As an example, we revisit the second-order free-riding problem, where costly punishment cannot truly resolve social dilemmas in a well-mixed population. Yet, in structured populations, we derive an accurate threshold for the punishment strength, beyond which punishment can either lead to the extinction of defection or transform the system into a rock-paper-scissors-like cycle. The analytical solution also qualitatively agrees with the phase diagrams that were previously obtained for non-marginal selection strengths. Our framework thus allows an exploration of any multi-strategy multiplayer game on regular graphs.</description>

      <title>How transformers learn structured data: insights from hierarchical filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the learning process and the embedded computation in transformers is becoming a central goal for the development of interpretable AI. In the present study, we introduce a hierarchical filtering procedure for data models of sequences on trees, allowing us to hand-tune the range of positional correlations in the data. Leveraging this controlled setting, we provide evidence that vanilla encoder-only transformers can approximate the exact inference algorithm when trained on root classification and masked language modeling tasks, and study how this computation is discovered and implemented. We find that correlations at larger distances, corresponding to increasing layers of the hierarchy, are sequentially included by the network during training. By comparing attention maps from models trained with varying degrees of filtering and by probing the different encoder levels, we find clear evidence of a reconstruction of correlations on successive length scales corresponding to the various levels of the hierarchy, which we relate to a plausible implementation of the exact inference algorithm within the same architecture.</description>

      <title>Breaking Mechanical Holography in Combinatorial Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial mechanical metamaterials are made of anisotropic, flexible blocks, such that multiple metamaterials may be constructed using a single block type, and the system's response strongly depends on the mutual orientations of the blocks within the lattice. We study a family of possible block types for the square, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Blocks that are centrally symmetric induce holographic order, such that mechanical compatibility (meaning that blocks do not impede each other's motion) implies bulk-boundary coupling. With them, one can design a compatible metamaterial that will deform in any desired texture only on part of its boundary. With blocks that break holographic order, we demonstrate how to design the deformation texture on the entire boundary. Correspondingly, the number of compatible holographic metamaterials scales exponentially with the boundary, while in non-holographic cases we show that it scales exponentially with the bulk.</description>

      <title>Defect Positioning in Combinatorial Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial mechanical metamaterials are made of anisotropic, flexible blocks, such that multiple metamaterials may be constructed using a single block type, and the system's response depends on the frustration (or its absence) due to the mutual orientations of the blocks within the lattice. Specifically, any minimal loop of blocks that may not simultaneously deform in their softest mode defines a mechanical defect at the vertex (in two dimensions) or edge (in three dimensions) that the loop encircles. Defects stiffen the metamaterial, and allow to design the spatial patterns of stress and deformation as the system is externally loaded. We study the ability to place defects at arbitrary positions in metamaterials made of a family of block types that we recently introduced for the square, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Alongside blocks for which we show that any defect configuration is possible, we identify situations in which not all sets are realizable as defects. One of the restrictions is that in three dimensions, defected edges form closed curves. Even in cases when not all geometries of defect lines are possible, we show how to produce defect lines of arbitrary knottedness.</description>

      <title>Quantum Statistics of Two Identical Particles and Modified Hong-Ou-Mandel Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to probe the quantum statistics of two identical particles. The transition between the quantum and classical statistics of two identical particles is described by the particles having identical multiple internal energy levels. We show that effective distinguishability emerges as the thermal energy increases with respect to the energy level spacing, and the mesoscopic regime bridges quantum indistinguishability and classical distinguishability. A realistic experimental approach is proposed using a two-particle interferometer, where the particles reach statistical equilibrium before the two-particle distribution is measured. The unitarity of the scattering/separation process ensures the preservation of the equilibrium distribution and allows a direct measurement of the two-particle statistical distribution. Our results show the transition between quantum and classical behavior of the two-particle distribution, which can be directly probed by a realistic experiment.</description>

      <title>Phase separation in a mixture of proliferating and motile active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proliferation and motility are ubiquitous drivers of activity in biological systems. Here, we study a dense binary mixture of motile and proliferating particles with exclusively repulsive interactions, where homeostasis in the proliferating subpopulation is maintained by pressure-induced removal. Using computer simulations, we show that phase separation emerges naturally in this system at high density and weak enough self-propulsion. We show that condensation is caused by interactions between motile particles induced by the growing phase, and recapitulate this behavior in an effective model of only motile particles with attractive interactions. Our results establish a new type of phase transition and pave a way to reinterpret the physics of dense cellular populations, such as bacterial colonies or tumors, as systems of mixed active matter.</description>
