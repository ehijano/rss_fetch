      <title>A gas-surface interaction algorithm for discrete velocity methods in predicting rarefied and multi-scale flows II: For CL boundary model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete velocity method (DVM) for rarefied flows and the unified methods (based on the DVM framework) for flows in all regimes have proven to be effective flow solvers over the past decades and have been successfully extended to other important physical fields. Both DVM and unified methods strive to physically model gas-gas interactions. However, for gas-surface interactions (GSI) at the wall boundary, they have only used the full accommodation boundary until now, which deviates from reality. Moreover, the accommodation degrees of momentum and thermal energy are often different. To overcome this limitation and extend the DVM and unified methods to more realistic boundary conditions, an algorithm for the Cercignani-Lampis (CL) boundary with different accommodation degrees of momentum and thermal energy is proposed and integrated into the DVM framework. A Gaussian distribution with slip velocity, including several undetermined parameters, is designed to describe the reflected distribution function. Once the accommodation coefficients (ACs) are known, these undetermined parameters are solved using the relationship between ACs and reflected macroscopic fluxes. In this paper, the Maxwell model and CLL model are adopted as benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the proposed CL model. Additionally, the current CL boundary for the DVM framework considers generality, accommodating both the recently developed efficient unstructured velocity space and the traditional Cartesian velocity space. Moreover, the proposed CL model allows for calculations of both monatomic gases and diatomic gases with internal degrees of freedom. Finally, by being integrated with the unified gas-kinetic scheme within the DVM framework, the performance of the present CL model is validated through a series of benchmark numerical tests across a wide range of Knudsen numbers.</description>

      <title>Modeling the effect of vorticity on inhaled transport in the upper airway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localized vortices can have significant influence on transport of inhaled particles through the upper respiratory tract. These vortices have complex three-dimensional structure with details dependent on the anatomical geometry. Using a highly simplified model, we demonstrate that changes in transport characteristics with geometric distortion can be estimated by accounting merely for the net strength and location of the vorticity in a two-dimensional projection. Test cases consider 30 L/min inhaled airflow containing suspended spherical water droplets from 1 micrometer to 30 micrometers in diameter through (1) a healthy upper respiratory tract and (2) a distorted variation mimicking a glottic tumor. The reduced-order model approximates the system by a two-dimensional potential flow with embedded point vortices having features derived from Large Eddy Simulations of inhaled airflow through anatomically realistic, tomography-based, three-dimensional tracts. The effects of vorticity and particle size on changes in particle transport are shown to be consistent between the reduced-order model and the full-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>FGM modeling considering preferential diffusion, flame stretch, and non-adiabatic effects for hydrogen-air premixed flame wall flashback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preferential diffusion plays an important role especially in hydrogen flames. Flame stretch significantly affects the flame structure and induces preferential diffusion. A problematic phenomenon occurring in real combustion devices is flashback, which is influenced by non-adiabatic effects, such as wall heat loss. In this paper, an extended flamelet-generated manifold (FGM) method that explicitly considers the preferential diffusion, flame stretch, and non-adiabatic effects is proposed. In this method, the diffusion terms in the transport equations of scalars, viz. the progress variable, mixture fraction, and enthalpy, are formulated employing non-unity Lewis numbers that are variable in space and different for each chemical species. The applicability of the extended FGM method to hydrogen flames is investigated using two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations of hydrogen-air flame flashback in channel flows. The results of the extended FGM method are compared with those of detailed calculations and other FGM methods. The two-dimensional numerical simulations show that considering both preferential diffusion and flame stretch improves the prediction accuracy of the mixture fraction distribution and flashback speed. The three-dimensional numerical simulations show that the prediction accuracy of the flashback speed, backflow region, and distributions of physical quantities near the flame front is improved by employing the extended FGM method, compared with the FGM method that considers only the heat loss effect. In particular, the extended FGM method successfully reproduced the relationship between the reaction rate and curvature. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the extended FGM method.</description>

      <title>Sensitivities of Free-Air RANS and DDES Methods on the High-Lift NASA CRM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reduce the time-to-market of future aircraft, it is crucial to predict the flight envelope accurately before building prototypes for flight tests. The High-Lift Prediction Workshop (HLPW) series aims to assess the numerical prediction capability of current CFD technology considering NASA's high-lift version of the Common Research Model (CRM-HL). The present work contributes to these collaborative efforts, quantifying sensitivities for RANS-based steady, unsteady, and hybrid RANS/LES scale-resolving approaches. Uncertainties associated with the choice of turbulence model, initialization strategies, grid resolution, and iterative convergence at free-air conditions are covered. Near stall, a large spread of RANS results was observed for different turbulence models and initialization strategies, while iterative convergence appeared less crucial for the present simulations. Steady and unsteady RANS simulations were unable to predict the correct flow physics near CLmax, even for large grids. Delayed Detached Eddy Simulations (DDES), however, showed good accuracy compared with wind-tunnel experiments and predicted CLmax with an error of around 5%. Compared to steady RANS, the computational cost of DDES was a factor of ten higher. Lessons learned and potential best-practice strategies are shared to aid future studies. While warm-started RANS simulations using SA models are recommended at lower angles of attack, scale-resolving methods are required near stall.</description>

      <title>Chaotic measures as an alternative to spectral measures for analysing turbulent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence has associated chaotic features. In the past couple of decades there has been growing interest in the study of these features as an alternative means of understanding turbulent systems. Our own input to this effort has been in contributing to the initial studies of chaos in Eulerian flow using direct numerical simulation (DNS). In this review we discuss the progress achieved in the turbulence community in understanding chaotic measures including our own work. A central relation between turbulence and chaos is one by Ruelle that connects the maximum Lyapunov exponent and the Reynolds number. The first DNS studies, ours amongst them, in obtaining this relation has shown the viability of chaotic simulation studies of Eulerian flow. Such chaotic measures and associated simulation methodology provides an alternative means to probe turbulent flow. Building on this, we have analyzed the finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) and studied its fluctuations, and found that chaotic measures could be quantified accurately even at small simulation box sizes where for comparative sizes spectral measures would be inconclusive. We further highlight applications of chaotic measures in analyzing phase transition behavior in turbulent flow and two dimensional thin layer turbulent systems. This work has shown chaotic measures are an excellent tool that can be used alongside spectral measures in studying turbulent flow.</description>

      <title>Modelling Wind Turbines via Actuator Lines in High-Order h/p Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper compares two actuator line methodologies for modelling wind turbines employing high-order h/p solvers and large-eddy simulations. The methods combine the accuracy of high-order solvers (in this work the maximum order is 6) with the computational efficiency of actuator lines to capture the aerodynamic effects of wind turbine blades.
  Comparisons with experiments validate the actuator line methodologies. We explore the effects of the polynomial order and the smoothing parameter associated with the Gaussian regularization function, and use them to blend the actuator line forcing in the high-order computational mesh, to show that both parameters influence the distribution of forces along the blades and the turbine wake. The greatest impact is obtained when the polynomial order is increased, allowing one to better capture the physics without requiring new meshes.
  When comparing the actuator line methodologies, we show the advantages of performing weighted sums, over element averages, to compute the blade velocities and forces in high-order solvers. For low-order simulations (low polynomial orders), both methods provide similar results, but as the polynomial order is increased, the weighted sum method shows smoother thrust/torque distributions and better wake resolution. Furthermore, cell averaging introduces nonphysical oscillations when increasing the polynomial order beyond 3 (4th order accuracy).</description>

      <title>Asymptotic scaling laws for periodic turbulent boundary layers and their numerical simulation up to Re_theta = 8300</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous analysis of the self-similar solution of the temporal turbulent boundary layer, recently proposed in [2], in which a body force is used to maintain a statistically steady turbulent boundary layer with periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise direction. We derive explicit expressions for the forcing amplitudes which can maintain such flows, and identify those which can hold either the displacement thickness or the momentum thickness equal to unity. This opens the door to the first main result of the paper, which is to prove upper bounds on skin friction for the temporal turbulent boundary layer. We use the Constantin-Doering-Hopf bounding method to show, rigorously, that the skin friction coefficient for periodic turbulent boundary layer flows is bounded above by a uniform constant which decreases asymptotically with Reynolds number. This asymptotic behaviour is within a logarithmic correction of well-known empirical scaling laws for skin friction. This gives the first evidence, applicable at asymptotically high Reynolds numbers, to suggest that the self-similar solution of the temporal turbulent boundary layer exhibits statistical similarities with canonical, spatially evolving, boundary layers. Furthermore, we show how the identified forcing formula implies an alternative, and simpler, numerical implementation of periodic boundary layer flows. We give a detailed numerical study of this scheme presenting direct numerical simulations up to Re_theta = 2000 and implicit large-eddy simulations up to Re_theta = 8300, and show that these results compare well with data from canonical spatially evolving boundary layers at equivalent Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Energetics of particle-size segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a continuum framework for the energetics of particle-size segregation in bidisperse granular flows. Building on continuum segregation equations and a recent segregation flux model, the proposed framework offers general analytical expressions to study the physics of granular flows from a mechanical energy perspective. To demonstrate the framework's applicability, we examined the energetics in shear-driven flows. Numerical experiments with varying frictional coefficients and particle-size ratios revealed two distinct phases in the associated energetics with particle segregation and diffusive remixing, and that the potential energy to the kinetic energy ratio in the steady state follows the scaling relationship $\hat{E}^{(s)}_{gp} / \hat{E}^{(s)}_{k} \propto Pe^{-1/2}_{sr}$ for $0.4 \leq Pe_{sr} \leq 300$, the segregation-rheology P\'eclet number. Our findings hint that the bulk segregation-mixing state can be predicted and controlled using $Pe_{sr}$, determined from known system parameters, providing a impactful tool for engineering and geophysical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the first steady traveling wave solutions of the 2D incompressible Euler equation that take the form of a contiguous vortex-patch dipole, which can be viewed as the vortex-patch counterpart of the well-known Lamb-Chaplygin dipole. Our construction is based on a novel fixed-point approach that determines the patch boundary as the fixed point of a certain nonlinear map. Smoothness and other properties of the patch boundary are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing of reacting flows via Hamiltonian simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the quantum computing of reacting flows by simulating the Hamiltonian dynamics. The scalar transport equation for reacting flows is transformed into a Hamiltonian system, mapping the dissipative and non-Hermitian problem in physical space to a Hermitian one in a higher-dimensional space. Using this approach, we develop the quantum spectral and finite difference methods for simulating reacting flows in periodic and general conditions, respectively. The present quantum computing algorithms offer a ``one-shot'' solution for a given time without temporal discretization, avoiding iterative quantum state preparation and measurement. We compare computational complexities of the quantum and classical algorithms. The quantum spectral method exhibits exponential acceleration relative to its classical counterpart, and the quantum finite difference method can achieve exponential speedup in high-dimensional problems. The quantum algorithms are validated on quantum computing simulators with the Qiskit package. The validation cases cover one- and two-dimensional reacting flows with a linear source term and periodic or inlet-outlet boundary conditions. The results obtained from the quantum spectral and finite difference methods agree with analytical and classical simulation results. They accurately capture the convection, diffusion, and reaction processes. This demonstrates the potential of quantum computing as an efficient tool for the simulation of reactive flows in combustion.</description>

      <title>Vortex Stretching of Non-premixed, Diluted Hydrogen/Oxygen Flamelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A three-dimensional flamelet model considering vortex stretching with unitary Lewis number is used to simulate diluted hydrogen-oxygen diffusion flames. Non-reacting nitrogen is used as the diluent gas in the fuel stream. Unitary Lewis number provides a common thermal and mass diffusivity from which to create scalar dissipation rate. Both stable and unstable branches of flammability curves (S-curves) are calculated with three vorticity levels and plotted against multiple input and output parameters. The description of the three-dimensional flamelet structure, allowing vorticity and variable density to produce a centrifugal effect, is seen to be necessary for an accurate determination of the water burning rate. Both maximum temperature and integrated water burning rate nearly collapse to a single curve when plotted versus maximum scalar dissipation rate but do not collapse when plotted versus the local maximum strain rate or the ambient strain rate; however, local strain rate and scalar dissipation rate depend strongly on vorticity and ambient strain rate. It is argued that the controlling inputs and natural parameters for a flamelet embedded in a turbulent eddy are the ambient vorticity and strain rate which are thus the natural parameterizing variables as opposed to local strain rate or scalar dissipation rate within the flame zone. Furthermore, established practices of the scaling of velocity derivatives exist in the literature while scaling laws for scalar gradients are sparse and unsubstantiated, further supporting the use of ambient parameterizing quantities.</description>

      <title>Life beyond Fritz: On the detachment of electrolytic bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an experimental study on detachment characteristics of hydrogen bubbles during electrolysis. Using a transparent (Pt or Ni) electrode enables us to directly observe the bubble contact line and bubble size. Based on these quantities we determine other parameters such as the contact angle and volume through solutions of the Young-Laplace equation. We observe bubbles without ('pinned bubbles') and with ('spreading bubbles') contact line spreading, and find that the latter mode becomes more prevalent if the concentration of HClO4 is greater than or equal to 0.1 M. The departure radius for spreading bubbles is found to drastically exceed the value predicted by the well-known formula of W. Fritz (Physik. Zeitschr. 1935, 36, 379-384) for this case. We show that this is related to the contact line hysteresis, which leads to pinning of the contact line after an initial spreading phase at the receding contact angle. The departure mode is then similar to a pinned bubble and occurs once the contact angle reaches the advancing contact angle of the surface. A prediction for the departure radius based on these findings is found to be consistent with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Discovery of knowledge of wall-bounded turbulence via symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of high performance computer and experimental technology, the study of turbulence has accumulated a large number of high fidelity data. However, few general turbulence knowledge has been found from the data. So we use the symbolic regression (SR) method to find a new mixing length formula which is generally valid in wall-bounded turbulence, and this formula has physical interpretation that it has correct asymptotic relationships in viscous sublayer,buffer layer, log-law region and outer region. Coupled with Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver, we test several classic cases. The prediction results fully demonstrate the accuracy and generalization of the formula. So far, we have found that SR method can help us find general laws from complex turbulent systems, and it is expected that through this 'white box' machine learning method, more turbulence knowledge with physical interpretation can be found in the future.</description>

      <title>A hyperbolic-elliptic PDE model and conservative numerical method for gravity-dominated variably-saturated groundwater flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Richards equation is often used to represent two-phase fluid flow in an unsaturated porous medium when one phase is much heavier and more viscous than the other. However, it cannot describe the fully saturated flow for some capillary functions without specialized treatment due to degeneracy in the capillary pressure term. Mathematically, gravity-dominated variably saturated flows are interesting because their governing partial differential equation switches from hyperbolic in the unsaturated region to elliptic in the saturated region. Moreover, the presence of wetting fronts introduces strong spatial gradients often leading to numerical instability. In this work, we develop a robust, multidimensional mathematical model and implement a well-known efficient and conservative numerical method for such variably saturated flow in the limit of negligible capillary forces. The elliptic problem in saturated regions is integrated efficiently into our framework by solving a reduced system corresponding only to the saturated cells using fixed head boundary conditions in the unsaturated cells. In summary, this coupled hyperbolic-elliptic PDE framework provides an efficient, physics-based extension of the hyperbolic Richards equation to simulate fully saturated regions. Finally, we provide a suite of easy-to-implement yet challenging benchmark test problems involving saturated flows in one and two dimensions. These simple problems, accompanied by their corresponding analytical solutions, can prove to be pivotal for the code verification, model validation (V&amp;V) and performance comparison of simulators for variably saturated flow. Our numerical solutions show an excellent comparison with the analytical results for the proposed problems.

      <title>Magnetic Fields in Multiphase Turbulence: Impacts on Dynamics and Structure</title>

Abstract: Both multiphase gas and magnetic fields are ubiquitous in astrophysics. However, the influence of magnetic fields on mixing of the different phases is still largely unexplored. In this study, we use both turbulent radiative mixing layer (TRML) and turbulent box simulations to examine the effects of magnetic fields on cold gas growth rates, survival, and the morphology of the multiphase gas. Our findings indicate that, in general, magnetic fields suppress mixing in TRMLs while turbulent box simulations show comparatively marginal differences in growth rates and survival of the cold gas. We reconcile these two seemingly contrasting results by demonstrating that similar turbulent properties result in comparable mixing -- regardless of the presence or absence of magnetic fields. We, furthermore, find the cold gas clump size distribution to be independent of the magnetic fields but the clumps are more filamentary in the MHD case. Synthetic MgII absorption lines support this picture being marginally different with and without magnetic fields; both cases aligning well with observations. We also examine the magnetic field strength and structure in turbulent boxes. We generally observe a higher mean magnetic field in the cold gas phase due to flux freezing and reveal fractal-like magnetic field lines in a turbulent environment.</description>

      <title>Topological modes and spectral flows in inhomogeneous PT-symmetric continuous media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical Hermitian continuous media, the spectral-flow index of topological modes is linked to the bulk topology via index theorem. However, the interface between two bulks is usually non-Hermitian due to the inhomogeneities of system parameters. We show that the connection between topological modes and bulk topology still exists despite the non-Hermiticity at the interface if the system is endowed with PT symmetry. The theoretical framework developed is applied to the Hall magnetohydrodynamic model to identify a topological mode called topological Alfv\'{e}n-sound wave in magnetized plasmas.</description>

      <title>Limits to extreme event forecasting in chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16512</link>

Abstract: Predicting extreme events in chaotic systems, characterized by rare but intensely fluctuating properties, is of great importance due to their impact on the performance and reliability of a wide range of systems. Some examples include weather forecasting, traffic management, power grid operations, and financial market analysis, to name a few. Methods of increasing sophistication have been developed to forecast events in these systems. However, the boundaries that define the maximum accuracy of forecasting tools are still largely unexplored from a theoretical standpoint. Here, we address the question: What is the minimum possible error in the prediction of extreme events in complex, chaotic systems? We derive the minimum probability of error in extreme event forecasting along with its information-theoretic lower and upper bounds. These bounds are universal for a given problem, in that they hold regardless of the modeling approach for extreme event prediction: from traditional linear regressions to sophisticated neural network models. The limits in predictability are obtained from the cost-sensitive Fano's and Hellman's inequalities using the R\'enyi entropy. The results are also connected to Takens' embedding theorem using the information can't hurt inequality. Finally, the probability of error for a forecasting model is decomposed into three sources: uncertainty in the initial conditions, hidden variables, and suboptimal modeling assumptions. The latter allows us to assess whether prediction models are operating near their maximum theoretical performance or if further improvements are possible. The bounds are applied to the prediction of extreme events in the R\"ossler system and the Kolmogorov flow.</description>

      <title>From hydrodynamics to dipolar colloids: modeling complex interactions and self-organization with generalized potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The self-organization of clusters of particles is a fundamental phenomenon across various physical systems, including hydrodynamic and colloidal systems. One example is that of dense spherical particles submerged in a fluid and subjected to horizontal oscillations. The interaction of the particles with the oscillating flow leads to the formation of one-particle-thick chains or multiple-particle-wide bands. In this study, we model the hydrodynamic interactions between such particles and parallel chains using simplified potentials. We first focus on the hydrodynamic interactions between chains, which we characterize using data from numerical simulations. Based on these interactions, we propose a simplified model potential, called the Siren potential, which combines the representative hydrodynamic interactions: short-range attraction, mid-range repulsion, and long-range attraction. Through one-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations, we successfully replicate the characteristic patterns observed in hydrodynamic experiments and draw the phase diagram for the model potential. We extend our analysis to two-dimensional systems, introducing a dipole-capillary model potential that accounts for both chain formation and Siren-like chain interactions. This potential is based on colloidal particles at an interface, where chain formation is driven by an external electric field inducing a dipole moment parallel to the interface in each particle. The capillary force contributes the long-range attraction. Starting with parallel chains, the patterns in the two-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of this colloidal system are similar to those observed in the hydrodynamic experiments. Still, the model potentials help clarify the dynamic behavior of the particles and chains due to the complex interactions encountered in both hydrodynamic and colloidal systems, drawing parallels between them.</description>
