      <title>Error correction, authentication, and false acceptance, probabilities for communication over noisy quantum channels: converse upper bounds on the bit transmission rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain strict upper bounds on the bit transmission rate for communication of Classical bit codewords over Quantum channels. Albeit previous arguments in arXiv: 1804.01797 which have demonstrated that lower bounds can be shown to hold for the bit transmission rate without the presence of significant noise over the channel shared by Alice and Bob for the purposes of encoding, decoding, transmission and authentication, the author suggests that upper bounding the bit transmission rate could be of use towards classifying paradoxical aspects of communication protocols, as well as constructing error correcting codes which are resilient to noise. The upper bound that is obtained in this work for the bit transmission rate, as a converse result, is dependent upon the natural logarithm of the size of each player's alphabet, as well as smaller alphabets, which can be leveraged for simultaneously realizing Quantum advantage for maximizing error correction and minimizing false acceptance. Crucially, the upper bound to the bit transmission rate is dependent upon a pruning procedure, which seeks to determine whether letters from player's alphabets can be removed so that prospective Quantum advantage, in order for Alice and Bob to implement error correction protocols with high probability, despite the fact that there is more noise over the channel between Alice and Bob in comparison to that between Bob and Eve.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reflection Effects in the Diffraction of Matter Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the fundamental quantum effects, quantum reflection (QR) is one of the most notable phenomena. Approximating arbitrary potentials in the Schr\"odinger equation as multistep potentials allows us to determine the reflection coefficient by means of a Riccati equation. We introduce a measure for the wavefunction's characteristic reflection distance and derive an analytical expression for this reflection point in an arbitrary power-law potential. We study the associated QR rate in the context of Casimir--Polder atom surface interactions, revealing its strong dependence on critical parameters such as velocity and interaction duration. As an application, we demonstrate how the matter-wave diffraction of a low-velocity metastable Argon beam impinging on a rotated grating facilitates high-precision potential analysis.</description>

      <title>STABSim: A Parallelized Clifford Simulator with Features Beyond Direct Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient stabilizer-based computation is a key task in quantum computing as it provides a classically tractable insight into quantum algorithms, which otherwise quickly become impossible at scale on a classical device. Formulations in quantum error correction, hardware verification, hybrid computing, and more, all benefit from the ability of Clifford gates to be accurately evaluated by classical computers. However, current stabilizer simulators have significant limitations in scaling and use-case beyond direct simulation. To address this, we present a GPU-accelerated tableau stabilizer simulator that scales efficiently in direct circuit simulation, and supports a range of stabilizer-based tasks. We show how the simulator is used to quickly calculate Pauli commutation groupings between Pauli strings to reduce the number of circuit runs in quantum chemistry problems. We also present a Clifford+T circuit transpiler based on STABSim, which uses the simulator framework to track relations in non-Clifford rotations as Clifford gates are absorbed into the measurement step of the circuit. The T rotation layers left behind are then further optimized in the simulator structure to create a reduced circuit containing only the minimum non-Clifford rotations, improving the time to simulate and reducing the cost to run on real quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Estimating Quantum Execution Requirements for Feature Selection in Recommender Systems Using Extreme Value Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing have significantly accelerated research into quantum-assisted information retrieval and recommender systems, particularly in solving feature selection problems by formulating them as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems executable on quantum hardware. However, while existing work primarily focuses on effectiveness and efficiency, it often overlooks the probabilistic and noisy nature of real-world quantum hardware. In this paper, we propose a solution based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to quantitatively assess the usability of quantum solutions. Specifically, given a fixed problem size, the proposed method estimates the number of executions (shots) required on a quantum computer to reliably obtain a high-quality solution, which is comparable to or better than that of classical baselines on conventional computers. Experiments conducted across multiple quantum platforms (including two simulators and two physical quantum processors) demonstrate that our method effectively estimates the number of required runs to obtain satisfactory solutions on two widely used benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Qumode-Based Quantum Image Storage with Entropy-Guided Frame Indexing and Fidelity-Preserved Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I propose a novel framework for quantum image storage using continuous-variable (CV) photonic systems. Unlike traditional qubit-based approaches, this model encodes grayscale image intensities into qumodes via coherent-state displacement operators. A delta evolution mechanism enables memory efficient storage by recording only intensity shifts between frames. To support scalable retrieval, I introduce entropy based frame indexing using von Neumann entropy. The proposed system is simulated using Strawberry Fields, demonstrating partial fidelity preservation and coherent phase-space behavior via Wigner function visualization. This approach offers a promising pathway toward scalable, photonic-compatible quantum memory models for quantum vision and imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum measurements for additive information and disturbance measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive measures for information and disturbance in quantum measurements of a system are defined from well-known multiplicative measures such as estimation and operation fidelities using a logarithm. This is motivated by the fact that information and disturbance are naturally assumed to be additive while performing independent measurements on separable systems. Although the additivity makes no remarkable difference when information and disturbance are separately considered, it can change measurements that only introduce minimal disturbance relative to the amount of information. Such optimal measurements are shown for additive information and disturbance measures with a tradeoff relationship.</description>

      <title>Optimising germanium hole spin qubits with a room-temperature magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Germanium spin qubits exhibit strong spin-orbit interaction, which allow for high-fidelity qubit control, but also provide a strong dependence on the magnetic field. Superconducting vector magnets are often used to minimize dephasing due to hyperfine interactions and to maximize spin control, but these compromise the sample space and thus challenge scalability. Here, we explore whether a permanent magnet outside the cryostat can be used as an alternative. Operating in a hybrid mode with an internal and external magnet, we find that we can fine-tune the magnetic field to an in-plane orientation. We obtain a qubit dephasing time T2*=13 microseconds, Hahn-echo times T2H=88 microseconds, and an average single-qubit Clifford gate fidelity above 99.9%, from which we conclude that room temperature magnets allow for high qubit performance. Furthermore, we probe the qubit resonance frequency using only the external magnet, with the internal superconducting magnet switched off. Our approach may be used to scale semiconductor qubits and use the increased sample space for the integration of cryogenic control circuitry and wiring to advance to large-scale quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Theory of Three-Photon Transport Through a Weakly Coupled Atomic Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding multi-photon interactions in non-equilibrium quantum systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum optics. In this work, we develop an analytical and diagrammatic framework to explore three-photon interactions in atomic ensembles weakly coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. Taking advantage of the weak coupling, we use our diagrammatic framework to perform perturbation theory and calculate the leading-order contributions to the three-photon wavefunction, which would otherwise be intractable. We then compute the outgoing photon wavefunction of a resonantly driven atomic ensemble, with photon-photon interactions truncated up to three photons. Our formulation not only captures the individual transmission of photons but also isolates the connected S-matrix elements that embody genuine photon-photon correlations. Through detailed analysis, we obtain the analytic expressions of the connected third-order correlation function and the third-order electric-field-quadrature cumulant, which reveal non-Gaussian signatures emerging from the interplay of two- and three-photon processes. We also calculate the optical depth where non-Gaussian photon states can be observed. Numerical simulations based on a cascaded master equation validate our analytical predictions on a small-scale system. These results provide a formalism to further explore non-equilibrium quantum optics in atomic ensembles and extend this to the regime of non-Gaussian photon transport.</description>

      <title>Spatial Leggett-Garg Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a spatial extension of the Leggett-Garg inequality by considering three distant observers locally measuring a many-body system at three subsequent times. The spatial form, in particular, is specially suited to analyze propagation of quantum perturbations through spin chains, by capturing how a measurement at one site can later affect distant sites due to the interactions. We illustrate our proposal for a Heisenberg chain in a magnetic field, showing indeed that the first inequality-violation time scales proportionally to the distance between measuring parties. We attribute this phenomenon to Lieb-Robinson physics and, confirming this connection, we find that violations are anticipated when increasing the interaction range. The inequality violation, readily observable in current experiments, demonstrates the incompatibility between two-point correlation functions and the macrorealistic hypothesis. In outlook, spatial Leggett-Garg inequalities constitute a new tool for analyzing the non-relativistic dynamics of many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for the Fixed-Radius Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neighbor search is a computationally demanding problem, usually both time- and memory-consuming. The main problem of this kind of algorithms is the long execution time due to cache misses. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm for the Fixed RAdius Neighbor Search problem (FRANS) based on the fixed-point version of Grover's algorithm. We derive an efficient circuit for solving the FRANS with linear query complexity with the number of particles $N$. The quantum circuit returns the list of all the neighbors' pairs within the fixed radius, together with their distance, avoiding the slow down given by cache miss. We explicitly write the Grover's operator and analyze its gate complexity. The whole algorithm has complexity of $\mathcal{O}(M^{\frac{1}{2}}N^{2})$ in the worst-case scenario, where $M$ is the number of neighboring pairs, and uses $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ number of qubits. By employing extra ancilla qubits the depth of the circuit can be brought down to $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ at the cost of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ qubits for unstructured dataset, or $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(\log N))$ qubits for structured datasets. Finally we assess the resilience of the model to the readout error, suggesting an error correction-free strategy to check the accuracy of the results.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium thermometry via an ensemble of initially correlated qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an nonequilibrium quantum thermometry protocol in which an ensemble of qubits, acting as temperature probes, is weakly coupled to a macroscopic thermal bath. The temperature of the bath, the parameter of interest, is encoded in the dissipator of a Markovian thermalization process. For some relevant initial states, we observe a peak in the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) during the transient of the thermalization, indicating enhanced sensitivity in early-time dynamics. This effect becomes more pronounced at higher bath temperatures and is further enhanced when the qubits' initial state has a larger ground-state population. Our analysis shows that both local coherence in the probes' initial state and initial correlations among the probes contribute to the amplification of the peak in the QFI, thus improving the precision of the temperature estimation. The influence of quantum correlations emerges as a central feature of this work. Although the dynamics does not permit superlinear scaling of the QFI with the number of probes, we identify the most effective initial states for designing high-precision quantum sensors within this setting. We also provide concrete guidelines for experimental implementations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Constrained Quantum Metrology: Rapid Low-Entanglement Gains, Tapered High-Level Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a specific type of quantum correlated state that achieves optimal precision in parameterestimation under unitary encoding. We consider the potential experimental limitation on probe entanglement, and find a relation between achievable precision and initial probe entanglement, in both bipartite and multipartite scenarios. For two-qubit probes, we analytically derive an exact relationship between the entanglement-constrained optimal quantum Fisher information and the limited initial entanglement, measured via both generalized geometric measure and entanglement entropy. We demonstrate that this fundamental relationship persists across the same range of the entanglement measures even when higher-dimensional bipartite probes are considered. Furthermore, we identify the specific states that realize maximum precision in these scenarios. Additionally, by considering the geometric measure of entanglement, we extend our approach to multiqubit probes. We find that in every case, the optimal quantum Fisher information exhibits a universal behavior:a steep increase in the low-entanglement regime, followed by a gradual and nearly-saturated improvement as the probe entanglement approaches values close to those required for achieving the Heisenberg limit.</description>

      <title>Security of quantum key distribution with source and detector imperfections through phase-error estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises information-theoretic security based on quantum mechanics, but practical implementations face security vulnerabilities due to device imperfections. Recent advances have separately addressed source and detector imperfections in phase-error-estimation based security proof frameworks, but this is not enough to protect real-world QKD systems suffering from both types of imperfections simultaneously. In this work, we show that existing techniques for BB84-type protocols can be combined to construct a unified security proof that simultaneously accounts for both source and detector imperfections. Our approach thus represents a significant step towards closing the gap between theoretical security proofs and practical QKD implementations.</description>

      <title>Smarter Usage of Measurement Statistics Can Greatly Improve Continuous Variable Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing is a machine learning scheme in which a quantum system is used to perform information processing. A prospective approach to its physical realization is a photonic platform in which continuous variable (CV) quantum information methods are applied. The simplest CV quantum states are Gaussian states, which can be efficiently simulated classically. As such, they provide a benchmark for the level of performance that non-Gaussian states should surpass in order to give a quantum advantage. In this article we propose two methods to extract more performance from Gaussian states compared to previous protocols. We consider better utilization of the measurement distribution by sampling its cumulative distribution function. We show it provides memory in areas that conventional approaches are lacking, as well as improving the overall processing capacity of the reservoir. We also consider storing past measurement results in classical memory, and show that it improves the memory capacity and can be used to mitigate the effects of statistical noise due to finite measurement ensemble.</description>

      <title>Circuit-QED simulator of the Bose-Hubbard model for quantum spin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an experimentally feasible circuit-QED Bose-Hubbard simulator that reproduces the complex spin dynamics of Heisenberg models. Our method relies on mapping spin-1/2 systems onto bosonic states via the polynomially expanded Holstein-Primakoff (HP) transformation. The HP transformation translates the intricate behavior of spins into a representation that is compatible with bosonic devices like those in a circuit QED setup. For comparison, we also implement the Dyson-Maleev (DM) encoding for spin-1/2 and show that, in this limit, DM and HP are equivalent. We show the equivalence of the DM and the HP transformations for spin-1/2 systems. Rigorous numerical analyses confirm the effectiveness of our HP-based protocol. Specifically, we obtain the concurrence between the spin dynamics and the behavior of microwave photons within our circuit QED-based analog simulator that is designed for the Bose-Hubbard model. By utilizing the microwave photons inherent to circuit QED devices, our framework presents an accessible, scalable avenue for probing quantum spin dynamics in an experimentally viable setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Part I of this article discussed the quantum measurement process within the de Broglie-Bohm theory. In the experiment considered, the outcome of the measurements was primarily determined by the initial Bohmian positions within the measurement apparatus. This is nevertheless not always the case. Part II is a short addendum with a more general discussion: cases where the measurement results reveal the values of the positions attached to the measured system, the measurement apparatus, or both, are considered.</description>

      <title>Shaping Cold Atom Clouds with a Vortex Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for shaping a cold atom cloud using a vortex laser beam with a polarisation singularity at its center, which creates a point of vanishing intensity. Exploiting this feature we experimentally demonstrate two different schemes to create micron-scaled line- and sheet-like atomic density distributions. In the dynamic scheme, atoms in the bright beam regions are accelerated and therefore effectively removed from the cloud. In the dark-state scheme, these atoms are pumped into a state that does not interact with the shaping light. In both cases, an atomic distribution remains, either as a thin line or as a sheet when an additional polarizer is used. We find good agreement between the experimental results and our theoretical model, which predicts the method to be in principle not diffraction-limited.</description>

      <title>Compact detector for atom-atom correlations on an atom chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compact, ionization-based detector for the state-selective and spatially resolved measurement of individual Rydberg atoms trapped in the vicinity of an atom chip. The system combines an electrostatic lens system for guiding charged particles with an array of channel electron multipliers (CEMs) capable of detecting both ions and electrons produced by ionization. Designed for quantum information applications, this device enables the detection of correlations between spatially separated Rydberg qubits. Additionally, the electrodes provide compensation for stray electric fields and control over particle trajectories. The imaging system achieves a total magnification of more than 12, with a single-axis magnification up to 200, while maintaining low aberrations. We characterize the performance of the system using a charged particle trajectory simulation software and discuss how a coincidence measurement of ions and electrons can be used to calibrate the detection efficiency. This detector enables high-fidelity measurement of multiple Rydberg atoms and is well-suited for applications in cavity-mediated quantum gates.</description>

      <title>High-power readout of a transmon qubit using a nonlinear coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of superconducting qubits is constantly evolving with new circuit designs. However, when it comes to qubit readout, the use of simple transverse linear coupling remains overwhelmingly prevalent. This standard readout scheme has significant drawbacks: in addition to the Purcell effect, it suffers from a limitation on the maximal number of photons in the readout mode, which restricts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) nature of the readout. Here, we explore the high-power regime by engineering a nonlinear coupling between a transmon qubit and its readout mode. Our approach builds upon previous work by Dassonneville et al. [Physical Review X 10, 011045 (2020)], on qubit readout with a non-perturbative cross-Kerr coupling in a transmon molecule. We demonstrate a readout fidelity of 99.21% with 89 photons utilizing a parametric amplifier. At this elevated photon number, the QND nature remains high at 96.7%. Even with up to 300 photons, the QNDness is only reduced by a few percent. This is qualitatively explained by deriving a critical number of photons associated to the nonlinear coupling, yielding a theoretical value of $\bar{n}_r^\text{crit} = 377$ photons for our sample's parameters. These results highlight the promising performance of the transmon molecule in the high-power regime for high-fidelity qubit readout.</description>

      <title>Awesome Quantum Computing Experiments: Benchmarking Experimental Progress Towards Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) demands simultaneous progress in physical qubit performance and quantum error correction (QEC). This work reviews and benchmarks experimental advancements towards FTQC across leading platforms, including trapped ions, superconducting circuits, neutral atoms, NV centers, and semiconductors. We analyze key physical metrics like coherence times, entanglement error, and system size (qubit count), fitting observed exponential trends to characterize multi-order-of-magnitude improvements over the past two decades. At the logical level, we survey the implementation landscape of QEC codes, tracking realized parameters $[[n, k, d]]$ and complexity from early demonstrations to recent surface and color code experiments. Synthesizing these physical and logical benchmarks reveals substantial progress enabled by underlying hardware improvements, while also outlining persistent challenges towards scalable FTQC. The experimental databases and analysis code underpinning this review are publicly available at https://github.com/francois-marie/awesome-quantum-computing-experiments.</description>

      <title>A Resource Efficient Quantum Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum processors may enhance machine learning by mapping high-dimensional data onto quantum systems for processing. Conventional quantum kernels, or feature maps, for encoding data features onto a quantum circuit are currently impractical, as the number of entangling gates scales quadratically with the dimension of the dataset and the number of qubits. In this work, we introduce a quantum kernel designed to handle high-dimensional data with a significantly reduced number of qubits and entangling operations. Our approach preserves essential data characteristics while promoting computational efficiency, as evidenced by extensive experiments on benchmark datasets that demonstrate a marked improvement in both accuracy and resource utilization, as compared to state-of-the-art quantum feature maps. Our noisy simulations results combined with lower resource requirements highlight our kernel's ability to function within the constraints of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Through numerical simulations and small-scale implementation on a superconducting circuit quantum computing platform, we demonstrate that our scheme performs on par or better than a set of classical algorithms for classification. Our findings herald a promising avenue for the practical implementation of quantum machine learning algorithms on near future quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Access Model for Sparse Structured Matrices using Linear Combination of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach for Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) type decomposition for structured sparse matrices. Such matrices frequently arise during numerical solution of partial differential equations which are ubiquitous in science and engineering. LCU is a versatile quantum algorithmic primitive that plays an important role in context of both variational quantum algorithms (VQA) and fully fault-tolerant ones, and has been applied to a diverse range of problems. Conventionally, Pauli basis is used for LCU decomposition, which however in worst case can result in number of LCU terms that scale quadratically with respect to the matrix size. We show that by using an alternate basis one can better exploit the sparsity and underlying structure of matrix leading to number of tensor product terms which scale only logarithmically with respect to the matrix size. We develop numerical and semi-analytical approaches for computing sigma basis decomposition for an arbitrary matrix. Given this new basis is comprised of non-unitary operators, we employ the concept of unitary completion to design efficient quantum circuits for evaluation of the expectation values of operators composed of tensor product of elements from sigma basis which can be used for cost function evaluation in VQAs. We also develop an approach for block encoding of arbitrary operator given its decomposition in sigma basis which could be used in variety of fully fault-tolerant algorithms. We compare our approach with other related concepts in the literature including unitary dilation and provide numerical illustrations on several PDE examples.</description>

      <title>Compact Fiber-Coupled Narrowband Two-Mode Squeezed Light Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum correlated states of light, such as squeezed states, are a fundamental resource for the development of quantum technologies, as they are needed for applications in quantum metrology, quantum computation, and quantum communications. It is thus critical to develop compact, efficient, and robust sources to generate such states. Here we report on a compact, narrowband, fiber-coupled source of two-mode squeezed states of light at 795 nm based on four wave mixing (FWM) in a $^{85}$Rb atomic vapor. The source is designed in a small modular form factor, with two input fiber-coupled beams, the seed and pump beams required for the FWM, and two output fibers, one for each of the modes of the squeezed state. The system is optimized for low pump power (135 mW) to achieve a maximum intensity-difference squeezing of 4.4 dB after the output fibers at an analysis frequency of 1 MHz. The narrowband nature of the source makes it ideal for atomic-based quantum sensing and quantum networking configurations that rely on atomic quantum memories. Such a source paves the way for a versatile and portable platform for applications in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum melting of quasiperiodic attractors in driven-dissipative cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear classical mechanics has established countless intriguing and profound phenomena. These include limit tori defined by toroidal attractors that support quasiperiodic motion of at least two incommensurate frequencies. Here we address the question, whether and how such phenomena persist in open quantum systems. We develop a quantum description of limit tori within the Lindblad master-equation formalism for a system of two coupled driven-dissipative Kerr cavities. Using the spectral theory of the Liouvillian and the truncated Wigner approximation, we analyze the system across the quantum-to-classical transition. In the classical limit, we identify two pairs of purely imaginary Liouvillian eigenvalues, corresponding to persistent quasiperiodic modes of the limit torus. Quantum fluctuations induce small negative real parts to these eigenvalues, giving rise to finite lifetimes of these modes. The corresponding Liouvillian gaps vanish algebraically in the classical limit. This behavior signals a genuine continuous dynamical phase transition, marked by the spontaneous breaking of time-translational symmetry. Analysis of individual quantum trajectories reveals quantum-fluctuation-induced dephasing as the primary mechanism behind this "quantum melting" of the torus. We quantify this dephasing using a circular-variance-based order parameter, revealing universal scaling with both system size and time. These scaling laws are robust and independent of microscopic parameters. Our results establish the quantum melting of limit tori as a distinct non-equilibrium critical phenomenon and provide concrete signatures for experimental observation in trapped ions and superconducting circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study measurement-induced phase transitions in quantum circuits consisting of kicked Ising models with postselected weak measurements, whose dynamics can be mapped onto a classical dynamical system. For a periodic (Floquet) non-unitary evolution, such circuits are exactly tractable and admit volume-to-area law transitions. We show that breaking time-translation symmetry down to a quasiperiodic (Fibonacci) time evolution leads to the emergence of a critical phase with tunable effective central charge and with a fractal origin. Furthermore, for some classes of random non-unitary circuits, we demonstrate the robustness of the volume-to-area law phase transition for arbitrary random realizations, thanks to the emergent compactness of the classical map encoding the circuit's dynamics.</description>

      <title>High-harmonic spectroscopy of the nonadiabatic coupling via Floquet-Bloch states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong laser light drives complex quantum electron dynamics in solids, which is captured by the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process. Here we report the observation of laser-dressed Floquet-Bloch states (FBSs) at the edge of the Brillouin zone (BZ) in HHG, by driving a large-bandgap MgO crystal in the strong-field regime where the laser pulse is intense enough both to accelerate electrons to the BZ edge as well as to dress the bands. We experimentally show and numerically confirm that the HHG spectrum encodes the nonadiabatic coupling between the conduction bands and FBSs, induced by the high-intensity driver, when some high harmonics are resonant with the dressed band structure. This enables us to trace the bandgap morphology - expanding HHG-spectroscopy techniques to cover the HHG tomography of the BZ edge.</description>

      <title>Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry with cavity QED-based single-photon sources: A Quantum Jump Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum jump/trajectory analysis of the two-photon interference phenomenon in the context of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect (HOME). In particular, we consider the standard setup of HOME, which consists of two-photon sources firing single photons from the opposite sides of a 50/50 beam splitter and two perfect detectors placed at the output ports to record photodetection events. For single-photon sources, we consider two special cases: (1) two excited two-level atoms and (2) two atom-cavity setups with initially present single photons in both cavities. For both cases, we report analytic results as well as quantum jump-based Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the signatures of these single-photon sources on the HOME under different working conditions (for example, strong- and weak-coupling regimes of cavity quantum electrodynamics). Our results may have interesting applications in linear optics quantum computing as well as in protocols that test the indistinguishability of single-photon sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics offers a fundamentally unpredictable entropy source due to the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum measurements, making it attractive for secure random number generation. This paper explores the practicality of generating random numbers from two quantum platforms: gate-based circuits on IBM Quantum and (Gaussian) boson sampling with Xanadu Borealis. We implement simple post-processing methods, including the classic Von Neumann extractor and two tailored variants designed to address the correlated structure of boson sampling outputs. We evaluate debiased output from real quantum hardware using the NIST SP800-22r1a test suite and measure the extraction efficiency of each debiasing method. Results show that, while unbiased bitstreams can be achieved on both platforms, throughput remains low and cost per random bit is high compared to specialized QRNG devices.</description>

      <title>Temporally-long C-band heralded single photons generated from hot atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: C-band photons are recognized for having the lowest loss coefficient in optical fibers, making them highly favorable for optical fiber-based communication. In this study, we systematically investigated the temporal width of C-band heralded single photons and developed a theoretical model for biphoton generation via the spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) process using a diamond-type transition scheme, which has not been previously reported. Our experimental data on temporal width closely aligns with the predictions of this model. Additionally, we introduced a new concept: the atomic velocity group relating to the two-photon resonance condition and the one-photon detuning in this atomic frame. These two parameters are crucial for understanding the behavior of the biphoton source. The concept indicates that the hot-atom source behaves similarly to the cold-atom source. Guided by our theoretical model, we observed 1529-nm (C-band) heralded single photons with a temporal width of 28.3$\pm$0.6 ns, corresponding to a linewidth of 11.0$\pm$0.2 MHz. For comparison, the ultimate linewidth limit is 6.1 MHz, determined by the natural linewidth of the atoms. Among all atom-based sources of 1300 to 1550 nm heralded single photons utilizing either cold or hot atoms, the temporal width achieved in this work represents the first instance of a width exceeding 10 ns, making it (or its linewidth) the longest (or narrowest) record to date. This work significantly enhances our understanding of diamond-type or cascade-type SFWM biphoton generation and marks an important milestone in achieving greater temporal width in atom-based sources of C-band heralded single photons.</description>

      <title>Continuous variable entanglement with orbital angular momentum multiplexing in coherently prepared media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement constitutes a pivotal resource, serving as a fundamental cornerstone within the field of quantum information science. In recent years, the study of vortex light entanglement has garnered widespread attention due to its unique structure and inherent advantages; however, the majority of these investigations are primarily focused on discrete variable (DV) systems. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for generating vortex optical entanglement in coherently prepared media, employing continuous variable (CV) analysis and leveraging Raman scattering as an alternative to the conventional spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) method. The entanglement arises from the quantum correlation between the two light fields, induced by atomic coherence. Using numerical simulations, we thoroughly explore the impact of various tunable system parameters on the degree of entanglement, ultimately identifying the optimal conditions for maximal entanglement. Our findings offer a reference framework for vortex light entanglement, with potential implications across quantum teleportation, quantum key distribution, quantum computing, high-dimensional quantum information, and other related fields.</description>

      <title>Security proof for parallel DIQKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a parallel device independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) protocol based on the CHSH game and prove its security. Using techniques developed for analysing the parallel repetition of anchored non-local games, we show that the answers on a small random linear subset of the games in the DIQKD protocol can be simulated as the output of a single-round strategy for playing the CHSH game. Then, we use the recently developed unstructured approximate entropy accumulation theorem to establish the smooth min-entropy lower bound required for the security proof. Our approach yields a more information-theoretic and general proof for parallel DIQKD compared to previous proofs.</description>

      <title>General Approach to Error Detection of Bosonic Codes via Phase Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general approach to error detection of bosonic quantum error-correction codes via an adaptive quantum phase estimation algorithm assisted by a single ancilla qubit. The approach is applicable to a broad class of bosonic codes whose error syndromes are described by symmetry or stabilizer operators, including the rotation-symmetric codes and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. The detection precision scales inversely with the total evolution time and thus reaches the Heisenberg limit. We numerically demonstrate the approach for several examples, such as detecting bosonic excitation loss errors in high-order cat or binomial codes and displacement errors in finite-energy GKP codes. We also extend the approach to efficiently generate arbitrary Fock states. Our schemes are feasible in present-day experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rabin oblivious transfer is the cryptographic task where Alice wishes to receive a bit from Bob but it may get lost with probability 1/2. In this work, we provide protocol designs which yield quantum protocols with improved security. Moreover, we provide a constant lower bound on any quantum protocol for Rabin oblivious transfer. To quantify the security of this task with asymmetric cheating definitions, we introduce the notion of cheating advantage which may be of independent interest in the study of other asymmetric cryptographic primitives.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing for genomics: conceptual challenges and practical perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the potential of quantum computing to accelerate computation of central tasks in genomics, focusing on often-neglected theoretical limitations. We discuss state-of-the-art challenges of quantum search, optimization, and machine learning algorithms. Examining database search with Grover's algorithm, we show that the expected speedup vanishes under realistic assumptions. For combinatorial optimization prevalent in genomics, we discuss the limitations of theoretical complexity in practice and suggest carefully identifying problems genuinely suited for quantum acceleration. Given the competition from excellent classical approximate solvers, quantum computing could offer a speedup in the near future only for a specific subset of hard enough tasks in assembly, gene selection, and inference. These tasks need to be characterized by core optimization problems that are particularly challenging for classical methods while requiring relatively limited variables. We emphasize rigorous empirical validation through runtime scaling analysis to avoid misleading claims of quantum advantage. Finally, we discuss the problem of trainability and data-loading in quantum machine learning. This work advocates for a balanced perspective on quantum computing in genomics, guiding future research toward targeted applications and robust validation.</description>

      <title>Revealing Bosonic Exchange Symmetry in Two-Photon Temporal Wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wavefunction of two identical bosons remains invariant under particle exchange - a fundamental quantum symmetry that underlies Bose-Einstein statistics. We report the direct experimental observation of bosonic exchange symmetry in the temporal wavefunction of photon pairs generated via spontaneous four-wave mixing in a three-level cold atomic ensemble. The measured two-photon temporal correlations show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions based on symmetrized bosonic wavefunctions. In addition, we perform time-resolved two-photon interference to reconstruct the complex temporal wavefunction. Both the amplitude and phase profiles exhibit clear symmetry under photon exchange, providing a direct confirmation of bosonic exchange symmetry in the time domain.</description>

      <title>Probing the Limits of Dispersive Quantum Thermometry with a Nonlinear Mach-Zehnder-Based Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature estimation, known as thermometry, is a critical sensing task for physical systems operating in the quantum regime. Indeed, thermal fluctuations can significantly degrade quantum coherence. Therefore, accurately determining the system's operating temperature is a crucial first step toward distinguishing thermal noise from other sources of decoherence. In this work, we estimate the unknown temperature of a collection of identical and independent two-level atoms dispersively probed by a single-mode quantized electromagnetic field. In contrast to previous works, we present an analytical sensing analysis demonstrating that the joint atom-field evolution -- without any assumptions or approximations -- can achieve, at best, the standard quantum limit of precision concerning the number of field excitations. To investigate our analysis further, we propose and implement a quantum thermometer based on a nonlinear Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which we realize through quantum digital simulation. Our simulation is highly flexible regarding atomic state preparation, allowing the initialization of atomic ensembles with positive and effective negative temperatures. This makes our platform a promising and versatile testbed for benchmarking thermometric capabilities in current quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Security of the BB84 protocol with receiver's passive biased basis choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bennett-Brassard 1984 protocol (BB84 protocol) is one of the simplest protocols for implementing quantum key distribution (QKD). In the protocol, the sender and the receiver iteratively choose one of two complementary measurement bases. Regarding the basis choice by the receiver, a passive setup has been adopted in a number of its implementations including satellite QKD and time-bin encoding one. However, conventional theoretical techniques to prove the security of BB84 protocol are not applicable if the receiver chooses his measurement basis passively, rather than actively, with a biased probability, followed by the measurement with threshold detectors. Here we present a fully analytical security proof for such a decoy-state BB84 protocol with receiver's passive basis choice and measurement with threshold detectors. Thanks to the analytic nature, our security proof can straightforwardly be lifted up to the one over coherent attacks. The numerical simulations under practical situations show that the difference in secure key rate between the active and the passive implementations of the protocol is negligible except for long communication distances.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Quantum Chemistry Simulations with a Hybrid Quantization Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike classical algorithms, where second quantization is ubiquitous, the nature of quantum computers enables both the first- and second-quantized representations to be on somewhat equal footing. While quantum algorithms of both quantizations provide advantages over classical algorithms for ground state calculation and time-evolution, they face distinct limitations and inefficiencies in addressing real-world molecular and material simulation problems. As an example, the first-quantized representation is unsuitable for calculating electron non-conserving properties, such as dynamic correlations. Conversely, the ground-state molecular orbital wavefunction efficiently prepared in the second quantization may benefit from efficient first-quantized measurement circuits. In light of this, we propose a hybrid quantization scheme for electronic simulations that employs a conversion circuit to switch efficiently between the two quantizations, achieving a gate cost of $\mathcal{O}(N\log N \log M)$ and requiring $\mathcal{O}(N \log M)$ qubits for a system of $N$ electrons and $M$ orbitals. This way, plane-wave Hamiltonian simulations can be done efficiently in the first-quantization before converting to the second quantization to apply electron non-conserving operations. Similarly, second-quantized Hamiltonian simulation algorithms can take advantage of efficient measurement circuits originally designed for the first-quantized representation. We discuss applications of this hybrid quantization scheme to bring polynomial circuit improvements in the characterization of ground-state and excited-state properties, and in performing ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations.</description>

      <title>Solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on multiple different scales using the quantics tensor train representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations of highly featured problems represents a formidable challenge, where reaching high precision across multiple length scales can require a prohibitive amount of computer memory or computing time. However, the solutions to physics problems typically have structures operating on different length scales, and as a result exhibit a high degree of compressibility. Here, we use the quantics tensor train representation to build a solver for the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We demonstrate that the quantics approach generalizes well to the presence of the non-linear term in the equation. We show that we can resolve phenomena across length scales separated by seven orders of magnitude in one dimension within one hour on a single core in a laptop, greatly surpassing the capabilities of more naive methods. We illustrate our methodology with various modulated optical trap potentials presenting features at vastly different length scales, including solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on two-dimensional grids above a trillion points ($2^{20} \times 2^{20}$). This quantum-inspired methodology can be readily extended to other partial differential equations combining spatial and temporal evolutions, providing a powerful method to solve highly featured differential equations at unprecedented length scales.</description>

      <title>Complete and Orthonormal Sets of Exponential-type Orbitals with non-integer quantum numbers. On the results for many-electron atoms using Roothaan's LCAO method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complete orthonormal sets of exponential-type orbitals with non-integer principal quantum numbers are discussed as basis functions in non-relativistic Hartree-Fock-Roothaan electronic structure calculations of atoms. A method is proposed to construct accurate and computationally efficient basis sets using these orbitals. It is demonstrated that principal quantum numbers of fractional order cannot be treated solely as variational parameters, since such a procedure may lead to unphysical basis sets (in particular, linearly dependent Slater-type functions). Ground-state total energies for the Be- and Ne- isoelectronic series are calculated. The results obtained are lower than those reported using other published basis sets. However, the energies obtained using Slater-type functions with non-integer principal quantum numbers are omitted from the comparison. These "orbitals" have no physical interpretation (except the "1s", which coincides with a hydrogenlike eigenfunction). In general linear independence of such Slater-type orbitals is not guaranteed. The results confirm that the parameter alpha, used to represent the complete orthonormal exponential-type orbitals in the weighted Hilbert space, is neither observable nor suitable to be considered as a variational parameter, despite its treatment as such in some prior work.</description>

      <title>High-rate qutrit entanglement swapping with photon-number-basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement generation between distant nodes is a fundamental process in distributed quantum information processing. Qudits, high-dimensional quantum states, are promising candidates for enhancing entanglement distribution capabilities. However, the success probability of qudit entanglement distribution using Bell measurements is typically lower than that of conventional qubit-based protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel entanglement swapping protocol specifically designed for qutrits (three-dimensional quantum states). Our protocol employs photon-number encoding combined with an additional mode basis, such as polarization, effectively increasing the success probability. We show that the proposed qutrit protocol can achieve higher entanglement generation rates compared to conventional two-photon detection-based qubit protocols, especially under conditions of limited photon generation probability. Furthermore, we evaluate our protocol under realistic experimental imperfections, including photon loss and threshold detection, and show that it achieves high fidelity with probabilistic photon sources.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on Utilization of Measurements in Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement is a fundamental operation in quantum computing and has many important use cases in quantum algorithms. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the basic measurement operations in quantum computing and represents a selected set of their applications in quantum algorithms. Our goal is to provide one of the first algorithmic overviews of measurement processes in quantum computing. From the quantum information-theoretical perspective, measurements are either a method to access the result of a quantum computation or a technique to modify a quantum state. We also identify measurement-based methods to solve quantum computational challenges, such as error mitigation and circuit cutting. We discuss three main categories of measurements: performing measurements in static quantum circuits, modifying the quantum state in dynamic quantum circuits via measurements, and addressing challenges in quantum computing with measurements. Based on the reviewed topics, the measurement operations are frequently not at the center of the quantum algorithm design. However, the most novel and error-prone quantum algorithms will likely require sophisticated measurement schemes. Thus, the central message of this article is to broaden the view of measurement operations and highlight their importance at every level of quantum algorithm design.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning for Energy-Efficient 5G-Enabled IoMT Healthcare Systems: Enhancing Data Security and Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-efficient healthcare systems are becoming increasingly critical for Industry 5.0 as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) expands, particularly with the integration of 5G technology. 5G-enabled IoMT systems allow real-time data collection, high-speed communication, and enhanced connectivity between medical devices and healthcare providers. However, these systems face energy consumption and data security challenges, especially with the growing number of connected devices operating in Industry 5.0 environments with limited power resources. Quantum computing integrated with machine learning (ML) algorithms, forming quantum machine learning (QML), offers exponential improvements in computational speed and efficiency through principles such as superposition and entanglement. In this paper, we propose and evaluate three QML algorithms, which are UU{\dag}, variational UU{\dag}, and UU{\dag}-quantum neural networks (QNN) for classifying data from four different datasets: 5G-South Asia, Lumos5G 1.0, WUSTL EHMS 2020, and PS-IoT. Our comparative analysis, using various evaluation metrics, reveals that the UU{\dag}-QNN method not only outperforms the other algorithms in the 5G-South Asia and WUSTL EHMS 2020 datasets, achieving 100% accuracy, but also aligns with the human-centric goals of Industry 5.0 by allowing more efficient and secure healthcare data processing. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed quantum algorithms is verified against several noisy channels by analyzing accuracy variations in response to each noise model parameter, which contributes to the resilience aspect of Industry 5.0. These results offer promising quantum solutions for 5G-enabled IoMT healthcare systems by optimizing data classification and reducing power consumption while maintaining high levels of security even in noisy environments.</description>

Abstract: Simulating a quantum circuit with a classical computer requires exponentially growing resources. Decision diagrams exploit the redundancies in quantum circuit representation to efficiently represent and simulate quantum circuits. But for complicated quantum circuits like the quantum supremacy benchmark, there is almost no redundancy to exploit. Therefore, it often makes sense to do a trade-off between simulation accuracy and memory requirement. Previous work on approximate simulation with decision diagrams exploits this trade-off by removing less important nodes. In this work, instead of removing these nodes, we try to find similar nodes to replace them, effectively slowing down the fidelity loss when reducing the memory. In addition, we adopt Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to drastically reduce the computational complexity for searching for replacement nodes. Our new approach achieves a better memory-accuracy trade-off for representing a quantum circuit with decision diagrams with minimal run time overhead. Notably, our approach shows good scaling properties when increasing the circuit size and depth. For the first time, a strong better-than-linear trade-off between memory and fidelity is demonstrated for a decision diagram based quantum simulation when representing the quantum supremacy benchmark circuits at high circuit depths, showing the potential of drastically reducing the resource requirement for approximate simulation of the quantum supremacy benchmarks on a classical computer.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of High-Level Quantum Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit simulation is paramount to the verification and optimization of quantum algorithms, and considerable research efforts have been made towards efficient simulators. While circuits often contain high-level gates such as oracles and multi-controlled X (CkX) gates, existing simulation methods require compilation to a low-level gate-set before simulation. This, however, increases circuit size and incurs a considerable (typically exponential) overhead, even when the number of high-level gates is small. Here we present a gadget-based simulator which simulates high-level gates directly, thereby allowing to avoid or reduce the blowup of compilation. Our simulator uses a stabilizer decomposition of the magic state of non-stabilizer gates, with improvements in the rank of the magic state directly improving performance. We then proceed to establish a small stabilizer rank for a range of high-level gates that are common in various quantum algorithms. Using these bounds in our simulator, we improve both the theoretical complexity of simulating circuits containing such gates, and the practical running time compared to standard simulators found in IBM's Qiskit Aer library. We also derive exponential lower-bounds for the stabilizer rank of some gates under common complexity-theoretic hypotheses. In certain cases, our lower-bounds are asymptotically tight on the exponent.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Bandits with Knapsacks with Improved Regret and Time Complexities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bandits with knapsacks (BwK) constitute a fundamental model that combines aspects of stochastic integer programming with online learning. Classical algorithms for BwK with a time horizon $T$ achieve a problem-independent regret bound of ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ and a problem-dependent bound of ${O}(\log T)$. In this paper, we initiate the study of the BwK model in the setting of quantum computing, where both reward and resource consumption can be accessed via quantum oracles. We establish both problem-independent and problem-dependent regret bounds for quantum BwK algorithms. For the problem-independent case, we demonstrate that a quantum approach can improve the classical regret bound by a factor of $(1+\sqrt{B/\mathrm{OPT}_\mathrm{LP}})$, where $B$ is budget constraint in BwK and $\mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{LP}}$ denotes the optimal value of a linear programming relaxation of the BwK problem. For the problem-dependent setting, we develop a quantum algorithm using an inexact quantum linear programming solver. This algorithm achieves a quadratic improvement in terms of the problem-dependent parameters, as well as a polynomial speedup of time complexity on problem's dimensions compared to classical counterparts. Compared to previous works on quantum algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our study is the first to consider bandit models with resource constraints and hence shed light on operations research.</description>

      <title>Approaching the Key Rate Limit in Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum key distribution network enables pairs of users to generate independent secret keys by leveraging the principles of quantum physics. For end-to-end secure communication, a user pair's secret key must remain secure against any third parties, including both external eavesdroppers and other network users. However, isolating a given user pair from the remaining users while maintaining a high key rate is challenging when all users are intrinsically coupled and correlated, particularly in continuous-variable networks. This results in either a low key rate, or incomplete end-to-end security. Here, we introduce a multi-user security framework, offering a general and comprehensive end-to-end key rate formula, against the collaboration of the other network users and eavesdropper. Building on this framework, we propose a multi-user protocol that achieves the theoretical upper limit in all practical deployments within a 100 km range. Applied to a three-node network, it achieves an Mbps-level per-user key rate and an overall network key rate reaching 90\% of the upper limit. The proposed solution supports scalable implementations using telecom-compatible components, while the method for obtaining the accessible information in the network is broadly applicable and can be extended to various multipartite quantum information systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Repeater Chains via Cavity Magnon for Scalable Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable quantum networks require quantum repeaters to overcome major challenges such as photon loss and decoherence in long-distance quantum communication. In this paper, we present a cavity-magnon quantum repeater architecture that exploits the frequency tunability and coherence characteristics of magnonic platforms to enable efficient entanglement swapping across multi-hop networks. Through comprehensive numerical simulations with realistic experimental parameters, we analyze system performance across diverse deployment scenarios and network scales, examining both short-range and long-distance implementations. We identify critical factors influencing performance and scalability, demonstrating that cavity-magnon systems represent a viable and promising quantum repeater platform with significant integration advantages over existing quantum memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Fast quantum measurement tomography with dimension-optimal error bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a two-step protocol for quantum measurement tomography that is light on classical co-processing cost and still achieves optimal sample complexity in the system dimension. Given measurement data from a known probe state ensemble, we first apply least-squares estimation to produce an unconstrained approximation of the POVM, and then project this estimate onto the set of valid quantum measurements. For a POVM with $L$ outcomes acting on a $d$-dimensional system, we show that the protocol requires $\mathcal{O}(d^3 L \ln(d)/\epsilon^2)$ samples to achieve error $\epsilon$ in worst-case distance, and $\mathcal{O}(d^2 L^2 \ln(dL)/\epsilon^2)$ samples in average-case distance. We further establish two almost matching sample complexity lower bounds of $\Omega(d^3/\epsilon^2)$ and $\Omega(d^2 L/\epsilon^2)$ for any non-adaptive, single-copy POVM tomography protocol. Hence, our projected least squares POVM tomography is sample-optimal in dimension $d$ up to logarithmic factors. Our method admits an analytic form when using global or local 2-designs as probe ensembles and enables rigorous non-asymptotic error guarantees. Finally, we also complement our findings with empirical performance studies carried out on a noisy superconducting quantum computer with flux-tunable transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>Exceptional point rings and $PT$-symmetry in the non-Hermitian XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The XY spin chain is a paradigmatic example of a model solved by free fermions, in which the energy eigenspectrum is built from combinations of quasi-energies. In this article we show that by extending the XY model's anisotropy parameter $\lambda$ to complex values, it is possible for two of the quasi-energies to become degenerate. In the non-Hermitian XY model these quasi-energy degeneracies give rise to exceptional points (EPs) where two of the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. The distinct $\lambda$ values at which EPs appear form concentric rings in the complex plane which are shown in the infinite system size limit to converge to the unit circle coinciding with the boundary between distinct topological phases. The non-Hermitian model is also seen to possess a line of broken $PT$ symmetry along the pure imaginary $\lambda$-axis. For finite systems, there are four EP values on this broken $PT$-symmetric line if the system size is a multiple of 4.</description>

      <title>Geometry-induced Coulomb-like potential in helically twisted quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Schr\"odinger equation in a three-dimensional helically twisted space characterized by a non-trivial torsion parameter. By applying exact separation of variables, we derive the radial equation governing the dynamics of quantum particles in this geometric background. Remarkably, the intrinsic coupling between angular and longitudinal momenta induced by the torsion gives rise to an attractive Coulomb-like potential term that emerges purely from the underlying geometry, without introducing any external fields or interactions. We obtain exact analytical solutions for the bound states, including both the energy spectrum and the normalized wave functions. Numerical calculations are also performed, and excellent agreement with the exact results is found. The interplay between the torsion parameter and the effective Coulomb-like interaction is analyzed in detail, showing how geometric deformation generates novel quantum confinement mechanisms in twisted spaces.</description>

      <title>From Wavefunctional Entanglement to Entangled Wavefunctional Degrees of Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of whether entanglement between photons is equivalent to entanglement between their characteristic field modes, specifically, the single-particle wavefunctions that are composed and superposed to describe identical particles, is a key, open problem concerning multi-partite optical degrees of freedom, and has profound implications for topics ranging from quantum foundations to quantum computation. In this Letter, I offer a fresh, deeper, physical insight into this subtle, albeit enduring, issue by describing a situation in which entangling interactions between optical modes, namely, the wavefunctions can be distilled into genuine entanglement between the physical properties of the photons, which are the wavefunctional degrees of freedom. This theoretical observation also highlights the salience of the measurement context, especially, of clearly disambiguating between the choice of the quantum subsystem and the decision to measure an observable along a particular axis of measurement, while quantifying and transforming quantum optical entanglement. This understanding might be applied to formulate a new class of protocols for distilling quantum magic from contextually and nonlocally entangled photons within inseparable field modes.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of Schr\"odinger equation for the complex Morse potential to investigate physical systems with position-dependent complex mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the exact ground state solution for a diatomic particle system with position-dependent complex mass under action of a complex Morse potential in the quantum domain. By solving the position-dependent Schr\"odinger equation in extended complex phase space without assuming a specific mass profile, we derive both the eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenenergies using the analyticity conditions of the eigenfunctions. A key focus is placed on addressing the challenge of normalization inherent in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. To overcome the limitations of conventional normalization methods in systems with complex potentials and spatially varying mass, we propose a modified normalization approach based on a two-dimensional integral over phase space. The results reveal that, under certain parameter constraints, real energy spectra can arise in non Hermitian settings, supported by normalized and physically meaningful eigenfunctions. Probability density plots validate the existence of stable, localized bound states, maintaining essential characteristics of the traditional Morse potential. Moreover, the model offers potential applications in high-energy and cosmological physics, particularly in the quantum description of exotic systems like dark matter.</description>

      <title>Engineering a Multi-Mode Purcell Filter for Superconducting-Qubit Reset and Readout with Intrinsic Purcell Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient qubit reset and leakage reduction are essential for scalable superconducting quantum computing, particularly in the context of quantum error correction. However, such operations often require additional on-chip components. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a mode-efficient approach to qubit reset and readout using a multi-mode Purcell filter in a superconducting quantum circuit. We exploit the inherent multi-mode structure of a coplanar waveguide resonator, using its fundamental and second-order modes for qubit reset and readout, respectively, thereby avoiding additional circuit elements. Implemented in a flip-chip architecture, our device achieves unconditional reset with residual excitation below 1% in 220 ns, and a leakage reduction unit that selectively resets the second excited state within 62 ns. Simulations predict Purcell-limited relaxation times exceeding 1 ms over an 800 MHz bandwidth. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental trial that exploits different-order modes of a microwave resonator for distinct qubit operations, representing a new direction toward scalable, mode-efficient quantum processor design.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of single qubit quantum classifier with small number of samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigated a single-qubit quantum classifier implemented on a silicon photonic integrated circuit, focusing on its performance under photon-limited conditions. Using the Data Reuploading method with layer-wise optimization via Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), input data were encoded into the photonic circuit, and classification was performed based on output detection probabilities. Heralded single photons, generated via spontaneous four-wave mixing in a silicon waveguide, served as the input states. Even when the average number of photon samples per input was reduced to approximately two, the classifier achieved nearly 90\% accuracy, provided that the training dataset was sufficiently large. The experimental results were consistent with numerical simulations, which also indicated that performance at low sample sizes can be improved by increasing the size of the training dataset. These findings demonstrate that photonic quantum classifiers can operate effectively with very few photons, supporting their practical feasibility for resource-efficient quantum machine learning on integrated photonic platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most quantum algorithms for generalized eigenvalue problems focus on Hermitian systems, and few are applicable to non-Hermitian systems. Based on the generalized Schur decomposition, we propose a variational quantum algorithm for solving generalized eigenvalue problems in non-Hermitian systems. The algorithm transforms the generalized eigenvalue problem into a process of searching for unitary transformation matrices. Moreover, we develop a method for evaluating both the loss function and its gradients on near-term quantum devices. Finally, we numerically validate the algorithm's performance through simulations and demonstrate its application to generalized eigenvalue problems in ocean acoustics. The algorithm's robustness is further confirmed through noise simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiport interferometers can be constructed out of two-port components in various ways. We study how this choice affects the quality of the operations performed by the interferometer, through the asymmetry of optical losses in the multiport. We find that some operations benefit from asymmetrically designed interferometers. Our results point to a fundamental tradeoff between lowering infidelity and achieving high success rates, which are key considerations in quantum information processing applications. Our results challenge the common understanding that balanced losses are always optimal for quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological quantum mechanics II: deducing the formalism from experimental observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04812v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of quantum mechanics solely from phenomenological observations. The only assumed inputs are the multi-time probability distributions estimated from the results of sequential measurements of quantum observables; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are permitted. In the concluding Part II of the paper, we carry out the deduction of the formalism from the phenomenological inputs described in Part I. We show that the resulting formalism exhibits an affinity with Hilbert spaces, and we derive an explicit representation in terms of those mathematical structures. Analogues of the obtained elementary building blocks -- such as projection operators -- are readily identifiable within the standard formalism. However, once these building blocks are assembled according to the blueprint of the deduced bi-trajectory formalism, it becomes evident that the new and the standard formalisms differ substantially at the conceptual level. These differences do not negate the fact that both formalisms are in perfect agreement with respect to empirically testable predictions. Rather, the emergence of a novel, non-standard formulation should be seen as a relatively rare opportunity to reassess, from a fresh perspective, some of the long-standing foundational issues in the theory. The hope is that the new approach may prove more successful in addressing problems that have resisted resolution within the established theoretical framework.</description>

Abstract: Quantum multiparameter estimation offers a framework for the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters, pertaining to possibly noncommutating observables. While the optimal probe for estimating a single unitary phase is well understood - being a pure state that is an equal superposition of the eigenvectors of the encoding Hamiltonian corresponding to its maximum and minimum eigenvalues - the structure of optimal probes in the multiparameter setting remains more intricate. We investigate the simultaneous estimation of two phases, each encoded through arbitrary qubit Hamiltonians, using arbitrary weight matrices, and considering single-qubit probes. We also consider single-qutrit probes, for which the encoding Hamiltonians are chosen as SU(2) generators. We find that in both the qubit and qutrit scenarios, the optimal probe is a coherent superposition of the eigenstates corresponding to the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the total encoding Hamiltonian, with a fixed - and not arbitrary - relative phase. Remarkably, this optimal probe is independent of the specific choice of weight matrix, making it a universally optimal input state for the estimation of any pair of SU(2) parameters, which can be reparameterized to the phase estimation problem. Furthermore, we show that this probe also maximizes the determinant of the quantum Fisher information matrix, providing a handy tool for identifying the optimal probe state. We also examine the role of commutativity between the generators of the unitary encodings. Our results demonstrate that a high degree of commutativity degrades the achievable precision, rendering estimation infeasible in the extreme case. However, maximal noncommutativity does not necessarily yield optimal precision.</description>

      <title>Multi-Photon Quantum Rabi Models with Center-of-Mass Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise control of light-matter interaction serves as a cornerstone for diverse quantum technologies, spanning from quantum computing to advanced atom optics. Typical experiments often feature multi-mode fields and require atoms with intricate internal structures to facilitate e.g., multi-photon interactions or cooling. Moreover, the development of high-precision cold-atom sensors necessitates the use of entangled atoms. We introduce a rigorous, second-quantized framework for describing multi-$\Lambda$-atoms in a cavity, encompassing their center-of-mass motion and interaction with a two-mode electromagnetic field. A key feature of our approach is the systematic application of a Hamiltonian averaging theory to the atomic field operators, enabling the derivation of a compact and physically insightful effective Hamiltonian governing the system's time evolution. This effective Hamiltonian not only incorporates the AC-Stark and Bloch-Siegert shifts, augmented by contributions from all involved ancillary states, but also includes effects from counter-rotating terms, offering a more complete description than conventional RWA-based models. A significant finding is the emergence of a particle-particle interaction mediated by ancillary states, stemming directly from the combined quantum nature of the coupled electromagnetic field and atomic system. We illustrate the practical implications of our model through an analysis of atomic Raman diffraction, determining the time evolution for a typical initial state and demonstrating the resulting Rabi oscillations. Furthermore, our results confirm that both the atomic and optical Hong-Ou-Mandel effect can be observed within this Raman configuration, utilizing a specific two-particle input state, thereby extending the utility of Raman diffraction for quantum interference phenomena and providing a microscopic model of the effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonance fluorescence of natural or artificial atoms constitutes a prime method for generating non-classical light. While most efforts have focused on producing single-photons, multi-photon emission is unavoidably present in the resonant driving of an atom. Here, we study the extent to which these processes occur: we quantify the multi-photon emission statistics in a resonantly-driven two-level artificial atom -- a semiconductor quantum dot in a micropillar cavity -- when pumped by short optical pulses. By measuring auto-correlation functions up to the fourth order, we observe up to four photons emitted after a single pumping pulse, and investigate the emission dynamics with finely resolved temporal measurements. Furthermore, we propose a method based on acquisition time gating to enhance the purity of a single-photon source while maintaining high efficiencies. Our results deepen the understanding of the photon emission processes in coherently driven atomic systems, and suggest a simple but effective technique to reduce the multi-photon components of a single-photon source.</description>

      <title>DYNAMO: Dynamic Neutral Atom Multi-programming Optimizer Towards Quantum Operating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing advances towards practical applications, quantum operating systems become inevitable, where multi-programming -- the core functionality of operating systems -- enables concurrent execution of multiple quantum programs to enhance hardware utilization. However, most quantum compilation work focuses solely on single-circuit execution, severely limiting resource efficiency and hindering quantum operating system development. We propose Dynamic Neutral Atom Multi-programming Optimizer (DYNAMO), a method that realizes multi-programming on neutral atom quantum architectures through parallel compilation and intelligent resource allocation across multiple quantum processing units (QPUs). DYNAMO addresses two critical challenges: inefficient and difficult resource partitioning, and complex scheduling conflicts from concurrent program. Our method enables efficient spatial and temporal resource sharing while maintaining circuit correctness and hardware constraints. Experimental evaluation across circuits ranging from 12 to over 1200 gates demonstrates that DYNAMO achieves up to 14.39x compilation speedup while reducing execution stages by an average of 50.47%. Furthermore, DYNAMO successfully distributes workloads across multiple QPUs with balanced resource utilization. By enabling efficient multi-programming capabilities, DYNAMO establishes a critical foundation towards realizing practical quantum operating systems.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Open Quantum Dynamics and Isomorphism to Superconformal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the Lie algebraic structure of a physical problem often makes it easier to find its solution. In this paper, we focus on the Lie algebra of Gaussian-conserving superoperators. We construct a Lie algebra of $n$-mode states, $\mathfrak{go}(n)$, composed of all superoperators conserving Gaussianity, and we find it isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{2n^2+3n}\oplus_{\mathrm{S}}\mathfrak{gl}(2n,\mathbb{R})$. This allows us to solve the quadratic-order Redfield equation for any, even non-Gaussian, state. We find that the algebraic structure of Gaussian operations is the same as that of super-Poincar\'e algebra in three-dimensional spacetime, where the CPTP condition corresponds to the combination of causality and directionality of time flow. Additionally, we find that a bosonic density matrix satisfies both the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac equations. Finally, we expand the algebra of Gaussian superoperators even further by relaxing the CPTP condition. We find that it is isomorphic to a superconformal algebra, which represents the maximal symmetry of the field theory. This suggests a deeper connection between two seemingly unrelated fields, with the potential to transform problems from one domain into another where they may be more easily solved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a generalized model of photodetection in which the detector couples simultaneously to both electric and magnetic components of the electromagnetic field. Extending Glauber's seminal theory, we show that such detectors, now experimentally feasible via meta-materials, can yield interference patterns that depend strongly on the internal response of the detector. In particular, we show that for a two-source interference setup, coherent electric-magnetic dipole coupling can suppress or enhance interference visibility, revealing a clear instance of measurement contextuality in quantum optics, where the outcome depends on how the system is probed.</description>

      <title>Universal Bound States in Long-range Spin Chains with an Impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how quasi-particles interact with impurities is crucial for unveiling novel properties of quantum many-body systems. A prominent example is the enhanced scattering between electrons and magnetic impurities in the low-energy limit, which gives rise to the Kondo effect. In this letter, motivated by recent developments in quantum simulation platforms, we investigate the universal behavior of long-range quantum spin chains with a single local impurity, focusing on systems that conserve the magnon number. Using effective field theory, we show that distinct classes of universal three-magnon states can emerge when the impurity-mediated two-magnon interaction is on resonance. When the long-range coupling decays as $1/r^\alpha$, we find that (i) for $\alpha\in (2,2.89)$, the system exhibits Efimov effects, with the three-body binding energy forming a geometric series $\ln|E^{(n)}_{\text{3-body}}|\sim-n (\alpha-1) \pi/s_0(\alpha)$, (ii) for $\alpha=2$, the system shows semi-super Efimov effects with $\ln|E^{(n)}_{\text{3-body}}|\sim-(n\pi-\theta)^2/8$. Our theoretical prediction is validated by the numerical solution of the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian equation. Our results could be tested experimentally in the future on quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Experimental entropic uncertainty relations in dimensions three to five</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide experimental validation of tight entropic uncertainty relations for the Shannon entropies of observables with mutually unbiased eigenstates in high dimensions. In particular, we address the cases of dimensions $d = 3$, $4$ and $5$ and consider from $2$ to $d+1$ mutually unbiased bases. The experiment is based on pulsed frequency bins measured with a multi-output quantum pulse gate, which can perform projective measurements on a complete high-dimensional basis in the time-frequency domain. Our results fit the theoretical predictions: the bound on the sum of the entropies is never violated and is saturated by the states that minimize the uncertainty relations.</description>

      <title>Work and entropy of mixing in isolated quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mixing of two different gases is one of the most common natural phenomena, with applications ranging from CO$_2$ capture to water purification. Traditionally, mixing is analyzed in the context of local thermal equilibrium, where systems exchange energy with a heat bath. Here, we study mixing in an isolated system with potentially non-equilibrium initial states, characterized solely by macroscopic observables. We identify the entropy of mixing as a special case of observational entropy within an observer-dependent framework, where both entropy and extractable work depend on the resolution of measurement. This approach naturally resolves the Gibbs mixing paradox in quantum systems: while an observer experiences a discontinuous increase in entropy upon learning of the existence of two particle types, this knowledge does not provide an advantage in work extraction if the types of particles remain operationally indistinguishable in their measurements. Finally, we derive a Landauer-like bound on the difference in energy extracted by two observers, where an "observational temperature" emerges, determined by the accessible information. These results provide a foundation for rigorously determining the energy required to unmix in non-equilibrium settings and extend beyond quantum systems, offering insights into the thermodynamics of isolated classical gases.</description>

      <title>Disentangling strategies and entanglement transitions in unitary circuit games with matchgates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In unitary circuit games, two competing parties, an "entangler" and a "disentangler", can induce an entanglement phase transition in a quantum many-body system. The transition occurs at a certain rate at which the disentangler acts. We analyze such games within the context of matchgate dynamics, which equivalently corresponds to evolutions of non-interacting fermions. We first investigate general entanglement properties of fermionic Gaussian states (FGS). We introduce a representation of FGS using a minimal matchgate circuit capable of preparing the state and derive an algorithm based on a generalized Yang-Baxter relation for updating this representation as unitary operations are applied. This representation enables us to define a natural disentangling procedure that reduces the number of gates in the circuit, thereby decreasing the entanglement contained in the system. We then explore different strategies to disentangle the systems and study the unitary circuit game in two different scenarios: with braiding gates, i.e., the intersection of Clifford gates and matchgates, and with generic matchgates. For each model, we observe qualitatively different entanglement transitions, which we characterize both numerically and analytically.</description>

      <title>Violation of local realism with spatially multimode parametric down-conversion pumped by spatially incoherent light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a violation of local realism with negligible spatial postselection on the polarization-entangled two-photon states produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) pumped by a spatially incoherent light source-a light-emitting diode (LED). While existing studies have observed such a violation only by post-selecting the LED-pumped SPDC into a single spatial detection mode, we achieve a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality violation of $S = 2.532 \pm 0.069 &gt; 2$ using a spatially multimode detection setup that supports more than 45,000 spatial modes. These results indicate that coherent pump sources, such as lasers, are not required for SPDC-based entanglement generation. Our work could enable novel and practical sources of entangled photons for quantum technologies such as device-independent quantum key distribution and quantum-enhanced sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last decades have seen the development of quantum machine learning, stemming from the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. This field is particularly promising for the design of alternative quantum (or quantum inspired) computation paradigms that could require fewer resources with respect to standard ones, e.g. in terms of energy consumption. In this context, we present the implementation of a data re-uploading scheme on a photonic integrated processor, achieving high accuracies in several image classification tasks. We thoroughly investigate the capabilities of this apparently simple model, which relies on the evolution of one-qubit states, by providing an analytical proof that our implementation is a universal classifier and an effective learner, capable of generalizing to new, unknown data. Hence, our results not only demonstrate data re-uploading in a potentially resource-efficient optical implementation but also provide new theoretical insight into this algorithm, its trainability, and generalizability properties. This lays the groundwork for developing more resource-efficient machine learning algorithms, leveraging our scheme as a subroutine.</description>

      <title>Coherent Spins in van der Waals Semiconductor GeS2 at Ambient Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically active spin defects in van der Waals (vdW) materials have recently emerged as versatile quantum sensors, enabling applications from nanoscale magnetic field detection to the exploration of novel quantum phenomena in condensed matter systems. Their ease of exfoliation and compatibility with device integration make them promising candidates for future quantum technologies. Here we report the observation and room-temperature coherent control of spin defects in the high-temperature crystalline phase of germanium disulfide ($\beta$-GeS2), a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor with low nuclear spin density. The observed spin defects exhibit spin-1/2 behavior, and their spin dynamics can be explained by a weakly coupled spin-pair model. We implement dynamical decoupling techniques to extend the spin coherence time (T$_2$) by a factor of 20. Finally, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to estimate the structure and spin densities of two possible spin defect candidates. This work will help expand the field of quantum sensing with spin defects in van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Optical pumping simulations and optical Rabi frequency measurements in $^{151}\mathrm{Eu}^{3+}\!:\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{SiO}_5$ under magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Europium-doped crystal $\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{SiO}_5$ is an interesting platform for optical quantum memories, due to its long optical and spin coherence times. In this work, we investigate $^{151}\mathrm{Eu}^{3+}\!:\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{SiO}_5$ under the application of magnetic field, a complex system with 36 different optical-hyperfine transitions. We present a simple numerical simulator for calculating the effect of optical pumping schemes that allow the isolation of a single frequency class of ions, applicable to any multi-level atom with inhomogeneous broadening. Experimentally, we develop methodologies for estimating the magnetic field vector, demonstrating high precision in predicting spectral features based on the known spin Hamiltonians. We measured the optical Rabi frequency of 21 transitions among the 36 possible optical-hyperfine transitions, allowing for the construction of a 6x6 branching ratio matrix of relative transition strengths. From the Rabi frequency measurements, we derive the optical dipole moment for the $^7\!F_0 \leftrightarrow {}^5\!D_0$ transition, yielding a value of $(6.94 \pm 0.09) \times 10^{-33}~\mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m}$. Our results provide a critical test of the spin Hamiltonian models, demonstrating high precision in predicting energy levels and relative transition strengths, which are key abilities for quantum applications with $^{151}\mathrm{Eu}^{3+}\!:\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{SiO}_5$ under magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising direction in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, offering computational and memory advantages by harnessing superposition and entanglement. However, QML models often face challenges in scalability and expressiveness due to hardware constraints. In this paper, we propose quantum mixture of experts (QMoE), a novel quantum architecture that integrates the mixture of experts (MoE) paradigm into the QML setting. QMoE comprises multiple parameterized quantum circuits serving as expert models, along with a learnable quantum routing mechanism that selects and aggregates specialized quantum experts per input. The empirical results from the proposed QMoE on quantum classification tasks demonstrate that it consistently outperforms standard quantum neural networks, highlighting its effectiveness in learning complex data patterns. Our work paves the way for scalable and interpretable quantum learning frameworks.</description>

      <title>Alternating minimization for computing doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information (PRMI) of order $\alpha$ is defined as the minimization of the Petz divergence of order $\alpha$ of a fixed bipartite quantum state $\rho_{AB}$ relative to any product state $\sigma_A\otimes \tau_B$. To date, no closed-form expression for this measure has been found, necessitating the development of numerical methods for its computation. In this work, we show that alternating minimization over $\sigma_A$ and $\tau_B$ asymptotically converges to the doubly minimized PRMI for any $\alpha\in (\frac{1}{2},1)\cup (1,2]$, by proving linear convergence of the objective function values with respect to the number of iterations for $\alpha\in (1,2]$ and sublinear convergence for $\alpha\in (\frac{1}{2},1)$. Previous studies have only addressed the specific case where $\rho_{AB}$ is a classical-classical state, while our results hold for any quantum state $\rho_{AB}$.</description>

      <title>Towards a Comparative Framework for Compositional AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the construction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual words together according to the grammatical structure of the text. The compositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional generalisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training distribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data distribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the model works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the processes through which these components are combined. We present these notions in a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a series of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.
  Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of models can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit based models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of compositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the systematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation tasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the Train data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model on one of the trained models. By considering how the model components interact with one another, we explain how the model behaves.</description>

      <title>Quasiconservation Laws and Suppressed Transport in Weakly Interacting Localized Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.</description>

      <title>Can slow recombination in ordered superconductors explain the excess quasiparticle population?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An excess density of quasiparticles is widely observed in superconducting films. This excess causes performance degradation in a variety of superconducting devices, including decoherence in qubits. In this Letter, we evaluate the hypothesis of [1] that the quasiparticle excess is caused by anomalously slow recombination at low quasiparticle densities due to localization in sub-gap states. We probe the density of states in aluminum and niobium films using current-voltage measurements of tunnel junctions and extract upper bounds on the energy scales of the sub-gap states and gap smearing. With these parameters, we evaluate the recombination times predicted by [1] and find that slow recombination is not predicted to occur at observed quasiparticle densities in aluminumand niobium-based superconducting devices. These results suggest that the quasiparticle excess in ordered superconductors is primarily due to non-thermal sources of quasiparticle generation and not slow recombination.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Robinson bounds, automorphic equivalence and LPPL for long-range interacting fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a Lieb-Robinson bound for lattice fermion models with polynomially decaying interactions, which can be used to show the locality of the quasi-local inverse Liouvillian. This allows us to prove automorphic equivalence and the local perturbations perturb locally (LPPL) principle for these systems. The proof of the Lieb-Robinson bound is based on the work of Else et al. (2020), and our results also apply to spin systems. We explain why some newer Lieb-Robinson bounds for long-range spin systems cannot be used to prove the locality of the quasi-local inverse Liouvillian, and in some cases may not even hold for fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable and low-noise WSe$_2$ quantum emitters for quantum photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-noise and tunable single-photon sources are essential components of photonic quantum technologies. However, in WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, charge noise from fluctuations in their local electrostatic environment remains a major obstacle to achieving transform-limited single-photon emission and high photon indistinguishability. Here, we systematically investigate two noise mitigation strategies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation and electrostatic biasing. We demonstrate that hBN encapsulation alone suppresses spectral wandering (from $\sim$170 $\mu$eV to $\sim$40 $\mu$eV) and narrows emission linewidths (from $\sim$500 $\mu$eV to $\sim$150 $\mu$eV), while applied bias enables stable Stark tuning over a 280 $\mu$eV range and further linewidth narrowing down to $\sim$100 $\mu$eV reaching the resolution-limited regime. Time-resolved and second-order correlation measurements confirm stable mono-exponential decay and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0) \approx 0.01$) with no observable blinking. To quantify progress toward the transform limit, we define two figures of merit: the linewidth ratio $R = W_{\text{exp}} / W_{\text{rad}}$ and total broadening $\Delta W = W_{\text{exp}} - W_{\text{rad}}$, with both being reduced more than five-fold in optimized devices. These results provide a robust framework for developing and evaluating low-noise, tunable WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, potentially realizing electrically controllable sources of indistinguishable single-photons for future photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Index Theorem and Vortex Kinetics in Bose-Einstein Condensates on a Haldane Sphere with a Magnetic Monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometry-gauge interplay constitutes a fundamental issue in quantum physics, with profound implications spanning from quantum gravity to topological matter. Here, we investigate the dynamic effects of geometry-gauge interplay in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) on a Haldane sphere with a magnetic monopole. We reveal an index theorem that establishes a correspondence between BEC vortices and the topology of the gauge field, enabling the construction of vortex-monopole composites. Furthermore, we derive the universal logarithmic interaction between composites, which governs the structure of the ground-state vortex lattice. By developing a kinetic theory, we predict scale-invariant vortex dynamics and an emergent duality. Both are confirmed through numerical simulations. This work first presents the dynamical coupling mechanism between spatial geometry and gauge fields, providing deep insights into superfluid systems with topological gauge structures in curved space.</description>

      <title>An infinite family of Dunkl type superintegrable curved Hamiltonians through coalgebra symmetry: Oscillator and Kepler-Coulomb models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to bridge the gap between Dunkl superintegrable systems and the coalgebra symmetry approach to superintegrability, and subsequently to recover known models and construct new ones. In particular, an infinite family of $N$-dimensional quasi-maximally superintegrable quantum systems with reflections, sharing the same set of $2N-3$ quantum integrals, is introduced. The result is achieved by introducing a novel differential-difference realization of $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$ and then applying the coalgebra formalism. Several well-known maximally superintegrable models with reflections appear as particular cases of this general family, among them, the celebrated Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system. Furthermore, restricting to the case of "hidden" quantum quadratic symmetries, maximally superintegrable curved oscillator and Kepler-Coulomb Hamiltonians of Dunkl type, sharing the same underlying $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$ coalgebra symmetry, are presented. Namely, the Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system on the $N$-sphere and hyperbolic space together with two models which can be interpreted as a one-parameter superintegrable deformation of the Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system on non-constant curvature spaces. In addition, maximally superintegrable generalizations of these models, involving non-central potentials, are also derived on flat and curved spaces. For all specific systems, at least an additional quantum integral is explicitly provided, which is related to the Dunkl version of a (curved) Demkov-Fradkin tensor or a Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers use quantum mechanical phenomena to perform conventionally intractable calculations for specific problems. Despite being universal machines, quantum computers are not expected to replace classical computers, but rather, to complement them and form hybrid systems. This makes integrating quantum computers into high performance computing (HPC) systems an increasingly relevant topic. We present a structured literature review on the integration aspect. We methodologically search literature databases and manually evaluate 107 publications. These publications are divided into seven categories that describe the state of the art in each category. After a brief quantitative analysis of the literature, this survey deals with the hardware architecture of hybrid quantum-classical systems, as well as the software stack. We observe the development of a wide range of tools enabling hybrid systems and emphasize the need for future standardization of interfaces and methods to foster synergy.</description>

      <title>Entanglement features from heavy particle scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amount of information propagated by intermediate heavy particles exhibits characteristic features in inelastic scatterings with $n\geq 3$ final particles. As the total energy increases, the entanglement entropy, between its decay products and other final particles, exhibits a universal sharp dip, suppressed by its small decay rate. This indicates an entanglement suppression from a low-energy effective theory to a channel dominated by an on-shell heavy particle. As demonstrations of these entanglement features, we study concrete models of $2\to 3$ and $2\to 4$ scatterings, which shed light on the entanglement structure beyond the area law derived for $2\to 2$ scattering. In practice, these features may be probed by suitably marginalizing the phase-space distribution of final particles.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computation with Correlated Measurements: Implications for the Complexity Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2004, Aaronson introduced the complexity class $\mathsf{PostBQP}$ ($\mathsf{BQP}$ with postselection) and showed that it is equal to $\mathsf{PP}$. In this paper, we define a new complexity class, $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$, a modification of $\mathsf{BQP}$ which has the power to perform correlated measurements, i.e. measurements that output the same value across a partition of registers. We show that $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$ is exactly equal to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$, placing it "just above" $\mathsf{PP}$. In fact, we show that other metaphysical modifications of $\mathsf{BQP}$, such as $\mathsf{CBQP}$ (i.e. $\mathsf{BQP}$ with the ability to clone arbitrary quantum states), are also equal to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$. Furthermore, we show that $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$ is self-low with respect to classical queries. In contrast, if it were self-low under quantum queries, the counting hierarchy ($\mathsf{CH}$) would collapse to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$. Finally, we introduce a variant of rational degree that lower-bounds the query complexity of $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the melting of a domain wall in free-fermion chains, where the periodic variation of the hopping amplitudes gives rise to a band structure. It is shown that the entanglement grows logarithmically in time, and the prefactor is proportional to the number of filled bands in the initial state. For a dimerized chain the particle density and current are found to have the same expressions as in the homogeneous case, up to a rescaling of the velocity. The universal contribution to the entropy profile is then doubled, while the non-universal part can be extracted numerically from block-Toeplitz matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum scattering calculations for strongly interacting molecular systems are computationally demanding due to the large number of molecular states coupled by the anisotropy of atom - molecule interactions. We demonstrate that thermal rate coefficients for total (elastic + inelastic) atom - molecule scattering are insensitive to the interaction anisotropy of the underlying potential energy surface. In particular, we show that the rate coefficients for Rb-H$_2$ and Rb-N$_2$ scattering at room temperature can be computed to 1% accuracy with anisotropy set to zero, reducing the complexity of coupled channel quantum scattering calculations to numerical solutions of a single differential equation. Our numerical calculations and statistical analysis based on Gaussian process regression elucidate the origin and limitations of the invariance of the total scattering rate coefficients to changes in atom - molecule interaction anisotropy.</description>

Abstract: Radiative nonlinear four-wave mixing can monitor the evolution of electronic wave packets, providing access to lifetimes and quantifies the light induced couplings between excited states. We report the observation of quantum beats in an autoionizing electronic wavepacket in krypton, probed using this technique. Analysis of the signal reveals that these beats originate from the contribution of previously unassigned, doubly excited states interacting with singly excited ones. We introduce a minimal theoretical model, based on multichannel quantum defect theory, that quantitatively reproduces both the wavepacket dynamics and the static spectrum. This work combines a versatile, background-free experimental scheme with a tractable model, establishing a powerful approach for the metrology and control of complex, correlated electronic states.</description>

      <title>Observation of Momentum-Band Topology in PT-Symmetric acoustic Floquet Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Momentum-band topology, which transcends conventional topological band theory, unlocks new topological phases that host fascinating temporal interface states. However, direct bulk experimental evidence of such emerging band topology is still lacking due to the great challenges in resolving eigenstates and topological invariants of time-varying systems. Here, we present a comprehensive study on the momentum-band topology in a PT-symmetric Floquet lattice, where the drive-induced momentum gap can be characterized by a quantized Berry phase in the energy Brillouin zone. Experimentally, we synthesize the Floquet lattice model using an acoustic cavity-tube structure coupled to custom-designed external circuits. By reconstructing the effective Hamiltonian, we extract the system's eigenstates and provide the first bulk evidence of momentum-band topology from the perspectives of band inversion and topological invariants. This is accompanied by an unambiguous observation of time-localized interface states in real physical time, thereby providing the boundary signature of the bulk topology. Our work paves the way for further experimental studies on the burgeoning momentum-gap physics.</description>

      <title>Ergotropy of a Photosynthetic Reaction Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the Photosystem II reaction center using a quantum master equation approach, where excitonic and charge-transfer rates are computed at the Redfield and F\"orster levels with realistic spectral densities. The focus is on ergotropy, the maximum work extractable from a quantum state without energy loss. We compute the ergotropy by constructing passive states in the thermodynamic sense. Among the electron transfer pathways, those involving charge separation between $Chl_{D1}$ and $Phe_{D1}$, as well as a route passing through three sequential charge-separated states, yield higher ergotropy, suggesting greater capacity for work extraction, akin to quantum energy capacitors. A third pathway, bypassing the $Chl_{D1},Phe_{D1}$ pair, shows significantly reduced ergotropy. These differences arise from population-induced transitions between active and passive regimes. Our findings highlight how biological systems may exploit non-equilibrium population structures to optimize energy conversion, connecting quantum thermodynamic principles to biological energy harvesting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04128v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator systems of matrices can be viewed as quantum analogues of finite graphs. This analogy suggests many natural combinatorial questions in linear algebra. We determine the quantum Ramsey numbers $QR(2,k)$ and the lower quantum Tur\'an numbers $T^\downarrow(n, m)$ with $m \geq n/4$. In particular, we conclude that $QR(2,2) = 4$ and confirm Weaver's conjecture that $T^\downarrow(4, 1) = 4$. We also obtain a new result for the existence of anticliques in quantum graphs of low dimension.</description>

      <title>Electrons in quantum dots on helium: from charge qubits to synthetic color centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons trapped above the surface of helium provide a means to study many-body physics free from the randomness that comes from defects in other condensed-matter systems. Localizing an electron in an electrostatic quantum dot makes its energy spectrum discrete, with controlled level spacing. The lowest two states can act as charge qubit states. In this paper, we study how the coupling to the quantum field of capillary waves on helium -- ripplons -- affects electron dynamics. As we show, the coupling can be strong. This bounds the parameter range where electron-based charge qubits can be implemented. The constraint is different from the conventional relaxation time constraint. The electron-ripplon system in a dot is similar to a color center formed by an electron defect coupled to phonons in a solid. In contrast to solids, the coupling in the electron on helium system can be varied from strong to weak. This enables a qualitatively new approach to studying color center physics. We analyze the spectroscopy of the pertinent synthetic color centers in a broad range of the coupling strength</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific realism is, currently, one of the most well-entrenched background assumptions of some relevant versions of anti-exceptionalism about logic. We argue that this is a sort of sociological contingency rather than a metaphilosophical necessity. Drawing parallels with the metaphysics of science (as applied to quantum foundations), we try to bring the realist assumptions of anti-exceptionalism to light, to demotivate the necessary connection between realism and anti-exceptionalism, briefly exploring the possibility of adopting antirealism as the background default view of science instead.</description>

      <title>Linking diffusive fields to virtual waves as their propagative duals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04542v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In non-destructive and biomedical imaging, spatial patterns inside a sample are imaged without destroying it. Therefore, propagating waves, including electromagnetic or ultrasonic signals, or even diffuse heat are generated or modified by these internal patterns and transmit this structural information to the sample surface. There, the signals can be detected, and an image of the internal structure can be reconstructed from the measured signals. The amount of information about the interior of the sample that can be obtained from the detected signals at the sample surface is significantly influenced by the propagation from the internal structure to the surface. In the real world, all signal propagation is more or less irreversible. The entropy generated during propagation corresponds to the loss of information.
  In an idealized model, such propagating waves, called virtual waves, are described by the wave equation. They remain valid solutions of this equation when the direction of time is reversed, thus exhibiting reversibility and showing no entropy production and therefore no loss of information during propagation.
  We have used the locally computed virtual waves from the measured diffusive surface signals for image reconstruction using established time-of-flight methods from ultrasound or RADAR imaging. This improves the spatial resolution in thermography and compensates for the dispersion of quantum wave packets in atom probe tomography.</description>

      <title>Universal shape-dependence of quantum entanglement in disordered magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered quantum magnets are not only experimentally relevant, but offer efficient computational methodologies to calculate the low energy states as well as various measures of quantum correlations. Here, we present a systematic analysis of quantum entanglement in the paradigmatic random transverse-field Ising model in two dimensions, using an efficient implementation of the asymptotically exact strong disorder renormalization group method. The phase diagram is known to be governed by three distinct infinitely disordered fixed points (IDFPs) that we study here. For square subsystems, it has been recently established that quantum entanglement has a universal logarithmic correction due to the corners of the subsystem at all three IDFPs. This corner contribution has been proposed as an "entanglement susceptibility", a useful tool to locate the phase transition and to measure the correlation length critical exponent. Towards a deeper understanding, we quantify how the corner contribution depends on the shape of the subsystem. While the corner contribution remains universal, the shape-dependence is qualitatively different in each universality class, also confirmed by line segment subsystems, a special case of skeletal entanglement. Therefore, unlike in conformally invariant systems, in general different subsystem shapes are versatile probes to unveil new universal information on the phase transitions in disordered quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inverse Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system, initially in thermal equilibrium and prepared at different temperatures below that of the final equilibrium state, relaxes to the final state more rapidly when starting from a lower initial temperature. We extend this concept to the relaxation toward a prethermal state in isolated quantum systems. By examining a simple model that exhibits prethermalization, we demonstrate that this effect indeed manifests under periodic driving. We further discuss the realization of this phenomenon in a variety of systems within a unified theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Entropy from decoherence: a case study using glasma-based occupation numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the entropy-per-particle, $S/N$, produced by the decoherence of a coherent state interacting with an environment, using an analytical open quantum system approach. The coherent state considered is characterized by occupation numbers borrowed from the glasma fields produced in the early stages of high-energy nuclear collisions. The environment is modeled as the vacuum, and decoherence arises from the interaction of the state with vacuum fluctuations. We describe the system-environment interaction via a phase-damping model, which represents continuous measurements on the system without altering its energy or particle number. Starting from the occupation numbers typical of the Glasma in high-energy proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions, we find that the final $S/N$ after decoherence is lower than that of a two-dimensional thermal bath of ultrarelativistic gluons, except for proton-nucleus collisions at small values of $g\mu$. Our results indicate that quantum decoherence alone does not generate sufficient entropy to transform the initial coherent state into a thermalized gluon bath.</description>

      <title>Dual frequency calibration to build a portable vapor cell optical clock with improved stability and without a frequency comb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article theoretically proposes a new dual interferometer technique to accurately calibrate two laser frequencies simultaneously using four-wave mixing in an alkali metal vapor cell. The two frequency-calibrated lasers are mixed to create a beat signal at radio frequency to build a portable optical atomic clock (OAC) without an optical frequency comb (OFC). Removal of the OFC improves the portability of OAC, while the dual interferometer setup enhances the one second stability to $1.3\times 10^{-15}$, which is better than the current portable OAC. Thermal noise in the OAC is minimized by choosing the double-lambda atomic scheme with co-propagating laser fields. Using D2 transition of Rb-87, the standard quantum limited frequency sensitivity and stability of the OAC are estimated as $3.2\;\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$, and $1.3\times10^{-15}\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}^{-1}}$, respectively. After considering broadening effects due to $357\,$K temperature and collisions, the optimum stability of the OAC is reduced to $3.3\times10^{-15}\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}^{-1}}$ for a laser with $1\,$KHz linewidth and $0.54$ mW power at the input of the vapor cell.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically discuss a new kind of photonic spin-Hall effect (PSHE) for optical beams propagating inside an inhomogeneously twisted anisotropic material. The rotation angle plays the role of an effective gauge field. When the twisting distribution is odd symmetric, the optical beams move along mirror-symmetric trajectories according to their helicity. Connection of this volumetric PSHE with the geometric phase and the Kapitza effect is elucidated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present view of modern physics on non-equilibrium dynamics is that generic systems equilibrate or thermalize under rather general conditions, even closed systems under unitary time evolution. The investigation of exceptions thus not only appears attractive, in view of quantum computing where thermalization is a threat it also seems to be necessary. Here, we present aspects of the one-magnon dynamics on the kagome lattice antiferromagnet as an example of a non-equilibrating dynamics due to flat bands. Similar to the one-dimensional delta chain localized eigenstates also called localized magnons lead to disorder-free localization and prevent the system from equilibration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a novel localization phenomenon that emerges in non-Hermitian and quasiperiodic coupled systems, which we dub ``Anderson-Skin (AS) dualism". The emergence of AS dualism is due to the fact that non-Hermitian topological systems provide non-trivial topological transport channels for disordered systems, causing the originally localized Anderson modes to transform into skin modes, i.e., the localized states within the point gap regions have dual characteristics of localization under periodic boundary condition (PBC) and skin effects under open boundary conditions (OBC). As an example, we analytically prove the 1D AS dualism through the transfer matrix method. Moreover, by discussing many-body interacting systems, we confirm that AS dualism is universal.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Induced Chiral Currents in a Mesoscopic Helicoidal Quantum Well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mesoscopic quantum well whose confinement and chirality emerge solely from the intrinsic torsion of a finite helicoidal metric. This purely geometric construction requires no external gates or fields: the metric itself induces both a harmonic radial potential and a torsion-driven Zeeman term that breaks the $m \leftrightarrow -m$ degeneracy. By imposing hard-wall boundary conditions at $z = \pm L/2$, we quantize the axial motion and obtain a genuinely zero-dimensional helicoidal quantum dot. An exact analytic solution reveals an energy spectrum with chiral splitting linear in both the torsion parameter $\Omega$ and the axial quantum number $n_z$. For realistic InAs nanoroll parameters ($L = 100$ nm, $\Omega = 5\times10^{6} \mathrm{m^{-1}}$), this geometric effect results in a measurable splitting of $\sim 0.5$ meV. We propose three viable experimental platforms, ultracold atoms in optical traps, femtosecond-written photonic waveguides, and strain-engineered semiconductor nanorolls, where this torsion-induced phenomenon should be accessible with current technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional frustrated quantum Heisenberg model with bond disorder on nearest-neighbor couplings using the recently introduced Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States framework, which enables accurate and efficient computation of disorder-averaged observables with a single variational optimization. Simulations on large lattices reveal an extended region of the phase diagram where long-range magnetic order vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, while the overlap order parameter, which characterizes quantum spin glass states, remains finite. These findings, supported by a semiclassical analysis based on a large-spin expansion, provide compelling evidence that the spin glass phase is stable against quantum fluctuations, unlike the classical case where it disappears at any finite temperature.</description>

Abstract: We present a dequantization algorithm for the Vlasov--Poisson (VP) system, termed the dequantized particle algorithm, by systematically dequantizing the underlying many-body quantum theory. Starting from the second-quantized Hamiltonian description, we derive a finite-dimensional dequantized system and show that it furnishes a structure-preserving discretization of the Schr\"odinger--Poisson (SP) equations. Through the Wigner or Husimi transformations, this discretization provides an efficient approximation of the VP system when quantum effects are negligible. Unlike conventional structure-preserving algorithms formulated in 6D phase space, this dequantized particle algorithm operates in 3D configuration space, potentially offering more compact and efficient representations of physical information under appropriate conditions. A numerical example of the classical nonlinear two-stream instability, simulated using merely 97 dequantized particles, demonstrates the efficiency, accuracy, and conservation properties of the algorithm and confirms its potential as a foundation for developing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms for kinetic plasma dynamics.</description>

      <title>Statistical characterization of valley coupling in Si/SiGe quantum dots via $g$-factor measurements near a valley vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of low-energy valley excitations in Si/SiGe heterostructures often causes spin qubits to fail. It is therefore important to develop robust protocols for characterizing the valley coupling. Here, we show that realistically sized samplings of valley energy distributions tend to dramatically overestimate the average valley coupling. But we find that knowledge of the valley phase, in addition to the valley splitting, can significantly improve our estimates. Motivated by this understanding, we propose a novel method to probe the valley phase landscape across the quantum well using simple $g$-factor measurements. An important calibration step in this procedure is to measure $g$ in a loop enclosing a valley vortex, where the valley phase winds by $\pm 2\pi$ around a zero of the valley splitting. This proposal establishes an important new tool for probing spin qubits, and it can be implemented in current experiments.</description>

Abstract: The global landscape for quantum technologies (QTs) is rapidly changing, and proper understanding of their impact and subsequent regulations need to match this pace. A Responsible Innovation (RI) approach and guiding principles have been proposed to accompany this development. We examine practical efforts globally and in Canada, from industry to research to governments, and analyze the current status of quantum technological advances under the RI framework. We analyze and compare what is being done internationally, identify gaps in the Canadian strategy, propose initiatives to fill those gaps, and highlight areas where Canada is leading or where more work is needed.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Tensor-Network Fractional-Step Method for Incompressible Flow in Curvilinear Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithmic framework based on tensor networks for computing fluid flows around immersed objects in curvilinear coordinates. We show that the tensor network simulations can be carried out solely using highly compressed tensor representations of the flow fields and the differential operators and discuss the numerical implementation of the tensor operations required for computing fluid flows in detail. The applicability of our method is demonstrated by applying it to the paradigm example of steady and transient flows around stationary and rotating cylinders. We find excellent quantitative agreement in comparison to finite difference simulations for Strouhal numbers, forces and velocity fields. The properties of our approach are discussed in terms of reduced order models. We estimate the memory saving and potential runtime advantages in comparison to standard finite difference simulations. We find accurate results with errors of less than 0.3% for flow-field compressions by a factor of up to 20 and differential operators compressed by factors of up to 1000 compared to sparse matrix representations. We provide strong numerical evidence that the runtime scaling advantages of the tensor network approach with system size will provide substantial resource savings when simulating larger systems. Finally, we note that, like other tensor network-based fluid flow simulations, our algorithmic framework is directly portable to a quantum computer leading to further scaling advantages.</description>

      <title>Quantum Quasinormal Mode Theory for Dissipative Nano-Optics and Magnetodielectric Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented pace of evolution in nanoscale architectures for cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has posed crucial challenges for theory, where the quantum dynamics arising from the non-perturbative dressing of matter by cavity electric and magnetic fields, as well as the fundamentally non-hermitian character of the system are to be treated without significant approximation. The lossy electromagnetic resonances of photonic, plasmonic or magnonic nanostructures are described as quasinormal modes (QNMs), whose properties and interactions with quantum emitters and spin qubits are central to the understanding of dissipative nano-optics and magnetodielectric cQED. Despite recent advancements toward a fully quantum framework for QNMs, a general and universally accepted approach to QNM quantization for arbitrary linear media remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a unified theoretical framework, based on macroscopic QED and complex coordinate transformations, that achieves QNM quantization for a wide class of spatially inhomogeneous, dissipative (with possible gain components) and dispersive, linear, magnetodielectric resonators. The complex coordinate transformations effectively convert the radiative losses into non-radiative material dissipation, and via a suitable transformation that reflects all the losses of the resonator, we define creation and annihilation operators that allow the construction of modal Fock states for the joint excitations of field-dressed matter. By directly addressing the intricacies of modal loss in a fully quantum theory of magnetodielectric cQED, our approach enables the exploration of modern, quantum nano-optical experiments utilizing dielectric, plasmonic, magnetic or hybrid cQED architectures, and paves the way towards a rigorous assessment of room-temperature quantum nanophotonic technologies without recourse to ad hoc quantization schemes.</description>

      <title>Towards a consistent Semiclassical Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that semiclassical gravity can be rendered consistent by assuming that quantum systems only emit a gravitational field when they interact with a stable determination chain (SDCs), which are specific chains of interactions modeled via decoherence and test functions obeying a set of conditions. When systems are disconnected from SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field. This denies the universality of gravity, while upholding a version of the equivalence principle. We argue that this theory can be tested by experiments that investigate the gravitational field emitted by isolated systems like in gravcats experiments or by investigating the gravitational interactions between entangled systems like in the (Bose-Marletto-Vedral) BMV experiment. Our theory fits into a new framework which holds that in the absence of certain conditions, quantum systems cannot emit a gravitational field. There are many possible conditions for systems to emit a gravitational field, and we will adopt a subset of them. We will show how this subset of conditions provides multiple benefits beyond rendering semiclassical gravity consistent, which includes deriving the value of the cosmological constant from first principles and providing an explanation for why the vacuum does not gravitate.</description>

      <title>A Tensor Network based Decision Diagram for Representation of Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.02618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor networks have been successfully applied in simulation of quantum physical systems for decades. Recently, they have also been employed in classical simulation of quantum computing, in particular, random quantum circuits. This paper proposes a decision diagram style data structure, called TDD (Tensor Decision Diagram), for more principled and convenient applications of tensor networks. This new data structure provides a compact and canonical representation for quantum circuits. By exploiting circuit partition, the TDD of a quantum circuit can be computed efficiently. Furthermore, we show that the operations of tensor networks essential in their applications (e.g., addition and contraction), can also be implemented efficiently in TDDs. A proof-of-concept implementation of TDDs is presented and its efficiency is evaluated on a set of benchmark quantum circuits. It is expected that TDDs will play an important role in various design automation tasks related to quantum circuits, including but not limited to equivalence checking, error detection, synthesis, simulation, and verification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an optical technique for suppressing relaxation in alkali-metal spins using a single off-resonant laser beam. The method harnesses a physical mechanism that synchronizes Larmor precession in the two hyperfine manifolds, protecting magnetic coherence from relaxation caused by spin-exchange and other hyperfine-changing collisions. We experimentally demonstrate up to a ninefold reduction in decoherence of warm cesium vapor, achieving simultaneous protection from both spin-exchange relaxation and partial depolarization from coated cell walls. The technique substantially enhances the spin precession quality factor and maintains a stable gyromagnetic ratio independent of spin polarization, even under frequent collisions. These findings offer a pathway for mitigating dominant relaxation channels in alkali-metal-based applications and experiments, particularly in anti-relaxation-coated cells.</description>

Abstract: We propose to characterize multipartite entanglement of pure states as local unitary transformations acting on some parts of a system that can be undone by local unitary transformations acting on other parts. This leads to a definition of multipartite entanglement in terms of entanglement groups, constructed as certain quotients of the stabilizer group and its subgroups. We analyze properties of these entanglement groups and show that they imply restrictions which correspond to monogamy of entanglement. We use these groups to propose a coarse-grained classification scheme for entanglement in multi-partite quantum systems and we show that this group theory characterization of entanglement underlies several well-known quantum tasks.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Autonomous Quantum Error Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous quantum memories are a way to passively protect quantum information using engineered dissipation that creates an ``always-on'' decoder. We analyze Markovian autonomous decoders that can be implemented with a wide range of qubit and bosonic error-correcting codes, and derive several upper bounds and a lower bound on the logical error rate in terms of correction and noise rates. These bounds suggest that, in general, there is always a correction rate, possibly size-dependent, above which autonomous memories exhibit arbitrarily long coherence times. For any given autonomous memory, size dependence of this correction rate is difficult to rule out: we point to common scenarios where autonomous decoders that stochastically implement active error correction must operate at rates that grow with code size. For codes with a threshold, we show that it is possible to achieve faster-than-polynomial decay of the logical error rate with code size by using superlogarithmic scaling of the correction rate. We illustrate our results with several examples. One example is an exactly solvable global dissipative toric code model that can achieve an effective logical error rate that decreases exponentially with the linear lattice size, provided that the recovery rate grows proportionally with the linear lattice size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08991v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While traditionally regarded as an obstacle to quantum coherence, recent breakthroughs in quantum optics have shown that the dissipative interaction of a qubit with its environment can be leveraged to protect quantum states and synthesize many-body entanglement. Inspired by this progress, here we set the stage for the -- yet uncharted -- exploration of analogous cooperative phenomena in hybrid solid-state platforms. We develop a comprehensive formalism for the quantum many-body dynamics of an ensemble of solid-state spin defects interacting with the magnetic field fluctuations of a common solid-state reservoir. Our framework applies to any solid-state reservoir whose fluctuating spin, pseudospin, or charge degrees of freedom generate magnetic fields. To understand whether correlations induced by dissipative processes can play a relevant role in a realistic experimental setup, we apply our model to a qubit array interacting via the spin fluctuations of a ferromagnetic bath. Our results show that the low-temperature collective relaxation rates of the qubit ensemble can display clear signatures of super- and subradiance, i.e., forms of cooperative dynamics traditionally achieved in atomic ensembles. We find that the solid-state analog of these cooperative phenomena is robust against spatial disorder in the qubit ensemble and thermal fluctuations of the magnetic reservoir, providing a route for their feasibility in near-term experiments. Our work lays the foundation for a multi-qubit approach to quantum sensing of solid-state systems and the direct generation of many-body entanglement in spin-defect ensembles. Furthermore, we discuss how the tunability of solid-state reservoirs opens up novel pathways for exploring cooperative phenomena in regimes beyond the reach of conventional quantum optics setups.</description>

      <title>Learning unitaries with quantum statistical queries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose several algorithms for learning unitary operators from quantum statistical queries with respect to their Choi-Jamiolkowski state. Quantum statistical queries capture the capabilities of a learner with limited quantum resources, which receives as input only noisy estimates of expected values of measurements. Our approach leverages quantum statistical queries to estimate the Fourier mass of a unitary on a subset of Pauli strings, generalizing previous techniques developed for uniform quantum examples. Specifically, we show that the celebrated quantum Goldreich-Levin algorithm can be implemented with quantum statistical queries, whereas the prior version of the algorithm involves oracle access to the unitary and its inverse. As an application, we prove that quantum Boolean functions with constant total influence or with constant degree are efficiently learnable in our model. Moreover, we prove that $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-juntas are efficiently learnable and constant-depth circuits are learnable query-efficiently with quantum statistical queries. On the other hand, all previous algorithms for these tasks demand significantly greater resources, such as oracle access to the unitary or direct access to the Choi-Jamiolkowski state. We also demonstrate that, despite these positive results, quantum statistical queries lead to an exponentially larger query complexity for certain tasks, compared to separable measurements to the Choi-Jamiolkowski state. In particular, we show an exponential lower bound for learning a class of phase-oracle unitaries and a double exponential lower bound for testing the unitarity of channels. Taken together, our results indicate that quantum statistical queries offer a unified framework for various unitary learning tasks, with potential applications in quantum machine learning, many-body physics and benchmarking of near-term devices.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement, crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity, is commonly assessed through various measures such as von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and entanglement contour, each with its inherent advantages and limitations. In this work, we introduce the hyperfine structure of entanglement, which decomposes entanglement contours known as the fine structure into particle-number cumulants. This measure exhibits a set of universal properties with its significance in quantum information science. We apply it across diverse contexts: in Fermi gases, establishing connections to mutual information and interacting conformal field theory; in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, unveiling finer subregion-subregion duality; and in Chern insulators, distinguishing between different quantum phases, especially topological gapped state and trivial gapped state. Our findings suggest experimental accessibility, offering fresh insights into quantum entanglement across physical systems.</description>

Abstract: This study presents a novel quantum algorithm for lattice gas automata simulation with a single time step, demonstrating logarithmic complexity in terms of $CX$ gates. The algorithm is composed of three main steps: collision, mapping, and propagation. A computational complexity analysis and a comparison using different error rates and number of shots are provided. Despite the impact of noise, our findings indicate that accurate simulations could be achieved already on current noisy devices. This suggests potential for efficient simulation of classical fluid dynamics using quantum lattice gas automata, conditional on advancements to expand the current method to multiple time steps and state preparation.</description>

      <title>Quantum PCPs: on Adaptivity, Multiple Provers and Reductions to Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a general formulation of quantum PCPs, which captures adaptivity and multiple unentangled provers, and give a detailed construction of the quantum reduction to a local Hamiltonian with a constant promise gap. The reduction turns out to be a versatile subroutine to prove properties of quantum PCPs, allowing us to show: (i) Non-adaptive quantum PCPs can simulate adaptive quantum PCPs when the number of proof queries is constant. In fact, this can even be shown to hold when the non-adaptive quantum PCP picks the proof indices simply uniformly at random from a subset of all possible index combinations, answering an open question by Aharonov, Arad, Landau and Vazirani (STOC '09). (ii) If the $q$-local Hamiltonian problem with constant promise gap can be solved in $\mathsf{QCMA}$, then $\mathsf{QPCP}[q] \subseteq \mathsf{QCMA}$ for any $q \in O(1)$. (iii) If $\mathsf{QMA}(k)$ has a quantum PCP for any $k \leq \text{poly}(n)$, then $\mathsf{QMA}(2) = \mathsf{QMA}$, connecting two of the longest-standing open problems in quantum complexity theory. Moreover, we also show that there exist (quantum) oracles relative to which certain quantum PCP statements are false. Hence, any attempt to prove the quantum PCP conjecture requires, just as was the case for the classical PCP theorem, (quantumly) non-relativizing techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantum Realization of the Finite Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19512v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum algorithm for the solution of prototypical second-order linear elliptic partial differential equations discretized by $d$-linear finite elements on Cartesian grids of a bounded $d$-dimensional domain. An essential step in the construction is a BPX preconditioner, which transforms the linear system into a sufficiently well-conditioned one, making it amenable to quantum computation. We provide a constructive proof demonstrating that, for any fixed dimension, our quantum algorithm can compute suitable functionals of the solution to a given tolerance $\mathtt{tol}$ with an optimal complexity of order $\mathtt{tol}^{-1}$ up to logarithmic terms, significantly improving over existing approaches. Notably, this approach does not rely on regularity of the solution and achieves quantum advantage over classical solvers in two dimensions, whereas prior quantum methods required at least four dimensions for asymptotic benefits. We further detail the design and implementation of a quantum circuit capable of executing our algorithm, present simulator results, and report numerical experiments on current quantum hardware, confirming the feasibility of preconditioned finite element methods for near-term quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits can be sensitive to abrupt energy deposits caused by cosmic rays and ambient radioactivity. While previous studies have explored correlated effects in time and space due to cosmic ray interactions, we present the first direct comparison of a transmon qubit's performance measured at two distinct sites: the above-ground SQMS facility (Fermilab, US) and the deep-underground Gran Sasso Laboratory (Italy). Despite the stark difference in radiation levels, we observe a similar average qubit relaxation time of approximately 80 microseconds at both locations. To further investigate potential radiation-induced events, we employ a fast decay detection protocol, comparing the relative rates of triggered events between the two environments. Although intrinsic noise remains the dominant source of single errors in superconducting qubits, our analysis revealed a significant excess of radiation-induced events for high-coherence transmon qubits operated above-ground. Finally, using $\gamma$-ray sources with increasing activity levels, we evaluate the qubit response in a controlled low-background environment.</description>

      <title>Quantum Enhanced Sensitivity through Many-Body Bloch Oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13921v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sensing capacity of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems exhibiting Bloch oscillations. By focusing on the resource efficiency of the probe, quantified by quantum Fisher information, we find different scaling behaviors in two different phases, namely localized and extended. Our results provide a quantitative ansatz for quantum Fisher information in terms of time, probe size, and the number of excitations. In the long-time regime, the quantum Fisher information is a quadratic function of time, touching the Heisenberg limit. The system size scaling drastically depends on the phase changing from quantum-enhanced scaling in the extended phase to size-independent behavior in the localized phase. Furthermore, increasing the number of excitations always enhances the precision of the probe, although, in the interacting systems the enhancement becomes less eminent than the non-interacting probes. This is due to the induced localization by increasing the interaction between the excitations. We show that a simple particle configuration measurement together with a maximum likelihood estimation can closely reach the ultimate precision limit in both single- and multi-particle probes.</description>

      <title>Coherent information for CSS codes under decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stabilizer codes lie at the heart of modern quantum-error-correcting codes (QECC). Of particular importance is a class called Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, which includes many important examples such as toric codes, color codes, and fractons. Recent studies have revealed that the decoding transition for these QECCs could be intrinsically captured by calculating information-theoretic quantities from the mixed state. Here we perform a simple analytic calculation of the coherent information for general CSS codes under local incoherent Pauli errors via diagonalization of the density matrices and mapping to classical statistical mechanical (SM) models. Our result establishes a rigorous connection between the decoding transition of the quantum code and the phase transition in the random classical SM model. It is also directly confirmed for CSS codes that exact error correction is possible if and only if the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder always succeeds in the thermodynamic limit. Thus, the fundamental threshold is saturated by the optimal decoder.</description>

      <title>Qudit Quantum Programming with Projective Cliffords</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel abstraction for programming quantum operations, specifically projective Cliffords, as functions over the qudit Pauli group. Generalizing the idea behind Pauli tableaux, we introduce a type system and lambda calculus for projective Cliffords called LambdaPC, which captures well-formed Clifford operations via a Curry-Howard correspondence with a particular encoding of the Clifford and Pauli groups. Importantly, the language captures not just qubit operations, but qudit operations for any dimension $d$.
  Throughout the paper we explore what it means to program with projective Cliffords through a number of examples and a case study focusing on stabilizer error correcting codes.</description>

      <title>A bound on the quantum value of all compiled nonlocal games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A cryptographic compiler introduced by Kalai et al. (STOC'23) converts any nonlocal game into an interactive protocol with a single computationally bounded prover. Although the compiler is known to be sound in the case of classical provers and complete in the quantum case, quantum soundness has so far only been established for special classes of games. In this work, we establish a quantum soundness result for all compiled two-player nonlocal games. In particular, we prove that the quantum commuting operator value of the underlying nonlocal game is an upper bound on the quantum value of the compiled game. Our result employs techniques from operator algebras in a computational and cryptographic setting to establish information-theoretic objects in the asymptotic limit of the security parameter. It further relies on a sequential characterization of quantum commuting operator correlations which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Harvesting asymmetric steering via non-identical detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate asymmetric steering harvesting phenomenon involving two non-identical inertial detectors with different energy gaps, which interact locally with vacuum massless scalar fields. Our study assumes that the energy gap of detector $B$ exceeds that of detector $A$. It is shown that $A\rightarrow B$ steerability is bigger that $B\rightarrow A$ steerability, implying that the observer with a small energy gap has more stronger steerability than the other one. We find that the energy gap difference can enlarge the harvesting-achievable range of $A\rightarrow B$ steering, while it can also narrow the harvesting-achievable range of $B\rightarrow A$ steering at the same time. In addition, the maximal steering asymmetry indicates the transformation between two-way steering and one-way steering in some cases, showing that $B\rightarrow A$ steering suffers ``sudden death" at the point of this parameter. These results suggest that asymmetric steering exhibits richer and more interesting properties than quantum entanglement harvested from vacuum quantum field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13880v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relationship between advice in the form of a training set and classical advice. We do this by analyzing the class $\mathsf{BPP/samp}$ and certain variants of it. Specifically, our main result demonstrates that $\mathsf{BPP/samp}$ is a proper subset of the class $\mathsf{P/poly}$, which implies that advice in the form of a training set is strictly weaker than classical advice. This result remains valid when considering quantum advice and a quantum generalization of the training set. Finally, leveraging the insights from our proofs, we identify both sufficient and necessary complexity-theoretic assumptions for the existence of concept classes that exhibit a quantum learning speed-up. We consider both the worst-case setting, where accurate results are required for all inputs, and the average-case setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of stable subspaces in the low-temperature quantum thermal dynamics of finite spin chains. Our analysis reveals the existence of effective decoherence-free qudit subspaces, persisting for timescales exponential in $\beta$. Surprisingly, the appearance of metastable subspaces is not directly related to the entanglement structure of the ground state(s). Rather, they arise from symmetry relations in low-lying excited states. Despite their stability within a 'phase', practical realization of stable qubits is hindered by susceptibility to symmetry-breaking perturbations. This work highlights that there can be non-trivial quantum behavior in the thermal dynamics of noncommuting many body models, and opens the door to more extensive studies of self-correction in such systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum repeaters are an essential building block for realizing long-distance quantum communications. However, due to the fragile nature of quantum information, these repeaters suffer from loss and operational errors. Prior works have classified repeaters into three broad categories based on their use of probabilistic or near-deterministic methods to mitigate these errors. Besides differences in classical communication times, these approaches also vary in technological complexity, with near-deterministic methods requiring more advanced technology. Recent increases in the number of available memories, and introduction of entanglement generation through multiplexing motivate a re-comparison of one-way and two-way repeater architectures. In this work, we propose a novel protocol that optimizes multiplexed elementary link generation and distillation in memory-unconstrained 'connection-oriented' two-way repeaters to boost the entanglement generation rates. We introduce a recursive formulation to derive the probability distribution of the number of Bell pairs in multiplexed two-way repeater architectures, compatible with probabilistic $n$-to-$k$ distillation protocols. We then compare the performance of this new protocol with one-way schemes in the parameter regime where one-way schemes have previously been shown to be advantageous, and find that the multiplexed two-way protocol provides better performance with lower resource and technology requirements.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Quantum Neural Network for Split Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field of research with potential applications to distributed collaborative learning, such as Split Learning (SL). SL allows resource-constrained clients to collaboratively train ML models with a server, reduce their computational overhead, and enable data privacy by avoiding raw data sharing. Although QML with SL has been studied, the problem remains open in resource-constrained environments where clients lack quantum computing capabilities. Additionally, data privacy leakage between client and server in SL poses risks of reconstruction attacks on the server side. To address these issues, we propose Hybrid Quantum Split Learning (HQSL), an application of Hybrid QML in SL. HQSL enables classical clients to train models with a hybrid quantum server and curtails reconstruction attacks. Additionally, we introduce a novel qubit-efficient data-loading technique for designing a quantum layer in HQSL, minimizing both the number of qubits and circuit depth. Evaluations on real hardware demonstrate HQSL's practicality under realistic quantum noise. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate HQSL's feasibility and ability to enhance classification performance compared to its classical models. Notably, HQSL achieves mean improvements of over 3% in both accuracy and F1-score for the Fashion-MNIST dataset, and over 1.5% in both metrics for the Speech Commands dataset. We expand these studies to include up to 100 clients, confirming HQSL's scalability. Moreover, we introduce a noise-based defense mechanism to tackle reconstruction attacks on the server side. Overall, HQSL enables classical clients to train collaboratively with a hybrid quantum server, improving model performance and resistance against reconstruction attacks.</description>

      <title>Beating the Optimal Verification of Entangled States via Collective Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of quantum information processing, the efficient characterization of entangled states poses an overwhelming challenge, rendering the traditional methods including quantum tomography unfeasible and impractical. To tackle this problem, we propose a new verification scheme using collective strategies, showcasing arbitrarily high efficiency that beats the optimal verification with global measurements. Our collective scheme can be implemented in various experimental platforms and scalable for large systems with a linear scaling on hardware requirement, and distributed operations are allowed. Notably, larger ensembles can always improve the efficiency further, but without increasing the quantum memory. More importantly, the approach consumes only a few copies of the entangled states, while ensuring the preservation of unmeasured ones, and even boosting their fidelity for any subsequent tasks. Furthermore, our protocol provides additional insight into the specific types of noise affecting the system, thereby facilitating potential targeted improvements. These advancements hold promise for a wide range of applications, offering a pathway towards more robust and efficient quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Observation of disorder-free localization using a (2+1)D lattice gauge theory on a quantum processor</title>

Abstract: Disorder-induced phenomena in quantum many-body systems pose significant challenges for analytical methods and numerical simulations at relevant time and system scales. To reduce the cost of disorder-sampling, we investigate quantum circuits initialized in states tunable to superpositions over all disorder configurations. In a translationally-invariant lattice gauge theory (LGT), these states can be interpreted as a superposition over gauge sectors. We observe localization in this LGT in the absence of disorder in one and two dimensions: perturbations fail to diffuse despite fully disorder-free evolution and initial states. However, R\'enyi entropy measurements reveal that superposition-prepared states fundamentally differ from those obtained by direct disorder sampling. Leveraging superposition, we propose an algorithm with a polynomial speedup in sampling disorder configurations, a longstanding challenge in many-body localization studies.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological quantum mechanics I: phenomenology of quantum observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of quantum mechanics solely from phenomenological observations. The only assumed inputs are obtained through sequential probing of quantum systems; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are permitted. We demonstrate that it is indeed possible to derive, on this basis, a complete and fully functional formalism rooted in the structures of Hilbert spaces. However, the resulting formalism--the bi-trajectory formalism--differs significantly from the standard state-focused formulation. In Part I of the paper, we analyze the outcomes of various experiments involving sequential measurements of quantum observables. These outcomes are quantitatively described by phenomenological multi-time probability distributions, estimated from experimental data. Our first conclusion is that the theory describing these experiments must be non-classical: the measured sequences cannot be interpreted as sampling of a uni-trajectory representing the system's observable. The non-classical nature of the investigated systems manifests in a range of observed phenomena, including quantum interference, the quantum Zeno effect, and uncertainty relations between the measured observables.</description>

      <title>The multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality and the squashed entanglement of the multimode extreme bosonic Gaussian channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality for bosonic quantum systems. This inequality determines the minimum conditional von Neumann entropy of the output of the most general linear mixing of bosonic quantum modes among all the input states of the modes with given conditional entropies. Bosonic quantum systems constitute the mathematical model for the electromagnetic radiation in the quantum regime, which provides the most promising platform for quantum communication and quantum key distribution. We apply our multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality to determine new lower bounds to the squashed entanglement of a large family of bosonic Gaussian states. The squashed entanglement is one of the main entanglement measures in quantum communication theory, providing the best known upper bound to the distillable key. Exploiting this result, we determine a new lower bound to the squashed entanglement of the multimode bosonic Gaussian channels that are extreme, i.e., that cannot be decomposed as a non-trivial convex combination of quantum channels. The squashed entanglement of a quantum channel provides an upper bound to its secret-key capacity, i.e., the capacity to generate a secret key shared between the sender and the receiver. Lower bounds to the squashed entanglement are notoriously hard to prove. Our results contribute to break this barrier and will stimulate further research in the field of quantum communication with bosonic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Classical Algorithms for Constant Approximation of the Ground State Energy of Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct classical algorithms computing an approximation of the ground state energy of an arbitrary $k$-local Hamiltonian acting on $n$ qubits.
  We first consider the setting where a good ``guiding state'' is available, which is the main setting where quantum algorithms are expected to achieve an exponential speedup over classical methods. We show that a constant approximation (i.e., an approximation with constant relative accuracy) of the ground state energy can be computed classically in $\mathrm{poly}\left(1/\chi,n\right)$ time and $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ space, where $\chi$ denotes the overlap between the guiding state and the ground state (as in prior works in dequantization, we assume sample-and-query access to the guiding state). This gives a significant improvement over the recent classical algorithm by Gharibian and Le Gall (SICOMP 2023), and matches (up a to polynomial overhead) both the time and space complexities of quantum algorithms for constant approximation of the ground state energy. We also obtain classical algorithms for higher-precision approximation.
  For the setting where no guided state is given (i.e., the standard version of the local Hamiltonian problem), we obtain a classical algorithm computing a constant approximation of the ground state energy in $2^{O(n)}$ time and $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ space. To our knowledge, before this work it was unknown how to classically achieve these bounds simultaneously, even for constant approximation. We also discuss complexity-theoretic aspects of our results.</description>

      <title>Deterministic generation of frequency-bin-encoded microwave photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A distributed quantum computing network requires a quantum communication channel between spatially separated processing units. In superconducting circuits, such a channel can be implemented based on propagating microwave photons to encode and transfer quantum information between an emitter and a receiver. However, traveling microwave photons can be lost during the transmission, leading to the failure of information transfer. Heralding protocols can be used to detect such photon losses. In this work, we propose such a protocol and experimentally demonstrate a frequency-bin encoding method of microwave photonic modes using superconducting circuits. We deterministically encode the quantum information from a superconducting qubit by simultaneously emitting its information into two photonic modes at different frequencies, with a process fidelity of 90.4%. The frequency-bin-encoded photonic modes can be used, at the receiver processor, to detect the occurrence of photon loss. Our work thus provides a reliable method to implement high-fidelity quantum state transfer in a distributed quantum computing network, incorporating error detection to enhance performance and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Unstructured Adiabatic Quantum Optimization: Optimality with Limitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the circuit model of quantum computing, amplitude amplification techniques can be used to find solutions to NP-hard problems defined on $n$-bits in time $\text{poly}(n) 2^{n/2}$. In this work, we investigate whether such general statements can be made for adiabatic quantum optimization, as provable results regarding its performance are mostly unknown. Although a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ has existed in such a setting for over a decade, a purely adiabatic algorithm with this running time has been absent. We show that adiabatic quantum optimization using an unstructured search approach results in a running time that matches this lower bound (up to a polylogarithmic factor) for a broad class of classical local spin Hamiltonians. For this, it is necessary to bound the spectral gap throughout the adiabatic evolution and compute beforehand the position of the avoided crossing with sufficient precision so as to adapt the adiabatic schedule accordingly. However, we show that the position of the avoided crossing is approximately given by a quantity that depends on the degeneracies and inverse gaps of the problem Hamiltonian and is NP-hard to compute even within a low additive precision. Furthermore, computing it exactly (or nearly exactly) is \#P-hard. Our work indicates a possible limitation of adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms, leaving open the question of whether provable Grover-like speed-ups can be obtained for any optimization problem using this approach.</description>

      <title>Topological schemes in spacetime for the electrodynamic Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider different schemes for the electrodynamic Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect introduced in Ref. [Phys. Rev. A $\mathbf{108}$, 062218 (2023)], exploring the phenomenon to enhance the understanding of its topological nature in spacetime. In the treated examples, the electric current in a solenoid varies in time, changing its internal magnetic field and producing an external electric field, while a quantum charged particle is in a superposition state inside two Faraday cages in an interferometer. The Faraday cages cancel the electric field at their interiors, such that the particle is always subjected to null electromagnetic fields. We discuss how the AB phase difference depends on the topology of the electric and magnetic fields in spacetime in the different treated situations. In particular, we discuss interesting results when a conducting wire connects the two Faraday cages, with the AB phase depending on the wire position. We also show an amplification of the AB phase when the wire makes several turns around the solenoid, which could enable an experimental verification of the effect.</description>

      <title>A Universal Circuit Set Using the $S_3$ Quantum Double</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One potential route toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computation is to use non-Abelian topological codes. In this work, we investigate how to achieve this goal with the quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ -- a specific non-Abelian topological code. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a qubit-qutrit pair, we give an explicit construction of the circuits for creating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design a specialized anyon interferometer to remotely measure the total charge of well-separated anyons; this avoids fusion, which would compromise fault tolerance. These protocols enable the implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active quantum error correction of the circuit-level noise during the computation process. To further reduce the error rate and facilitate error correction, we encode each physical degree of freedom of $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ into a novel, quantum, error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the logical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal offers a promising path to realize robust universal topological quantum computation in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Learning Feedback Mechanisms for Measurement-Based Variational Quantum State Preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a self-learning protocol that incorporates measurement and feedback into variational quantum circuits for efficient quantum state preparation. By combining projective measurements with conditional feedback, the protocol learns state preparation strategies that extend beyond unitary-only methods, leveraging measurement-based shortcuts to reduce circuit depth. Using the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state as a benchmark, the protocol learns high-fidelity state preparation by overcoming a family of measurement induced local minima through adjustments of parameter update frequencies and ancilla regularization. Despite these efforts, optimization remains challenging due to the highly non-convex landscapes inherent to variational circuits. The approach is extended to larger systems using translationally invariant ans\"atze and recurrent neural networks for feedback, demonstrating scalability. Additionally, the successful preparation of a specific AKLT state with desired edge modes highlights the potential to discover new state preparation protocols where none currently exist. These results indicate that integrating measurement and feedback into variational quantum algorithms provides a promising framework for quantum state preparation.</description>

Abstract: We revisit an argument proposed by Hardy concerning local realistic theories, but in terms of probability currents in standard quantum mechanics and of the trajectories obtained from its flux lines. We emphasize surprising properties of the trajectories in configuration space, in particular their (quasi) discontinuous variations when the context (the experimental setup) is changed. This occurs in both Galilean and Einsteinian relativity. In the latter case, discontinuous variations also appear without changing the setup, when the Lorentzian reference frame is changed.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally superposition-robust entangled state in all multiparty quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the inseparability of states generated by superposition of a multipartite pure entangled state with a product state. In particular, we identify specific multipartite entangled states that will always produce inseparability after superposition with an arbitrary completely product state. Thus, these entangled states are unconditionally superposition-robust, and we refer to this phenomenon as ``unconditional inseparability of superposition" in multipartite quantum systems. In this way, we complete the picture of unconditional inseparability of superposition which was introduced earlier for bipartite systems. We also characterize the superposition of a multipartite pure entangled state with a pure bi-separable state. However, the present analysis allows us to obtain a more general result, viz., there exists at least one pure entangled state in any multipartite Hilbert space such that its superposition with an arbitrary completely product state always yields an entangled state. On the other hand, for any bipartite pure entangled state, if at least one of the subsystems is a qubit, then it is always possible to find a suitable product state such that the superposition of the entangled state and the product state produces a product state. In this way, we find a feature of multipartite quantum systems which is in sharp contrast with that of bipartite ones. We then show how unconditional inseparability of superposition can be useful in exhibiting an indistinguishability property within the local unambiguous state discrimination problem.</description>

Abstract: We investigate state designs for continuous-variable quantum systems using the aid of lattice-like quantum states. These are code states of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. We show that for an n-mode system, the set of all GKP states forms a rigged continuous-variable state 2-design. We use these lattice state designs to construct a continuous variable shadow tomography protocol, derive sample complexity bounds for both global- and local GKP shadows under reasonable physical assumptions, and provide the physical gadgets needed to implement this protocol.</description>

      <title>Cylindrically confined $H$ atom in magnetic field: variational cut-off factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14297v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present study, we consider the hydrogen atom confined within an impenetrable infinite cylindrical cavity of radius $\rho_{0}$ in the presence of a constant magnetic field ${\bf B} = B\,\hat{\bf z}$ oriented along the main cylinder's axis. In the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, anchoring the nucleus to the geometric center of the cylinder, a physically meaningful 3-parametric trial function is used to determine the ground state energy $E$ of the system. This trial function incorporates the exact symmetries and key limiting behaviors of the problem explicitly. In particular, it does not treat the Coulomb potential nor the magnetic interaction as a \textit{perturbation}. The novel inclusion of a variational cut-off factor $\big(1 - \big(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\big)^\nu\big)$, $\nu \geq 1$, appears to represent a significant improvement compared to the non-variational cut-off factors commonly employed in the literature. The dependence of the total energy $E=E(\rho_0,\,B)$ and the binding energy $E_b=E_b(\rho_0,\,B)$ on the cavity radius $\rho_0 \in [0.8,\,5] \,$a.u. and the magnetic field strength $B\in [0.0,\,1.0]\,$a.u. is presented in detail. The expectation values $\langle \rho \rangle$ and $\langle|z| \rangle$, and the Shannon entropy in position space are computed to provide additional insights into the system's localization. A brief discussion is provided comparing the 2D and 3D cases as well.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal characteristics and argand diagram of two-qubit gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlocal characteristics of a two-qubit gate are determined by its nonlocal part. The squared eigenvalues of the nonlocal part of a two-qubit gate exist on the unit circle in the complex plane. We show that two sets of chords, the chords connecting the squared eigenvalues with each other and those connecting a squared eigenvalue with the complex conjugate of others in the unit circle, can be used to describe the nonlocal characteristics of two-qubit gates. Lengths of both sets of chords are proportional to the amount of entanglement contained in certain pure states. The entangling power of a two-qubit gate can be expressed in terms of the squared lengths of the first set of chords. Similarly, we show that the gate typicality of a two-qubit gate can be expressed in terms of the squared lengths of the second set of chords and the linear entropy of a two-qubit gate can be expressed using the squared lengths of both sets of chords. Perfect entanglers are known to transform some product states into maximally entangled states. The convex hull of the squared eigenvalues of the nonlocal part of perfect entanglers contain the zero. We analyse the simplices containing the zero in the convex hull of the squared eigenvalues of the nonlocal part of perfect entanglers to construct a pair of orthonormal product states that can be transformed into maximally entangled states by the nonlocal part of perfect entanglers and divide the region of perfect entanglers in the Weyl chamber into three tetrahedral regions and eight bounding planes based on the uniqueness of the simplices containing the zero.</description>

      <title>Correlations and Krylov spread for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian: Ising chain with a complex-valued transverse magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A scheme for implementing quantum batteries in a realizable and controllable platform based on a trapped ion chain driven by a mechanical oscillator is proposed. The effects of the hopping interaction between the two-level ions and the coupling interaction between the ions and the external mechanical oscillator on the charging process of the battery are investigated. The importance of the counter-rotating wave terms in the system's Hamiltonian, which are often ignored, is analyzed, and it is found that the charging energy and the ergotropy of the battery are dramatically affected by the counter-rotating wave terms. The quantum phase transition of the two-level system is restrained by the counter-rotating wave terms due to the destruction of the quantum coherence. Lastly, the power-law dependence of the charging process on the distance between the ions is discussed. Our theoretical analysis provides a solid foundation for the development of a practical quantum battery.</description>

      <title>Controlling complex dynamics with synthetic magnetism in optomechanical systems: A route to enhanced sensor performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the complex nonlinear dynamics of an optomechanical system featuring an optical cavity coupled to two mechanical resonators interconnected by a phase-dependent interaction. We specifically explore the role of this phase-dependent phonon hopping as a mechanism for generating synthetic gauge fields without relying on gain-loss or PT-symmetric elements, offering a potentially more robust approach to manipulate mechanical energy transfer. By deriving the semiclassical dynamical equations, we map out the system's behavior across different parameter regimes. Our findings reveal a rich spectrum of dynamics, including bistability (coexistence of two steady states) and the emergence of complex attractors such as self-excited oscillations, hidden attractors, and chaos. We demonstrate how controlling system parameters, particularly the mechanical coupling phase and optical drive, allows for tunability between these distinct dynamical states. The presence of tunable bistability and sensitive chaotic regimes offers significant potential for practical applications. Specifically, we discuss how these controlled dynamics could be leveraged for state-switching in optical information processing and for enhancing sensitivity in advanced sensor technologies through chaos-based mechanisms. This work deepens our understanding of how synthetic gauge fields, generated via phase-dependent interactions, can sculpt the nonlinear dynamics of optomechanical systems, providing a pathway toward designing robust and tunable devices for signal processing, communication, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Universality in the Anticoncentration of Chaotic Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a \emph{universal functional form} that governs anticoncentration in random quantum circuits-one that holds across diverse circuit architectures and depths, and crucially remains valid even at finite system sizes and shallow depth. We support this claim through analytical results for ensembles of random tensor-network states and random-phase models. This compact, universal expression for the output bitstring probability distribution is fully characterized by just two fitting parameters, as validated through extensive numerical simulations. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of finite-size and finite-depth effects in shaping anticoncentration and introduce a practical framework for benchmarking quantum devices using shallow circuits, thereby enabling validation of systems significantly larger than previously accessible.</description>

      <title>Study of double kicked top: a classical and quantum perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06103v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the double kicked top (DKT), which is an extension of the standard quantum kicked top (QKT) model. The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_\theta)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_\theta$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT.</description>

      <title>A Useful Metric for the NISQ Era: Qubit Error Probability and Its Role in Zero Noise Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate assessment and management of errors is indispensable for extracting useful results from noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we propose the qubit error probability (QEP), a device specific metric that combines relaxation, dephasing, gate, and measurement contributions into a single per qubit figure of merit computable before execution. Leveraging QEP as the control variable, we revisit zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) by adding pairs of controlled native two-qubit gates on all connected qubit pairs to generate circuits with successively larger mean QEP; the zero error limit is then approximated by a linear regression of the measured observable against those values. Benchmarking on IBM Quantum Heron processors, we apply QEP guided ZNE to first order Trotterized simulations of the two dimensional transverse field Ising model, chosen as a representative interacting many body system, involving up to 68 qubits and 15 Trotter steps. In regimes where the raw circuits exhibit a finite mean QEP, the method suppresses observable errors beyond those attainable with circuit depth scaled ZNE, while requiring only three noise scaled evaluations and no additional classical post processing. These results demonstrate that QEP serves as a transparent and efficient error metric, and that its integration into ZNE provides a practical route to reliability gains on current superconducting hardware, without the resource costs associated with full quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Reversing Hydrogen-Related Loss in $\alpha$-Ta Thin Films for Quantum Device Fabrication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) is an emerging material for superconducting qubit fabrication due to the low microwave loss of its stable native oxide. However, hydrogen absorption during fabrication, particularly when removing the native oxide, can degrade performance by increasing microwave loss. In this work, we demonstrate that hydrogen can enter $\alpha$-Ta thin films when exposed to 10 vol% hydrofluoric acid for 3 minutes or longer, leading to an increase in power-independent ohmic loss in high-Q resonators at millikelvin temperatures. Reduced resonator performance is likely caused by the formation of non-superconducting tantalum hydride (TaH$_x$) precipitates. We further show that annealing at 500{\deg}C in ultra-high vacuum (10$^{-8}$ Torr) for one hour fully removes hydrogen and restores the resonators' intrinsic quality factors to ~4 million at the single-photon level. These findings identify a previously unreported loss mechanism in $\alpha$-Ta and offer a pathway to reverse hydrogen-induced degradation in quantum devices based on Ta and, by extension also Nb, enabling more robust fabrication processes for superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Enhancing variational quantum algorithms by balancing training on classical and quantum hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers offer a promising route to tackling problems that are classically intractable such as in prime-factorization, solving large-scale linear algebra and simulating complex quantum systems, but potentially require fault-tolerant quantum hardware. On the other hand, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are a promising approach for leveraging near-term quantum computers to solve complex problems. However, there remain major challenges in their trainability and resource costs on quantum hardware. Here we address these challenges by adopting Hardware Efficient and dynamical LIe algebra supported Ansatz (HELIA), and propose two training methods that combine an existing classical-enhanced g-sim method and the quantum-based Parameter-Shift Rule (PSR). Our improvement comes from distributing the resources required for gradient estimation and training to both classical and quantum hardware. We numerically evaluate our approach for ground-state estimation of 6 to 18-qubit Hamiltonians using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and quantum phase classification for up to 12-qubit Hamiltonians using quantum neural networks. For VQE, our method achieves higher accuracy and success rates, with an average reduction in quantum hardware calls of up to 60% compared to purely quantum-based PSR. For classification, we observe test accuracy improvements of up to 2.8%. We also numerically demonstrate the capability of HELIA in mitigating barren plateaus, paving the way for training large-scale quantum models.</description>

Abstract: Quantum batteries can be charged by performing a work ``instantaneously'' if there is a large number of cells. In general, the work exhibits statistics that can be represented by a quasiprobability in the presence of initial quantum coherence in the energy basis. Here we show that these two concepts of quantum thermodynamics, which apparently appear disconnected, show a simple relation. Specifically, if the work distribution shows negativity in some time interval, then we can surely get quantum advantage in the charging process.</description>

      <title>Selective and efficient quantum state tomography for multi-qubit systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a crucial tool for characterizing quantum states. However, QST becomes impractical for reconstructing multi-qubit density matrices since data sets and computational costs grow exponentially with qubit number. In this Letter, we introduce selective and efficient QST (SEEQST), an approach for efficiently estimating multiple selected elements of an arbitrary $N$-qubit density matrix. We show that any $N$-qubit density matrix can be partitioned into $2^N$ subsets, each containing $2^N$ elements. With SEEQST, any such subset can be accurately estimated from just two experiments with only single-qubit measurements. The complexity for estimating any subset remains constant regardless of Hilbert-space dimension, so SEEQST can find the full density matrix using $2^{N+1} - 1$ experiments, where standard methods would use $3^N$ experiments. We provide a circuit decomposition for the SEEQST experiments, demonstrating that their maximum circuit depth scales logarithmically with $N$ assuming all-to-all connectivity. The Python code for SEEQST is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/aniket-ae/SEEQST}{github.com/aniket-ae/SEEQST}.</description>

      <title>Quantum Doeblin Coefficients: Interpretations and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classical information theory, the Doeblin coefficient of a classical channel provides an efficiently computable upper bound on the total-variation contraction coefficient of the channel, leading to what is known as a strong data-processing inequality. Here, we investigate quantum Doeblin coefficients as a generalization of the classical concept. In particular, we define various new quantum Doeblin coefficients, one of which has several desirable properties, including concatenation and multiplicativity, in addition to being efficiently computable. We also develop various interpretations of two of the quantum Doeblin coefficients, including representations as minimal singlet fractions, exclusion values, reverse max-mutual and oveloH informations, reverse robustnesses, and hypothesis testing reverse mutual and oveloH informations. Our interpretations of quantum Doeblin coefficients as either entanglement-assisted or unassisted exclusion values are particularly appealing, indicating that they are proportional to the best possible error probabilities one could achieve in state-exclusion tasks by making use of the channel. We also outline various applications of quantum Doeblin coefficients, ranging from limitations on quantum machine learning algorithms that use parameterized quantum circuits (noise-induced barren plateaus), on error mitigation protocols, on the sample complexity of noisy quantum hypothesis testing, and on mixing, distinguishability, and decoupling times of time-varying channels. All of these applications make use of the fact that quantum Doeblin coefficients appear in upper bounds on various trace-distance contraction coefficients of a channel. Furthermore, in all of these applications, our analysis using Doeblin coefficients provides improvements of various kinds over contributions from prior literature, both in terms of generality and being efficiently computable.</description>

Abstract: Executing quantum logic in cryogenic quantum computers requires a continuous energy supply from room-temperature control electronics. This dependence on external energy sources creates scalability limitations due to control channel density and heat dissipation. Here, we propose quantum batteries (QBs) as intrinsic quantum energy sources for quantum computation, enabling the thermodynamic limit of zero dissipation for unitary gates. Unlike classical power sources, QBs maintain quantum coherence with their load,a property that, while theoretically studied, remains unexploited in practical quantum technologies. We demonstrate that a bosonic Fock state QB can supply the energy required for arbitrary unitary gates, regardless of the circuit's depth, via quantum field recycling while facilitating a universal gate set controlled by a single parameter per qubit: its resonant frequency. The relative detuning of each qubit from the QB's resonant frequency gives rise to qualitatively two gate types, off-resonance and around-resonance. The former facilitates dispersive gates which allow multi-qubit parity probing while the latter enables energy exchange between the QB and the qubits, driving both population transfer and entanglement generation. This mechanism utilizes the all-to-all connectivity of the shared-resonator architecture to go beyond the standard single- and two-qubit native gates of current platforms with gate timescales of few pi/g, where g is the qubit-resonator coupling. The resultant speed-up includes also superextensive gates between symmetric Dicke states, characteristic of QB systems. By eliminating the individual drive lines, this approach significantly reduces wiring overhead, potentially quadrupling the number of qubits integrated within cryogenic systems and offering a scalable architecture for quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Predicting the von Neumann Entanglement Entropy Using a Graph Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calculating the von Neumann entanglement entropy from experimental data is challenging due to its dependence on the complete wavefunction, forcing reliance on approximations such as classical mutual information (MI). We propose a machine learning approach using a graph neural network to predict the von Neumann entropy directly from experimentally accessible bitstrings. We test this approach on a Rydberg ladder system and achieve a mean absolute error of $3.6 \times 10^{-3}$ when evaluating within the training range on a dataset with entropy values ranging from 0 to 1.9. The model achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 1.44\% and outperforms MI-based bounds. When tested beyond the training range, the model maintains reasonable accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning the model with small datasets significantly improves performance on data outside the original training range.</description>

      <title>Bright squeezed light in the kilohertz frequency band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The largely technical noise of a free running laser is the fundamental limit for preparation of a bright squeezed light, especially within MHz band. We construct a universal and complete theoretical model for nonclassical stabilization, and propose a novel bright squeezed light generation scheme with assistance of a hybrid noise stabilization technology. The scheme assimilates a broadband passive noise stabilization to successfully extend the feedback frequency bandwidth of a nonclassical active stabilization to MHz band. Meanwhile, the technical noise suppression magnitude is further improved by 9 dB, which creates the prerequisite conditions for preparing a broadband bright squeezed light. Finally, a -5.5 dB bright squeezed light with a power of 1 mW and a squeezing bandwidth among kHz to MHz band was generated. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical one. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first demonstration of a milliwatt-order bright squeezed light across the kHz frequency band. The demonstration sheds light on potential applications of bright squeezed light in quantum metrology and might enable new concepts in the future.</description>

      <title>Planar quantum low-density parity-check codes with open boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although high-threshold and low-overhead quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, such as bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, can reduce the physical-qubit cost by an order of magnitude compared to the Kitaev toric code, their torus layout remains difficult for physical implementation. In this work, we introduce the first systematic procedure to convert BB codes into fully planar, open-boundary qLDPC codes, preserving their performance. We present planar code families with logical dimensions $k=6\sim13$, e.g., $[[78, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$, $[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$, all with geometrically local weight-6 stabilizers. Allowing weight-8 stabilizers produces a $[[282,12,14]]$ code, exhibiting an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) an order of magnitude higher than the surface code. The construction combines boundary anyon condensation with the ``lattice grafting'' optimization, yielding high-performance qLDPC codes natively compatible with planar hardware architectures. It also uncovers Sierpinski-type fractal logical operators whose distance scales with the fractal area on finite lattices. These planar qLDPC codes provide an implementable route to resource-efficient, high-threshold fault tolerance and a flexible framework for future code design on realistic two-dimensional hardware.</description>

      <title>Performance guarantees of light-cone variational quantum algorithms for the maximum cut problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising to demonstrate the advantage of near-term quantum computing over classical computing in practical applications, such as the maximum cut (MaxCut) problem. However, current VQAs such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) have lower performance guarantees compared to the best-known classical algorithm, and suffer from hard optimization processes due to the barren plateau problem. We propose a light-cone VQA by choosing an optimal gate sequence of the standard VQAs, which enables a significant improvement in solution accuracy while avoiding the barren plateau problem. Specifically, we prove that the light-cone VQA with one round achieves an approximation ratio of 0.7926 for the MaxCut problem in the worst case of $3$-regular graphs, which is higher than that of the 3-round QAOA, and can be further improved to 0.8333 by an angle-relaxation procedure. Finally, our numerical results indicate an exponential speed-up in finding the exact solution using the light-cone VQA compared with the classical algorithm. Using IBM's quantum devices, we demonstrate that the single-round light-cone VQA exceeds the known classical hardness threshold in both 72- and 148-qubit demonstrations, whereas $p$-round $\text{QAOA}$ with $p=1,2,3$ does not in the latter one. Our work highlights a promising route towards solving classically hard problems on practical quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Computing $n$-time correlation functions without ancilla qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $n$-time correlation function is pivotal for establishing connections between theoretical predictions and experimental observations of a quantum system. Conventional methods for computing $n$-time correlation functions on quantum computers, such as the Hadamard test, generally require an ancilla qubit that controls the entire system -- an approach that poses challenges for digital quantum devices with limited qubit connectivity, as well as for analog quantum platforms lacking controlled operations. Here, we introduce a method to compute $n$-time correlation functions using only unitary evolutions on the system of interest, thereby eliminating the need for ancillas and the control operations. This approach substantially relaxes hardware connectivity requirements for digital processors and enables more practical measurements of $n$-time correlation functions on analog platforms. We demonstrate our protocol on IBM quantum hardware up to 12 qubits to measure the single-particle spectrum of the Schwinger model and the out-of-time-order correlator in the transverse-field Ising model. In the demonstration, we further introduce an error mitigation procedure based on signal processing that integrates signal filtering and correlation analysis, and successfully reproduces the noiseless simulation results from the noisy hardware. Our work highlights a route to exploring complex quantum many-body correlation functions in practice, even in the presence of realistic hardware limitations and noise.</description>

      <title>A streamlined demonstration that stabilizer circuits simulation reduces to Boolean linear algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gottesman-Knill theorem states that computations on stabilizer circuits can be simulated on a classical computer, conventional simulation algorithms extensively use linear algebra over bit strings. For instance, given a non-adaptive stabilizer circuit, the problem of computing the probability of a given outcome (strong simulation) is known to be log-space reducible to solving the system of linear equations over Boolean variables, which is commonly done by Gaussian elimination. This note aims to make the connection between stabilizer circuits and Boolean linear algebra even more explicit. To do this, we extend the stabilizer tableau formalism to include stabilizer tableau descriptions of arbitrary stabilizer operations (Clifford channels). Finding the tableau corresponding to the composition of two channels becomes a linear algebra problem. Any stabilizer circuit rewrites to a diagram with stabilizer tableaux on vertices, contracting an edge means to take the composition of channels, to compute the result of the circuit means to fully contract the diagram. Thus, simulating stabilizer circuits reduces to a sequence of Gaussian eliminations. This approach gives a new perspective on explaining the work of stabilizer tableau methods (reproducing the asymptotics) and creates opportunity for exploring various tensor-contraction techniques in stabilizer simulation.</description>

      <title>On estimating the quantum $\ell_{\alpha}$ distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of estimating the quantum $\ell_{\alpha}$ distance ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$, defined via the Schatten $\alpha$-norm $\|A\|_{\alpha} = \mathrm{tr}(|A|^{\alpha})^{1/\alpha}$, given $\operatorname{poly}(n)$-size state-preparation circuits of $n$-qubit quantum states $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$. This quantity serves as a lower bound on the trace distance for $\alpha &gt; 1$. For any constant $\alpha &gt; 1$, we develop an efficient rank-independent quantum estimator for ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ with time complexity $\operatorname{poly}(n)$, achieving an exponential speedup over the prior best results of $\exp(n)$ due to Wang, Guan, Liu, Zhang, and Ying (TIT 2024). Our improvement leverages efficiently computable uniform polynomial approximations of signed positive power functions within quantum singular value transformation, thereby eliminating the dependence on the rank of the quantum states.
  Our quantum algorithm reveals a dichotomy in the computational complexity of the Quantum State Distinguishability Problem with Schatten $\alpha$-norm (QSD$_{\alpha}$), which involves deciding whether ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ is at least $2/5$ or at most $1/5$. This dichotomy arises between the cases of constant $\alpha &gt; 1$ and $\alpha=1$:
  - For any $1+\Omega(1) \leq \alpha \leq O(1)$, QSD$_{\alpha}$ is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete.
  - For any $1 \leq \alpha \leq 1+\frac{1}{n}$, QSD$_{\alpha}$ is $\mathsf{QSZK}$-complete, implying that no efficient quantum estimator for $\mathrm{T}_\alpha(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ exists unless $\mathsf{BQP} = \mathsf{QSZK}$.
  The hardness results follow from reductions based on new rank-dependent inequalities for the quantum $\ell_{\alpha}$ distance with $1\leq \alpha \leq \infty$, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quantum computational speedup and retrocausality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08346v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Involving only the measurements of commuting observables - the problem-setting and the corresponding solution - quantum algorithms should be subject to classical logic. This would allow flanking their customary quantum description with a classical logic description, with surprising consequences. In the classical logic description of the quantum algorithm, very simply, it is as if the problem-solver knew in advance, before beginning her problem-solving action, one of the possible halves of the information that specifies the solution of the problem she will produce and measure in the future and could use this knowledge to produce the solution with fewer computation steps. This is a causal loop whose retrocausal character turns out to be implicit in the very notion of quantum state superposition, both an essential ingredient of the quantum computational speedup and one of the pillars of quantum mechanics. Indeed, the key point of the work is that the classical logic description of a quantum state superposition must resort to a logical form of retrocausality that in turn must be physically implicit in the superposition itself. The existence of retrocausality in ordinary quantum physics implies e different way of viewing physical reality. It explains in a unified way all quantum speedups and quantum nonlocality. It highlights the teleological character of quantum algorithms, that is, their being evolutions toward a goal (the solution of the problem) with an attractor in the solution they will produce in the future (the solution again). Under the quantum cosmological assumption, it provides a plausible physical basis to the teleological character of natural evolutions.</description>

Abstract: The Magnus expansion offers a method to express a time-ordered exponential as an ordinary operatorial exponential. This representation has advantageous theoretical properties, while still solving the original differential equation. For any finite dimensional Hermitian Hamiltonians, the standard Magnus expansion guarantees a manifestly unitary representation. However, this property is no longer preserved if the Hamiltonian is infinite dimensional or non-Hermitian. In this work, we derive a generalized expansion that maintains the property of unitarity for all bounded finite dimensional Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Role of scrambling and noise in temporal information processing with quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scrambling quantum systems have attracted attention as effective substrates for temporal information processing. Here we consider a quantum reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast, the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove that memory decays exponentially in time for local noisy channels. These results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding concentration in temporal quantum models.</description>

      <title>Physical Reduced Stochastic Equations for Continuously Monitored Non-Markovian Quantum Systems with a Markovian Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An effective approach to modeling non-Markovian quantum systems is to embed a principal (quantum) system of interest into a larger quantum system. A widely employed embedding is one that uses another quantum system, referred to as the auxiliary system, which is coupled to the principal system, and both the principal and auxiliary can be coupled to quantum white noise processes. The principal and auxiliary together form a quantum Markov system and the quantum white noises act as a bath (environment) for this system. Recently it was shown that the conditional evolution of the principal system in this embedding under continuous monitoring by a travelling quantum probe can be expressed as a system of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that involve only operators of the principal system. The reduced conditional state of the principal only (conditioned on the measurement outcomes) is determined by the ``diagonal" blocks of this coupled systems of SDEs. It is shown here that the ``off-diagonal" blocks can be exactly eliminated up to their initial conditions, leaving a reduced closed system of SDEs for the diagonal blocks only. Under additional conditions the off-diagonal initial conditions can be made to vanish. This new closed system of equations, which includes an integration term involving a two-time stochastic kernel, represents the non-Markovian stochastic dynamics of the principal system under continuous-measurement. The system of equations determine the reduced conditional state of the principal only and may be viewed as a stochastic Nakajima-Zwanzig type of equation for continuously monitored non-Markovian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Charge and Exciton Transfer in Multi-mode Models using Engineered Reservoirs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.</description>

The derivation of quantization rules and energy levels is revisited using semiclassical methods. Sommerfeld-type integrals are evaluated by elementary techniques, and connections with the Schr\"{o}dinger and Dirac equations are established. Historical developments and key transitions from classical to quantum theory are discussed to clarify the structure and significance of the old quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: By recursively nesting sums and products, probabilistic circuits have emerged in recent years as an attractive class of generative models as they enjoy, for instance, polytime marginalization of random variables. In this work we study these machine learning models using the framework of quantum information theory, leading to the introduction of positive unital circuits (PUnCs), which generalize circuit evaluations over positive real-valued probabilities to circuit evaluations over positive semi-definite matrices. As a consequence, PUnCs strictly generalize probabilistic circuits as well as recently introduced circuit classes such as PSD circuits.</description>

      <title>Symmetric quantum states: a review of recent progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetric quantum states are fascinating objects. They correspond to multipartite systems that remain invariant under particle permutations. This symmetry is reflected in their compact mathematical characterisation but also in their unique physical properties: they exhibit genuine multipartite entanglement and notable robustness against noise and perturbations. These features make such states particularly well-suited for a wide range of quantum information tasks. Here, we provide a pedagogic analysis of the mathematical structure and relevant physical properties of this class of states. Beyond the theoretical framework, robust tools for certifying and verifying the properties of symmetric states in experimental settings are essential. In this regard, we explore how standard techniques -- such as quantum state tomography, Bell tests, and entanglement witnesses -- can be specifically adapted for symmetric systems. Next, we provide an up-to-date overview of the most relevant applications in which these states outperform other classes of states in specific tasks. Specifically, we address their central role in quantum metrology, highlight their use in quantum error correction codes, and examine their contribution in computation and communication tasks. Finally, we present the current state-of-the-art in their experimental generation, ranging from systems of cold atoms to implementations via quantum algorithms. We also review the most significant results obtained in the different experimental realizations. Despite the notable progress made in recent years with regard to the characterisation and application of symmetric quantum states, several intriguing questions remain unsolved. We conclude this review by discussing some of these open problems and outlining promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Several types of quantum Wasserstein distance based on an optimization over separable states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider several definitions of the quantum Wasserstein distance based on an optimization over general bipartite quantum states with given marginals. Then, we examine the quantities obtained after the optimization is carried out over bipartite separable states instead. We prove that several of these quantities are equal to each other. Thus, we connect several approaches in the literature. We prove the triangle inequality for some of these quantities for the case of one of the three states being pure. As a byproduct, we show that the Uhlmann-Jozsa quantum fidelity can also be written as an optimization over separable states with given marginals. We use this to prove that some of these quantities equal the Uhlmann-Jozsa quantum fidelity for qubits.</description>

      <title>An Elementary Characterization of Bargmann Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bargmann invariants, also known as multivariate traces of quantum states $\operatorname{Tr}(\rho_1 \rho_2 \cdots \rho_n)$, are unitary invariant quantities used to characterize weak values, Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities, out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), and geometric phases. Here we give a complete characterization of the set $B_n$ of complex values that $n$-th order invariants can take, resolving some recently proposed conjectures. We show that $B_n$ is equal to the range of invariants arising from pure states described by Gram matrices of circulant form. We show that both ranges are equal to the $n$-th power of the complex unit $n$-gon, and are therefore convex, which provides a simple geometric intuition. Finally, we show that any Bargmann invariant of order $n$ is realizable using either qubit states, or circulant qutrit states.</description>

      <title>A Solvable Semi-infinite Fock-state-lattice SSH Model: the Stable Topological Zero Mode and the Non-Hermitian Bound Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fock-state lattice (FSL) offers a powerful quantum simulator for topological phenomena due to the unbounded scalability and ease of implementation. Nevertheless, the unique topological properties induced by its site-dependent coupling have remained elusive, mainly due to the challenge of handling an infinite state space without translational symmetry. Here, we rigorously analyze the topological features of a semi-infinite FSL-based Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian realms, by mapping it to the solvable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model via a unitary displacement transformation. We find a more stable topological zero mode than the conventional SSH model, originating from the bound state at the inherent domain wall under anisotropic conditions. With gain and loss introduced, we predict a non-Hermitian bound effect (NHBE), i. e., any state overlapping with the bound state will quickly stabilize to the domain wall, with the minimal stabilization time occurring in the vicinity of exceptional point (EP). The paritytime (PT ) phase transition can be observed by the oscillating-to-steady crossover of dynamics in the subspace orthogonal to the bound state. Our work takes the first step towards exploring unique topological properties in infinite anisotropic topological models based on the promising FSL simulator.</description>

      <title>Collapses in quantum-classical probabilistically checkable proofs and the quantum polynomial hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of quantum proof systems by establishing collapse results that reveal simplifications in their complexity landscape. By extending classical theorems such as the Karp-Lipton theorem to quantum settings and analyzing uniqueness in quantum-classical PCPs, we clarify how various constraints influence computational power.
  Our main contributions are:
  (1) We show that restricting quantum-classical PCPs to unique proofs does not reduce their power: $\mathsf{UniqueQCPCP} = \mathsf{QCPCP}$ under $\mathsf{BQ}$-operator and randomized reductions. This parallels the known $\mathsf{UniqueQCMA} = \mathsf{QCMA}$ result, indicating robustness of uniqueness even in quantum PCP-type systems.
  (2) We prove a non-uniform quantum analogue of the Karp-Lipton theorem: if $\mathsf{QMA} \subseteq \mathsf{BQP}/\mathsf{qpoly}$, then $\mathsf{QPH} \subseteq \mathsf{Q\Sigma}_2/\mathsf{qpoly}$. This conditional collapse suggests limits on quantum advice for $\mathsf{QMA}$-complete problems.
  (3) We define a bounded-entanglement version of the quantum polynomial hierarchy, $\mathsf{BEQPH}$, and prove that it collapses above the fourth level. We also introduce the separable hierarchy $\mathsf{SepQPH}$ (zero entanglement), for which the same collapse result holds. These collapses stem not from entanglement, as in prior work, but from the convex structure of the protocols, which renders higher levels tractable.
  Collectively, these results offer new insights into the structure of quantum proof systems and the role of entanglement, uniqueness, and advice in defining their complexity.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Based Excitation Filter for Molecular Ground-State Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular ground-state simulation is one of the most promising fields for demonstrating practical quantum advantage on near-term quantum computers. However, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a leading algorithm for this task, still faces significant challenges due to excessive circuit depth. This paper introduces a method to efficiently simplify the Unitary Coupled-Cluster with Single and Double Excitations (UCCSD) ansatz on classical computers. We propose to estimate the correlation energy contributions of excitations using their gradients at Hartree-Fock state, supported by a theoretical proof. For molecular systems with $K$ orbitals, these gradients can be obtained with complexity only $O(K^8)$, which can be efficiently implemented on classical computers, especially in parallel. By sorting and truncating the excitations based on these gradients, the simplified ansatz can be obtained immediately, avoiding the challenging task of optimizing ansatz structure on a quantum computer. Furthermore, we introduce a strategy to indirectly identify critical excitations through spin-adapted constraints, reducing gradient computations by $60\%$. Numerical experiments on prototype molecular systems (H${_4}$, HF, H${_2}$O, BeH${_2}$ and NH$_3$) demonstrate that our approach achieves up to $46\%$ parameter decrease, $60\%$ circuit depth reduction and $678\times$ runtime speedup compared to the state-of-the-art ADAPT-VQE algorithm, enabling significantly more compact quantum circuits with enhanced near-term feasibility.</description>

      <title>Tight Success Probabilities for Quantum Period Finding and Phase Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Period finding and phase estimation are fundamental in quantum computing. Prior work has established lower bounds on their success probabilities. Such quantum algorithms measure a state $|\hat\ell\rangle$ in an $n$-qubit computational basis, $\hat\ell \in [0, 2^n - 1]$, and then post-process this measurement to produce the final output, in the case of period finding, a divisor of the period $r$. We consider a general post-processing algorithm which succeeds whenever the measured $\hat\ell$ is within some tolerance $M$ of a positive integer multiple of $2^n / r$. We give new (tight) lower and upper bounds on the success probability that converge to 1. The parameter $n$ captures the complexity of the quantum circuit. The parameter $M$ can be tuned by varying the post-processing algorithm (e.g., additional brute-force search, lattice methods). Our tight analysis allows for the careful exploitation of the tradeoffs between the complexity of the quantum circuit and the effort spent in classical processing when optimizing the probability of success. We note that the most recent prior work in most recent work does not give tight bounds for general $M$.</description>

      <title>Strict hierarchy between $n$-wise measurement simulability, compatibility structures, and multi-copy compatibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The incompatibility of quantum measurements, i.e. the fact that certain observable quantities cannot be measured jointly is widely regarded as a distinctive quantum feature with important implications for the foundations and the applications of quantum information theory. While the standard incompatibility of multiple measurements has been the focus of attention since the inception of quantum theory, its generalizations, such as measurement simulability, $n$-wise incompatibility, and mulit-copy incompatibility have only been proposed recently. Here, we point out that all these generalizations are differing notions of the question of how many measurements are genuinely contained in a measurement device. We then show, that all notions do differ not only in their operational meaning but also mathematically in the set of measurement assemblages they describe. We then fully resolve the relations between these different generalizations, by showing a strict hierarchy between these notions. Hence, we provide a general framework for generalized measurement incompatibility. Finally, we consider the implications our results have for recent works using these different notions.</description>

      <title>Evolution of tripartite entanglement in three-qubit Quantum Gravity-Induced Entanglement of Masses (QGEM) with quantum decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently introduced quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) protocol aims to test the quantum nature of gravity by witnessing the entanglement produced by the virtual exchange of a graviton between two spatially superposed masses. Shortly after the original proposal, further improvements upon the experiment were suggested, including the addition of a third mass, showing that three-qubit setups can be more resilient to higher rates of decoherence caused by the interaction of the system with the environment. In this work, we investigate the type of tripartite entanglement generated in these three-qubit QGEM experiments when considering the effects of decoherence. We show that the gravitational interaction between the qubits is able to generate genuine tripartite entanglement between them, studying the corresponding parameter spaces and comparing the performance of the possible experimental configurations of the three qubits at allowing for the detection of genuine entanglement via an entanglement witness.</description>

      <title>Coupled Cluster Downfolding Theory in Simulations of Chemical Systems on Quantum Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The practical application of quantum technologies to chemical problems faces significant challenges, particularly in the treatment of realistic basis sets and the accurate inclusion of electron correlation effects. A direct approach to these problems is currently infeasible due to limitations in the number of logical qubits, their fidelity, and the shallow circuit depths supported by existing hardware; all of which hinder simulations at the required level of accuracy. A promising alternative is hybrid quantum-classical computing, where classical resources are used to construct effective Hamiltonians characterized by dimensions that conform to the constraints of current quantum devices. In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of a hybrid approach: coupled-cluster downfolded Hamiltonians are first evaluated in reduced-dimensionality active spaces, and the corresponding ground-state energies are subsequently computed using quantum algorithms. Our comprehensive analysis explores the achievable accuracy in recovering correlation energies when hundreds of orbitals are downfolded into a problem size tractable by today's quantum hardware. We argue that such flexible hybrid algorithms, where problem size can be tailored to available quantum resources, can serve as a bridge between noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and future fault-tolerant quantum computers, marking a step toward the early realization of quantum advantage in chemistry.</description>

      <title>Passive Quantum Interconnects: High-Fidelity Quantum Networking at Higher Rates with Less Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block of scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) approach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based on photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success probability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining a passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or intermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a primary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity and the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing protocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations by protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity dynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities are sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses required for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed operation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate entanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration leveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for external photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a concrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal cooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \times 10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup beyond $10^6~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength channels. Our results establish the CAPS-based network protocol as a leading candidate for scaling quantum information platforms.</description>

Abstract: Time crystals constitute a novel phase of matter defined by the spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry. We present a scheme to realize a continuous-time crystal in the vibrational phonon mode of a trapped-ion system. By coupling two addressable traveling-wave lasers to the individual ions, we generate a nonlinear phonon mode with controllable linear gain and nonlinear damping via adiabatic elimination. This scheme enables stable dissipative dynamics over timescales significantly longer than the oscillation period, leading to the emergence of discrete time-translation symmetry breaking in the phonon mode, i.e., a phonon time crystal, under specific conditions. We further analyze the experimental feasibility and numerically demonstrate this phonon time crystal using accessible experimental parameters. These results provide a practical scheme for observing a time crystal in a nonlinear phonon mode, which will advance research into time crystals.</description>

Abstract: In this essay based on 0907.2939, we argue that the emergence of classically connected spacetimes is intimately related to the quantum entanglement of degrees of freedom in a non-perturbative description of quantum gravity. Disentangling the degrees of freedom associated with two regions of spacetime results in these regions pulling apart and pinching off from each other in a way that can be quantified by standard measures of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Existence of Schrodinger Evolution with Absorbing Boundary Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.12057v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a non-relativistic quantum particle with wave function inside a region $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^3$, and suppose that detectors are placed along the boundary $\partial \Omega$. The question how to compute the probability distribution of the time at which the detector surface registers the particle boils down to finding a reasonable mathematical definition of an ideal detecting surface; a particularly convincing definition, called the \emph{absorbing boundary rule}, involves a time evolution for the particle's wave function $\psi$ expressed by a Schr\"odinger equation in $\Omega$ together with an ``absorbing'' boundary condition on $\partial \Omega$ first considered by Werner in 1987, viz., $\partial \psi/\partial n=i\kappa\psi$ with $\kappa&gt;0$ and $\partial/\partial n$ the normal derivative. We provide here a discussion of the rigorous mathematical foundation of this rule. First, for the viability of the rule it plays a crucial role that these two equations together uniquely define the time evolution of $\psi$; we point out here how, under some technical assumptions on the regularity (i.e., smoothness) of the detecting surface, the Lumer-Phillips theorem implies that the time evolution is well defined and given by a contraction semigroup. Second, we show that the collapse required for the $N$-particle version of the problem is well defined. We also prove that the joint distribution of the detection times and places, according to the absorbing boundary rule, is governed by a positive-operator-valued measure.</description>

      <title>Circuit complexity and functionality: a thermodynamic perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circuit complexity, defined as the minimum circuit size required for implementing a particular Boolean computation, is a foundational concept in computer science. Determining circuit complexity is believed to be a hard computational problem [1,2,3]. Recently, in the context of black holes, circuit complexity has been promoted to a physical property, wherein the growth of complexity is reflected in the time evolution of the Einstein-Rosen bridge (``wormhole'') connecting the two sides of an AdS ``eternal'' black hole [4]. Here we are motivated by an independent set of considerations and explore links between complexity and thermodynamics for functionally-equivalent circuits, making the physics-inspired approach relevant to real computational problems, for which functionality is the key element of interest. In particular, our thermodynamic framework provides a new perspective on the obfuscation of programs of arbitrary length -- an important problem in cryptography -- as thermalization through recursive mixing of neighboring sections of a circuit, which can be viewed as the mixing of two containers with ``gases of gates''. This recursive process equilibrates the average complexity and leads to the saturation of the circuit entropy, while preserving functionality of the overall circuit. The thermodynamic arguments hinge on ergodicity in the space of circuits which we conjecture is limited to disconnected ergodic sectors due to fragmentation. The notion of fragmentation has important implications for the problem of circuit obfuscation as it implies that there are circuits of same size and functionality that cannot be connected via a polynomial number of local moves. Furthermore, we argue that fragmentation is unavoidable unless the complexity classes NP and coNP coincide.</description>

      <title>Efficient Finite Initialization with Partial Norms for Tensorized Neural Networks and Tensor Networks Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06577v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two algorithms to initialize layers of tensorized neural networks and general tensor network algorithms using partial computations of their Frobenius norms and lineal entrywise norms, depending on the type of tensor network involved. The core of this method is the use of the norm of subnetworks of the tensor network in an iterative way, so that we normalize by the finite values of the norms that led to the divergence or zero norm. In addition, the method benefits from the reuse of intermediate calculations. We have also applied it to the Matrix Product State/Tensor Train (MPS/TT) and Matrix Product Operator/Tensor Train Matrix (MPO/TT-M) layers and have seen its scaling versus the number of nodes, bond dimension, and physical dimension. All code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Randomized Gradient Descents on Riemannian Manifolds: Almost Sure Convergence to Global Minima in and beyond Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze convergence of gradient-descent methods on Riemannian manifolds. In particular, we study randomization of Riemannian gradient algorithms for minimizing smooth cost functions (of Morse-Bott type). We prove that randomized gradient descent methods, where the Riemannian gradient is replaced by a random projection of it, converge to a single local optimum almost surely despite the existence of saddle points. We consider both uniformly distributed and discrete random projections. We also discuss the time required to pass a saddle point. As a major application, we consider ground-state preparation through quantum optimization over the unitary group. In mathematical terms our randomized algorithm applied to the trace function $U \to \operatorname{tr}(AU\rho U^*)$ almost surely converges to its global minimum. The minimum corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue (ground state) of the selfadjoint operator $A$ (Hamiltonian) if $\rho$ is a rank-one projector (pure state). In this setting, one can efficiently replace the uniform random projections by implementing so-called discrete unitary 2-designs.</description>

      <title>Matrix Majorization in Large Samples with Varying Support Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that a matrix $P$ with non-negative entries majorizes another such matrix $Q$ if there is a stochastic matrix $T$ such that $Q=TP$. We study matrix majorization in large samples and in the catalytic regime in the case where the columns of the matrices need not have equal support, as has been assumed in earlier works. We focus on two cases: either there are no support restrictions (except for requiring a non-empty intersection for the supports) or the final column dominates the others. Using real-algebraic methods, we identify sufficient and almost necessary conditions for majorization in large samples or when using catalytic states under these support conditions. These conditions are given in terms of multivariate divergences that generalize the R\'enyi divergences. We notice that varying support conditions dramatically affect the relevant set of divergences. Our results find an application in the theory of catalytic state transformation in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of boundary criticality and exotic topological semimetals in $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently found that, going beyond the tendfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes and violating the bulk-boundary correspondence of the usual topological phases, PT-invariant systems support a real Chern insulator with the so-called boundary criticality, which forbids the transition between different orders of topological phases accompanied by the closing and reopening of the bulk-band gap. Here, we fnd that the periodic driving can break the boundary criticality of a PT-invariant system. Setting free from the the boundary criticality, diverse first- and second-order topological phases absent in the static case are found in both the zero and Pi/T modes. The application of our result in the three-dimensional PT-invariant system permits us to discover exotic second-order Dirac and nodal-line semimetals with coexisting surface and hinge Fermi arcs. Enriching the family of the topological phases in PT-invariant systems, our result provides us a useful way to explore novel topological phases.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Meissner effect in pressurized bilayer nickelate with integrated multi-parameter quantum sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent reports on the signatures of high-temperature superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc close to 80 K have triggered great research interest and extensive follow-up studies. Although the zero resistance has been successfully achieved under improved hydrostatic pressure conditions, the Meissner effect of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ under high pressure remains controversial. Here, using shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers implanted on the culet of diamond anvils as in-situ quantum sensors, we observe compelling evidence for the Meissner effect in polycrystalline bilayer nickelate samples: the magnetic field expulsion during both field cooling and field warming processes. In particular, we explore the multiparameter measurement capacity of the diamond quantum sensors to extract the weak demagnetization signal of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$. The correlated measurements of Raman spectra and magnetic imaging indicate an incomplete structural transformation related to the displacement of oxygen ions emerging in the non-superconducting region. Our work clarifies the controversy about the Meissner effect of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ and contributes to the development of quantum sensing of weak signals under high-pressure conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce QICS (Quantum Information Conic Solver), an open-source primal-dual interior point solver fully implemented in Python, which is focused on solving optimization problems arising in quantum information theory. QICS has the ability to solve optimization problems involving the quantum relative entropy, noncommutative perspectives of operator convex functions, and related functions. It also includes an efficient semidefinite programming solver which exploits sparsity, as well as support for Hermitian matrices. QICS is also currently supported by the Python optimization modelling software PICOS. This paper aims to document the implementation details of the algorithm and cone oracles used in QICS, and serve as a reference guide for the software. Additionally, we showcase extensive numerical experiments which demonstrate that QICS outperforms state-of-the-art quantum relative entropy programming solvers, and has comparable performance to state-of-the-art semidefinite programming solvers.</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier--phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier--phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the general explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring appropriate hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05055).</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side on timescales comparable to the phonon period. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum--classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Correlation Trends in the Electric Dipole Polarizabilities of Many Low-lying States in Cs I through First-principle Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron correlation and higher-order relativistic effects are probed in the evaluation of scalar and tensor static electric dipole (E1) polarizabilities ($\alpha_d$) of several even- and odd-parity states in cesium (Cs) using the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) method, second-order perturbation theory (MBPT(2)), third-order perturbation theory (MBPT(3)), random phase approximation (RPA), and singles and doubles approximated relativistic coupled-cluster (RCCSD) method. To account for perturbation due to odd-parity E1 operator on the atomic orbitals, calculations are carried out in the linear response approach. Our final $\alpha_d$ values, with the estimated uncertainties, show reasonably good agreement with the previous calculations and available experimental results. Differences among the DHF, MBPT(2), MBPT(3) and RPA results indicate pair-correlation (PC) effects play major roles than the core-polarization (CP) effects in the determination of $\alpha_d$ values in Cs. From the differences among the MBPT(3) and RCC results, we find correlations among the PC and CP effects and double CP effects together are also significant in these calculations. Contributions from the Breit interactions are found to be quite large in the high-lying states.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Quantum Dynamics on Embedded Submanifolds: From Geometric Mass to Higgs Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07337v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a quantum dynamics framework for curved submanifolds embedded in higher-dimensional spaces. Through rigorous dimensional reduction, we derive the first complete Schr\"{o}dinger and Klein-Gordon equations incorporating non-perturbative geometric interactions-resolving ambiguities in constrained quantization. Crucially, extrinsic curvature of the ambient manifold governs emergent low-dimensional quantum phenomena. Remarkably, this mechanism generates scalar field masses matching Kaluza-Klein spectra while eliminating periodic compactification requirements. Geometric induction concurrently produces Higgs mechanism potentials. Particle masses emerge solely from submanifold embedding geometry, with matter-field couplings encoded in curvature invariants. This enables experimental access to higher-dimensional physics at all energy scales through geometric induction. We also discuss the Higgs vacuum near small-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Fermi-Hubbard model by the Tensor-Backflow method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a variational wave-function based on the tensor representation of backflow corrections has achieved state-of-the-art energy precision in solving Fermi-Hubbard-type models. However, the Fermi-Hubbard model is very challenging to solve, and the validity of a method relies on investigating the ground state's physical property. For simplicity, we name the tensor representation of backflow corrections as the Tensor-Backflow in this work. We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$ and boundary conditions. Energy precision can be further improved by considering more backflow terms, such as considering backflow terms from next-nearest-neighbours or from all sites. Energy extrapolations on 64-site lattices give competitive results to the gradient optimized fPEPS with the bond dimension as large as $D$=20. For cases of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\times 16$ lattice under open boundary condition, by considering nearest-neighbour backflow terms, obtained energy is only $4.5\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. For periodic boundary condition, the variational wave-function is not enforced on any prior symmetry, meanwhile linear stripe order is successfully obtained. Under the same filling and $U$=10,12, energies obtained from initializations with the obtained wave-function for $U$=8 are lower than that from direct optimizations, meanwhile energies are competitive to or even better than state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations.</description>
