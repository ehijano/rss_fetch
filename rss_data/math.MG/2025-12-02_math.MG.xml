      <title>Lipschitz Geometry of Mixed Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the (ambient) bi-Lipschitz V-equivalence of two-variable mixed polynomials satisfying the Newton inner non-degeneracy condition. Concerning triviality, we show that ambient bi-Lipschitz V-triviality for families $\{f + \varepsilon \theta\}_{\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}}$ is guaranteed when $f$ is semi-radially weighted homogeneous and the weighted radial degree of every monomial in $\theta$ is greater than the weighted radial degree associated with $f$. However, in the general case, we prove that it is not guaranteed, even though ambient topological V-triviality still holds.
  For the classification problem, we define two simple metric links and prove that they suffice to determine bi-Lipschitz V-equivalence within the class of mixed polynomials that are $\Gamma_{\rm inn}$-nice. A key outcome is that neither the Newton boundary $\Gamma(f)$ nor the C-face diagram $\Gamma_{\rm inn}$ constitutes an invariant of this equivalence for such mixed polynomials. To outcome this, we introduce new data extracted from the two face diagrams under consideration and prove that, under certain generic conditions, these data become fundamental invariants for the bi-Lipschitz equivalences. This provides a fundamental step toward a bi-Lipschitz classification of these mixed polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a certain class of affine hyperplane arrangements are $K(\pi,1)$ by endowing their Falk complexes with an injective metric. This gives new examples of infinite $K(\pi,1)$ arrangements in dimension $n&gt;2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the smoothness of a plane curve and that of its evolute, especially in the cases where the parent curve is no more two or three times continuously differentiable, and exhibit the same kind of apparent improvement in regularity: in the generic local situation, the evolute has one order of regularity less than the parent curve.</description>

      <title>Expansion joints in hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformations of hyperbolic manifolds through metrics with cone singularities along closed loops were first studied by Thurston as continuous realisations of Dehn fillings. Instead of gluing singular solid tori into rank $2$ cusps, we glue singular $2$-handles into rank $1$ cusps. Our method is to find substructures within which the hyperbolic metric can be `fractured' in a controlled way by direct manipulation of a fundamental polyhedron, changing the cone angle around an ideal arc to interpolate between cusped hyperbolic manifolds and hyperbolic manifolds with conformal surfaces on the visual boundary. As an application, we use cone deformations of a family of arithmetic manifolds derived from the Borromean rings to show that the upper unknotting tunnels of highly twisted $2$-bridge links can be drilled out by cone deformations. We also show that our structures arise naturally in fully augmented links, providing a large family of examples.</description>

      <title>Invariant valuations on Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolution of valuations was introduced by the first named author and Fu for linear spaces, and later by Alesker and the first named author for compact Lie groups. In this paper we study the convolution of invariant valuations on Lie groups. First, we obtain an explicit formula for the convolution of left-invariant valuations on compact groups in terms of differential forms. Independently, we show that a connected Lie group admits smooth bi-invariant valuations beyond the Euler characteristic and the Haar measure if and only if the group is the product of a compact group and a linear space. Finally, we use these two results to define the convolution of bi-invariant smooth valuations on an arbitrary unimodular Lie group, thus unifying both previously defined convolution operations.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Principle for Isoperimetry and Its Equivalence to Nonlinear Log-Sobolev Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the large deviations principle (which concerns sequences of exponentially small sets) for the isoperimetric problem on product Riemannian manifolds $M^{n}$ equipped with product probability measures $\nu^{\otimes n}$, where $M$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying curvature-dimension bound $\mathrm{CD}(0,\infty)$. When the probability measure ${\nu}$ admits a finite moment generating function for squared distance, we establish an exact characterization of the large deviations asymptotics for the isoperimetric profile, which shows a precise equivalence between these asymptotic isoperimetric inequalities and nonlinear log-Sobolev inequalities. It is observed that the product of two relative entropy typical sets (or empirically typical sets) forms an asymptotically optimal solution to the isoperimetric problem. The proofs in this paper integrate tools from information theory, optimal transport, and geometric measure theory.</description>

      <title>The Fourth Geometry I: Difference--Angle Geometry Beyond Euclid, Hyperbolic, and Elliptic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new geometry based on the difference angle, an angle defined as the difference of slopes of two lines, together with an axiomatic system for angles. This framework provides a constructive approach to the fundamental question ``What is an angle?'', and shows that an angle can be defined independently of circles or rotations, as a primary geometric notion.
  Within this geometry, one can define difference-angle triangles, norms, bisectors, perpendiculars, and inner products. Several characteristic properties not seen in existing geometries emerge, together with behaviors analogous to those in Euclidean geometry: the triangle inequality always holds with equality, the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is $0$, and a Miquel point exists even for parabolas. In particular, the concurrency of the parabolic Miquel configuration was suggested by Weiss and Odehnal, and our main theorem provides the first explicit and rigorous confirmation of this assertion. We also point out that many classical Euclidean configurations (including Brocard-type configurations) naturally reappear in the setting of difference-angle geometry.
  These results indicate that difference-angle geometry is a promising candidate for a ``Fourth Geometry'' following the Euclidean, hyperbolic, and elliptic geometries.</description>

      <title>Colorful positive bases decomposition and Helly-type results for cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the following colorful Helly-type result: Fix $k \in [d-1]$. Assume $\mathcal{A}_1, \dots, \mathcal{A}_{d+(d-k)+1}$ are finite sets (colors) of nonzero vectors in $\R^d$. If for every rainbow sub-selection $R$ from these sets of size at most $\max \{d+1, 2(d-k+1)\}$, the system $\langle {a},{x} \rangle \leq 0,\; a \in R$ has at least $k$ linearly independent solutions, then at least one of the systems $\langle {a},{x} \rangle \leq 0,\; a \in \mathcal{A}_i,$ $i \in [d+(d-k)+1]$ has at least $k$ linearly independent solutions.
  A \emph{rainbow sub-selection} from several sets refers to choosing at most one element from each set (color).
  The Helly number $\max \{d+1, 2(d-k+1)\}$ and the number of colors $d+(d-k)+1$ are optimal.
  Our key observation is a certain colorful Carath\'eodory-type result for positive bases.</description>

      <title>Diffusions and random walks with prescribed sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given suitable functions $V, \Psi:[0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on $V,\Psi$ for the existence of a metric measure space and a symmetric diffusion process that satisfies sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates with volume growth profile $V$ and escape time profile $\Psi$. We prove sufficiency by constructing a new family of diffusions. Special cases of this construction also leads to a new family of infinite graphs whose simple random walks satisfy sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates with prescribed volume growth and escape time profiles. In particular, these random walks on graphs generalizes earlier results of Barlow who considered the case $V(r)=r^\alpha$ and $\Psi(r)=r^\beta$ (Rev Mat Iberoam 2004). The family of diffusions we construct have martingale dimension one but can have arbitrarily high spectral dimension. Therefore our construction shows the impossibility of obtaining non-trivial lower bounds on martingale dimension in terms of spectral dimension which is in contrast with upper bounds on martingale dimension using spectral dimension obtained by Hino (Probab Theory Relat Fields 2013).</description>

      <title>Infinite Interacting Brownian Motions and EVI Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a sufficient condition under which the time-marginal law of $\mu$-reversible infinite interacting Brownian motions is characterised as the steepest gradient descent of the relative entropy in the Wasserstein space in the sense of evolution variational inequality (EVI). This is an infinite-dimensional generalisation of Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto/Ambrosio-Gigli-Savar\'e theory. Consequently, the configuration space (the space of locally finite point measures) endowed with the reversible measure $\mu$ is an RCD space and the time-marginal law is identified to the heat flow on this space. Our result covers the infinite-dimensional Dyson Brownian motion with bulk and soft-edge limits; the latter yields Airy line ensemble as its stationary process, a central object in KPZ universality. Our result therefore provides an optimal transport characterisation of these models as Wasserstein gradient flows, and establishes a range of new functional inequalities (HWI, distorted Brunn-Minkowski, dimension-free Harnack and many others) as a corollary. As an application, we discover the new phenomena, dynamical number rigidity and dynamical tail triviality, that the time-marginal law possesses number rigidity and tail triviality for every time $t&gt;0$, revealing a propagation of random crystal and extremal structures by the Dyson Brownian motions.</description>
