      <title>Discrete Lyapunov functional for cyclic systems of differential equations with time-variable or state-dependent delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nonautonomous cyclic systems of delay differential equations with variable delay. Under suitable feedback assumptions, we define an (integer valued) Lyapunov functional related to the number of sign changes of the coordinate functions of solutions. We prove that this functional possesses properties analogous to those established by Mallet-Paret and Sell for the constant delay case and by Krisztin and Arino for the scalar case. We also apply the results to equations with state-dependent delays.</description>

      <title>Multisymplectic structure of nonintegrable Henon-Heiles system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-symplectic integrators are typically regarded as a discretization of the Hamiltonian partial differential equations. This is due to the fact that, for generic finite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, there exists only one independent symplectic structure. In this note, the second invariant symplectic form is presented for the nonintegrable Henon-Heiles system, Kepler problem, integrable and non-integrable Toda type systems. This approach facilitates the construction of a multi-symplectic integrator, which effectively preserves both symplectic forms for these benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Dimensions of orthogonal projections of typical self-affine sets and measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T_1,\ldots, T_m$ be a family of $d\times d$ invertible real matrices with $\|T_i\|&lt;1/2$ for $1\leq i\leq m$. For ${\bf a}=(a_1,\ldots, a_m)\in {\Bbb R}^{md}$, let $\pi^{\bf a}\colon \Sigma=\{1,\ldots, m\}^{\Bbb N}\to {\Bbb R}^d$ denote the coding map associated with the affine IFS $\{T_ix+a_i\}_{i=1}^m$, and let $K^{\bf a}$ denote the attractor of this IFS. Let $W$ be a linear subspace of ${\Bbb R}^d$ and $P_W$ the orthogonal projection onto $W$. We show that for $\mathcal L^{md}$-a.e.~${\bf a}\in {\Bbb R}^{md}$, the Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions of $P_W(K^{\bf a})$ coincide and are determined by the zero point of a certain pressure function associated with $T_1,\ldots, T_m$ and $W$. Moreover, for every ergodic $\sigma$-invariant measure $\mu$ on $\Sigma$ and for $\mathcal L^{md}$-a.e.~${\bf a}\in {\Bbb R}^{md}$, the local dimensions of $(P_W\pi^{\bf a})_*\mu$ exist almost everywhere, here $(P_W\pi^{\bf a})_*\mu$ stands for the push-forward of $\mu$ by $P_W\pi^{\bf a}$. However, $(P_W\pi^{\bf a})_*\mu$ may not be exact dimensional for $\mathcal L^{md}$-a.e.~${\bf a}\in {\Bbb R}^{md}$. Nevertheless, when $\mu$ is a Bernoulli product measure, or more generally, a supermultiplicative ergodic $\sigma$-invariant measure, $(P_W\pi^{\bf a})_*\mu$ is exact dimensional for $\mathcal L^{md}$-a.e.~${\bf a}\in {\Bbb R}^{md}$.</description>

      <title>Projections of self-affine fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Falconer's 1988 landmark result on the dimensions of self-affine fractals to encompass the dimensions of their projections, showing furthermore that their families of exceptional projections contain algebraic varieties which are preserved by the underlying linear algebraic group. The techniques which we develop allow us to construct examples of additional new phenomena: firstly, we give general examples of equilibrium measures on self-affine fractals which admit non-exact-dimensional projections. Secondly, we construct strongly irreducible self-affine sets which have small sumsets without any arithmetic resonance in their construction.</description>

      <title>Strong Borel--Cantelli Lemmas for Recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,T,\mu,d)$ be a metric measure-preserving system for which $3$-fold correlations decay exponentially for Lipschitz continuous observables. Suppose that $(M_k)$ is a sequence satisfying some weak decay conditions and suppose there exist open balls $B_k(x)$ around $x$ such that $\mu(B_k(x)) = M_k$. Under a short return time assumption, we prove a strong Borel--Cantelli lemma, including an error term, for recurrence, i.e., for $\mu$-a.e. $x \in X$, \[ \sum_{k=1}^{n} \mathbf{1}_{B_k(x)} (T^k x) = \Phi(n) + O \bigl( \Phi(n)^{1/2} (\log \Phi(n))^{3/2 + \varepsilon} \bigr), \] where $\Phi(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \mu(B_k(x))$.
  Applications to systems include some non-linear piecewise expanding interval maps and hyperbolic automorphisms of $\mathbf{T}^2$.</description>

      <title>Period-rigidity of one-relator groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We follow in this paper a recent line of work, consisting in characterizing the periodically rigid finitely generated groups, i.e., the groups for which every subshift of finite type which is weakly aperiodic is also strongly aperiodic. In particular, we show that every finitely generated group admitting a presentation with one reduced relator and at least $3$ generators is periodically rigid if and only if it is either virtually cyclic or torsion-free virtually $\mathbb Z^2$. This proves a special case of a recent conjecture of Bitar (2024). We moreover prove that period rigidity is preserved under taking subgroups of finite indices. Using a recent theorem of MacManus (2023), we derive from our results that Bitar's conjecture holds in groups whose Cayley graphs are quasi-isometric to planar graphs.</description>

      <title>MXMap: A Multivariate Cross Mapping Framework for Causal Discovery in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) is a powerful method for detecting causality in coupled nonlinear dynamical systems, providing a model-free approach to capture dynamic causal interactions. Partial Cross Mapping (PCM) was introduced as an extension of CCM to address indirect causality in three-variable systems by comparing cross-mapping quality between direct cause-effect mapping and indirect mapping through an intermediate conditioning variable. However, PCM remains limited to univariate delay embeddings in its cross-mapping processes. In this work, we extend PCM to the multivariate setting, introducing multiPCM, which leverages multivariate embeddings to more effectively distinguish indirect causal relationships. We further propose a multivariate cross-mapping framework (MXMap) for causal discovery in dynamical systems. This two-phase framework combines (1) pairwise CCM tests to establish an initial causal graph and (2) multiPCM to refine the graph by pruning indirect causal connections. Through experiments on simulated data and the ERA5 Reanalysis weather dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MXMap. Additionally, MXMap is compared against several baseline methods, showing advantages in accuracy and causal graph refinement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss some aspects of numerical continuation and bifurcation for partial differential equations, specifically pattern formation and coherent structures. For the sake of clarity we focus on wavetrains, stability and associated invasion processes in the paradigmatic cubic Swift-Hohenberg equation (SHE). We do not aim at a review of numerical continuation for PDE or pattern formation in SHE in any generality, rather our goal is to provide an entry point for interested students and colleagues to the application of continuation methods. We provide access to numerical implementations and hope that our presentation provides an introductory guideline that can also be used for teaching.</description>

      <title>Feedback stabilization for a spatial-dependent Sterile Insect Technique model with Allee Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on feedback control strategies for applying the sterile insect technique (SIT) to eliminate pest populations. The presentation is centered on the case of mosquito populations, but most of the results can be extended to other species by adapting the model and selecting appropriate parameter values to describe the reproduction and movement dynamics of the species under consideration. In our study, we address the spatial distribution of the population in a two dimensional bounded domain by extending the temporal SIT model analyzed in [2], thereby obtaining a reaction-diffusion SIT model. After the analysis of the existence and the uniqueness of the solution of this problem, we construct a feedback law that globally asymptotically stabilizes the extinction equilibrium thus yielding a robust strategy to keep the pest population at very low levels in the long term.</description>

      <title>Geometric Stabilization of Virtual Nonlinear Nonholonomic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of stabilizing a system around a desired manifold determined by virtual nonlinear nonholonomic constraints. Virtual constraints are relationships imposed on a control system that are rendered invariant through feedback control. Virtual nonholonomic constraints represent a specific class of virtual constraints that depend on the system's velocities in addition to its configurations. We derive a control law under which a mechanical control system achieves exponential convergence to the virtual constraint submanifold, and rendering it control-invariant. The proposed controller's performance is validated through simulation results in two distinct applications: flocking motion in multi-agent systems and the control of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) navigating a stream.</description>

      <title>Using Lagrangian descriptors to reveal the phase space structure of dynamical systems described by fractional differential equations: Application to the Duffing oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We showcase the utility of the Lagrangian descriptors method in qualitatively understanding the underlying dynamical behavior of dynamical systems governed by fractional-order differential equations. In particular, we use the Lagrangian descriptors method to study the phase space structure of the unforced and undamped Duffing oscillator when its time evolution is governed by fractional-order differential equations. In our study, we implement two types of fractional derivatives, namely the standard Gr\"unwald-Letnikov method, which is a finite difference approximation of the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, and a Gr\"unwald-Letnikov method with a correction term that approximates the Caputo fractional derivative. While there is no issue with forward-time integrations needed for the evaluation of Lagrangian descriptors, we discuss in detail ways to perform the non-trivial task of backward-time integrations and implement two methods for this purpose: a `nonlocal implicit inverse' technique and a `time-reverse inverse' approach. We analyze the differences in the Lagrangian descriptors results due to the two backward-time integration approaches, discuss the physical significance of these differences, and eventually argue that the nonlocal implicit inverse implementation of the Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivative manages to reveal the phase space structure of fractional-order dynamical systems correctly.</description>

Abstract: We examine pairs of closed plane curves that have the same closing property as two conic sections in Poncelet's porism. We show how the vertex curve can be computed for a given envelope and vice versa. Our formulas are universal in the sense that they produce all possible sufficiently regular pairs of such Poncelet curves. We arrive at similar results for sets of curves, analogous to the pencil of conic sections in the full Poncelet theorem. We also study the case of Poncelet curves that carry Poncelet polygons which are equiangular or even congruent.</description>

      <title>Ideal quantum metrics from fractional Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel framework for Monge--Kantorovi\v{c} metrics using Schatten ideals and commutators of fractional Laplacians on Ahlfors regular spaces. Notably, for those metrics we derive closed formulas in terms of spectra of higher-order fractional Laplacians. For our proofs we develop new techniques in noncommutative geometry, in particular a Weyl law and Schatten-class commutators, yielding refined quantum metrics on the space of Borel probability measures. Lastly, our fractional analysis extends to dynamical systems. We showcase this in the setting of expansive algebraic $\mathbb Z^m$-actions and homoclinic $C^*$-algebras of certain hyperbolic dynamical systems. These findings illustrate the versatility of fractional analysis in fractal geometry, dynamical systems and noncommutative geometry.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium States for Open Zooming Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.08143v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we construct Markov structures for zooming systems adapted to holes of a special type. Our construction is based on backward contractions provided by zooming times. These Markov structures may be used to code the open zooming systems.
  In the context of open zooming systems, possibly with the presence of a critical/singular set, we prove the existence of finitely many ergodic zooming equilibrium states for zooming potentials whose induced potential is locally H\"older. For example, the zooming H\"older continuous. Among the zooming ones are the so-called \textit{hyperbolic potentials} and also what we call \textit{bounded distortion potentials}, having as a particular case the \textit{pseudo-geometric potentials} $\phi_{t} = -t \log J_{\mu}f $, where $J_{\mu}f$ is a Jacobian of the reference zooming measure. Moreover, for this last class of potentials, we show the existence of what we call pseudo-conformal measures. Afterwards, with a mild condition, we prove uniqueness of equilibrium state with no requirement of transitivity.
  The technique consists in using an inducing scheme in a finite Markov structure with infinitely many symbols to code the dynamics to obtain an equilibrium state for the associated symbolic dynamics and then projecting it to obtain an equilibrium state for the original map. To obtain a pseudo-conformal measure, we "spread" the conformal one which exists for the symbolic dynamics. The uniqueness is obtained by showing that the equilibrium states are liftable to the same inducing scheme.
  Finally, we show that the class of hyperbolic potentials is equivalent to the class of continuous zooming potentials. Moreover, we give a class of examples of hyperbolic potentials (including the null one). It implies the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium state. Among the maps considered is the important class known as Viana maps.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb R$- and $\mathbb C$-supercyclicity for some classes of operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper we investigate different variants of supercyclicity, precisely $\mathbb R^+$-, $\mathbb R$- and $\mathbb C$-supercyclicity in the context of composition operators. We characterize $\mathbb R$-supercyclic composition operators on $L^p$, $1 \leq p &lt; \infty$. Then, we turn our attention to dissipative composition operators, and we show that $\mathbb R$- and $\mathbb C$-supercyclicity are equivalent notions in this setting and they have a ``shift-like'' characterization.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Parameter Singular Perturbation Analysis of the Robertson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Robertson model describing a chemical reaction involving three reactants is one of the classical examples of stiffness in ODEs. The stiffness is caused by the occurrence of three reaction rates $k_1,\,k_2$, and $k_3$, with largely differing orders of magnitude, acting as parameters. The model has been widely used as a numerical test problem. Surprisingly, no asymptotic analysis of this multiscale problem seems to exist. In this paper we provide a full asymptotic analysis of the Robertson model under the assumption $k_1, k_3 \ll k_2$. We rewrite the equations as a two-parameter singular perturbation problem in the rescaled small parameters $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2):=(k_1/k_2,k_3/k_2)$, which we then analyze using geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT). To deal with the multi-parameter singular structure, we perform blow-ups in parameter- and variable space. We identify four distinct regimes in a neighbourhood of the singular limit $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)= (0,0)$. Within these four regimes we use GSPT and additional blow-ups to analyze the dynamics and the structure of solutions. Our asymptotic results are in excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the numerics.</description>

      <title>Anosov flows in dimension 3: an outside look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes were intended as support material for a minicourse on Anosov flows in the conference "Symplectic geometry and Anosov flows'' which took place in Heidelberg in July 2024 organized by Peter Albers, Jonathan Bowden and Agust\'in Moreno. I took the invitation to present the subject as asking from an outsider view of the subject, given the fact that my research uses both ideas and results from the theory of Anosov flows. The point of view of the course is to provide an overview of the main results and questions in the subject, with emphasis on the interaction with topology, geometry, specially symplectic geometry and contact aspects of the theory. Some detail is given in the presentation of the Barbot-Fenley theory of leaf spaces. Hopefully the notes will contribute in gaining a working knowledge of the theory and its many beautiful connections.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Analysis of Predator-Prey System using Conformable Fractional Order Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, conformal fractional order discretization [20, 24, 25] is used to analyze bifurcation analysis and stability of a predator-prey system. A continuous model has been discretized into a discrete one while preserving the fractional-order dynamics. This allows us to look more closely at the stability properties of the system and bifurcation phenomena, including period-doubling and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. Through numerical and theoretical methods, this research investigated how the modification in system parameters affects the overall dynamics, which may have implications for ecological management and conservation strategies.</description>

      <title>Tranched graphs: consequences for topology and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare quasi-graphs and generalized $\sin(1/x)$-type continua, which are two classes of continua that generalize topological graphs and contain the Warsaw circle as a nontrivial common element. We show that neither class is a subset of the other, provide some characterizations, and present illustrative examples. We unify both approaches by considering the class of tranched graphs, compare it to concepts known from the literature, and describe how the topological structure of its elements restricts possible dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we find the first infinite family of hyperbolic 3-manifolds which admit tight contact structures but do not have any tight projectively Anosov flow. These manifolds are obtained as rational surgeries on the figure eight knot.</description>

      <title>Dimension bounds for singular affine forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish upper bounds on the dimension of sets of singular-on-average and \(\omega\)-singular affine forms in singly metric settings, where either the matrix or the shift is fixed. These results partially address open questions posed by Das, Fishman, Simmons, and Urba\'nski, as well as Kleinbock and Wadleigh. Furthermore, we extend our results to the generalized weighted setup and derive bounds for the intersection of these sets with a wide class of fractals.</description>

      <title>Containment Control Approach for Steering Opinion in a Social Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper studies the problem of steering multi-dimensional opinion in a social network. Assuming the society of desire consists of stubborn and regular agents, stubborn agents are considered as leaders who specify the desired opinion distribution as a distributed reward or utility function. In this context, each regular agent is seen as a follower, updating its bias on the initial opinion and influence weights by averaging their observations of the rewards their influencers have received. Assuming random graphs with reducible and irreducible topology specify the influences on regular agents, opinion evolution is represented as a containment control problem in which stability and convergence to the final opinion are proven.</description>
