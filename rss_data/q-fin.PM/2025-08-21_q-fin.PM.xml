      <title>Variable selection for minimum-variance portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods have been successfully employed in identifying variables that can predict the equity premium of individual stocks. In this paper, we investigate if ML can also be helpful in selecting variables relevant for optimal portfolio choice. To address this question, we parameterize minimum-variance portfolio weights as a function of a large pool of firm-level characteristics as well as their second-order and cross-product transformations, yielding a total of 4,610 predictors. We find that the gains from employing ML to select relevant predictors are substantial: minimum-variance portfolios achieve lower risk relative to sparse specifications commonly considered in the literature, especially when non-linear terms are added to the predictor space. Moreover, some of the selected predictors that help decreasing portfolio risk also increase returns, leading to minimum-variance portfolios with good performance in terms of Shape ratios in some situations. Our evidence suggests that ad-hoc sparsity can be detrimental to the performance of minimum-variance characteristics-based portfolios.</description>

      <title>Investment Portfolio Optimization Based on Modern Portfolio Theory and Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an important problem of an appropriate variance-covariance matrix estimation in the Modern Portfolio Theory. We propose a novel framework for variancecovariance matrix estimation for purposes of the portfolio optimization, which is based on deep learning models. We employ the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNN) along with two probabilistic deep learning models: DeepVAR and GPVAR to the task of one-day ahead multivariate forecasting. We then use these forecasts to optimize portfolios of stocks and cryptocurrencies. Our analysis presents results across different combinations of observation windows and rebalancing periods to compare performances of classical and deep learning variance-covariance estimation methods. The conclusions of the study are that although the strategies (portfolios) performance differed significantly between different combinations of parameters, generally the best results in terms of the information ratio and annualized returns are obtained using the LSTM-RNN models. Moreover, longer observation windows translate into better performance of the deep learning models indicating that these methods require longer windows to be able to efficiently capture the long-term dependencies of the variance-covariance matrix structure. Strategies with less frequent rebalancing typically perform better than these with the shortest rebalancing windows across all considered methods.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Trader Responses to Macroeconomic Surprises: Simulating Order Flow Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how market participants react to shocks like scheduled macroeconomic news is crucial for both traders and policymakers. We develop a calibrated data generation process DGP that embeds four stylized trader archetypes retail, pension, institutional, and hedge funds into an extended CAPM augmented by CPI surprises. Each agents order size choice is driven by a softmax discrete choice rule over small, medium, and large trades, where utility depends on risk aversion, surprise magnitude, and liquidity. We aim to analyze each agent's reaction to shocks and Monte Carlo experiments show that higher information, lower aversion agents take systematically larger positions and achieve higher average wealth. Retail investors under react on average, exhibiting smaller allocations and more dispersed outcomes. And ambient liquidity amplifies the sensitivity of order flow to surprise shocks. Our framework offers a transparent benchmark for analyzing order flow dynamics around macro releases and suggests how real time flow data could inform news impact inference.</description>
