      <description>arXiv:2412.19975v1 Announce Type: new

      <title>Main conjectures for non-CM elliptic curves at good ordinary primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve and $p &gt; 2$ be a prime of good ordinary reduction for $E$. Assume that the residue representation associate to $(E, p)$ is irreducible. In this paper, we prove more cases on several Iwasawa main conjectures for $E$. As applications, we prove more general cases of $p$-converse theorem and $p$-part BSD formula when the rank is less or equal to $1$.</description>

      <title>The third moment of the logarithm of zeta and a twisted pair correlation conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove precise conditional estimates for the third moment of the logarithm of the Riemann zeta function, refining what is implied by the Selberg central limit theorem, both for the real and imaginary parts. These estimates match predictions made in work of Keating and Snaith. We require the Riemann Hypothesis, a conjecture for the triple correlation of Riemann zeros and another ``twisted'' pair correlation conjecture which explains the interaction of a prime power with Montgomery's pair correlation function. We believe this to be of independent interest, and devote substantial effort to its justification. Namely, we prove this conjecture on a certain range unconditionally, and on a larger range under the assumption of a variant of the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture with good uniformity.</description>

      <title>Exponential sums twisted by general arithmetic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine exponential sums of the form $\sum_{n \le X} w(n) e^{2\pi i\alpha n^k}$, for $k=1,2$, where $\alpha$ satisfies a generalized Diophantine approximation and where $w$ are different arithmetic functions that might be multiplicative, additive, or neither. A strategy is shown on how to bound these sums for a wide class of functions $w$ belonging within the same ecosystem. Using this new technology we are able to improve current results on minor arcs that have recently appeared in the literature of the Hardy-Littlewood circle method. Lastly, we show how a bound on $\sum_{n \le X} |\mu(n)| e^{2\pi i\alpha n}$ can be used to study partitions asymptotics over squarefree parts and explain their connection to the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function.</description>

      <title>Strange and pseudo-differentiable functions with applications to prime partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{p}_{\mathbb{P}_r}(n)$ denote the number of partitions of $n$ into $r$-full primes. We use the Hardy-Littlewood circle method to find the asymptotic of $\mathfrak{p}_{\mathbb{P}_r}(n)$ as $n \to \infty$. This extends previous results in the literature of partitions into primes. We also show an analogue result involving convolutions of von Mangoldt functions and the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function. To handle the resulting non-principal major arcs we introduce the definition of strange functions and pseudo-differentiability.</description>

      <title>Monogenic $S_3$-cubic polynomials and class numbers of associated quadratic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a monic polynomial $f(x)\in {\mathbb Z}[x]$ is monogenic if $f(x)$ is irreducible over ${\mathbb Q}$ and $\{1,\theta,\theta^2,\ldots ,\theta^{\deg{f}-1}\}$ is a basis for the ring of integers of ${\mathbb Q}(\theta)$, where $f(\theta)=0$. In this article, we use a theorem due to Kishi and Miyake to give an explicit description of an infinite set ${\mathcal F}$ of cubic polynomials $f(x)\in {\mathbb Z}[x]$, such that $f(x)$ satisfies the three conditions: ${\rm Gal}_{{\mathbb Q}}(f)\simeq S_3$, the class number of the unique quadratic subfield of the splitting field of $f(x)$ is divisible by 3, and $f(x)$ is monogenic. Moreover, if $g(x)$ is any cubic polynomial satisfying these three conditions, then there exists a unique $f(x)\in {\mathcal F}$ such that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ generate the same cubic extension over ${\mathbb Q}$.</description>

      <title>Defining newforms in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of newforms, due to Atkin and Lehner, provides a powerful method for decomposing spaces of modular forms. However, many problems occur when trying to generalise this theory to characteristic $p$. Recently, Deo and Medvedovsky have suggested a way around these problems by using purely algebraic notions to define newforms. In this thesis, we describe the methods of Deo and Medvedovsky in detail and generalise their results where possible.</description>

      <title>On $\ell$-torsion in degree $\ell$ superelliptic Jacobians over $\mathbf{F}_q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\ell$-torsion subgroup in Jacobians of curves of the form $y^{\ell} = f(x)$ for irreducible $f(x)$ over a finite field $\mathbf{F}_{q}$ of characteristic $p \neq \ell$. This is a function field analogue of the study of $\ell$-torsion subgroups of ideal class groups of number fields $\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt[\ell]{N})$. We establish an upper bound, lower bound, and parity constraint on the rank of the $\ell$-torsion which depend only on the parameters $\ell$, $q$, and $\text{deg}\, f$. Using tools from class field theory, we show that additional criteria depending on congruence conditions involving the polynomial $f(x)$ can be used to refine the upper and lower bounds. For certain values of the parameters $\ell,q,\text{deg}\, f$, we determine the $\ell$-torsion of the Jacobian for all curves with the given parameters.</description>

      <title>Exponential Sums with Additive Coefficients and its Consequences to Weighted Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the weighted partition function $p_f(n)$ given by the generating series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} p_f(n)z^n = \prod_{n\in\mathbb{N}^{*}}(1-z^n)^{-f(n)}$, where we restrict the class of weight functions to strongly additive functions. Originally proposed in a paper by Yang, this problem was further examined by Debruyne and Tenenbaum for weight functions taking positive integer values. We establish an asymptotic formula for this generating series in a broader context, which notably can be used for the class of multiplicative functions. Moreover, we employ a classical result by Montgomery-Vaughan to estimate exponential sums with additive coefficients, supported on minor arcs.</description>

      <title>Abelian varieties genuinely of $\mathrm{GL}_n$-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple abelian variety $A$ defined over a number field $k$ is called of $\mathrm{GL}_n$-type if there exists a number field of degree $2\dim(A)/n$ which is a subalgebra of $\mathrm{End}^0(A)$. We say that $A$ is genuinely of $\mathrm{GL}_n$-type if its base change $A_{\overline{k}}$ contains no isogeny factor of $\mathrm{GL}_m$-type for $m&lt;n$. This generalizes the classical notion of abelian variety of $\mathrm{GL}_2$-type without potential complex multiplication introduced by Ribet. We develop a theory of building blocks, inner twists and nebentypes for these varieties. When the center of $\mathrm{End}^0(A)$ is totally real, Chi, Banaszak, Gajda, and Kraso\'n have attached to $A$ a compatible system of Galois representations of degree $n$ which is either symplectic or orthogonal. We extend their results under the weaker assumption that the center of $\mathrm{End}^0(A_{\overline{k}})$ be totally real. We conclude the article by showing an explicit family of abelian fourfolds genuinely of $\mathrm{GL}_4$-type. This involves the construction of a family of genus 2 curves defined over a quadratic field whose Jacobian has trivial endomorphism ring and is isogenous to its Galois conjugate.</description>

      <title>Relative Langlands duality for $\mathfrak{osp}(2n + 1|2n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an $S$-duality converse to the one studied by the 1st, 2nd and 4th authors; this is also a case of a twisted version of the relative Langlands duality of Ben Zvi, Sakellaridis and Venkatesh.. Namely, we prove that the $S$-dual of $\text{SO}(2n+1)\times \text{Sp}(2n)$ acting on the tensor product of their tautological representations is the symplectic mirabolic space $\text{Sp}(2n)\times\text{Sp}(2n)$ acting on the product $T^* \text{Sp}(2n)$ and the tautological representations of $\text{Sp}(2n)$. (Note that due to the anomaly, the dual of the second factor $\text{Sp}(2n)$ is the metaplectic dual, i.e. $\text{Sp}(2n)$). We also formulate the corresponding global conjecture, which describes explicitly the categorical theta-correspondence on the Langlands dual side.</description>

      <title>Some Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Diophantine Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A linear Diophantine equation $ax + by = n$ is solvable if and only if gcd$(a; b)$ divides $n$. A graph $G$ of order $n$ is called Diophantine if there exists a labeling function $f$ of vertices such that gcd$(f(u); f(v))$ divides $n$ for every two adjacent vertices $u; v$ in $G$. In this work, maximal Diophantine graphs on $n$ vertices, $D_n$, are defined, studied and generalized. The independence number, the number of vertices with full degree and the clique number of $D_n$ are computed. Each of these quantities is the basis of a necessary condition for the existence of such a labeling.</description>

      <title>On the clique number of random Cayley graphs and related topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a random Cayley graph on a group of order $N$ has clique number $O(\log N \log \log N)$ with high probability. This bound is best possible up to the constant factor for certain groups, including~$\mathbb{F}_2^n$, and improves the longstanding upper bound of $O(\log^2 N)$ due to Alon. Our proof does not make use of the underlying group structure and is purely combinatorial, with the key result being an essentially best possible upper bound for the number of subsets of given order that contain at most a given number of colors in a properly edge-colored complete graph. As a further application of this result, we study a conjecture of Alon stating that every group of order $N$ has a Cayley graph whose clique number and independence number are both $O(\log N)$, proving the conjecture for all abelian groups of order $N$ for almost all $N$. For finite vector spaces of order $N$ with characteristic congruent to $1 \pmod 4$, we prove the existence of a self-complementary Cayley graph on the vector space whose clique number and independence number are both at most $(2+o(1))\log N$. This matches the lower bound for Ramsey numbers coming from random graphs and solves, in a strong form, a problem of Alon and Orlitsky motivated by information theory.</description>

      <title>Full Galois groups of polynomials with slowly growing coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Choose a polynomial $f$ uniformly at random from the set of all monic polynomials of degree $n$ with integer coefficients in the box $[-L,L]^n$. The main result of the paper asserts that if $L=L(n)$ grows to infinity, then the Galois group of $f$ is the full symmetric group, asymptotically almost surely, as $n\to \infty$.
  When $L$ grows rapidly to infinity, say $L&gt;n^7$, this theorem follows from a result of Gallagher. When $L$ is bounded, the analog of the theorem is open, while the state-of-the-art is that the Galois group is large in the sense that it contains the alternating group (if $L&lt; 17$, it is conditional on the general Riemann hypothesis). Hence the most interesting case of the theorem is when $L$ grows slowly to infinity.
  Our method works for more general independent coefficients.</description>

      <title>SIC-POVMs and orders of real quadratic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns SIC-POVMs and their relationship to class field theory. SIC-POVMs are generalized quantum measurements (POVMs) described by $d^2$ equiangular complex lines through the origin in $\mathbb{C}^d$. Weyl--Heisenberg SICs are those SIC-POVMs described by the orbit a single vector under a finite Weyl--Heisenberg group ${\rm WH}(d)$.
  We relate known data on the structure and classification of Weyl--Heisenberg SICs in low dimensions to arithmetic data attached to certain orders of real quadratic fields. For $4 \le d \le 90$, we show the number of known geometric equivalence classes of Weyl--Heisenberg SICs in dimension $d$ equals the cardinality of the ideal class monoid of the real quadratic order $\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}$ of discriminant $\Delta=(d+1)(d-3)$; we conjecture the equality extends to all $d \ge 4$. We prove that this conjecture implies the existence of more than one geometric equivalence class of Weyl--Heisenberg SICs for $d &gt; 22$. We conjecture Galois multiplets of SICs are in one-to-one correspondence with the over-orders $\mathcal{O}'$ of $\mathcal{O}_{\Delta}$ in such a way that the number of classes in the multiplet equals the ring class number of $\mathcal{O}'$. We test that conjecture against known data on exact SICs in low dimensions.
  We refine the class field hypothesis of Appleby, Flammia, McConnell, and Yard (arXiv:1604.06098) to predict the exact class field over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{(d+1)(d-3)})$ generated by the ratios of vector entries for the equiangular lines defining a Weyl--Heisenberg SIC. The refined conjectures use a recently developed class field theory for orders of number fields (arXiv:2212.09177). The refined class fields assigned to over-orders $\mathcal{O}'$ have a natural partial order under inclusion; the inclusions of these fields fail to be strict in some cases. We characterize such cases and give a table of them for $d &lt; 500$.</description>

      <title>Heegner point constructions and fundamental units in cubic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Heegner points to prove the existence of nontorsion rational points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + D$ for any rational number $D=a/b$ such that $a$ and $b$ are squarefree integers for which $6$, $a$, and $b$ are pairwise relatively prime, $a\equiv b\pmod{4}$, $\lvert a\rvert\lvert b\rvert^{-1}\equiv5$ or $7\pmod{9}$, and $h_K$ is odd, where $K:=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{D})$. In particular, we show that under these assumptions, the elliptic curve with equation $y^2 = x^3 + D$ has algebraic rank $1$ and the elliptic curve with equation $y^2 = x^3 - D$ has algebraic rank $0$. This follows from our new expression for the fundamental unit of $\mathscr{O}_K$ in terms of the class number $h_K$ and the norm of a special value of a modular function of level $6$, for any integer $D$ relatively prime to $6$, not congruent to $\pm1\pmod{9}$, for which no exponent in its prime factorization is a multiple of $3$. This expression is an analogue of a theorem of Dirichlet in 1840 relating the fundamental unit of a real quadratic field to its class number and a product of cyclotomic units.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider families of smooth projective curves of genus 2 with a single point removed and study their integral points. We show that in many such families there is a dense set of fibres for which the integral points can be effectively determined. Our method is based on the construction of degree-3 \'etale covers of such curves of genus 2 and the study of the torsion values of sections of certain doubly elliptic abelian schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain new bounds on complete rational exponential sums with sparse polynomials modulo a prime, under some mild conditions on the degrees of the monomials of such polynomials. These bounds, when they apply, give explicit versions of a result of J. Bourgain (2005). In turn, as an application, we also obtain an explicit version of a result of J. Bourgain (2010) on national exponential sums with sparse polynomials modulo an arbitrary composite number. We then use one of these bounds to study the multidimensional distribution of the classical power generator of pseudorandom numbers, which has not been possible within previously known results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We train machine learning models to predict the order of the Shafarevich-Tate group of an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$. Building on earlier work of He, Lee, and Oliver, we show that a feed-forward neural network classifier trained on subsets of the invariants arising in the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjectural formula yields higher accuracies ($&gt; 0.9$) than any model previously studied. In addition, we develop a regression model that may be used to predict orders of this group not seen during training and apply this to the elliptic curve of rank 29 recently discovered by Elkies and Klagsbrun. Finally we conduct some exploratory data analyses and visualizations on our dataset. We use the elliptic curve dataset from the L-functions and modular forms database (LMFDB).</description>

Abstract: We study knots which behave like prime numbers. We discuss the planetary link raised from a hyperbolic fibered link in $S^3$ with an emphasis on surgeries, point out certain subtleness, and refine the construction. In addition, we point out a version of McMullen's theorem for the cases over cusped orbifolds and deduce that the family of modular knots around any torus knot $K_{a,b}$ in $S^3$ together with the missing knot $K_{a,b}$ obey the Chebotarev law. Furthermore, we attach several remarks in the view of arithmetic topology.</description>

      <title>On the construction of a family of sets of positive integers closed under taking subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the several contexts such as combinatorial number theory, families of sets of positive integers closed under taking subsets have been investigated. Then it is sometimes useful to give bijections between the set of the one-sided infinite sequences on the alphabet set $\{0,1\}$ and such a family of sets. The most typical example is the family of sum-free sets. Although such a kind of families covers a large class of families of sets, there are only a few considerations on bijections for the case where the sum-free property is replaced by another property.
  In this paper, we explicitly give a bijection and its inverse between the set of one-sided infinite sequences on the alphabet set $\{0,1\}$ and a family of sets which may be contained in a class of families closed under taking subsets. Moreover, we show that some extremal property in a particular family of sets is characterized by a discrete dynamical system based on this kind of bijections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10300v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate Vojta's conjecture for smooth weighted projective varieties, weighted multiplier ideal sheaves, and weighted log pairs and prove that all three versions of the conjecture are equivalent. In the process, we introduce generalized weighted general common divisors and express them as heights of weighted projective spaces blown-up relative to an exceptional divisor. Furthermore, we prove that assuming Vojta's conjecture for weighted projective varieties one can bound the $\log {\rm h_{wgcd}}$ for any subvariety of codimension $\geq 2$ and a finite set of places $S$. An analogue result is proved for weighted homogeneous polynomials with integer coefficients.</description>

Abstract: Mixed Tate motives are central objects in the study of cohomology groups of algebraic varieties and their arithmetic invariants. They also play a crucial role in a wide variety of questions related to multiple zeta values and polylogarithms, algebraic K-theory, hyperbolic geometry, and particle physics among others. This survey article is an introduction to mixed Tate motives and their many facets. It was written for the proceedings of the Summer School on Motives and Arithmetic Groups held in Strasbourg in June 2022.</description>
