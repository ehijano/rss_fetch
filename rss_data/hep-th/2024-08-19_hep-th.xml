      <title>A local diagnostic program for unitary evolution in general space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a local framework for investigating non-unitary evolution groups pertinent to effective field theories in general semi-classical spacetimes. Our approach is based on a rigorous local stability analysis of the algebra of observables and solely employs geometric concepts in the functional representation of quantum field theory. In this representation, it is possible to construct infinitely many self-adjoint extensions of the canonical momentum field at the kinematic level, and by the usual functional calculus arguments this holds for the Hamiltonian, as well. However, these self-adjoint domains have only the trivial wave functional in common with the solution space of the functional Schr\"odinger equation. This is related to the existence of boundaries in configuration field space which can be penetrated by the probability flux, causing probability to leak into regions in configuration field space that require a more fundamental description. As a consequence the evolution admits no unitary representation. Instead, in the absence of ghosts, the evolution is represented by contractive semi-groups in the semiclassical approximation. This allows to quantify the unitarity loss and, in turn, to assess the quality of the semi-classical approximation. We perform numerical experiments based on our formal investigations to determine regions in cosmological spacetimes where the semiclassical approximation breaks down for free quantum fields.</description>

      <title>De Sitter Bra-Ket Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model for the initial state of the universe based on a gravitational path integral that includes connected geometries which simultaneously produce bra and ket of the wave function. We argue that a natural object to describe this state is the Wigner distribution, which is a function on a classical phase space obtained by a certain integral transform of the density matrix. We work with Lorentzian de Sitter Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity in which we find semiclassical saddle-points for pure gravity, as well as when we include matter components such as a CFT and a classical inflaton field. We also discuss different choices of fixing time reparametrizations. In the regime of large universes our connected geometry dominates over the Hartle-Hawking saddle and gives a distribution that has a meaningful probabilistic interpretation for local observables. It does not, however, give a normalizable probability measure on the entire phase space of the theory.</description>

      <title>Triple critical point and emerging temperature scales in $SU(N)$ ferromagnetism at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Abelian ferromagnet recently introduced by the authors, consisting of atoms in the fundamental representation of $SU(N)$, is studied in the limit where $N$ becomes large and scales as the square root of the number of atoms $n$. This model exhibits additional phases, as well as two different temperature scales related by a factor $N\!/\!\ln N$. The paramagnetic phase splits into a "dense" and a "dilute" phase, separated by a third-order transition and leading to a triple critical point in the scale parameter $n/N^2$ and the temperature, while the ferromagnetic phase exhibits additional structure, and a new paramagnetic-ferromagnetic metastable phase appears at the larger temperature scale. These phases can coexist, becoming stable or metastable as temperature varies. A generalized model in which the number of $SU(N)$-equivalent states enters the partition function with a nontrivial weight, relevant, e.g., when there is gauge invariance in the system, is also studied and shown to manifest similar phases, with the dense-dilute phase transition becoming second-order in the fully gauge invariant case.</description>

      <title>On the Algebra of the Infrared with Twisted Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Algebra of the Infrared \cite{Gaiotto:2015aoa} is a framework to construct local observables, interfaces, and categories of supersymmetric boundary conditions of massive $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theories in two dimensions by using information only about the BPS sector. The resulting framework is known as the ``web-based formalism.'' In this paper we initiate the generalization of the web-based formalism to include a much wider class of $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ quantum field theories than was discussed in \cite{Gaiotto:2015aoa}: theories with non-trivial twisted masses. The essential new ingredient is the presence of BPS particles within a fixed vacuum sector. In this paper we work out the web-based formalism for the simplest class of theories that allow for such BPS particles: theories with a single vacuum and a single twisted mass. We show that even in this simple setting there are interesting new phenomenon including the emergence of Fock spaces of closed solitons and a natural appearance of Koszul dual algebras. Mathematically, studying theories with twisted masses includes studying the Fukaya-Seidel category of A-type boundary conditions for Landau-Ginzburg models defined by a closed holomorphic one-form. This paper sketches a web-based construction for the category of A-type boundary conditions for one-forms with a single Morse zero and a single non-trivial period. We demonstrate our formalism explicitly in a particularly instructive example.</description>

      <title>AdS3 Integrability, Tensionless Limits, and Deformations: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent advances in the understanding of integrability for $AdS_3$ backgrounds, we present a lightning review of this approach, with particular attention to the "tensionless" limits (with zero and one unit of NSNS flux), and to the many integrable deformations of the supergravity backgrounds. Our aim is to concisely but comprehensively take stock of the state of the art in the field, in a way accessible to non-experts, and to highlight outstanding challenges. Along the way we reference where the various derivation of these results, which we mostly omit, can be found in full detail.</description>

      <title>Mixed Gauge-Global Symmetries, Elliptic Modes, and Black Hole Thermodynamics in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical theories are largely dictated by their symmetries. One important conjecture in this vein is that a consistent quantum gravity theory may not possess a global symmetry, but rather only local gauge symmetries, a conjecture which has recently been extended to generalized global symmetries. Historically, this conjecture arose from a heuristic argument using black hole thermodynamics and was recently proven to hold in AdS/CFT. In Horava-Lifshitz gravity, a presumed consistent theory of quantum gravity for which there is strong evidence for both black hole thermodynamics and a holographic construction, spacetime is endowed with a preferred dynamical spacelike foliation. The theory has a leaf reparameterization symmetry that is neither global nor local gauge, hyperbolic and elliptic equations of motion, a lack of splittability, and universal horizon black hole solutions. The reparameterization symmetry is "mixed": it is a local symmetry in one coordinate that remains global on each leaf. More broadly it is an example of both unfree and projectable gauge symmetries. We show how the corresponding charge, which has previously not been considered thermodynamically, coupled with the other features above, resolves some outstanding tensions. Hence this mixed symmetry is not precluded by horizon thermodynamics, but is instead an integral feature. This expands the types of symmetries in quantum gravity compatible with black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Roles of electric field/time-dependent Wilson line in toroidal compactification with or without magnetic fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the effects of electric fields along compact directions within (supersymmetric) gauge theory in $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\times{\mathbb T}^2 (\times{\mathbb T}^2\times{\mathbb T}^2)$. The electric field along compact directions is equivalent to time-dependent homogeneous configuration of Wilson line moduli, which would be relevant to physics in the early universe. In particular, we consider models with and without background magnetic fluxes, which lead to completely different effects of the electric field due to the difference in the Kaluza-Klein (KK) level structure. We show that, in the case without magnetic fluxes, the deceleration of KK momenta may cause non-perturbative KK particle production dubbed as the KK Schwinger effect, whereas in the case with magnetic flux such KK particle production does not take place but flavor structure of low energy effective theory may be affected.</description>

      <title>On massive higher spin supermultiplets in d=4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we discuss the cubic interactions for massless spin 3/2 gravitino with massive higher spin supermultiplets using three superblocks (2,3/2), (5/2,2) and (3,5/2) as the first non-trivial examples. We use gauge invariant formalism for the massive higher spin fields and, as it common in such cases, we face an ambiguity related with the possible field redefinitions due to the presence of Stueckelberg fields. From one hand, we show how this ambiguity can be used as one more way to classify possible cubic vertices. We also note that all these field redefinitions do not change the part of the Lagrangian which appears in the unitary gauge (where all Stueckelberg fields are set to zero) so we still have some important independent results. From the other hand, we show how using the so-called unfolded formalism one can fix these ambiguities and obtain consistent deformations for all massive field gauge invariant curvatures which is the most important step in the Fradkin-Vasiliev formalism. Unfortunately, this works for the massive fields only so the way to construct deformations for the massless field curvatures is still has to be found.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau approach to the Gross-Neveu model: success and failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase diagram of the Gross-Neveu model in 1+1 dimensions is studied using Ginzburg-Landau expansion. It predicts several features of the exact phase diagram correctly even at low orders. It is shown that increasing the order of the expansion improves the accuracy of the crystal phase except for very small temperatures, where the expansion completely fails regardless of the order of the expansion. The source of this behaviour seems to be related to the Silver-Blaze phenomenon.</description>

      <title>On Stabilization of Magnetically Charged Brane Shell and Over-extremality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In string theory, we can geometrically realize a metastable state by wrapping D5-branes and anti D5-branes to a singular manifold. We consider wrapping D3-branes to the internal space in this setup. These D3-branes dissolve into the domain wall, which interpolates true vacua and false vacua, forming a bound state. The remnant of the D3-branes can be seen as a background magnetic field on the domain wall, which appears to an observer in 4D spacetime as a magnetically charged, spherically symmetric shell. This brane shell has finite radii due to the nonlinearity peculiar to string theory, even at the probe level. We demonstrate a new stabilization mechanism of the brane shell in 4D spacetime. We add a general relativity-inspired gravitational correction to the brane shells and investigate the influence on its potential. As a result, the potential value at the horizon will be relatively larger than the potential minimum in parameter regions where the influence of gravity is large, and even non-perturbative instabilities can be removed. Moreover, we show the existence of over-extremal states such that $(gQ)^{2}\geq G_{4}m^{2}$ is satisfied in regions where the magnetic field is sufficiently large. At least in our model, this over-extremal shell cannot be completely stabilized by gravitational correction. This paper also addresses the dilemma between stabilizing and achieving an over-extremal state.</description>

      <title>A hidden symmetry of complex spacetime and the emergence of the standard model algebraic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When spacetime is considered as a subspace of a wider complex spacetime manifold, there is a mismatch of the elementary linear representations of their symmetry groups, the real and complex Poincar\'{e} groups. In particular, no spinors are allowed for the complex case. When a spin$^{h}$ structure is implemented on principal bundles in complex spacetime, one is naturally led to an algebraic structure analogous to the one of the standard model.</description>

      <title>The Hierarchical Three-Body Problem at $\mathcal{O} (G^2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing techniques from scattering amplitudes and effective field theory, we model the dynamics of hierarchical triples, which are three-body systems composed of two bodies separated by a distance $r$ and a third body a distance $\rho$ away, with $r \ll \rho$. We apply the method of regions to systematically expand in the small ratio $r/\rho$ and illustrate this approach for evaluating Fourier transform integrals, which have been the bottleneck for deriving complete results in position space. In the limit where the distant third body is much heavier than the other two, we derive new analytic results in position space for the three-body conservative potential at $\mathcal{O}(G^2)$ and at leading and next-to-leading order in $r/\rho$. We also provide necessary formulae for deriving results for arbitrary masses in the rest frame of the distant particle. Our results are exact in velocity, and can be used in analyses involving both bound and unbound hierarchical triples in astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Tails from Soft Theorem: A Short Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a set of massive objects collide in space and the fragments disperse, possibly forming black holes, then this process will emit gravitational waves. Computing the detailed gravitational wave-form associated with this process is a complicated problem, not only due to the non-linearity of gravity but also due to the fact that during the collision and subsequent fragmentation the objects could undergo complicated non-gravitational interactions. Nevertheless the classical soft graviton theorem determines the power law fall-off of the wave-form at late and early times, including logarithmic corrections, in terms of only the momenta of the incoming and outgoing objects without any reference to what transpired during the collision. In this short review I shall explain the results and very briefly outline the derivation of these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey elementary features of Lovelock gravity and its maximally symmetric vacuum solutions. The latter is solely determined by the real roots of a dimension-dependent polynomial. We also recover the static spherically symmetric (black hole) solutions of Lovelock gravity using Palais' symmetric criticality principle. We show how to linearize the generic field equations of Lovelock models about a given maximally symmetric vacuum, which turns out to factorize into the product of yet another dimension-dependent polynomial and the linearized Einstein tensor about the relevant background. We also describe how to compute conserved charges using linearized field equations along with the relevant background Killing isometries. We further describe and discuss the special vacua which are defined by the simultaneous vanishing of the aforementioned polynomials.</description>

      <title>Thermodynmics of Rotating AdS black holes in Kaniadakis statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we advance the understanding of thermodynamic properties and phase transitions in rotating anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes by applying the Kaniadakis(KD) entropy framework. This framework represents a non-extensive generalization of classical statistical mechanics, inspired by the symmetries of relativity and offering a novel perspective on black hole thermodynamics. Our focus is on investigating how Kaniadakis entropy modifies the thermodynamic phase space of rotating AdS black holes. To achieve this, we analyze three prominent rotating AdS black hole systems: the Kerr AdS black hole, the Kerr-Sen AdS black hole, and the Kerr-Newman AdS black hole. We assess their thermodynamic quantities, phase transitions, thermodynamic topology and thermodynamic geometry within the Kaniadakis statistical framework. Our analysis reveals notable deviations from the behaviour predicted by traditional Gibbs-Boltzmann(GB) statistics.</description>

      <title>Geometric expansion of fluctuations and averaged shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this letter, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as averaged shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz formulas for finite-density Casimir effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lifshitz formula is well known as a theoretical approach to investigate the Casimir effect at finite temperature. In this Letter, we generalize the Lifshitz formula to the Casimir effect originating from quantum fields at finite chemical potential. To demonstrate the versatility of this formula, we discuss the typical phenomena of the Casimir effect at finite chemical potential in various systems, such as some boundary conditions, finite temperatures, arbitrary spatial dimensions, and mismatched chemical potentials. This formula can be applied to the Casimir effect in dense quark matter and Dirac/Weyl semimetals, where the chemical potential is regarded as a parameter to control the Casimir effect.</description>

      <title>Towards quantitative precision in functional QCD I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional approaches are the only first principle QCD setup that allow for direct computations at finite density. Predictive power and quantitative reliability of the respective results can only be obtained within a systematic expansion scheme with controlled systematic error estimates. Here we set up such a scheme within the functional renormalisation group (fRG) approach to QCD, aiming for full apparent convergence. In the current work we test this setup, using correlation functions and observables in 2+1 flavour vacuum QCD as a natural benchmark case. While the current work includes many evolutionary improvements collected over the past two decades, we also report on three novel important developments: (i) A comprehensive systematic error analysis based on the modular nature of the fRG approach. (ii) The introduction of a fully automated computational framework, allowing for unprecedented access and improvement of the fRG approach to QCD. (iii) The inclusion of the full effective potential of the chiral order parameter. This also gives access to all-order scattering events of pions and to the full momentum dependence of correlation functions, which is a first application of the automated computational framework (ii). The results compare very well to other state-of-the-art results both from functional approaches and lattice simulations, and provide data on general multi-scattering events of pions and the sigma mode for the first time.</description>

      <title>SLOCC and LU classification of black holes with eight electric and magnetic charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{Linde}, Kallosh and Linde discussed the SLOCC classification of black holes. However, the criteria for the SLOCC classification of black holes have not been given. In addition, the LU classification of black holes has not been studied in the past. In this paper we will consider both SLOCC and LU classification of the STU black holes with four integer electric charges $q_{i} $ and four integer magnetic charges $p^{i}$, $i=0,1,2,3$. Two STU black holes with eight charges are considered SLOCC (LU) equivalent if and only if their corresponding states of three qubits are SLOCC (LU) equivalent. Under this definition, we give criteria for the classification of the eight-charge STU black holes under SLOCC and under LU, respectively. We will study the classification of the black holes via the classification of SLOCC and LU entanglement of three qubits. We then identify a set of black holes corresponding to the state W of three qubits, which is of interest since it has the maximal average von Neumann entropy of entanglement. Via von Neumann entanglement entropy, we partition the STU black holes corresponding to pure states of GHZ SLOCC class into five families under LU.</description>

      <title>Field mixing in a thermal medium: A quantum master equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the nonequilibrium dynamics of the indirect mixing of two (pseudo-)scalar fields induced by their couplings to common decay channels in a medium. The effective non-Markovian quantum master equation (QME) for the two fields' reduced density matrix is derived to leading order in the couplings of the two fields with the medium, but to all orders of the couplings among degrees of freedom in the medium. The self-energy and noise-kernel in the QME satisfy a fluctuation-dissipation relation. The solutions show that an initial expectation value (condensate) of one field induces a condensate of the other field through the indirect mixing and that the populations and coherence of the two fields thermalize and approach to non-vanishing values asymptotically. The nearly-degenerate field masses and coupling strengths resonantly enhance the quantum beats and asymptotic coherence, and induce a prominent dynamics of the vacuum after the switch-on of the couplings. We argue that a time-dependent definitions of particles due to the changing vacuum must be introduced so as to obtain results consistent with the calculations of equilibrium states in the asymptotic limit. A coupling strength hierarchy breaks down the resonant enhancement in the nearly-degenerate case but leads to different power countings of the coupling strengths in the magnitudes of the observables and time-scales in the evolution, suggesting the possibility of detecting extremely long-lived particles using prepared short-lived particles within a practical experimental period.</description>

      <title>Static and stationary loop quantum black bounces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a static and stationary black bounce geometry inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), focusing on how LQG corrections and regularization parameters affect its properties. Building on the spherically symmetric and static black hole solution from \cite{Kelly:2020uwj}, we trace its origin to Non-Linear Electrodynamics (NED) with electric and magnetic charges and check the energy conditions (NEC, WEC, SEC). By extending the geometry using the Simpson-Visser procedure, we construct a black hole-wormhole bounce structure, influenced by LQG parameters. We analyze the horizon structure to constrain parameters for black holes and wormholes, and examine curvature and new sources including a phantom-type scalar field to ensure spacetime regularity and adherence to energy conditions. Thermodynamic properties are also studied, revealing the existence of remnants and phase transitions. Additionally, we derive a rotating black bounce solution, verifying its regularity, and putting forward that the spherical bouncing surface turns into an ellipsoid with no ring singularity. Finally, we find that increasing the LQG parameter leads to smaller ergospheres and reduced shadows, with potential implications for observational astrophysics and quantum gravitational signatures.</description>

      <title>Parametrically amplified super-radiance towards hot big bang universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of preheating stage after inflation, using a new idea of parametrically amplified super-radiance. Highly coherent state, characterized by macro-coherence of scalar field coupled to produced massless particle in pairs, is created by parametric resonance effects associated with field oscillation around its potential minimum, within a Hubble volume. The state is described effectively by the simple Dicke-type of super-radiance model, and super-radiant pulse is emitted within a Hubble time, justifying neglect of cosmic expansion. Produced particles are shown to interact to change their energy and momentum distribution to realize thermal hot big bang universe. A long standing problem of heating after inflation may thus be solved. A new dark matter candidate produced at the emergence of thermalized universe is suggested as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sine-Gordon quantum field theory at finite temperature by generalizing the method of random surfaces to compute the free energy and one-point functions of exponential operators non-perturbatively. Focusing on the gapped phase of the sine-Gordon model, we demonstrate the method's accuracy by comparing our results to the predictions of other methods and to exact results in the thermodynamic limit. We find excellent agreement between the method of random surfaces and other approaches when the temperature is not too small with respect to the mass gap. Extending the method to more general problems in strongly interacting one-dimensional quantum systems is discussed.</description>

Abstract: Spectral flow in two-dimensional field theories is known to correspond to geometrical twisting between two circles in the gravity dual. We generalize this operation to the geometries which have SO(k+1) x SO(k+1) isometries with k&gt;1 and perform various non-abelian T-dualities of the resulting twisted backgrounds. Combination of non-abelian twists and dualities leads to a new solution generating technique in supergravity, and we apply it to the geometries dual to supersymmetric states in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Analytical Critical Phenomena of Rotating Regular AdS Black Holes with Dark Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on precisely calculating analytical critical points for rotating regular AdS black holes, examining scenarios with and without external dark field contributions. Importantly, it represents the first attempt to compute critical points for this specific class of rotating black holes. Our primary focus is on investigating the impact resulting from variations in the charge of nonlinear electrodynamics on the critical phenomena of rotating regular AdS black holes, while also incorporating the influence of quintessence field contributions. The analytical investigation is concentrated on the horizon radius, employing two distinct approaches to simplify the complexity and length of the calculations. Furthermore, our examination extends to deciphering the intricate relationship between dark energy and critical phenomena. This involves visually portraying a range of critical behaviors and detailing a recent discovery regarding how the intensity of quintessence affects phase transitions. The shift in these transitions conform to either a concave or convex function, a characteristic dependent on the sign of quintessence intensity.</description>

Abstract: Poisson electrodynamics is the low-energy limit of a rank-one noncommutative gauge theory. It admits a closed formulation in terms of a Poisson structure on the space-time manifold and reproduces ordinary classical electrodynamics in the commutative limit. In this paper, we address and solve the problem of minimal coupling to charged matter fields with a proper commutative limit. Our construction essentially relies on the geometry of symplectic groupoids and works for all integrable Poisson manifolds. An additional advantage of our approach is that the corresponding Lagrangians can be defined on an arbitrary metric background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of operator size in the Lindbladian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with $q$-body interaction terms and linear jump terms at finite dissipation strength. We compute the operator size as well as its distribution numerically at finite $q$ and analytically at large $q$. With dissipative (productive) jump terms, the size converges to a value smaller (larger) than half the number of Majorana fermions. At weak dissipation, the evolution of operator size displays a quadratic-exponential-plateau behavior. The plateau value is determined by the ratios between the coupling of the interaction and the linear jump term in the large $q$ limit. The operator size distribution remains localized in the finite size region even at late times, contrasting with the unitary case. Moreover, we also derived the time-independent orthogonal basis for operator expansion which exhibits the operator size concentration at finite dissipation. Finally, we observe that the uncertainty relation for operator size growth is saturated at large $q$, leading to classical dynamics of the operator size growth with dissipation.</description>

Abstract: Fibonacci anyons provide the simplest possible model of non-Abelian fusion rules: [1] x [1] = [0] + [1]. We propose a conformal field theory construction of topological quantum registers based on Fibonacci anyons realized as quasiparticle excitations in the Z_3 parafermion fractional quantum Hall state. To this end, the results of Ardonne and Schoutens for the correlation function of n = 4 Fibonacci fields are extended to the case of arbitrary n (and 3 r electrons). Special attention is paid to the braiding properties of the obtained correlators. We explain in details the construction of a monodromy representation of the Artin braid group acting on n-point conformal blocks of Fibonacci anyons. For low n (up to n = 8), the matrices of braid group generators are displayed explicitly. A simple recursion formula makes it possible to extend without efforts the construction to any n. Finally, we construct N qubit computational spaces in terms of conformal blocks of 2N + 2 Fibonacci anyons.</description>

Abstract: We compute the particle creation of a harmonic oscillator using the classical stochastic method. This recently constructed method reproduces all the vacuum expectation values in quantum theory. We prepare the vacuum state at the initial time and evolve it over time using Langevin equations of motion. By averaging over the ensemble, we compute the energy of the state at the final time and determine the amount of particles created. We verify that the particle creation agrees with predictions from quantum theory and thus give an evidence that this method can really compute the quantum dynamics.</description>

We compute here the corresponding gravitational shock wave propagators in general relativity and demonstrate that they too obey a double copy relation to gluon shock wave propagators computed previously. These results provide key input in a renormalization group approach towards computing the high frequency radiation spectrum in close black hole encounters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We quantify how constraints on light states affect the asymptotic growth of heavy states in weak Jacobi forms. The constraints we consider are sparseness conditions on the Fourier coefficients of these forms, which are necessary to interpret them as gravitational path integrals. Using crossing kernels, we extract the leading and subleading behavior of these coefficients and show that the leading Cardy-like growth is robust in a wide regime of validity. On the other hand, we find that subleading corrections are sensitive to the constraints placed on the light states, and we quantify their imprint on the asymptotic growth of states. Our approach is tested against the generating function of symmetric product orbifolds, where we provide new insights into the factors contributing to the asymptotic growth of their Fourier coefficients. Finally, we use our methods to revisit the UV/IR connection that relates black hole microstate counting to modular forms. We provide a microscopic interpretation of the logarithmic corrections to the entropy of BPS black holes in N = 2, 4 ungauged supergravity in four and five dimensions, and tie it to consistency conditions in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$.</description>

      <title>Classification of "large" black holes into seven families</title>

Abstract: The black-hole--qubit correspondence has been proven to be ``useful for obtaining additional insight into one of the string black hole theory and quantum information theory by exploiting approaches of the other"[Phys. Rev. D 82, 026003 (2010)]. Though different classes of stringy black holes can be related to the well-known stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) entanglement classes of pure states, the string theory requires a more detailed classification than the SLOCC classification of three qubits. In this paper, we derive the entanglement family of three qubits under local unitary operations (LU), and use the black-hole--qubit correspondence to classify \textquotedblleft large\textquotedblright\ black holes into seven inequivalent families. In particular, we show that two black holes with 4 non-vanishing charges ($q_{0}$, $p^{1}$, $p^{2}$, and $p^{3}$) are LU equivalent if their difference is only in the signs of charges. Thus, the classification of black holes is independent of the signs of charges and is only related to the ratio of the absolute values of charges. This observation simplifies the classification task, as one would only need to consider either the classification of non-BPS black holes or the classification of BPS black holes, but not both. Moreover, through the LU classification, the physical basis for this black-hole--qubit correspondence can be observed, and a relation between the black-hole entropy and the von Neumann entanglement entropy is revealed. Therefore, the LU classification offers a more straightforward physical connection than the SLOCC classification. Based on the LU classification, we further study the properties of von Neumann entanglement entropy for each of the seven families, and find the black holes with the maximal von Neumann entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Computable conditions for order-2 $CP$ symmetry in NHDM potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for order-2 $CP$ ($CP2$) symmetry in $N$-Higgs-doublet potentials for $N&gt;2$. The conditions, which are formulated as relations between vectors that transform under the adjoint representation of $\mathsf{SU}(N)$ under a change of doublet basis, are representation theoretical in nature. Making use of Lie algebra and representation theory we devise an efficient, computable algorithm which may be applied to decide whether or not a given numerical potential is $CP2$ invariant.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrinos flavour composition as a probe of neutrino magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino propagation in the Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields is considered. We extend an approach developed in \cite{Popov:2019nkr} to describe neutrino flavour and spin oscillations on astrophysical baselines using wave packets. The evolution equations for the neutrino wave packets in a uniform and non-uniform magnetic fields are derived. The analytical expressions for neutrino flavour and spin oscillations probabilities accounting for damping due to the wave packet separation are obtained for the case of a uniform magnetic field. It is shown that terms in the flavour oscillations probabilities that depend on the magnetic field strength are characterized by two coherence lengths. One of the coherence lengths coincides with the coherence length for neutrino oscillations in vacuum, while the second one is proportional to the cube of the average neutrino momentum $p_0^3$. The probabilities of flavour and spin oscillations are calculated numerically for neutrino interacting with the non-uniform Galactic magnetic field. It is shown that oscillations on certain frequencies are suppressed on the Galactic scale due to the neutrino wave packets separation. The flavour compositions of high-energy neutrino flux coming from the Galactic centre and ultra-high energy neutrinos from an extragalactic sourse are calculated accounting for neutrino interaction with the magnetic field and decoherence due to the wave packet separation. It is shown that for neutrino magnetic moments $\sim 10^{-13} \mu_B$ and larger these flavour compositions significantly differ from ones predicted by the vacuum neutrino oscillations scenario.}</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau description for multicritical Yang-Lee models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit and extend Fisher's argument for a Ginzburg-Landau description of multicritical Yang-Lee models in terms of a single boson Lagrangian with potential $\varphi^2 (i \varphi)^n$. We explicitly study the cases of $n=1,2$ by a Truncated Hamiltonian Approach based on the free massive boson perturbed by $\boldsymbol P \boldsymbol T$ symmetric deformations, providing clear evidence of the spontaneous breaking of $\boldsymbol P \boldsymbol T$ symmetry. For $n=1$, the symmetric and the broken phases are separated by the critical point corresponding to the minimal model $\mathcal M(2,5)$, while for $n=2$, they are separated by a critical manifold corresponding to the minimal model $\mathcal M(2,5)$ with $\mathcal M(2,7)$ on its boundary. Our numerical analysis strongly supports our Ginzburg-Landau descriptions for multicritical Yang-Lee models.</description>

      <title>Universality of the thermodynamics of a quantum-mechanically radiating black hole departing from thermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathur and Mehta won the third prize in the 2023 Gravity Research Foundation Essay Competition for proving the universality of black hole (BH) thermodynamics. Specifically, they demonstrated that any Extremely Compact Object (ECO) must have the same BH thermodynamic properties regardless of whether or not the ECO possesses an event horizon. The result is remarkable, but it was obtained under the approximation according to which the BH emission spectrum has an exactly thermal character. In fact, strong arguments based on energy conservation and BH back reaction imply that the spectrum of the Hawking radiation cannot be exactly thermal. In this work the result of Mathur and Mehta will be extended to the case where the radiation spectrum is not exactly thermal using the concept of BH dynamical state.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin Interactions in General Relativity versus Linearized Massive Gravity: $N$-body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulated spin-spin interactions of $N$-bodies in linearized General Relativity (GR) and linearized Massive Gravity of the Fierz-Pauli type (mGR). It was noted earlier that there is a discrete difference between the spin-spin interaction potential in GR and mGR for a $2$-body system, akin to the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity in the static Newton's potential. Specifically, at large distances, GR favors anti-parallel spin orientation with total spin pointing along the interaction axis, while mGR favors parallel spin orientation with total spin perpendicular to the axis between the sources. For an $N$-body system, a simulation in mGR hitherto has not been done and one would like to know the total spin of the system in both theories. Here we remedy this. In the simulations of GR, we observed that the total spin tends to decrease from a random initial configuration, while for mGR with a large distance, the total spin increases.</description>

      <title>Violation of causality in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is ongoing interest in the nonmetricity formulation of gravity. The nonlinear extension of the theory, called $f(Q)$ gravity, has recently been proposed and offers a promising avenue for addressing some of the long-standing challenges in cosmology and fundamental physics. A number of solutions have already been found that have confirmed the usefulness of the theory for astrophysics and cosmology. Motivated by earlier work on G\"odel-type spacetimes we investigate whether $f(Q)$ gravity admits such cosmological solutions, which entail causality violation. In the coincident gauge, which is shown to be a legitimate gauge because the connection field equations are satisfied, we find that G\"odel-type metrics are allowed by this modified gravity theory for any function $f(Q)$. As a matter of fact, out of all G\"odel-type metrics only G\"odel's original model is compatible with $f(Q)$ gravity, implying violation of causality. The requirement that energy conditions be obeyed by the matter content leads to mild restrictions on the function $f(Q)$.</description>

      <title>From the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularities to Einstein-Maxwell phantom wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime corresponds to a static spherically symmetric solution of Einstein equations with the energy momentum tensor of a massless quintessence field. It is understood that the spacetime describes a naked singularity. The solution has two parameters, $b$ and $s$. To our knowledge, the exact physical meaning of the two parameters is still unclear. In this paper, starting from the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity solution, we first obtain a wormhole solution by a complex transformation. Then let the parameter $s$ approaching infinity, we obtain the well-known exponential wormhole solution. After that, we embed both the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity and its wormhole counterpart in the background of de Sitter or anti-de Sitter Universe with the energy momentum tensor of massive quintessence and massive phantom fields, respectively. To our surprise, the resulting quintessence potential is actually the dilaton potential found by one of us. It hints us that, by modulating the parameters in the charged dilaton black hole solutions we can get the Janis-Newman-Winicour solution. Furthermore, a charged wormhole solution is obtained by performing complex transformation on the charged dilaton black hole solutions in the background of de Sitter or anti-de Sitter Universe. We eventually find that $s$ is actually related to the coupling constant of dilaton field to Maxwell field and $b$ is related to a negative mass for the dilaton black holes. A negative black hole mass is physically forbidden. Therefore, we conclude that the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity solution is not physically allowed.</description>

      <title>The Born rule for quantum probabilities from Newton's third law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the Born rule, the probability density in quantum theory is determined by the square of the wave function. A generally accepted derivation of this rule has not yet been proposed. In the given work, a simple physical picture is constructed within which the Born rule arises in a natural way. In the proposed scheme, the interaction of a particle with a measuring apparatus is equivalent to creation of a "mirror image" of particle wave function in the space region of interaction. The observable quantity is the product of the particle wave function and its "image". The phase of the latter is reversed due to Newton's third law, thus leading to the Born rule.</description>

      <title>String condensation and topological holography for 2+1D gapless SPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of anyon condensation is the foundation of the bulk-boundary relation and topological holography in 2+1D/1+1D. It is believed string condensation should replace anyon condensation in the 3+1D/2+1D topological holography theory. In this work we study string condensations in 3+1D topological orders and their relations to 2+1D phases. We find that a class of non-Lagrangian condensable algebras in 3+1D are exactly dual to a class of 2+1D symmetry enriched gapless phases known as gapless SPTs(gSPT). We show how topological properties of a gSPT can be fully extracted from the dual string condensation. We give an algebraic classification of this class of condensable algebras in 3+1D $G$-gauge theories that we call magnetic and simple. Through the topological holography dictionary, this maps to the classification of 2+1D $G$-symmetric phases with no topological order, including gapped and gapless SPTs. Utilizing the classification, we identify three classes of gSPTs and study their properties and gauging. Along the way, we reveal physical structures of string condensations.</description>
