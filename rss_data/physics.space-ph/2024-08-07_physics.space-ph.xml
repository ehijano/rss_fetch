      <title>Toroidal modified Miller-Turner CME model in EUHFORIA: II. Validation and comparison with flux rope and spheromak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rising concerns about the impact of space weather-related disruptions demand modelling and reliable forecasting of coronal mass ejection (CME) impacts. In this study, we demonstrate the application of the modified Miller-Turner (mMT) model implemented in EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA), to forecast the geo-effectiveness of observed coronal mass ejection (CME) events in the heliosphere. The goal is to develop a model that not only has a global geometry to improve overall forecasting but is also fast enough for operational space weather forecasting. We test the original full torus implementation and introduce a new three-fourth Torus version called the Horseshoe CME model. This new model has a more realistic CME geometry, and it overcomes the inaccuracies of the full torus geometry. We constrain the torus geometrical and magnetic field parameters using observed signatures of the CMEs before, during, and after the eruption. The assessment of the model's capability to predict the most important Bz component is performed using the advanced Dynamic Time Warping technique. The Horseshoe model prediction of CME arrival time and geo-effectiveness for both validation events compare well to the observations and are weighed with the results obtained with the spheromak and FRi3D models that were already available in EUHFORIA. The runtime of the Horseshoe model simulations is close to that of the spheromak model, which is suitable for operational space weather forecasting. Yet, the capability of the magnetic field prediction at 1~AU of the Horseshoe model is close to that of the FRi3D model. In addition, we demonstrate that the Horseshoe CME model can be used for simulating successive CMEs in EUHFORIA, overcoming a limitation of the FRi3D model.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Empirical Solar Energetic Particle Scaling Relations II. Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims. The space radiation environment conditions and the maximum expected coronal mass ejection (CME) speed are being assessed through the investigation of scaling laws between the peak proton flux and fluence of Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events with the speed of the CMEs. Methods. We utilize a complete catalog of SEP events, covering the last ~25 years of CME observations (i.e. 1997 to 2017). We calculate the peak proton fluxes and integrated event fluences for those events reaching an integral energy of up to E&gt; 100 MeV, covering the period of the last ~25 years of CME observations. For a sample of 38 strong SEP events, we first investigate the statistical relations between the recorded peak proton fluxes (IP) and fluences (FP) at a set of integral energies of E &gt;10 MeV, E&gt;30 MeV, E&gt;60 MeV, and E&gt;100 MeV versus the projected CME speed near the Sun (VCME) obtained by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (SOHO/LASCO). Based on the inferred relations, we further calculate the integrated energy dependence of both IP and FP, assuming that they follow an inverse power-law with respect to energy. By making use of simple physical assumptions, we combine our derived scaling laws to estimate the upper limits for VCME, IP, and FP focusing on two cases of known extreme SEP events that occurred on February 23, 1956 (GLE05) and in AD774/775, respectively. Given physical constraints and assumptions, several options for the upper limit VCME, associated with these events, are investigated. Results. A scaling law relating IP and FP to the CME speed as V^{5}CME for CMEs ranging between ~3400-5400 km/s is consistent with values of FP inferred for the cosmogenic nuclide event of AD774/775. At the same time, the upper CME speed that the current Sun can provide possibly falls within an upper limit of VCME &lt;= 5500 km/s.</description>
