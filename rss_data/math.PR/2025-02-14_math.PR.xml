      <title>Strong completeness of SDEs and non-explosion for RDEs whose coefficients have unbounded derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a non-explosion result for rough differential equations (RDEs) in which both the noise and drift coefficients together with their derivatives are allowed to grow at infinity. Additionally, we prove the existence of a bi-continuous solution flow for stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In the case of RDEs with additive noise, we show that our result is optimal by providing a counterexample.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Waves and Edge Eigenvectors of Random Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backhausz and Szegedy (2019) demonstrated that the almost eigenvectors of random regular graphs converge to Gaussian waves with variance $0\leq \sigma^2\leq 1$. In this paper, we present an alternative proof of this result for the edge eigenvectors of random regular graphs, establishing that the variance must be $\sigma^2=1$. Furthermore, we show that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are asymptotically independent. Our approach introduces a simple framework linking the weak convergence of the imaginary part of the Green's function to the convergence of eigenvectors, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Fourier dimension of the graph of fractional Brownian motion with $H \ge 1/2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Fourier dimension of the graph of fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index greater than $1/2$ is almost surely 1. This extends the result of Fraser and Sahlsten (2018) for the Brownian motion and verifies partly the conjecture of Fraser, Orponen and Sahlsten (2014). We introduce a combinatorial integration by parts formula to compute the moments of the Fourier transform of the graph measure. The proof of our main result is based on this integration by parts formula together with Fa\`a di Bruno's formula and strong local nondeterminism of fractional Brownian motion. We also show that the Fourier dimension of the graph of a symmetric $\alpha$-stable process with $\alpha\in[1,2]$ is almost surely 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sequences of partitions of the unit interval into subintervals, starting from the trivial partition, in which each partition is obtained from the one before by splitting its subintervals in two, according to a given rule, and then merging pairs of subintervals at the break points of the old partition. The $n$th partition then comprises $n+1$ subintervals with $n$ break points, and the empirical distribution of these points reveals a surprisingly rich structure, even when the splitting rule is completely deterministic. We consider both deterministic and randomized splitting rules and study the limiting behavior of the empirical distribution of the break points, from multiple angles.</description>

      <title>Tail Profile of Bulk Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos Measures I: Bulk/Boundary Quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first part of a series of papers devoted to studying the right tail profile of a bulk Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure with uniform singularity on the boundary. We investigate the bulk/boundary quotients of Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures appearing in boundary Liouville conformal field theory, for which we establish preliminary joint moment bounds. These moment bounds will be a crucial ingredient in establishing the right tail profile of the bulk Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure in subsequent papers. The main idea is to implement the so-called localization trick at the boundary, and we also record a useful generalization of Kahane's convexity inequality, which is of independent interest. The study of the universal tail profiles of general bulk measures and bulk/boundary quotients as well as connections to integrability results of boundary Liouville conformal field theory will be pursued in subsequent papers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the behavior and establish new properties of the cumulative-sum process (CUSUM) and its running maximum. The study includes precise expressions for CUSUM's moment generating function and moments, fast recursive computing algorithms, lower and upper bounds, as well as asymptotes. Results are applied to single, multiple, and transient change-point problems, for the calculation of thresholds that provide a desired control of familywise false alarm rates, as well as the quantiles of queuing processes and probabilities of their large deviation at least once over a given time interval.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of dense kernel-based random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel-based random graphs (KBRGs) are a broad class of random graph models that account for inhomogeneity among vertices. We consider KBRGs on a discrete $d-$dimensional torus $\mathbf{V}_N$ of size $N^d$. Conditionally on an i.i.d.~sequence of weights $(W_i)_{i\in \mathbf{V}_N}$ with tail exponent $\tau-1&gt;0$, we connect any two points $i$ and $j$ on the torus with probability
  $$p_{ij}= \frac{\kappa_{\sigma}(W_i,W_j)}{\|i-j\|^{\alpha}} \wedge 1$$ for some parameter $\alpha&gt;0$ and $\kappa_{\sigma}(u,v)= (u\vee v)(u \wedge v)^{\sigma}$ for some $\sigma\in(0,\tau-1)$.
  We focus on the adjacency operator of this random graph and study its empirical spectral distribution. For $\alpha&lt;d$ and $\tau&gt;2$, we show that a non-trivial limiting distribution exists as $N\to\infty$. The corresponding measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure and we analyse its moments. The measure is given by an operator-valued semicircle law, whose Stieltjes transform is characterised by a fixed point equation in an appropriate Banach space. In the case $\sigma=1$, corresponding to the so-called scale-free percolation random graph, we can explicitly describe the limiting measure and study its tail.</description>

      <title>An Analogue of Heyde's Theorem for a Certain Class of Compact Totally Disconnected Abelian Groups and p-quasicyclic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the well-known Heyde theorem, the Gaussian distribution on the real line is characterized by the symmetry of the conditional distribution of one linear form of independent random variables given another. In the article, we study an analogue of this theorem for two independent random variables taking values either in a compact totally disconnected Abelian group of a certain class, which includes finite cyclic groups and groups of p-adic integers, or in a p-quasicyclic group. In contrast to previous works devoted to group analogues of Heyde's theorem, we do not impose any restrictions on either coefficients of linear forms (they can be arbitrary topological automorphisms of the group) or the characteristic functions of random variables. For the proof we use methods of abstract harmonic analysis.</description>

      <title>A class of point-wise operating SPDE coefficients for HJM models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamic model for forward curves within the Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework under the Musiela parametrization. The forward curves take values in a function space H, and their dynamics follows a stochastic partial differential equation with state-dependent coefficients. In particular, the coefficients are defined through point-wise operating maps on H, resulting in a locally state-dependent structure. We first explore conditions under which these point-wise operators are well defined on H. Next, we determine conditions to ensure that the resulting coefficient functions satisfy local growth and Lipschitz properties, so to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of mild solutions. The proposed model captures the behavior of the entire forward curve through a single equation, yet retains remarkable simplicity. Notably, we demonstrate that certain one-dimensional projections of the model are Markovian and satisfy a one-dimensional stochastic differential equation. This connects our Hilbert-space approach to well established models for forward contracts with fixed delivery times, for which existing formulas and numerical techniques can be applied. This link allows us to examine also conditions for maintaining positivity of the solutions. As concrete examples, we analyze Hilbert-space valued variants of an exponential model and of a constant elasticity of variance model.</description>

      <title>The Eigenfunctions of the Transfer Operator for the Dyson model in a field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent works \cite{EFMV2024} and \cite{JOP2023} have studied the spectral properties of the Dyson model in the absence of an external field. This paper is a continuation of \cite{EFMV2024} and aims to bridge the gap in the literature by investigating the Dyson model in a field.\\ In this paper, we prove that, for high temperatures or strong magnetic fields, there exists a non-negative, integrable (with respect to the unique half-line Gibbs measure) eigenfunction of the transfer operator for the Dyson model if $\alpha\in(\frac 3 2,2]$. However, unlike in the zero-magnetic-field case, this eigenfunction is not continuous.</description>

      <title>Thresholds for Reconstruction of Random Hypergraphs From Graph Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graph projection of a hypergraph is a simple graph with the same vertex set and with an edge between each pair of vertices that appear in a hyperedge. We consider the problem of reconstructing a random $d$-uniform hypergraph from its projection. Feasibility of this task depends on $d$ and the density of hyperedges in the random hypergraph. For $d=3$ we precisely determine the threshold, while for $d\geq 4$ we give bounds. All of our feasibility results are obtained by exhibiting an efficient algorithm for reconstructing the original hypergraph, while infeasibility is information-theoretic.
  Our results also apply to mildly inhomogeneous random hypergrahps, including hypergraph stochastic block models (HSBM). A consequence of our results is an optimal HSBM recovery algorithm, improving on a result of Guadio and Joshi in 2023.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of solutions to linear-quadratic mean field stochastic optimal control problems. By formulating an ergodic control framework, we characterize the convergence between the finite time horizon control problem and its ergodic counterpart. Leveraging these convergence results, we establish the turnpike property for the optimal pairs, demonstrating that solutions to the finite time horizon control problem remain exponentially close to the ergodic equilibrium except near the temporal boundaries. This result reveals the intrinsic connection between long-term dynamics and their asymptotic behavior in mean field control systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to characterize universal and multiplier interpolating sequences for de Branges-Rovnyak spaces H (b) where the defining function b is a general non-extreme rational function. Our results carry over to recently introduced higher order local Dirichlet spaces and thus generalize previously known results in classical local Dirichlet spaces. In this setting, we also investigate random interpolating sequences with prescribed radii, providing a 0 -1 law. This condition is automatic when b is rational non inner so that we can assume H (b) = M(a). By standard results in functional analysis, the corresponding norms are equivalent. In [18], the authors demonstrated that the decomposition (1) is orthogonal in the metric of M(a).</description>

      <title>Optimal rate of convergence in the vanishing viscosity for quadratic Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to provide an optimal rate of convergence in the vanishing viscosity regime for first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations with purely quadratic Hamiltonian. We show that for a globally Lipschitz-continuous terminal condition the rate is of order O($\epsilon$ log $\epsilon$), and we provide an example to show that this rate cannot be sharpened. This improves on the previously known rate of convergence O( $\sqrt$ $\epsilon$), which was widely believed to be optimal. Our proof combines techniques involving regularization by sup-convolution with entropy estimates for the flow of a suitable version of the adjoint linearized equation. The key technical point is an integrated estimate of the Laplacian of the solution against this flow. Moreover, we exploit the semiconcavity generated by the equation.</description>

Abstract: We consider the advection equation on $\mathbb{T}^2$ with a real analytic and time-periodic velocity field that alternates between two Hamiltonian shears. Randomness is injected by alternating the vector field randomly in time between just two distinct shears. We prove that, under general conditions, these models have a positive top Lyapunov exponent and exhibit exponential mixing. This framework is then applied to the Pierrehumbert model with randomized time and to a model analogous to the Chirikov standard map.</description>

      <title>Universal criterion for selective outcomes under stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resetting plays a pivotal role in optimizing the completion time of complex first passage processes with single or multiple outcomes/exit possibilities. While it is well established that the coefficient of variation -- a statistical dispersion defined as a ratio of the fluctuations over the mean of the first passage time -- must be larger than unity for resetting to be beneficial for any outcome averaged over all the possibilities, the same can not be said while conditioned on a particular outcome. The purpose of this letter is to derive a universal condition which reveals that two statistical metric -- the mean and coefficient of variation of the conditional times -- come together to determine when resetting can expedite the completion of a selective outcome, and furthermore can govern the biasing between preferential and non-preferential outcomes. The universality of this result is demonstrated for a one dimensional diffusion process subjected to resetting with two absorbing boundaries.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the theoretical properties of general diffusion (interpolation) paths and their Langevin Monte Carlo implementation, referred to as diffusion annealed Langevin Monte Carlo (DALMC), under weak conditions on the data distribution. Specifically, we analyse and provide non-asymptotic error bounds for the annealed Langevin dynamics where the path of distributions is defined as Gaussian convolutions of the data distribution as in diffusion models. We then extend our results to recently proposed heavy-tailed (Student's t) diffusion paths, demonstrating their theoretical properties for heavy-tailed data distributions for the first time. Our analysis provides theoretical guarantees for a class of score-based generative models that interpolate between a simple distribution (Gaussian or Student's t) and the data distribution in finite time. This approach offers a broader perspective compared to standard score-based diffusion approaches, which are typically based on a forward Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noising process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study isometries of $p$-Wasserstein spaces. In our first result, for every complete and separable metric space $X$ and for every $p\geq1$, we construct a metric space $Y$ such that $X$ embeds isometrically into $Y$, and the $p$-Wasserstein space over $Y$ admits mass-splitting isometries. Our second result is about embeddings into rigid constructions. We show that any complete and separable metric space $X$ can be embedded isometrically into a metric space $Y$ such that the $1$-Wasserstein space is isometrically rigid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies quantitative homogenization of elliptic equations with random, uniformly elliptic coefficients that vanish in a union of random holes. Assuming an upper bound on the size of the holes and a separation condition between them, we derive optimal bounds for the regularity radius $r_*$ and suboptimal growth estimates for the corrector. These results are key ingredients for error analysis in stochastic homogenization and serve as crucial input for recent developments in the double-porosity model, such as those by Bonhomme, Duerinckx, and Gloria (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02847).</description>

      <title>Journey from the Wilson exact RG towards the Wegner-Morris Fokker-Planck RG and the Carosso field-coarsening via Langevin stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the Wilson RG of 'incomplete integration' as a function of the RG-time $t$, the non-linear differential RG flow for the energy $E_t[\phi(.)]$ translates for the probability distribution $P_t[\phi(.)] \sim e^{- E_t[\phi(.)]} $ into the linear Fokker-Planck RG flow associated to independent non-identical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes for the Fourier modes. The corresponding Langevin stochastic differential equation for the real-space field $\phi_t(\vec x)$ can be then interpreted within the Carosso perspective as genuine infinitesimal coarsening-transformations that are the analog of spin-blocking, and whose irreversible character is essential to overcome the paradox of the naive description of the Wegner-Morris RG flow as a mere infinitesimal change of variables in the partition function integral. This interpretation suggests to consider new RG-schemes, in particular the Carosso RG where the Langevin SDE corresponds to the well known stochastic heat equation or the Edwards-Wilkinson dynamics. We stress the advantages of this stochastic formulation of exact RG flows. While statistical field theory is usually written in infinite space, we focus here on the formulation on a large volume $L^d$ with periodic boundary conditions, in order to distinguish between extensive and intensives observables while keeping the translation-invariance. Since the empirical magnetization $m_e \equiv \frac{1}{L^d} \int_{L^d} d^d \vec x \ \phi(\vec x) $ is an intensive variable corresponding to the zero-momentum Fourier coefficient of the field, its probability distribution $p_L(m_e)$ can be obtained from the gradual integration over all the other Fourier coefficients associated to non-vanishing-momenta via exact differential RG, in order to obtain the large deviation properties with respect to the volume $L^d$.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for a strongly irreducible product of independent random matrices under optimal moment assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\nu$ be a probability distribution over the semi-group of square matrices of size $d\ge2$. We assume that $\nu$ is proximal, strongly irreducible and that $\nu^{*n}\{0\}=0$ for all $n$. We consider the sequence $\overline\gamma_n:=\gamma_0\cdots\gamma_{n-1}$ for $(\gamma_k)_{k}$ independent of distribution law $\nu$. Let $s_1\ge s_2\ge\dots s_d$ be the singular values given by the Cartan projection. We show that $(\log\frac{s_1}{s_2}(\overline{\gamma}_n))_{n}$, escapes to infinity linearly and satisfies exponential large deviations inequalities below its escape rate. This is an extension the simplicity of the top Lyapunov exponent result, proven by Guivarc'h and Raugi under a first moment assumption. We also show that the image of a generic line by $\overline{\gamma}_n$ as well as its eigenspace of maximal eigenvalue both converge to the same random line $l^\infty$ at an exponential speed.
  If we moreover assume that $\nu$ is supported on the group of invertible matrices and that the push-forward distribution $N_*\nu$ is $\mathrm{L}^p$ for $N:g\mapsto\log\|g\|\|g^{-1}\|$ and for some $p&gt;0$, then we show that $-\log d(l^\infty,H)$ is uniformly $\mathrm{L}^p$ for all proper subspace $H\subset\mathbb{R}^d$. For $p=1$, we moreover show that the rescaled logarithm of each coefficient of $\overline{\gamma}_n$ almost surely converges to the top Lyapunov exponent. This is an extension of results by Benoist and Quint which were themselves improvements of historic results by Guivarc'h, Lepage and Raugi, first proven under exponential moment assumptions.
  To prove these results, we do not rely on the existence of the stationary measure nor on the existence of the Lyapunov exponent. Instead we describe an effective way to group the i.i.d. factors into i.i.d. random words that are aligned in the Cartan decomposition. We moreover have an explicit control over the moments.</description>

      <title>Branching Brownian motion versus Random Energy Model in the supercritical phase: overlap distribution and temperature susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In comparison with Derrida's REM, we investigate the influence of the so-called decoration processes arising in the limiting extremal processes of numerous log-correlated Gaussian fields. In particular, we focus on the branching Brownian motion and two specific quantities from statistical physics in the vicinity of the critical temperature. The first one is the two-temperature overlap, whose behavior at criticality is smoothened by the decoration process - unlike the one-temperature overlap which is identical - and the second one is the temperature susceptibility, as introduced by Sales and Bouchaud, which is strictly larger in the presence of decorations and diverges, close to the critical temperature, at the same speed as for the REM but with a different multiplicative constant. We also study some general decorated cases in order to highlight the fact that the BBM has a critical behavior in some sense to be made precise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper asks if the following iterative procedure approximately orthogonalizes a set of $n$ linearly independent unit vectors while preserving their span: in each iteration, access a random pair of vectors and replace one with the component perpendicular to the other, renormalized to be a unit vector.
  We provide a positive answer: any given set of starting vectors converges almost surely to an orthonormal basis of their span. We specifically argue that the $n$-volume of the parallelepiped generated by the vectors approaches 1 (i.e. the parallelepiped approaches a hypercube). If $A$ is the matrix formed by taking these vectors as columns, this volume is simply $\det(|A|)$ where $|A|=(A^*A)^{1/2}$. We show that $O(n^2\log(1/(\det(|A|)\varepsilon)))$ iterations suffice to bring ${\det(|A|)}$ above $1-\varepsilon$ with constant probability.</description>

      <title>Liouville Brownian motion and quantum cones in dimension $d &gt; 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $d &gt; 2$ and $\gamma \in (0, \sqrt{2d})$, we study the Liouville Brownian motion associated with the whole-space log-correlated Gaussian field in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We compute its spectral dimension, i.e., the short-time asymptotics of the heat kernel along the diagonal, which, in contrast to the two-dimensional case, depends on both $\gamma$ and on the thickness of the starting point. Furthermore, for even dimensions $d &gt; 2$, we show that the spherical average process of the whole-space log-correlated Gaussian field in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be identified with the integral of a stationary Gaussian Markov process of order $(d-2)/2$. Exploiting this representation, we construct the higher-dimensional analogue of the $\beta$-quantum cone for $\beta \in (-\infty, Q)$, with $Q = d/\gamma + \gamma/2$. Lastly, for $\alpha = Q - \sqrt{Q^2-4}$, we prove that the law of the $d$-dimensional $\alpha$-quantum cone is invariant under shifts along the trajectories of the associated Liouville Brownian motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified approach to establish the uniqueness of generalized conformal restriction measures with central charge $c \in (0, 1]$ in both chordal and radial cases, by relating these measures directly to the Brownian loop soup. Our method also applies to the uniqueness of the Malliavin-Kontsevich-Suhov loop measures for $c \in (0,1]$, which was recently obtained in [Baverez-Jego, arXiv:2407.09080] for all $c \leq 1$ from a CFT framework of SLE loop measures. In contrast, though only valid for $c \in (0,1]$, our approach provides additional probabilistic insights, as it directly links natural quantities of MKS measures to loop-soup observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider random walks in the form of nearest-neighbor hopping on Erdos-Renyi random graphs of finite fixed mean degree c as the number of vertices N tends to infinity. In this regime, using statistical field theory methods, we develop an analytic theory of the first return time probability distribution. The problem turns out closely related to finding the spectrum of the normalized graph Laplacian that controls the continuum time version of the nearest-neighbor-hopping random walk. In the infinite graph limit, where loops are highly improbable, the returns operate in a manner qualitatively similar to c-regular trees, and the expressions for probabilities resemble those on random c-regular graphs. Because the vertex degrees are not exactly constant, however, the way c enters the formulas differs from the dependence on the graph degree of first return probabilities on random regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Beyond Non-Degeneracy: Revisiting Certainty Equivalent Heuristic for Online Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Certainty Equivalent heuristic (CE) is a widely-used algorithm for various dynamic resource allocation problems in OR and OM. Despite its popularity, existing theoretical guarantees of CE are limited to settings satisfying restrictive fluid regularity conditions, particularly, the non-degeneracy conditions, under the widely held belief that the violation of such conditions leads to performance deterioration and necessitates algorithmic innovation beyond CE.
  In this work, we conduct a refined performance analysis of CE within the general framework of online linear programming. We show that CE achieves uniformly near-optimal regret (up to a polylogarithmic factor in $T$) under only mild assumptions on the underlying distribution, without relying on any fluid regularity conditions. Our result implies that, contrary to prior belief, CE effectively beats the curse of degeneracy for a wide range of problem instances with continuous conditional reward distributions, highlighting the distinction of the problem's structure between discrete and non-discrete settings. Our explicit regret bound interpolates between the mild $(\log T)^2$ regime and the worst-case $\sqrt{T}$ regime with a parameter $\beta$ quantifying the minimal rate of probability accumulation of the conditional reward distributions, generalizing prior findings in the multisecretary setting.
  To achieve these results, we develop novel algorithmic analytical techniques. Drawing tools from the empirical processes theory, we establish strong concentration analysis of the solutions to random linear programs, leading to improved regret analysis under significantly relaxed assumptions. These techniques may find potential applications in broader online decision-making contexts.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching: Markov Kernels, Stochastic Processes and Transport Plans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among generative neural models, flow matching techniques stand out for their simple applicability and good scaling properties. Here, velocity fields of curves connecting a simple latent and a target distribution are learned. Then the corresponding ordinary differential equation can be used to sample from a target distribution, starting in samples from the latent one. This paper reviews from a mathematical point of view different techniques to learn the velocity fields of absolutely continuous curves in the Wasserstein geometry. We show how the velocity fields can be characterized and learned via i) transport plans (couplings) between latent and target distributions, ii) Markov kernels and iii) stochastic processes, where the latter two include the coupling approach, but are in general broader. Besides this main goal, we show how flow matching can be used for solving Bayesian inverse problems, where the definition of conditional Wasserstein distances plays a central role. Finally, we briefly address continuous normalizing flows and score matching techniques, which approach the learning of velocity fields of curves from other directions.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of optimal solutions to second-order Beckmann problem through bimartingale couplings and leaf decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We completely characterise the optimal solutions for the three-marginal optimal transport problem - introduced in [K. Bolbotowski, G. Bouchitt\'e, Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality theory for the Hessian, 2024, preprint], and whose relaxation is the second-order Beckmann problem - for arbitrary pairs $\mu,\nu\in\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ of absolutely continuous measures with common barycentre such that there exists an optimal plan with absolutely continuous third marginal.
  In our work, we define the concept of bimartingale couplings for a pair of measures and establish several equivalent conditions that ensure such couplings exist. One of these conditions is that the pair is ordered according to the convex-concave order, thereby generalising the classical Strassen theorem. Another equivalent condition is that the dual problem associated with the second-order Beckmann problem attains its optimum at a $\mathcal{C}^{1,1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ function with isometric derivative.
  We prove that the problem for $\mu,\nu$ completely decomposes into a collection of simpler problems on the leaves of the $1$-Lipschitz derivative $Du$ of an optimal solution $u\in\mathcal{C}^{1,1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for the dual problem. On each such, leaf the solution is expressed in terms of bimartingale couplings between conditional measures of $\mu,\nu$, where the conditioning is defined relative to the foliation induced by $Du$.</description>
