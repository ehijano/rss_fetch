      <title>A proof of the Riemann hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.0090</link>
      <description>arXiv:0807.0090v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By studying the trace of an integral operator on a $L^2$ space of complex valued functions, we prove in this paper the positivity of Li's criterion. This implies that all nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta-function lie on the critical line.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Arrangements that Determine Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.14250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shape grammars compute over shapes which are defined in the universe $U^*$. Shapes in the universe $U^*$ are analogous to line drawings that can be physically realized in the plane. Any shape is embedded or contained in an arrangement of points and lines in the plane called, respectively, registration marks and construction lines, that satisfy special incidence laws. In this expository article, arrangements that contain shapes are studied as incidence structures and the finite geometries they give rise to are characterized. In particular, arrangements that contain shapes are distinguished into those that give rise to finite near-linear and linear spaces, and those that do not give rise to any proper form of geometry (in the strict mathematical sense). Arrangements that constitute finite geometries (near-linear and linear spaces) give an alternative characterization of determinate rules in shape grammars. This paper contributes to the body of work related to the mathematics of shapes in the area of shape grammar theory.</description>

      <title>Towards Point-Free Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this thesis we propose and study a theory of ordered locales, a type of point-free space equipped with a preorder structure on its frame of opens. It is proved that the Stone-type duality between topological spaces and locales lifts to a new adjunction between a certain category of ordered topological spaces and the newly introduced category of ordered locales.
  As an application, we use these techniques to develop point-free analogues of some common aspects from the causality theory of Lorentzian manifolds. In particular, we show that so-called indecomposable past sets in a spacetime can be viewed as the points of the locale of futures. This builds towards a point-free causal boundary construction. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of causal coverage that leads naturally to a generalised notion of Grothendieck topology incorporating the order structure. From this naturally emerges a localic notion of domain of dependence, which is generally distinct from the traditional notion in spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Representations of Real Numbers by Alternating Perron Series and Their Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the representation of real numbers by alternating Perron series ($P^-$-representation), which is a generalization of representations of real numbers by Ostrogradsky-Sierpi\'nski-Pierce series (Pierce series), alternating Sylvester series (second Ostrogradsky series), alternating L\"{u}roth series, etc. Namely, we prove the basic topological and metric properties of $P^-$-representation and find the relationship between $P$-representation and $P^-$-representation in some measure theory problems.</description>
