      <title>Fast-Slow Analysis of a Model For the Stimulation of Enzymatic Activity by a Competitive Inhibitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competitive inhibitors can, paradoxically, stimulate an enzymatic reaction at low to moderate doses. Competitive inhibition of an enzyme occurs when an inhibitor binds to the enzyme's binding site and blocks the enzyme's target molecule from binding. We recently proposed a detailed but straightforward mass action model for competitive inhibition of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) by Terazosin (TZ). The full PGK1 model has two substrates and two products which can be bound and released in either order, known as a random bi-bi mechanism. This model, with no further modification, predicts an increased reaction rate at low or moderate TZ doses, suggesting that stimulation is an intrinsic feature of competitive inhibition in enzymes with two products. This mechanism can aid in the development of novel therapies, particularly since enzyme activators are more rare and difficult to design than inhibitors. Here we propose a three-timescale reduction of that detailed model and show that the resulting rate equation retains three essential attributes of competitive inhibitor stimulation. These attributes are the biphasic dose response, the dependence on the relative rates of product dissociation from the binary and ternary complexes, and the parameter region where stimulation is possible. The resulting rate equation is a rational function which is a Monod function of each substrate, but quadratic in the denominator as a function of inhibitor dose.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network based Gene Regulatory Network Inference for Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deciphering complex gene-gene interactions remains challenging in transcriptomics as traditional methods often miss higher-order and nonlinear dependencies. This study introduces a quantum-inspired framework leveraging tensor networks (TNs) to optimally map expression data into a lower dimensional representation preserving biological locality. Using Quantum Mutual Information (QMI), a nonparametric measure natural for tensor networks, we quantify gene dependencies and establish statistical significance via permutation testing. This constructs robust interaction networks where the edges reflect biologically meaningful relationships that are resilient to random chance. The approach effectively distinguishes true regulatory patterns from experimental noise and biological stochasticity. To test the proposed method, we recover a gene regulatory network consisted of six pathway genes from single-cell RNA sequencing data comprising over $28.000$ lymphoblastoid cells. Furthermore, we unveil several triadic regulatory mechanisms. By merging quantum physics inspired techniques with computational biology, our method provides novel insights into gene regulation, with applications in disease mechanisms and precision medicine.</description>

      <title>STL-based Optimization of Biomolecular Neural Networks for Regression and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular Neural Networks (BNNs), artificial neural networks with biologically synthesizable architectures, achieve universal function approximation capabilities beyond simple biological circuits. However, training BNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we propose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define training objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL, enabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a learning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in biological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in which we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback control problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease model, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to external infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based learning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.</description>

      <title>Dominant vertices and attractors' landscape for Boolean networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous works, we introduced the notion of dominant vertices. This is a set of nodes in the underlying network whose evolution determines the whole network's dynamics after a transient time. In this paper, we focus on the case of Boolean networks. We define a reduced graph on the dominant vertices and an induced automata network on this graph, which we prove is asymptotically equivalent to the original Boolean dynamics. Asymptotic conjugacy ensures that the systems, restricted to their respective attractors, are dynamically equivalent. For a significant class of networks, the induced automata network is indeed a reduction of the original system. In these cases, the reduction, which is obtained from the structure of dominant vertices, supplies a more tractable system with the same structure of attractors as the original one. Furthermore, the structure of the induced system allows us to establish bounds on the number and period of the attractors, as well as on the reduction of the basin's sizes and transient lengths. We illustrate this reduction by considering a class of networks, which we call clover networks, whose dominant set is a singleton. To get insight into the structure of the basins of attraction of Boolean networks with a single dominant vertex, we complement this work with a numerical exploration of the behavior of a parametrized ensemble of systems of this kind.</description>
