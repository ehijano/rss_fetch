      <title>On the periodic orbits of C0-typical impulsive semiflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impulsive semiflows modeled by a Lipschitz continuous vector field and continuous impulse functions, defined over an impulsive region, are piece-wise Lipschitz continuous semiflows with piecewise smooth trajectories. In this paper we contribute to the topological description of typical impulsive semi-flows, parameterized by both vector fields and impulses. We prove that $C^0$-generic Lipschitz vector fields generate impulsive semiflows with denseness of periodic orbits on the non-wandering set. Additionally, we show that $C^0$-generic impulses generate impulsive semiflows with denseness of periodic orbits on the impulsive non-wandering set.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of an isosceles problem generated by a perturbation of Euler's collinear solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the isosceles problem resulting by a perturbation of Euler's collinear solution under Newtonian gravitational attraction of three bodies in space. After the Hamiltonian is obtained, a circumference of relative equilibria points was found. The original system was subsequently reduced to another system with two degrees of freedom, where there is now a single point of equilibrium and the linear stability and parametric stability were discussed.</description>

      <title>Distributed Observer for Descriptor Linear System: The Luenberger Observer Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the distributed observer for the descriptor linear system. Unlike centralized descriptor system observers, in the case of distributed observers, each agent either finds it difficult to independently eliminate impulses, or the observer dynamics after eliminating pulses cannot be implemented. To overcome this issue, this paper develops the structure of the distributed observer in two different scenarios, and the observer parameters are presented through a novel design. Moreover, we provide two implementation methods for distributed observer in different scenarios. As a result, each local observer has the ability to reconstruct the states of the underlying system, including its impulse phenomenon. Finally, simulation results verify the validity of our results.</description>

      <title>Global bifurcation diagrams for coercive third-degree polynomial ordinary differential equations with recurrent nonautonomous coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonautonomous bifurcation theory is a growing branch of mathematics, for the insight it provides into radical changes in the global dynamics of realistic models for many real-world phenomena, i.e., into the occurrence of critical transitions. This paper describes several global bifurcation diagrams for nonautonomous first order scalar ordinary differential equations generated by coercive third degree polynomials in the state variable. The conclusions are applied to a population dynamics model subject to an Allee effect that is weak in the absence of migration and becomes strong under a migratory phenomenon whose sense and intensity depend on a threshold in the number of individuals in the population.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Dirichlet dynamical zeta function $\eta_D(s)$ for billiard flow corresponding to several strictly convex disjoint obstacles. For large ${\rm Re}\: s$ we have $\eta_D(s) =\sum_{n= 1}^{\infty} a_n e^{-\lambda_n s}, \: a_n \in \mathbb R$ and $\eta_D$ admits a meromorphic continuation to $\mathbb C$. We obtain some conditions of the frequencies $\lambda_n$ and some sums of coefficients $a_n$ which imply that $\eta_D$ cannot be prolonged as entire function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the unit tangent bundle of noncompact finite volume negatively curved Riemannian manifolds, we prove the equidistribution towards the measure of maximal entropy for the geodesic flow of the Lebesgue measure along the divergent geodesic flow orbits, as their complexity tends to infinity. We prove the analogous result for geometrically finite tree quotients, where the equidistribution takes place in the quotient space of geodesic lines towards the Bowen-Margulis measure.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this note is to give a short proof of a result of Py\"or\"al\"a--Shmerkin--Suomala--Wu; the Sierpi\'nski carpet, and generalisations, are tube-null; they can be covered with tubes of arbitrarily small total width. We remark that a more general class of sponge-like sets satisfy this property. For a given $\epsilon &gt; 0$ the proof is able to give an explicit description of the tubes for which the total width is less than $\epsilon.$</description>

      <title>Fractional modelling of COVID-19 transmission incorporating asymptomatic and super-spreader individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges worldwide, necessitating effective modelling approaches to understand and control its transmission dynamics. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates asymptomatic and super-spreader individuals in a single compartmental model. We highlight the advantages of utilizing incommensurate fractional order derivatives in ordinary differential equations, including increased flexibility in capturing disease dynamics and refined memory effects in the transmission process. We conduct a qualitative analysis of our proposed model, which involves determining the basic reproduction number and analysing the disease-free equilibrium's stability. By fitting the proposed model with real data from Portugal and comparing it with existing models, we demonstrate that the incorporation of supplementary population classes and fractional derivatives significantly improves the model's goodness of fit. Sensitivity analysis further provides valuable insights for designing effective strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus.</description>

      <title>Turbulence modeling over riblets via domain transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical and experimental studies have demonstrated the drag-reducing potential of carefully designed streamwise-elongated riblets in lowering skin-friction drag. To support the systematic design of such surface corrugations, recent efforts have integrated simplified versions of the governing equations with innovative methods for representing the effects of rough boundaries on flow dynamics. Notably, the statistical response of the eddy-viscosity-enhanced linearized Navier-Stokes equations has been shown to effectively capture the ability of riblets in suppressing turbulence, quantify the influence of background turbulence on the mean velocity, and reproduce established drag-reduction trends. In this paper, we enhance the flexibility and computational efficiency of this simulation-free approach by implementing a domain transformation for surface representation, along with a perturbation analysis on a small geometric parameter of the riblets. While domain transformation complicates the differential equations, it provides accurate boundary representations and facilitates the analysis of complex riblet shapes at high Reynolds numbers by enabling perturbation analysis to simplify the dimensional complexity of the governing equations. Our method successfully predicts drag reduction trends for semi-circular riblets, consistent with existing literature. We further utilize our framework to investigate flow mechanisms influenced by riblets and extend our study to channel flows with friction Reynolds numbers up to 2003. Our findings reveal the emergence of Kelvin-Helmholtz rollers over large and sharp semi-circular riblets, contributing to the degradation of drag reduction in these geometries. Additionally, we examine the impact of riblets on near-wall flow structures, focusing on their suppression of streamwise-elongated structures in flows over large riblets.</description>

Abstract: The pressure function is a fundamental object in various areas of mathematics. Its regularity is studied to derive insights into phase transitions in certain physical systems or to determine the Hausdorff dimension of self-affine sets. In this paper, we prove the analyticity of the pressure function for products of non-invertible matrices satisfying an irreducibility and a contractivity assumptions. Additionally, we establish a variational principle for the pressure function, thereby generalizing previous results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is primarily focused on the asymptotic dynamics of a non-autonomous stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo system with distribution dependence, specifically on unbounded domains $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Initially, we establish the well-posedness of solutions for the FitzHugh-Nagumo system with distribution dependence by utilizing the Banach fixed-point theorem. Subsequently, we demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of pullback measure attractors for this system through the application of splitting techniques, tail-end estimates and Vitali's theorem.</description>

      <title>Stochastic volatility model with long memory for water quantity-quality dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water quantity and quality are vital indices for assessing fluvial environments. These indices are highly variable over time and include sub-exponential memory, where the influences of past events persist over long durations. Moreover, water quantity and quality are interdependent, with the former affecting the latter. However, this relationship has not been thoroughly studied from the perspective of long-memory processes, which this paper aims to address. We propose applying a new stochastic volatility model, a system of infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations, to describe dynamic asset prices in finance and economics. Although the stochastic volatility model was originally developed for phenomena unrelated to the water environment, its mathematical universality allows for an interdisciplinary reinterpretation: river discharge is analogous to volatility, and water quality to asset prices. Moreover, the model's infinite-dimensional nature enables the analytical description of sub-exponential memory. The moments and autocorrelations of the model are then obtained analytically. We mathematically analyze the stochastic volatility model and investigate its applicability to the dynamics of water quantity and quality. Finally, we apply the model to real time-series data from a river in Japan, demonstrating that it effectively captures both the memory and the correlation of water quality indices to river discharge. This approach, grounded in infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations, represents a novel contribution to the modelling and analysis of environmental systems where long memory processes play a role.</description>

      <title>Koopman Learning with Episodic Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Koopman operator theory has found significant success in learning models of complex, real-world dynamical systems, enabling prediction and control. The greater interpretability and lower computational costs of these models, compared to traditional machine learning methodologies, make Koopman learning an especially appealing approach. Despite this, little work has been performed on endowing Koopman learning with the ability to leverage its own failures. To address this, we equip Koopman methods -- developed for predicting non-autonomous time-series -- with an episodic memory mechanism, enabling global recall of (or attention to) periods in time where similar dynamics previously occurred. We find that a basic implementation of Koopman learning with episodic memory leads to significant improvements in prediction on synthetic and real-world data. Our framework has considerable potential for expansion, allowing for future advances, and opens exciting new directions for Koopman learning.</description>

      <title>Global and local minima of $\alpha$-Brjuno functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this article is to analyze some peculiar features of the global (and local) minima of $\alpha$-Brjuno functions $B_\alpha$ where $\alpha\in(0,1].$ Our starting point is the result by Balazard--Martin (2020), who showed that the minimum of $B_1$ is attained at $g:=\frac{\sqrt 5 -1}{2}$; analyzing the scaling properties of $B_1$ near $g$ we shall deduce that all preimages of $g$ under the Gauss map are also local minima for $B_1$. Next we consider the problem of characterizing global and local minima of $B_\alpha$ for other values of $\alpha$: we show that for $\alpha\in (g,1)$ the global minimum is again attained at $g$, while for $\alpha$ in a neighbourhood of $1/2$ the function $B_{\alpha}$ attains its minimum at $\gamma:=\sqrt{2}-1$. The fact that the minimum of $B_\alpha$ is attained when $\alpha$ ranges a whole interval of parameters is non trivial. Indeed, we prove that $B_{\alpha}$ is lower semicontinuous for all rational $\alpha,$ but we also exhibit an irrational $\alpha$ for which $B_{\alpha}$ is not lower semicontinuous. %We also prove that if $\alpha$ is rational then $B_{\alpha}$ is lower semicontinuous. This property does not hold in general, in fact we show that $B_{\alpha}$ is not lower semicontinuous for a suitable irrational $\alpha.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quorum sensing governs bacterial communication, playing a crucial role in regulating population behaviour. We propose a mathematical model that uncovers chaotic dynamics within quorum sensing networks, highlighting challenges to predictability. The model explores interactions between autoinducers and two bacterial subtypes, revealing oscillatory dynamics in both a constant autoinducer sub-model and the full three-component model. In the latter case, we find that the complicated dynamics can be explained by the presence of homoclinic Shilnikov bifurcations. We employed a combination of normal form analysis and numerical continuation methods to analyse the system.</description>

      <title>Marked points of families of hyperbolic automorphisms of smooth complex projective varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\pi : X\to \Lambda$ be a flat family of smooth complex projective varieties parameterized by a smooth quasi-projective variety $\Lambda$, and let $f: X\to X$ be a family of automorphisms with positive topological entropy. Suppose $\sigma : \Lambda \to X$ is a marked point, i.e., it is a rational section of $\pi$. We propose two methods to measure the stability, normality, or periodicity of the family given by $t \mapsto f_t^n(\sigma(t))$.
  First, from an algebraic perspective, we construct geometric canonical height functions that have desirable properties. Second, from an analytic viewpoint, we construct a positive closed $(1,1)$-current with continuous local potential. When $\Lambda$ is a curve, we demonstrate that these two constructions actually coincide, providing a unified approach to understanding the dynamical behavior of the family. As an application of the algebraic method, we prove a special case of the Kawaguchi-Silverman conjecture over complex function fields.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study strong spectral properties of Ruelle transfer operators related to Gibbs measures for contact Anosov flows. As a consequence we establish exponential decay of correlations for H\"older observables with respect to any Gibbs measure. The approach invented in 1997 by Dolgopyat, and further developed in our papers in 2011 and 2023, is substantially enhanced here, allowing to deal with the general case of arbitrary contact Anosov flows and arbitrary Gibbs measures. The results obtained here naturally apply to geodesic flows on compact Riemannian manifolds. The strong spectral estimates for Ruelle operators and a well-established technique by Dolgopyat lead to exponential decay of correlations for H\"older continuous potentials</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and stability of synchronized solutions in the Kuramoto model with uniformly spaced natural frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the classical Kuramoto model (KM) with natural frequencies and its continuum limit (CL), and discuss the existence of synchronized solutions and their bifurcations and stability. We specifically assume that the frequency function is symmetric and linear in the CL, so that the natural frequencies are evenly spaced in the KM. We show that in the KM, $O(2^n)$ one-parameter families of synchronized solutions are born and $O(2^n)$ {saddle-node and} pitchfork bifurcations occur at least, when the node number $n$ is odd and tends to infinity. Moreover, we prove that the family of synchronized solutions obtained in the previous work suffers a saddle-node bifurcation at which its stability changes from asymptotically stable to unstable and the other families of synchronized solutions are unstable in the KM. For the CL, we show that the one-parameter family of synchronized solutions obtained in the previous work is the only continuous one and there exist uncountably many one-parameter families of noncontinuous synchronized solutions and that the former is asymptotically stable and the latter are unstable.</description>

      <title>Almost Uniform Convergence in Noncommutative Dunford-Schwartz Ergodic Theorem for $p&gt;1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.07286v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the ergodic Ces\' aro averages generated by a positive Dunford-Schwartz operator in a noncommutative space $L^p(\mathcal M,\tau)$, $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, converge almost uniformly (in Egorov's sense). This problem goes back to the original paper of Yeadon \cite{ye}, where bilaterally almost uniform convergence of these averages was established for $p=1$.</description>

      <title>Intersection of transverse foliations in 3-manifolds: Hausdorff leafspace implies leafwise quasi-geodesic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$ be transverse two dimensional foliations with Gromov hyperbolic leaves in a closed 3-manifold $M$ whose fundamental group is not solvable, and let $\mathcal{G}$ be the one dimensional foliation obtained by intersection. We show that $\mathcal{G}$ is \emph{leafwise quasigeodesic} in $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$ if and only if the foliation $\mathcal{G}_L$ induced by $\mathcal{G}$ in the universal cover $L$ of any leaf of $\mathcal{F}_1$ or $\mathcal{F}_2$ has Hausdorff leaf space. We end up with a discussion on the hypothesis of Gromov hyperbolicity of the leaves.</description>
