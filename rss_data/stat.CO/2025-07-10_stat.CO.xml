      <title>stCEG: An R Package for Modelling Events over Spatial Areas Using Chain Event Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: stCEG is an R package which allows a user to fully specify a Chain Event Graph (CEG) model from data and to produce interactive plots. It includes functions for the user to visualise spatial variables they wish to include in the model. There is also a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) provided, increasing ease of use for those without knowledge of R. We demonstrate stCEG using a dataset of homicides in London, which is included in the package. stCEG is the first software package for CEGs that allows for full model customisation.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Spatio-Temporal Bayesian Modeling for Multivariate Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate Gaussian processes (GPs) offer a powerful probabilistic framework to represent complex interdependent phenomena. They pose, however, significant computational challenges in high-dimensional settings, which frequently arise in spatial-temporal applications. We present DALIA, a highly scalable framework for performing Bayesian inference tasks on spatio-temporal multivariate GPs, based on the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximations. Our approach relies on a sparse inverse covariance matrix formulation of the GP, puts forward a GPU-accelerated block-dense approach, and introduces a hierarchical, triple-layer, distributed memory parallel scheme. We showcase weak scaling performance surpassing the state-of-the-art by two orders of magnitude on a model whose parameter space is 8$\times$ larger and measure strong scaling speedups of three orders of magnitude when running on 496 GH200 superchips on the Alps supercomputer. Applying DALIA to air pollution data from northern Italy over 48 days, we showcase refined spatial resolutions over the aggregated pollutant measurements.</description>

      <title>Solving the Constrained Random Disambiguation Path Problem via Lagrangian Relaxation and Graph Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a resource-constrained variant of the Random Disambiguation Path (RDP) problem, a generalization of the Stochastic Obstacle Scene (SOS) problem, in which a navigating agent must reach a target in a spatial environment populated with uncertain obstacles. Each ambiguous obstacle may be disambiguated at a (possibly) heterogeneous resource cost, subject to a global disambiguation budget. We formulate this constrained planning problem as a Weight-Constrained Shortest Path Problem (WCSPP) with risk-adjusted edge costs that incorporate probabilistic blockage and traversal penalties. To solve it, we propose a novel algorithmic framework-COLOGR-combining Lagrangian relaxation with a two-phase vertex elimination (TPVE) procedure. The method prunes infeasible and suboptimal paths while provably preserving the optimal solution, and leverages dual bounds to guide efficient search. We establish correctness, feasibility guarantees, and surrogate optimality under mild assumptions. Our analysis also demonstrates that COLOGR frequently achieves zero duality gap and offers improved computational complexity over prior constrained path-planning methods. Extensive simulation experiments validate the algorithm's robustness across varying obstacle densities, sensor accuracies, and risk models, consistently outperforming greedy baselines and approaching offline-optimal benchmarks. The proposed framework is broadly applicable to stochastic network design, mobility planning, and constrained decision-making under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Differential Equation-Constrained Local Regression for Data with Sparse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local polynomial regression of order one or higher often performs poorly in areas with sparse data. In contrast, local constant regression tends to be more robust in these regions, although it is generally the least accurate approach, especially near the boundaries of the data. Incorporating information from differential equations, which may approximately or exactly hold, is one way of extending the sparse design capacity of local constant regression while reducing bias and variance. A nonparametric regression method that exploits first-order differential equations is studied in this paper and applied to noisy mouse tumour growth data. Asymptotic biases and variances of kernel estimators using Taylor polynomials with different degrees are discussed. Model comparison is performed for different estimators through simulation studies under various scenarios that simulate exponential-type growth.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Generalized Nonlinear Models Offer Basis Free SINDy With Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) has become a standard methodology for inferring governing equations of dynamical systems from observed data using statistical modeling. However, classical SINDy approaches rely on predefined libraries of candidate functions to model nonlinearities, which limits flexibility and excludes robust uncertainty quantification. This paper proposes Bayesian Generalized Nonlinear Models (BGNLMs) as a principled alternative for more flexible statistical modeling. BGNLMs employ spike-and-slab priors combined with binary inclusion indicators to automatically discover relevant nonlinearities without predefined basis functions. Moreover, BGNLMs quantify uncertainty in selected bases and final model predictions, enabling robust exploration of the model space. In this paper, the BGNLM framework is applied to several three-dimensional (3D) SINDy problems.</description>

      <title>Protecting Classifiers From Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.08705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multiple domains such as malware detection, automated driving systems, or fraud detection, classification algorithms are susceptible to being attacked by malicious agents willing to perturb the value of instance covariates to pursue certain goals. Such problems pertain to the field of adversarial machine learning and have been mainly dealt with, perhaps implicitly, through game-theoretic ideas with strong underlying common knowledge assumptions. These are not realistic in numerous application domains in relation to security and business competition. We present an alternative Bayesian decision theoretic framework that accounts for the uncertainty about the attacker's behavior using adversarial risk analysis concepts. In doing so, we also present core ideas in adversarial machine learning to a statistical audience. A key ingredient in our framework is the ability to sample from the distribution of originating instances given the, possibly attacked, observed ones. We propose an initial procedure based on approximate Bayesian computation usable during operations; within it, we simulate the attacker's problem taking into account our uncertainty about his elements. Large-scale problems require an alternative scalable approach implementable during the training stage. Globally, we are able to robustify statistical classification algorithms against malicious attacks.</description>

      <title>Mask-Guided Attention U-Net for Enhanced Neonatal Brain Extraction and Image Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce MGA-Net, a novel mask-guided attention neural network, which extends the U-net model for precision neonatal brain imaging. MGA-Net is designed to extract the brain from other structures and reconstruct high-quality brain images. The network employs a common encoder and two decoders: one for brain mask extraction and the other for brain region reconstruction. A key feature of MGA-Net is its high-level mask-guided attention module, which leverages features from the brain mask decoder to enhance image reconstruction. To enable the same encoder and decoder to process both MRI and ultrasound (US) images, MGA-Net integrates sinusoidal positional encoding. This encoding assigns distinct positional values to MRI and US images, allowing the model to effectively learn from both modalities. Consequently, features learned from a single modality can aid in learning a modality with less available data, such as US. We extensively validated the proposed MGA-Net on diverse datasets from varied clinical settings and neonatal age groups. The metrics used for assessment included the DICE similarity coefficient, recall, and accuracy for image segmentation; structural similarity for image reconstruction; and root mean squared error for total brain volume estimation from 3D ultrasound images. Our results demonstrate that MGA-Net significantly outperforms traditional methods, offering superior performance in brain extraction and segmentation while achieving high precision in image reconstruction and volumetric analysis. Thus, MGA-Net represents a robust and effective preprocessing tool for MRI and 3D ultrasound images, marking a significant advance in neuroimaging that enhances both research and clinical diagnostics in the neonatal period and beyond.</description>
