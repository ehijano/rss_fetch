      <title>When inflationary perturbations refuse to classicalise: the role of non-Gaussianity in Wigner negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflationary perturbations are quantum in origin. Yet, when computing cosmological observables, they are often treated as classical stochastic fields. Do they nevertheless retain quantum birthmarks? A hallmark of genuinely quantum behaviour is quantum interferences, arising from phase coherence between distinct branches of the wavefunction. Such interference is diagnosed by the non-positivity of the Wigner function, and according to Hudson's theorem, the only pure states with positive Wigner functions are Gaussian states. Consequently, any departure from Gaussianity necessarily implies a non-positive Wigner function, precluding a description in terms of a classical distribution. This motivates us to compute the Wigner function of curvature perturbations, accounting for primordial non-Gaussianities, using the EFT of inflation. We find that the Wigner function develops pronounced interference fringes on super-Hubble scales, and in particular, its negativity grows as $a^2$ in ultra-slow-roll backgrounds. These results demonstrate that quantum effects can remain significant at late times, and that squeezing alone does not ensure classicality, contrary to standard lore. This suggests that the prospects for detecting genuinely quantum signatures of the universe's origins in cosmological observables may be less bleak than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Modified Teleparallel $f(T)$ Gravity, DESI BAO and the $H_0$ Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether late-time modifications of gravity in the teleparallel framework can impact the current tension in the Hubble constant $H_0$, focusing on $f(T)$ cosmology as a minimal and well-controlled extension of General Relativity. We consider three representative $f(T)$ parametrisations that recover the teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity at early times and deviate from it only at late epochs. The models are confronted with unanchored Pantheon+ Type~Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, compressed Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, and redshift-space distortion data, allowing us to jointly probe the background expansion and the growth of cosmic structures. Two of the three models partially shift the inferred value of $H_0$ towards local measurements, while the third worsens the discrepancy. This behaviour is directly linked to the effective torsional dynamics, with phantom-like regimes favouring higher $H_0$ and quintessence-like regimes producing the opposite effect. A global statistical comparison shows that the minimal $f(T)$ extensions considered here are not favoured over $\Lambda$CDM by the combined data. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that late-time torsional modifications can non-trivially redistribute current cosmological tensions among the background and growth sectors.</description>

      <title>Scattering sections from regular black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we investigate the scattering cross sections of black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM). We present both the classical and semi-classical scattering cross sections for different values of the parameter that characterizes the PFDM contribution. Our results show that the presence of dark matter increases the classical scattering cross section and modifies the width of the interference fringes in the semi-classical regime. In addition, the scattering cross section is also computed using the partial wave method for the black holes considered, exhibiting similar qualitative behavior. These findings suggest that the effects of dark matter surrounding black holes may play an important role in black holes phenomenology, particularly in certain regions near the black hole.</description>

      <title>Photon-graviton polarization entanglement induced by a classical electromagnetic wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the photon-graviton pair production induced by the propagation of a classical electromagnetic (EM) wave in a Minkowskian spacetime. In our model, the gravitational field is described in terms of the quantized graviton field, whereas the electromagnetic field is split into a classical drive (a linearly or circularly polarized electromagnetic wave) and a quantum fluctuation field. We analyze the time evolution of the quantum state showing that, among other outcomes, the propagation of the EM wave can generate Bell states in the photon-graviton polarization basis. We finally discuss the possibility to observe entangled photons in artificial and natural scenarios.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the energy-momentum squared gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we have revisited the energy-momentum squared gravity theory, by taking into account the second derivative of the matter Lagrangian with respect to the metric, encapsulating relations originated from thermodynamical grounds. After obtaining the scalar tensor representation of the energy-momentum squared gravity with the new corrections, we have analyzed the physical implications by relying on the linear stability theory. The results show that the current cosmological system is compatible with the expansion of the Universe for some specific matter Lagrangians, explaining the emergence of matter domination era, approaching the late time accelerated expansion era close to the de-Sitter phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Grey-body factors of higher dimensional regular black holes in quasi-topological theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study grey-body factors and Hawking radiation of higher-dimensional regular black holes arising in quasi-topological gravity. These spacetimes incorporate infinite-curvature corrections that remove the central singularity while preserving an event horizon and a well-defined semiclassical description. We show that, for all considered regular black hole models, the transmission of radiation and the corresponding Hawking evaporation are significantly suppressed compared to the singular black hole solutions of General Relativity.</description>

      <title>A Maximum Entropy Conjecture for Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The final state of a binary black hole merger is predicted with high precision by numerical relativity, but could there be a simple thermodynamic principle within general relativity that governs the selection of the remnant? Using post-Newtonian relations between the mass M (including the binding energy) and angular momentum J of quasi-circular, nonspinning binaries, we uncover a puzzling result: When the binary's instantaneous M and J are mapped to those of a hypothetical Kerr black hole, the corresponding entropy exhibits a maximum during the evolution. This maximum occurs at values of M and J strikingly close to those of the final remnant predicted by numerical relativity. Consistent behavior is observed when using the relation between M and J obtained from numerical relativity evolution. Although this procedure is somewhat ad hoc, the agreement between the masses and spins of the final state obtained from numerical relativity and the results of this maximum entropy procedure is remarkable, with agreement to within a few percent when using either post-Newtonian or numerical relativity results for M and J. These findings allow us to propose an entropy maximization conjecture for binary black hole mergers, hinting that thermodynamic principles may govern the selection of the final black hole state.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Stability of Ultraspinning Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraspinning black holes have attracted considerable attention due to their super-entropic nature, and previous analyses -- mostly restricted to neutral cases and high-temperature regimes -- have suggested that such black holes are always thermodynamically unstable. In this work, we revisit the thermodynamic stability of ultraspinning black holes by performing a systematic analysis of the heat capacity in different ensembles over the full range of the horizon radius $r_H$, which were missed in earlier temperature-based analyses. We demonstrate for the first time that, contrary to earlier claims, ultraspinning black holes can admit thermodynamically stable regions, whose existence crucially depends on the spacetime dimension, the solution branch, and the presence of charge. In addition, we present the first application of the revised reverse isoperimetric inequality to ultraspinning black holes. Despite the violation of the original reverse isoperimetric inequality in this super-entropic regime, we find that the revised inequality remains applicable and imposes nontrivial constraints on the allowed parameter space, including an upper bound on the ultraspinning parameter $\mu$, strengthened lower bounds on the mass $m$, and upper bounds on both the charge $q$ and the AdS radius $l$. To ensure the consistency of the thermodynamic description, the conserved charges and the first law in the ultraspinning limit are derived using the Iyer-Wald formalism together with integrability conditions.</description>

      <title>Holographic Dark Energy as a Source for Wormholes in Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traversable wormhole solutions are explored in $f(\mathcal{R},\mathbb{T})$ gravity, a curvature--matter extension in which $\mathcal{R}$ is the Ricci scalar and $\mathbb{T}$ denotes the trace of the energy--momentum tensor. To generate explicit wormhole models, we prescribe holographic dark-energy densities based on entropy formalism proposed by R\'enyi, Moradpour, and Bekenstein--Hawking, namely \[ \rho_{\textit{R}} = \frac{\alpha}{4\alpha_1 r^4 c^2 \kappa}\ln\!\left(1+\pi \alpha_1 r^2\right), \qquad \rho_{\textit{M}} = \frac{\alpha}{4\pi r^2 c^2 \kappa \left(\pi \alpha_1 r^2 + 1\right)}, \qquad \rho_{\textit{BH}} = \frac{\alpha}{4 c^2 \kappa r^2}, \] with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carrying dimensions of $L^{-2}$. The corresponding shape functions obtained from the field equations satisfy the standard throat and flare-out requirements for traversability. We then study how varying $\alpha$ and $\beta$ affects (i) the balance of forces associated with equilibrium and (ii) the status of the energy conditions. In particular, the null energy condition is found to be violated, indicating that exotic matter (or an effective exotic sector) is required to support the wormhole geometry. The spatial structure of the solutions is further visualized through embedding surfaces.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Corrections to Scalar Field Effective Action in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the one-loop effective action for a test scalar field in a general Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background, specifically focusing on quantum corrections up to the second order in the interaction strength. By employing the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we derive the equation of motion for the field expectation value, which incorporates not only the standard local radiative corrections but also novel nonlocal features: a memory term and a stochastic noise term. We identify all ultraviolet divergent structures within these nonlocal terms and provide a consistent renormalization procedure. To analyze the physical impact of these terms, we apply a local approximation under the assumption of slowly-varying fields, by which the memory term acts as a negative contribution to the drift coefficient. As a concrete application, we consider a massive $\phi^4$ theory and show that these one-loop corrections lead to a suppression of the field variance in the infrared regime compared to the tree-level results.</description>

      <title>Geometric Selection Rules for Singularity Formation in Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the polynomial degeneracies of curvature invariants can act as geometric selection rules for spacetime singularities in modified theories of gravity. The degeneracies arise purely from the algebraic structure of Riemannian geometry and impose non-trivial constraints on the effective energy-momentum tensor. We derive these constraints for metric $f(R)$ gravity and a wide class of scalar-tensor theories to show that a singularity formation is generally occluded by curvature and/or scalar-induced anisotropies. Therefore, formation of a singularity in modified theories of gravity is not always a generic outcome but can occur only along algebraically admissible branches selected by Riemannian curvature invariants.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Dynamics of Hyperbolic Evolution Models in $f(Q,L_m)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper highlights cosmologically viable sine and cosine hyperbolic evolution functions in the framework of $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_m)$ gravity. The models have been tested to check the behavior of the equation of state (EoS) parameter under the variation of parametric values. The EoS parameter experiences a quintessence phase, and is approaching to $-1$ at late time. The models are showing inclined behaviour with the $\Lambda$CDM model at the late time. The viability of both the models is retested using the widely accepted energy conditions in both cases. The violation of the strong energy condition admits the accelerating behaviour of the models. The same has been explained through the analysis of the profile of deceleration parameter, which concretely supports the evidence that the models explain early deceleration to late time acceleration phenomena.</description>

      <title>Scalar-tensor-vector gravity theory is tested by black hole photon rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the photon ring and shadow structure of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the scalar-tensor-vector gravitational framework. The black hole is characterized by the ( MOG) parameter (\alpha) and the charge (Q). The study finds that as (\alpha) increases, the event horizon radius (r_h), photon sphere radius (r_{ph}), and critical impact parameter (b_{ph}) all increase, while these decrease as (Q) increases. The innermost stable circular orbit radius (r_{isco}) exhibits similar monotonic behavior. Ray-tracing shows that as (Q) increases, the impact parameter (b) interval between the lensing ring and photon ring widens; (b_{\text{ph}}) is non-degenerate, and the photon ring radius is uniquely determined by (\alpha) and (Q). Using $EHT$ constraints on (SgrA^*) and (M87^*), the bounds on (\alpha) and (Q) are derived. For (Q = 0), (0.5), and (1), the allowed ranges are (\alpha \in [0, 0.06]), ([0, 0.11]), and ([0.19, 0.36]), respectively. Radiative simulations show that for fixed (Q), larger (\alpha) leads to a larger, non-degenerate photon ring. The Schwarzschild case is approached only when both (\alpha) and (Q) are small. This provides a computational basis for testing modified black holes and offers a non-degenerate observational criterion for distinguishing quantum gravity models, consistent with current $EHT$ data. Future observations with $ngEHT$ and multi-band polarization can further test this. The results suggest that studying the photon ring structure of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in scalar-tensor-vector gravity provides a unique optical diagnostic for potential quantum-gravity tests and black hole properties.</description>

      <title>Towards Claiming a Detection of Gravitational Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational memory is a zero-frequency effect associated with a permanent change in the asymptotic spacetime metric induced by radiation. While its universal manifestation is a net change of proper distances, gravitational-wave detectors are intrinsically insensitive to the final offset and can only probe the associated transition. A central challenge for any claim of detection therefore lies in defining a physically meaningful and operationally robust model of this time-dependent signal, which is uniquely attributable to gravitational memory and distinguishable from purely oscillatory radiation. In this work, we propose a general solution to this challenge. Building on a self-contained review of the theory of gravitational memory, we discuss a theoretical framework for defining and modeling a gravitational memory rise, in particular applicable to compact binary coalescences. Specializing to space-based detectors, we analyze the response of LISA to gravitational radiation including a memory contribution, with particular emphasis on mergers of supermassive black hole binaries, which offer the most promising prospects for a first single-event detection. The framework developed here provides the theoretical foundation for statistically well-defined hypothesis testing between memory-free and memory-full radiation and quantitative assessments of detection prospects. As such, these results establish a principled pathway toward a future observational claim of gravitational memory.</description>

      <title>Causal spinfoam vertex for 4d Lorentzian quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new causal spinfoam vertex for $4$d Lorentzian quantum gravity. The causal data are encoded in Toller $T$-matrices, which add to Wigner $D$-matrices $T^{(+)}+T^{(-)}=D$, and for which we provide a Feynman $\mathrm{i}\varepsilon$ representation. We discuss how the Toller poles cancel in the EPRL vertex, how the Livine-Oriti model is obtained in the Barrett-Crane limit, and how spinfoam causal data are distinct from Regge causal data. In the large-spin limit, we show that only Lorentzian Regge geometries with causal data compatible with the spinfoam data are selected, resulting in a single exponential $\exp(+\mathrm{i}\, S_{\mathrm{Regge}}/\hbar)$ and a new form of causal rigidity.</description>

      <title>Detectability of Gravitational-Wave Memory with LISA: A Bayesian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy opens a new venue to explore the universe. Future observatories such as LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are expected to observe previously undetectable fundamental physics effects in signals predicted by General Relativity (GR).One particularly interesting such signal is associated to the displacement memory effect, which corresponds to a permanent deformation of spacetime due to the passage of gravitational radiation. In this work, we explore the ability of LISA to observe and characterize this effect. In order to do this, we use state-of-the-art simulations of the LISA instrument, and we perform a Bayesian analysis to assess the detectability and establish general conditions to claim detection of the displacement memory effect from individual massive black hole binary (MBHB) merger events in LISA. We perform parameter estimation both to explore the impact of the displacement memory effect and to reconstruct its amplitude. We discuss the precision at which such a reconstruction can be obtained thus opening the way to tests of GR and alternative theories. To provide astrophysical context, we apply our analysis to black hole binary populations models and estimate the rates at which the displacement memory effect could be observed within the LISA planned lifetime.</description>

      <title>Slow-roll approximations for Gauss-Bonnet inflation revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our paper we consider the validity of slow-roll approximations for Gauss-Bonnet inflation introduced in [1]. In contrast to the cited paper where the coupling function before the Gauss-Bonnet term have been chosen as a decaying function of the scalar field, here we consider growing coupling functions. We have found that while in [1] new slow-roll approximations work considerably better, now they do not increase the precision. Moreover, we identify some cases where more involved approximations work worse than the standard one. Corresponding explanations of such a situation are given.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Constraints on Cosmology and Modified Gravitational-wave Propagation by Strongly Lensed Gravitational Waves Associating with Galaxy Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational wave (GW) will become the next frontier in studying cosmology and gravity. While time-delay cosmography using quadruply lensed GW events associated with optical images of the lens systems can provide precise measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), they are considered to be much rarer than doubly lensed events. In this work, we analyze time-delay cosmography with doubly lensed GW events for the first time. We generate mock doubly lensed GW events with designed sensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O5 network, with LIGO post-O5 upgrade, and with Einstein Telescope (ET) + Cosmic Explorer (CE) respectively, and select the events that can be associated with future galaxy surveys. Over 1000 realizations, we find an average of 0.2(2.4) qualified events with the LVK O5(post-O5) network. Whereas with the ET+CE network, we find an average of 73.2 qualified events over 100 realizations. Using the Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) lens model, we jointly estimate waveform parameters and the impact parameter with doubly lensed GW signals, and then forecast the constraints on cosmological parameters and modified GW propagation by combining time-delay cosmography and the standard siren approach. The average posterior gives a constraint on $H_0$ with a relative uncertainty of $14\%$, $10\%$ and $0.42\%$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model for the LVK O5, LVK post-O5, and ET+CE network, respectively. While the LVK network gives uninformative constraints on the $(w_0,w_a)$ dynamical dark energy model, the ET+CE network yields a moderate constraint of $w_0=-1.02^{+0.31}_{-0.22}$ and $w_a=0.48^{+0.99}_{-1.54}$. In addition, our method can provide precise constraints on modified GW propagation effects jointly with $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Isotropic Equivalence of STVG--MOG and $\Lambda$CDM and Its Breakdown in Large--Scale Anisotropic Cosmological Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) is observationally equivalent to the standard model $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model for all probes that depend on isotropic and linear gravitational dynamics, including galaxy rotation curves, cluster lensing, the linear matter power spectrum P(k), $\sigma_8$, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This degeneracy arises from the scale-dependent effective gravitational coupling $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$, which ensures identical background evolution, transfer functions, and linear growth. Consequently, all early-universe, low and intermediate scale cosmological observables are equally well described by STVG-MOG without invoking non-baryonic dark matter. We argue that the equivalence implies that isotropic cosmological data alone cannot establish the physical existence of dark matter. The degeneracy is broken only by observables sensitive to large-scale, anisotropic gravitational response. In particular, recent measurements of enhanced radio-galaxy and quasar number-count dipoles at gigaparsec scales probe a regime where $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$ departs from its $\Lambda$CDM limit, allowing STVG-MOG to generate anisotropic bulk flows, while preserving consistency with all isotropic constraints. These observations provide a concrete pathway for empirically distinguishing modified gravity from particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>Subsolar mass black holes from stellar collapse induced by primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While no gravitational-wave detection of subsolar mass black holes has been confirmed to date, a number of candidate detections invite us to speculate on the origin of such black holes should a detection be confirmed. It is generally assumed that the observation of a black hole with subsolar mass $M_{\rm obs}$ would provide strong evidence for primordial black holes (PBHs). The mass $M_{\rm PBH}$ of the PBH, however, does not necessarily have to be equal to $M_{\rm obs}$, as it would in what we term a ``direct PBH scenario". Instead, a black hole of mass $M_{\rm obs}$ may form in a capture of a much smaller primordial black hole, $M_{\rm PBH} \ll M_{\rm obs}$, by a dwarf star of mass $M_* \simeq M_{\rm obs}$, followed by the total consumption of the star by the PBH. We provide some rough estimates and demonstrate that such an ``indirect PBH scenario" may also lead to significant populations of black holes with mass $M_{\rm obs}$, especially in dwarf galaxies, and may be able to explain rare subsolar mass events.</description>

      <title>Hairy black hole solutions in nonlocal quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hairy black hole solutions are constructed within quantum-inspired nonlocal quadratic gravity. Nonlocal effects induce Yukawa screening, which shifts the event horizon inward and modifies both the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy and the Hawking temperature, while also renormalizing the chemical potential. Nonlocal corrections also reduce the magnitude of the negative specific heat, making small hairy black holes more stable, with Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies consistent with the absence of first-order phase transitions. The nonlocal spin-2 propagator contains, in addition to the massless graviton, a massive pole with positive residue and positive norm. Consequently, hairy black holes in nonlocal quadratic gravity are free of ghost instabilities at the quadratic and classical levels, in the effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Constructing a gravitational wave analysis pipeline for extremely large mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremely large mass-ratio inspirals (XMRIs), consisting of a brown dwarf orbiting a supermassive black hole, emit long-lived and nearly monochromatic gravitational waves in the millihertz band and constitute a promising probe of strong-field gravity and black-hole properties. However, dedicated data-analysis pipelines for XMRI signals have not yet been established. In this work, we develop, for the first time, a hierarchical semi-coherent search pipeline for XMRIs tailored to space-based gravitational-wave detectors, with a particular focus on the TianQin mission. The pipeline combines a semi-coherent multi-harmonic $\mathcal{F}$-statistic with particle swarm optimization, and incorporates a novel eccentricity estimation method based on the relative power distribution among harmonics. We validate the performance of the pipeline using simulated TianQin data for a Galactic center XMRI composed of a brown dwarf and Sgr A*. For a three-month observation, the pipeline successfully recovers the signal and achieves high-precision parameter estimation, including fractional uncertainties of $&lt;10^{-6}$ in the orbital frequency, $\lesssim10^{-3}$ in the eccentricity, $\lesssim2\times10^{-3}$ in the black-hole mass, and $\lesssim10^{-3}$ in the black-hole spin. Our framework establishes a practical foundation for future XMRI searches with space-based detectors and highlights the potential of XMRIs as precision probes of stellar dynamics and strong-field gravity in the vicinity of supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Chaos in the near-horizon dynamics of the dyonic $\rm{AdS_4}$-Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the chaos in the dynamics of a probe massless particle confined by the harmonic potential near the horizon of the dyonic $\rm{AdS_4}$-Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. The total energy of the particle, chemical potential and magnetic field in this system serving as independently adjustable parameters tune nonlinearity and phase-space structure. By analyzing the trajectories on the Poincar\'e section and evaluating the Lyapunov exponents, we obtain the dynamical phase diagrams of the chaos and find their counteracting regulatory role: at low energy, chaos is enhanced and the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L$ violates its upper bound (i.e. surface gravity) in the extremal black hole limit(combined paramete $\Gamma=3$); at high energy, the same extremal limit suppresses chaos, with $\lambda_L$ dropping to zero and a regular dynamical corridor emerging along $\Gamma=3$ in the dynamical phase diagrams. These results establish a direct mapping between black hole thermodynamics and microscopic chaos, offering new insights into the AdS/QCD correspondence and nonlinear dynamics in strongly curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of magnetoviscous warped discs around compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion discs that are tilted with respect to their compact hosts can warp out-of-plane through general relativistic frame-dragging. Warp influences disc dynamics in ways that have been studied extensively, especially as regards instabilities that might lead to rapid angular-momentum cancellation between neighbouring rings of fluid and mass infall. We provide a review of warped-disc phenomena here, revisiting key hydrodynamical assumptions that impact calculations of the shear viscosity controlling instability thresholds. Relativistic effects at the level of gas-parcel orbits are included, as are external Lorentz forces applied by the compact primary's magnetic field. Semi-analytic analysis reveals that intense magnetic fields can bring about new branches of warp modes and avoided crossings that significantly reduce the perpendicular viscosity at sub-Eddington accretion rates. Critical strengths required for misaligned torques to tear a thin disc may thus relax for systems like neutron star X-ray binaries or radio-loud active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Undecidability in Spacetime Geometry via the AdS/CFT Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Undecidability, a hallmark of G\"odel incompleteness theorems, has recently emerged in quantum many-body physics through the spectral gap problem. We demonstrate how this logical limitation can be holographically transmitted to a class of gravitational theories via the AdS/CFT correspondence. By embedding a translationally invariant spin Hamiltonian with undecidable gap status into a large-N gauge theory, we generate an AdS dual in which the selection of dominant bulk saddle (Poincar\'e AdS or AdS soliton) is itself undecidable. Consequently, under standard semiclassical holographic assumptions, even determining which smooth spacetime geometry emerges from quantum gravity can be beyond the limits of computability.</description>

      <title>The Bondi universe: How negative mass drives the cosmological expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a new cosmological coincidence that parallels the well-known matter/dark-energy coincidence: the present-epoch transition of the universe from a weakly coupled (collisionless) to a strongly coupled (collisional) gravitational regime. Within a cosmological model containing equal amounts of positive and negative Bondi masses -- consistent with the weak equivalence principle and momentum conservation -- we show that this coupling transition naturally coincides with the shift from a coasting to an accelerating expansion. A linear response analysis of the corresponding Vlasov-Poisson system reveals that mixed positive-negative mass configurations are always unstable, with growth rates that increase at shorter wavelengths, thereby driving the system toward strong coupling. Using long-time, exact one-dimensional N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the universe undergoes three successive expansion phases: an initial ballistic regime, an intermediate random-walk acceleration driven by sporadic Bondi encounters, and finally a uniformly accelerating phase triggered by the formation of stable positive/negative mass pairs. The onset of this last phase occurs precisely when the coupling parameter crosses unity, linking the two cosmological coincidences through a single dynamical mechanism. These results suggest that cosmic acceleration may arise from the nonlinear dynamics of a gravitationally neutral mixed-mass universe, without invoking dark energy or a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Exact black holes and black branes with bumpy horizons supported by superfluid pions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present exact solutions of the Einstein-$SU(2)$ non-linear sigma model in $3+1$ spacetime dimensions, describing bumpy black holes and black branes. Using an Ansatz for superfluid pion multi-vortices, the matter sector reduces to a first-order BPS system, while the Einstein equations reduce to a Liouville equation with a smooth source governing the horizon deformation. These solutions describe horizons of different constant curvatures, with nontrivial bumpy geometries protected by an integer topological invariant, namely the vorticity, which also controls the number of bumps and the black hole thermodynamics. Remarkably, such horizons arise in a minimal and physically motivated matter model, without invoking exotic fields or modified gravity. The physical implications of these results in holography and astrophysics are briefly described.</description>

      <title>Relational de Sitter State Counting with an SU(3) Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Maldacena's observer-centric formulation of de~Sitter physics \cite{Maldacena:2024spf}, we develop an observer-dependent state-counting framework in Euclidean de~Sitter space by modeling the observer as a massive equatorial worldline carrying an SU(3) clock. Starting from the gauge-fixed graviton path integral on $S^D$, we trace the one-loop phase $\ii^{D+2}$ to a finite set of scalar and conformal Killing modes and show that, once the worldline is included, the $(D-1)$ transverse negative modes cancel the corresponding $(D-1)$ conformal Killing directions mode by mode. The residual fixed-$\beta$ phase from the global conformal factor and reparametrizations is removed by imposing the Hamiltonian constraint $H_{\text{patch}} - H_{\text{clock}} - \nu = 0$ via a Bromwich inverse Laplace transform, which under explicit complete-monotonicity assumptions yields a real and positive microcanonical density. We stress that this positivity statement is conditional on Assumptions (A1)--(A3) and is established at one loop about the round $S^D$ saddle in the probe regime $G E_{\rm clock}/R\ll 1$; a self-consistent backreacting or higher-loop extension is a natural next step. In earlier work \cite{Ali:2025wld,Ali:2024rnw} we argued that unbroken SU(3) confinement at $T\to 0$ can account for the observed value of the cosmological constant and for the origin of the fundamental constants $(\hbar,G,c)$ as effective couplings fixed by the SU(3) vacuum structure; this makes SU(3) the natural candidate for the internal clock of de~Sitter, whose radius and temperature are themselves set by the same cosmological constant. This idea is implemented with three explicit SU(3) realizations (qutrit, Cartan weight-lattice, and $U(1)^2$ rotor), for which the observer-inclusive density of states factorizes into a universal gravity factor, a universal worldline residue, and a clock-dependent SU(3) weight.</description>

      <title>One loop photon-graviton mixing in an electromagnetic field: Part 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon-graviton conversion in an electromagnetic field is a well-known prediction of Einstein-Maxwell theory. First discussed at tree-level by Gertsenshtein in 1962, more recently it has been shown to lead to magnetic dichroism starting from one-loop. While previously only two diagrams were assumed to contribute to this one-loop photon-graviton amplitude in a constant electromagnetic field, here we point out the existence of a third one involving a tadpole subdiagram. As shown by H. Gies and one of the authors in 2016 for the pure QED case, such diagrams cannot be omitted in general even though the tadpole formally vanishes. After a short review of the calculation of one-loop photon-graviton amplitudes in the worldline formalism, we use this formalism for a unified calculation of all three diagrams. Although phenomenologically this amplitude is mainly of interest for the case of the spinor loop in a magnetic field, here we will also include the scalar loop and the electric field component, since the computational effort is essentially the same. We show that the tadpole diagram, although contributing to the amplitude, does not contribute to the magnetic dichroism. The gravitational Ward identity provides a useful check.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravitational Lensing by Compact Object without Cauchy Horizons in Effective Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we theoretically investigate strong gravitational lensing effects and evaluate various lensing observables of a static, spherically symmetric solution in the context of effective quantum gravity (EQG). Among the three types of solutions proposed in EQG backgrounds, this is the third type without having Cauchy horizons. This solution gives rise to black hole as well as horizonless wormhole solutions depending on the range of values of the parameters of the theory. Based on the data from SgrA* and M87* observations, possible bounds on the parameter are obtained. It is found that the horizonless wormhole solution is ruled out by SgrA* observations, but is allowed by M87* observations. We analyze and provide estimates of the lensing observables, some of which can potentially be detected by observational tools.</description>

      <title>Higgs Inflation Model with Small Non-Minimal Coupling Constant</title>

Abstract: The Higgs sector of the Two-Measure Theory (TMT) extension of the electroweak SM (TMSM) is studied in the context of cosmology, where the only non-zero component \varphi(t) of the cosmologically averaged Higgs field plays the role of the inflaton. The self-consistency of the system of equations has the form of an algebraic constraint defining the scalar \zeta equal to the ratio of two volume measures, as a function of \varphi. The \zeta is present in all equations of motion and has a significant effect on the dynamics. After the transition in the equations of motion to the Einstein frame, the resulting system of equations is described by the TMT-effective action S_{eff} and Lagrangian L_{eff}. Due to the constraint, the original model parameters are converted into \varphi-dependent classical effective parameters. The effective potential is U_{eff}=\frac{\lambda{4\xi^2}M_P^4\cdotF(\varphi)\cdot\tanh^4\bigl(\frac{\sqrt{\xi}\varphi}{M_P}\bigr), where F(\varphi)\approx \frac{1}{2} for \varphi &gt;\sqrt{6}M_P. If \xi=1/6, then to ensure agreement with CMB observational data, the Higgs field self-coupling model parameter \lambda must be \sim10^{-11}. After the end of inflation, the decrease of \varphi leads to a change in the sign of the effective Higgs mass term, that leads to SSB. As \varphi approaches VEV, \zeta changes in such a way that the TMT-effective \lambda increases by 10 orders of magnitude to the value in the GWS theory. Applying the model to the very beginning of the classical evolution of the Universe shows that cosmological dynamics can begin with a "pathological" and even phantom regime. However, if evolution begins with normal dynamics, then it proceeds only as inflation, and the problem of initial conditions for the onset of inflation does not arise. The fermion preheating model is described as a preliminary study of preheating after inflation.</description>

      <title>A novel Lagrange-multiplier approach to the effective-one-body dynamics of binary systems in post-Minkowskian gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach to the conservative dynamics of binary systems, within the effective one-body (EOB) framework, based on the use of a Lagrange multiplier to impose the mass-shell constraint. When applied to the post-Minkowskian (PM) description of the two-body problem in Einsteinian gravity, this Lagrange-EOB (LEOB) approach allows for a new formulation of the conservative dynamics that avoids the drawbacks of the recursive definition of EOB-PM Hamiltonians. Using state-of-the-art expressions of the resummed waveform and radiation reaction, we apply our new formalism to the construction of an aligned-spin, quasi-circular, inspiraling EOB waveform model, called {\tt LEOB-PM}, that incorporates analytical information up to the 4PM level, completed by 4PN contributions up to the sixth order in eccentricity, in the orbital sector, and by 4.5PN contributions, in the spin-orbit sector. In the nonspinning case, we find that an uncalibrated LEOB-PM model delivers maximum EOB/NR unfaithfulness ${\bar{F}}_{\rm EOBNR}$ (with the Advanced LIGO noise in the total mass range $10-200M_\odot$) varying between $0.2\%$ and $1\%$ over all the nonspinning dataset of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime (SXS) Numerical Relativity (NR) catalog up to mass ratio $q=15$. It also delivers excellent phasing agreement with the $q=32$ configuration of the RIT catalog. We also found consistency between binding energies within a few percent at the NR merger location. Then, when NR-informing the dynamics of the model (both orbital and spinning sectors) by using 17 SXS dataset, we find that the EOB/NR unfaithfulness (compared to 530 spin-aligned SXS waveforms) has a median value of $5.39\times 10^{-4}$, or $6.13\times 10^{-4}$ (depending on the spin-spin interactions), reaching at most $\sim 1\%$ in some of the high-spin corners.</description>

      <title>Fitting NANOGrav 15-year data and ACT data with modified inflation in entropic cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent evidences of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) through Pulsar Time Array (PTA) observations hint towards an alternative inflationary scenario, compared to the usual inflation, for describing the early stage of the universe in order to be compatible with the PTA data. Moreover, currently the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (combined with the Planck 2018 and BAO) refines the constraint on inflationary observables, compared to the only-Planck 2018 measurements. In the present work, we simultaneously address these two issues by incorporating certain modification during inflation over the usual inflationary scenario. Such modification amplifies the primordial tensor perturbation over the modes that are sensitive to the NANOGrav frequency region. For this purpose, we take the thermodynamic route of cosmology where the entropy of the apparent horizon is given by a generalized form of entropy that is able to generalize the other known form of horizon entropies for suitable representations. The constraints on the model parameters coming from the ACT data also fit the NANOGrav 15-year data (based on numerical analysis), which reveal the model's compatibility with both the ACT and the PTA data.</description>

      <title>Multi-probe analysis of strong-field effects in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Covariant $f(Q)$ gravity is a viable extension of General Relativity, however its strong-field predictions remain largely untested. Using the static, spherically symmetric black-hole solutions of the theory, we confront it with the most stringent probes available: black-hole shadows, Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements, S2-star precession, and strong gravitational lensing. We show that the two admissible solution branches behave very differently: Case~I produces negligible deviations from Schwarzschild solution, whereas Case~II yields significant, potentially observable corrections to the photon sphere and shadow size. From the EHT shadow diameters of M87* and Sgr~A*, we obtain tight bounds, which are further strengthened by strong-lensing coefficients. These results provide the sharpest strong-field constraints on covariant $f(Q)$ gravity to date, and point toward future tests using next-generation horizon-scale imaging and precision Galactic-center astrometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for inflationary model building in the framework of metric-affine gravity. Such a mechanism involves an inflaton non-minimally coupled with the Holst invariant. If the non-minimal coupling function has a zero point and it is very steep at that same point, then the canonically normalized inflaton potential always features an exponential plateau, regardless of the shape of the original inflaton potential. The inflationary predictions in such a region are equivalent to the ones of Starobinsky inflation.</description>

      <title>A framework for LISA population inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to have a source rich data stream containing signals from large numbers of many different types of source. This will include both individually resolvable signals and overlapping stochastic backgrounds, a regime intermediate between current ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. The resolved sources and backgrounds will be fitted together in a high dimensional Global Fit. To extract information about the astrophysical populations to which the sources belong, we need to decode the information in the Global Fit, which requires new methodology that has not been required for the analysis of current gravitational wave detectors. Here, we %start that development, presenting present a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the properties of astrophysical populations directly from the output of a LISA Global Fit, consistently accounting for information encoded in both the resolved sources and the unresolved background. Using a simplified model of the Global Fit, we illustrate how the interplay between resolved and unresolved components affects population inference and highlight the impact of data analysis choices, such as the signal-to-noise threshold for resolved sources, on the results. Our approach provides a practical foundation for population inference using LISA data.</description>

      <title>Exact Kerr-Newman-(A)dS and other spacetimes in bumblebee gravity: employing a novel generating technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we show that if the bumblebee field in the Einstein-bumblebee theory is given by its vacuum expectation value ($B_{\mu}=b_{\mu}$) and it is not dynamical ($\partial_{\mu}B_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}B_{\mu}=0$), then these conditions uniquely provide a generating technique, allowing us to construct exact solutions to bumblebee gravity from the vacuum solutions by adding a term $\sim b_{\mu}b_{\nu}$ to the metric tensor. Also, we show that the bumblebee field within this technique is proportional to the tangential vector of the (timelike or spacelike) geodesic curve in the background vacuum spacetime, and can be easily found knowing the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Moreover, we prove that this technique can be extended to the case of any non-zero cosmological constant and the presence of the electromagnetic field. We apply this generating technique and obtain the bumblebee extension of the Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime. We show that this extension is not unique, as it depends on the exact geodesic curve one chooses to associate a bumblebee field with. Then, by considering various special cases of this generic solution, we demonstrate that the condition of the global reality of the bumblebee field limits the set of geodesics with which we can associate it.</description>

      <title>Navigating permanent underdetermination in dark energy and inflationary cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify troubling cases of so-called `permanent underdetermination' in both dark energy and inflationary cosmology. We bring to bear (a) a taxonomy of possible responses to underdetermination, and (b) an understanding of both dark energy and inflationary cosmology from an effective field theory point of view. We argue that, under certain conditions, there are viable responses which can arguably alleviate at least some of the concerns about underdetermination in the dark energy and inflationary sectors. However, the epistemic threat of permanent underdetermination remains a significant challenge.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry in momentum space: restoring ${\cal C}{\cal P}{\cal T}$ invariance of $\kappa$-field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The positive and negative energy modes of a field theory in $\kappa$-Minkowski/$\kappa$-Poincar\'e noncommutative spacetime have very different symmetry properties. This can be understood geometrically by considering that they span two distinct sectors of a curved momentum space. By performing an explicit direct computation of the relativistic Noether charges and their algebra within the canonical formalism, we identify a striking consequence of this asymmetry in momentum space: charge conjugation and Poincar\'e invariance are incompatible. We then notice how the structure of momentum space suggests that time reversal could be deformed so that the overall ${\cal C}{\cal P}{\cal T}$-invariance is restored. We prove that this new proposal works by studying the transformation properties under deformed discrete symmetries of the new relativistic charges.</description>

      <title>Phantom crossing or dark interaction?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent results from DESI BAO measurements, together with Planck CMB and Pantheon+ data, suggest that there may be a `phantom' phase ($w_{\rm de}&lt;-1$) in the expansion of the Universe. This inference follows when the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$ is used to fit the data. Since phantom dark energy in general relativity is unphysical, we investigate the possibility that the phantom behaviour is not intrinsic, but effective -- due to a non-gravitational interaction between dark matter and non-phantom dark energy. To this end, we assume a physically motivated thawing quintessence-like form of the intrinsic dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$. Then we use a $w_0, w_a$ model for the \emph{effective} equation of state of dark energy. We find that the data favours a phantom crossing for the effective dark energy, but only at low significance. The intrinsic equation of state of dark energy is non-phantom, without imposing any non-phantom priors. A nonzero interaction is favoured at more than $3\sigma$ at $z\sim0.3$. The energy flows from dark matter to dark energy at early times and reverses at later times.</description>

      <title>Lense-Thirring precession of neutron-star accretion flows: Relativistic versus classical precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vertical (Lense-Thirring) precession of the innermost accretion flows has been discussed as a sensitive indicator of the rotational properties of neutron stars (NSs) and their equation of state because it vanishes for a non-rotating star. In this work, we apply the Hartle-Thorne spacetimes to study the frequencies of the precession for both geodesic and non-geodesic (fluid) flows. We build on previous findings on the effect of the NS quadrupole moment, which revealed the importance of the interplay between the relativistic and classical precession. Because of this interplay, the widely used Lense-Thirring metric, linear in the NS angular momentum, is insufficient to calculate the behaviour of the precession frequency across an astrophysically relevant range of NS angular momentum values. We find that even for a moderately oblate NSs, the dependencies of the precession frequency on the NS angular momentum at radii within the innermost accretion region have maxima that occur at relatively low values of the NS angular momentum. We conclude that very different groups of accreting NSs -- slow and fast rotators -- can display the same precession frequencies. This may explain the lack of evidence for a correlation between the frequencies of the observed low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations and the NS spin. In our work, we provide a full, general description of precession behaviour, and also examples that assume specific NS and quark star (MIT bag) equation of state. Our calculations are reproducible using the associated Wolfram Mathematica notebook.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider free Dirac fermions on a discretized $AdS_2$ black hole background, and analyze how curved space redshift, horizons, and the spin connection induced chiral gravitational effect shape spectral, transport, and scrambling phenomena. The system is discretized via staggered fermions followed by the Jordan-Wigner transform to encode the model in qubit degrees of freedom, whose Hamiltonian carries site dependent warp factors and bond chirality terms encoding the redshift and spin connection effects. We calculate the ground state and first excited states energies, their local charge profiles, and their half-chain entanglement entropies, showing how redshift and chirality affect the transition from criticality to a gapped regime. Probing operator growth via out-of-time-order correlators, we find that horizons and the chiral coupling accelerate scrambling, yet remain within a non-chaotic regime. Finally, we map out an integrable to ergodic crossover via level-spacing statistics and Brody fits, and introduce on-site disorder to drive a many body localization transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore novel classes of exotic astrophysical sources capable of producing ultra-high-energy gamma rays extending beyond the PeV scale, motivated by quantum gravity scenarios and dark matter phenomenology. These sources include: ultra-spinning black hole vortex-string systems; exotic compact objects such as boson star, axion star and Q-ball. Such Exotica generate powerful magnetic fields through interactions with millicharged dark matter, enabling particle acceleration mechanisms that surpass the energy limits of conventional astrophysical sources like pulsar wind nebulae and supernova remnants. We demonstrate that such exotic PeVatrons could be distributed throughout our Galaxy and may be detectable by current (LHAASO, HAWC) and next-generation (CTA) gamma-ray observatories.</description>

      <title>SL(2N,C) Yang-Mills Theories: Direct Internal Forces and Emerging Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19210v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a four-dimensional gauge-gravity unification based on the \(SL(2N,\mathbb C)\) gauge theory taken in a universal Yang--Mills type setting. The accompanying tetrads are promoted to dynamical fields whose contracted invertibility condition is interpreted as a nonlinear sigma-model type length constraint. This triggers tetrad condensation and spontaneously breaks $\mathrm{SL}(2N, \mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(N)$, lifting all noncompact directions. A special ghost-free curvature-squared Lagrangian provides a consistent quadratic sector, while an Einstein--Cartan linear curvature term is induced radiatively from fermion loops. Below the breaking scale, only a neutral tetrad associated with graviton and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ vector fields remain massless, whereas axial-vector and tensor fields of the entire gauge multiplet acquire heavy masses. The matter sector clearly points to a deeper elementarity of \(SL(2N,\mathbb C)\) spinors, which can be identified with preon constituents whose bound states form the observed quarks and leptons. Anomaly matching between preons and composites singles out $N=8$. The chain $\mathrm{SL}(16,\mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(8)$ then naturally yields three composite quark--lepton families, while filtering out extraneous heavy states.</description>

      <title>Scattering Amplitudes and Conservative Binary Dynamics at $O(G^5)$ without Self-Force Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the complete potential-graviton contributions to the conservative radial action and scattering angle for two non-spinning bodies in general relativity, accurate through fifth order in Newton's constant and including second-order self-force (2SF) effects. The calculation is carried out in the scattering-amplitude framework, combining the double copy, effective field theory, and multi-loop integration techniques based on integration by parts and differential equations. To address a major computational bottleneck, we develop improved integration-by-parts algorithms that render calculations at this order tractable. The post-Minkowskian amplitude is presented as a series expansion, following the strategy used earlier in maximal supergravity. For the first self-force sector, which involves only polylogarithmic functions, we also provide a closed-form analytic expression. For the second self-force sector, as in earlier supergravity work, we find nontrivial cancellations among contributions related to integrals supported on Calabi-Yau geometry.</description>
