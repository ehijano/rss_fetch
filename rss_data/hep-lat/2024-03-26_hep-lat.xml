      <title>Symplectic quantization and the Feynman propagator: a new real-time numerical approach to lattice field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here the first numerical test of symplectic quantization, a new approach to quantum field theory. Symplectic quantization is characterized by the possibility to sample quantum fluctuations of relativistic fields by means of a deterministic dynamics generated by Hamilton-like equations, the latter evolving with respect to an additional time parameter $\tau$. In the present work we study numerically the symplectic quantization dynamics for a real scalar field in 1+1 space-time dimensions and with $\lambda \phi^4$ non-linear interaction. We find that for $\lambda \ll 1$ the Fourier spectrum of the two-point correlation function obtained numerically reproduces qualitatively well the shape of the Feynman propagator. Within symplectic quantization the expectation over quantum fluctuations is computed as a dynamical average along the trajectories parametrized by the intrinsic time $\tau$. As a numerical strategy to study quantum fluctuations of fields directly in Lorentzian space-time, we believe that symplectic quantization will be of key importance for the study of non-equilibrium relaxational dynamics in quantum field theory and the phenomenology of metastable bound states with very short life-time, something usually not accessible by numerical methods based on Euclidean field theory.</description>

      <title>Four-gluon vertex from the Curci-Ferrari model at one-loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the four-gluon vertex from the Curci-Ferrari model at one-loop order for a collinear configuration. Our results display a good agreement with the first lattice data for this vertex, released very recently (arXiv:2401.12008). A noteworthy novelty of our work is that we can provide analytical expressions for the four-gluon vertex in collinear configurations, together with a renormalization scheme that allows us to perform reliable perturbative computations even in the infrared regime. We observe an infrared suppression in the form factor associated with the tree-level four-gluon tensor with a possible zero-crossing in the deep infrared which demands new lattice investigations to be confirmed. Moreover, we report an infrared divergence in the completely symmetric tensor form factor due to the ghost-loop contributions. These results come as predictions since previous two-point correlations fix all the available parameters of the model, up to an overall constant factor.</description>

      <title>A new method to access heavy meson lightcone distribution amplitudes from first-principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to compute lightcone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of heavy meson within heavy quark effective theory (HQET). Our method utilizes quasi distribution amplitudes (quasi-DAs) with a large momentum component $P^z$. We point out that by sequentially integrating out $P^z$ and $m_H$, one can disentangle different dynamical scales. Integrating out $P^z$ allows to connect quasi-DAs to QCD LCDAs, and then integrating out $m_H$ enables to relate QCD LCDAs to HQET LCDAs. To verify this proposal, we make use of lattice QCD simulation on a lattice ensemble with spacing $a = 0.05187$\,fm. The preliminary findings for HQET LCDAs qualitatively align with phenomenological models. Using a recent model for HQET LCDAs, we also fit the first inverse moment $\lambda_B^{-1}$ and the result is consistent with the experimentally constrain from $B \to \gamma \ell\nu_\ell$. This agreement demonstrates the promise of our method in providing first-principle predictions for heavy meson LCDAs.</description>

      <title>Model-independent description of $B\rightarrow D \pi \ell \nu$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution we present a novel, model-independent description of semileptonic $B\rightarrow D \pi \ell \nu$ decays. In addition, we discuss recent developments in the understanding of coupled-channel $D \pi$-$D \eta$-$D_s K$ S-wave scattering and, for the first time, apply them to semileptonic decays. We not only obtain model-independent predictions for kinematic distributions in $B\rightarrow D \pi \ell \nu$ decays, but also rule out the hypothesis that the gap between the inclusive $B\rightarrow X\ell\nu$ branching fraction and the sum over exclusive channels is made up predominantly by $B\rightarrow D^{(\ast)} \eta \ell \nu$ decays.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Gauge Theory for Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous gauge theories, because of their bosonic degrees of freedom, have an infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space. Encoding these degrees of freedom on qubit-based hardware demands some sort of ``qubitization'' scheme, where one approximates the behavior of a theory while using only finitely many degrees of freedom. We propose a novel qubitization strategy for gauge theories, called ``fuzzy gauge theory,'' building on the success of the fuzzy $\sigma$-model in earlier work. We provide arguments that the fuzzy gauge theory lies in the same universality class as regular gauge theory, in which case its use would obviate the need of any further limit besides the usual spatial continuum limit. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these models are relatively resource-efficient for quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>New mixed inhomogeneous phase in vortical gluon plasma: first-principle results from rotating SU(3) lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using first-principle numerical simulations, we find a new spatially inhomogeneous phase in rigidly rotating $N_c = 3$ gluon plasma. This mixed phase simultaneously possesses both confining and deconfining phases in thermal equilibrium. Unexpectedly, the local critical temperature of the phase transition at the rotation axis does not depend on the angular frequency within a few percent accuracy. Even more surprisingly, an analytic continuation of our results to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates a profound breaking of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law in the vicinity of the phase transition, with the confining (deconfining) phase appearing far (near) the rotation axis.</description>

Abstract: We investigate relations between the chiral susceptibility and axial $U(1)$ anomaly in lattice QCD at high temperatures. Employing the exactly chiral symmetric Dirac operator, we separate the purely axial $U(1)$ breaking effect in the connected and disconnected chiral susceptibilites in a theoretically clean manner. Preliminary results for two-flavor lattice QCD near the critical temperature are presented.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap for Lattice Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.11360v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $SU(\infty)$ lattice Yang-Mills theory at the dimensions $D=2,3,4$ via the numerical bootstrap method. It combines the Makeenko-Migdal loop equations, with a cut-off $L_{\mathrm{max}}$ on the maximal length of loops, and positivity conditions on certain matrices of Wilson loops. Our algorithm is inspired by the pioneering paper of P.Anderson and M.Kruczenski but it is significantly more efficient, as it takes into account the symmetries of the lattice theory and uses the relaxation procedure in line with our previous work on matrix bootstrap. We thus obtain rigorous upper and lower bounds on the plaquette average at various couplings and dimensions. For $D=4$, the lower bound data appear to be close to the MC data in the strong coupling phase and the upper bound data in the weak coupling phase reproduce well the 3-loop perturbation theory. Our results suggest that this bootstrap approach can provide a tangible alternative to the, so far uncontested, Monte Carlo approach.</description>

      <title>Analysis of $b\rightarrow c\tau\bar{\nu}_\tau$ anomalies using weak effective Hamiltonian with complex couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the experimental measurements of the branching ratios and different polarization asymmetries for the processes occurring through flavor-changing-charged current $b\rightarrow c\tau\overline{\nu}_{\tau}$ transitions by BABAR, Belle, and LHCb show some sparkling differences with the corresponding SM predictions. Assuming the left handed neutrinos, we add the dimension-six vector, (pseudo-)scalar, and tensor operators with complex WCs to the SM WEH. Together with 60%, 30% and 10% constraints coming from the branching ratio of $B_{c}\to\tau\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$, we analyze the parametric space of these new physics WCs accommodating the current anomalies in the purview of the most recent HFLAV data of $R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D\right)$, $R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^*\right)$ and Belle data of $F_{L}\left(D^*\right)$ and $P_{\tau}\left(D^*\right)$. Furthermore, we derive the sum rules which correlate these observables with $R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D\right)$ and $R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^*\right)$. Using the best-fit points of the new complex WCs along with the latest measurements of $R_{\tau/{\mu,e}}\left(D^{(*)}\right)$, we predict the numerical values of the observable $R_{\tau/\ell}\left(\Lambda_c\right)$, $R_{\tau/\mu}\left(J/\psi\right)$ and $R_{\tau/\ell}\left(X_c\right)$ from the sum rules. Apart from finding the correlation matrix among the observables under consideration, we plot them graphically which is useful to discriminate different NP scenarios. Finally, we study the impact of these NP couplings on various angular and the CP triple product asymmetries, that could be measured in some ongoing and future experiments. The precise measurements of these observables are important to check the SM and extract the possible NP.</description>

      <title>Negative Barnett effect, negative moment of inertia of (quark-)gluon plasma and thermal evaporation of chromomagnetic condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the negativity of the moment of inertia of (quark-)gluon plasma in a window of "supervortical" range of temperatures above the deconfining phase transition, $T \simeq (1\dots 1.5) T_c $ found recently in numerical Monte Carlo simulations by two independent methods. In our work, we confirm numerically that the origin of this effect is rooted in the thermal evaporation of the non-perturbative chromomagnetic condensate. We argue that the negative moment of inertia of gluon plasma indicates the presence of a novel effect, the negative spin-vortical coupling for gluons resulting in a negative gluonic Barnett effect: the spin polarization of gluons exceeds the total angular momentum of rotating plasma thus forcing the orbital angular momentum to take negative values in the supervortical range of temperatures.</description>

      <title>Enhanced contribution of the pairing gap to the QCD equation of state at large isospin chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11443v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I study QCD at large isospin density, which is known to be in the superfluid state with Cooper pairs carrying the same quantum number as pions. I solve the gap equation derived from the perturbation theory up to the next-to-leading order corrections. The pairing gap at large isospin chemical potential is found to be enhanced compared to the color-superconducting gap at large baryon chemical potential due to the $\sqrt{2}$ difference in the exponent arising from the stronger attraction in one-gluon exchange in the singlet channel. Then, using the gap function, I evaluate the contribution of the condensation energy of the superfluid state to the QCD equation of state. At isospin chemical potential of a few GeV, where the lattice QCD and the perturbative QCD can be both applied, the effect of the condensation energy becomes dominant even compared to the next-to-leading order corrections to the pressure in the perturbation theory. It resolves the discrepancy between the recent lattice QCD results and the perturbative QCD result.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the $\mathrm{X_{AV}}$ state through its electromagnetic properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To improve our understanding of the quark-gluon dynamics underlying multiquark states, we systematically study their electromagnetic properties. In this study, the magnetic and quadrupole moments of the theoretically predicted singly-charmed state with the quantum numbers $\mathrm{J^P = 1^+}$ is investigated within the framework of the QCD light-cone sum rules method by considering the diquark-antidiquark configuration of this state with quark contents $[ud][\bar{c}\bar{s}]$. The predicted results for the magnetic and quadrupole moments are as $\mu_{\mathrm{X_{AV}}}=-0.89 ^{+0.14}_{-0.12}~\mu_N $ and $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{X_{AV}}} = (-0.46 ^{+0.07}_{-0.06})\times 10^{-2} ~\mbox{fm}^2$. The results obtained can be useful in determining the exact nature of this state. This work will hopefully stimulate experimental interest in the study of the electromagnetic properties of multiquark systems.</description>

      <title>Benchmark calculations of fully heavy compact and molecular tetraquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the mass spectrum of the S-wave fully heavy tetraquark systems $ QQ\bar Q\bar Q~(Q=c,b) $ with both normal $ (J^{PC}=0^{++},1^{+-},2^{++}) $ and exotic $ (J^{PC}=0^{+-},1^{++},2^{+-}) $ C-parities using three different quark potential models (AL1, AP1, BGS). The exotic C-parity systems refer to the ones that cannot be composed of two S-wave ground heavy quarkonia. We incorporate the molecular dimeson and compact diquark-antidiquark spatial correlations simultaneously, thereby discerning the actual configurations of the states. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the four-body Schr\"odinger equation, and the complex scaling method to identify the resonant states. The mass spectra in three different models qualitatively agree with each other. We obtain several resonant states with $ J^{PC} = 0^{++}, 1^{+-}, 2^{++}, 1^{++} $ in the mass region $(6.92,7.30)\, \mathrm{GeV}$, some of which are good candidates of the experimentally observed $X(6900)$ and $X(7200)$. We also obtain several exotic C-parity zero-width states with $ J^{PC}=0^{+-} $ and $ 2^{+-} $. These zero-width states have no corresponding S-wave diquarkonium threshold and can only decay strongly to final states with P-wave quarkonia. With the notation $T_{4Q,J(C)}(M)$, we deduce from the root mean square radii that the $ X(7200) $ candidates $ T_{4c,0(+)}(7173), T_{4c,2(+)}(7214) $ and the state $ T_{4c,1(-)}(7191) $ look like molecular states although most of the resonant and zero-width states are compact states.</description>
