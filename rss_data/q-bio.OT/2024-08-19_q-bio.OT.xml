      <title>Carbon Dioxide as a Pollutant. The Risks of Rising Atmospheric CO$_2$ Levels on Human Health and on the Stability of the Biosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon dioxide is a chemically active molecule that plays a vital role in Earth's ecosphere. CO$_2$ affects the acidity of seawater and has multiple negative effects on marine organisms. It is also a fundamental component of the photosynthesis and respiration reactions. There is evidence that higher CO$_2$ concentration can make the photosynthetic reaction faster in some plants, but also negatively impact the respiration reaction in aerobic lifeforms. The effects of this chemical and biochemical perturbation on the biosphere and on human health may be more important than generally highlighted in the discussion on CO$_2$, usually focused on thermal effects only. These considerations stress the importance of rapidly reducing CO$_2$ emissions and, whenever possible, remove the excess from the atmosphere. They also show that geoengineering technologies based on Solar Radiation Management (SRM) alone cannot be sufficient to contrast the negative effects of CO$_2$ anthropogenic emissions.</description>

      <title>DOME Registry: Implementing community-wide recommendations for reporting supervised machine learning in biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning (ML) is used extensively in biology and deserves closer scrutiny. The DOME recommendations aim to enhance the validation and reproducibility of ML research by establishing standards for key aspects such as data handling and processing, optimization, evaluation, and model interpretability. The recommendations help to ensure that key details are reported transparently by providing a structured set of questions. Here, we introduce the DOME Registry (URL: registry.dome-ml.org), a database that allows scientists to manage and access comprehensive DOME-related information on published ML studies. The registry uses external resources like ORCID, APICURON and the Data Stewardship Wizard to streamline the annotation process and ensure comprehensive documentation. By assigning unique identifiers and DOME scores to publications, the registry fosters a standardized evaluation of ML methods. Future plans include continuing to grow the registry through community curation, improving the DOME score definition and encouraging publishers to adopt DOME standards, promoting transparency and reproducibility of ML in the life sciences.</description>
