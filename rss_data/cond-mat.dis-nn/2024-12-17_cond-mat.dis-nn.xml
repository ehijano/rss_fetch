      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics in geometrically frustrated spin glass Bi2Fe3GaO9 with a Cairo lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have explored the relaxation process of the spin glass phase in Bi2Fe3GaO9, a geometrically frustrated magnet with a unique structure consisting of pentagonal building blocks known as the Cairo lattice. Using dc magnetization measurements on single crystals, we estimate the relaxation time across various temperatures and fields. Our results indicate that the relaxation time of Bi2Fe3GaO9 follows the Arrhenius law as a function of temperature but remains relatively constant as the applied magnetic field varies. Further, through a carefully designed protocol, we observe significant rejuvenation and memory effects. Remarkably, the memory effects in Bi2Fe3GaO9 are found to be more similar to those observed in classical spin glasses rather than in spin jamming systems, both in terms of the magnitude of the memory effect and the value of the exponent that describes the relaxation behavior. Our findings suggest that Bi2Fe3GaO9 provides an excellent platform for investigating the time-dependent evolution of underlying magnetism using neutron scattering, paving the way for future research.</description>

      <title>Time-translation invariance symmetry breaking hidden by finite-scale singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a renormalization group perspective on the quantum dynamics of a particle moving in the Euclidean $\mathbb{R}^N$ space through the complex landscape provided by a disordered Hamiltonian of type $2+p$. We focus on the large $N$ limit, where the coarse-graining procedure is unconventional: it is based on the Wigner spectrum of the rank-2 disorder. The main consequence of this choice is that canonical dimensions depend on the scale, and the flow equations fail to become autonomous, preventing the existence of global fixed points. One of the main features of the underlying renormalization group flow is the existence of finite-scale singularities for initial conditions sufficiently close to the Gaussian region and for rank-$p$ disorder intensity large enough. Using the Luttinger-Ward formalism, we show that these finite-scale singularities hide (and should be resolved by) a phase transition that breaks time-translation invariance.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced phase transitions and critical phases in nonreciprocal non-Hermitian quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</description>

      <title>The fate of Wannier-Stark localization and skin effect in periodically driven non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eigenstates of one-dimensional Hermitian and non-Hermitian tight-binding systems (in the presence/absence of quasiperiodic potential) and an external electric field undergo complete localization with equally spaced eigenenergies, known as the Wannier-Stark (WS) localization. In this work, we demonstrate that when the electric field is slowly modulated with time, new non-trivial phases with multiple mobility edges emerge in place of WS localized phase, which persists up to a certain strength of the non-Hermiticity. On the other hand, for a large driving frequency, we retrieve the usual sharp delocalization-localization transition to the usual (no WS) localized phase, similar to the static non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper type without any electric field. This vanishing of WS localization can be attributed solely to the time-periodic drive and occurs irrespective of the non-Hermiticity. Interestingly, under the open boundary condition (OBC), we find that contrary to the undriven systems where an external electric field destroys the SE completely, the SE appears in certain regime of the parameter space when the electric field is temporally driven. This appearance of SE is closely related to the absence of extended unitarity. In addition, in the presence of the drive, the skin states are found to be multifractal, contrary to its usual nature in such non-Hermitian systems. An in-depth understanding about the behavior of the states in the driven system is established from the long-time dynamics of an initial excitation.</description>

      <title>Room temperature exciton-polariton neural network with perovskite crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limitations of electronics have stimulated the search for novel unconventional computing platforms that enable energy-efficient and ultra-fast information processing. Among various systems, exciton-polaritons stand out as promising candidates for the realization of optical neuromorphic devices. This is due to their unique hybrid light-matter properties, resulting in strong optical nonlinearity and excellent transport capabilities. However, previous implementations of polariton neural networks have been restricted to cryogenic temperatures, limiting their practical applications. In this work, using non-equillibrium Bose-Einstein condensation in a monocrystalline perovskite waveguide, we demonstrate the first room-temperature exciton-polariton neural network. Its performance is verified in various machine learning tasks, including binary classification, and object detection. Our result is a crucial milestone in the development of practical applications of polariton neural networks and provides new perspectives for optical computing accelerators based on perovskites.</description>

      <title>Topology and Spectrum in Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competition among repetitive measurements of noncommuting observables and unitary dynamics can give rise to a rich variety of entanglement phases. We here characterize topological phases in monitored quantum systems by their spectrum and many-body topological invariants. We analyze (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits for Majorana fermions, which have topological and trivial area-law entangled phases and a critical phase with sub-volume-law entanglement, through the Lyapunov spectrum. We uncover the presence (absence) of edge-localized zero modes inside the bulk gap in the topological (trivial) area-law phase and a bulk gapless spectrum in the critical phase. Furthermore, by suitably exploiting the fermion parity with twisted measurement outcomes at the boundary, we construct a topological invariant that sharply distinguishes the two area-law phases and dynamically characterizes the critical phase. Our work thus paves the way to extend the bulk-edge correspondence for topological phases from equilibrium to monitored quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Analog model for Euclidean wormholes: Bose-Einstein condensate with dirty surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a Bose-Einstein condensate under the effects of the non-condensate atomic cloud. We model the resulting linear interaction of the condensate with the atomic gas as a quenched disorder. Using the distributional zeta function method, we obtained a representation for the quenched free energy as a series of integral moments of the partition function. Assuming that the Bose-Einstein condensate is confined between two planar surfaces, we show that random surface fields generate non-local terms in the effective action. The non-local effects in this condensed matter system define an analog model for Euclidean wormhole.</description>

      <title>Specific Heat Anomalies and Local Symmetry Breaking in (Anti-)Fluorite Materials: A Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the high-temperature properties of materials with (anti-)fluorite structures is crucial for their application in nuclear reactors. In this study, we employ machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations to investigate the high-temperature thermal properties of thorium dioxide, which has a fluorite structure, and lithium oxide, which has an anti-fluorite structure. Our results show that MLMD simulations effectively reproduce the reported thermal properties of these materials. A central focus of this work is the analysis of specific heat anomalies in these materials at high temperatures, commonly referred to as Bredig, pre-melting, or $\lambda$-transitions. We demonstrate that a local order parameter, analogous to those used to describe liquid-liquid transitions in supercooled water and liquid silica, can effectively characterize these specific heat anomalies. The local order parameter identifies two distinct types of defective structures: lattice defect-like and liquid-like local structures. Above the transition temperature, liquid-like local structures predominate, and the sub-lattice character of mobile atoms disappears.</description>

      <title>Average Spectral Density of Multiparametric Gaussian Ensembles of Complex Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08850v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A statistical description of part of a many body system often requires a non-Hermitian random matrix ensemble with nature and strength of randomness sensitive to underlying system conditions. For the ensemble to be a good description of the system, the ensemble parameters must be determined from the system parameters. This in turn makes its necessary to analyze a wide range of multi-parametric ensembles with different kinds of matrix elements distributions. The spectral statistics of such ensembles is not only system-dependent but also non-ergodic as well as non-stationary.
  A change in system conditions can cause a change in the ensemble parameters resulting an evolution of the ensemble density and it is not sufficient to know the statistics for a given set of system conditions. This motivates us to theoretically analyze a multiparametric evolution of the ensemble averaged spectral density of a multiparametric Gaussian ensemble on the complex plane. Our analysis reveals the existence of an evolutionary route common to the ensembles belonging to same global constraint class and thereby derives a complexity parameter dependent formulation of the spectral density for the non-equilibrium regime of the spectral statistics, away from Ginibre equilibrium limit.</description>

      <title>Investigating finite-size effects in random matrices by counting resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resonance counting is an intuitive and widely used tool in Random Matrix Theory and Anderson Localization. Its undoubted advantage is its simplicity: in principle, it is easily applicable to any random matrix ensemble. On the downside, the notion of resonance is ill-defined, and the `number of resonances' does not have a direct mapping to any commonly used physical observable like the participation entropy, the fractal dimensions, or the gap ratios (r-parameter), restricting the method's predictive power to the thermodynamic limit only where it can be used for locating the Anderson localization transition. In this work, we reevaluate the notion of resonances and relate it to measurable quantities, building a foundation for the future application of the method to finite-size systems.

      <description>arXiv:2408.15072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the Efetov's super-symmetric formalism we computed analytically the mean spectral density $\rho(E)$ for the L\'evy and the L\'evy -Rosenzweig-Porter random matrices which off-diagonal elements are strongly non-Gaussian with power-law tails. This makes the standard Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation inapplicable to such problems. We used, instead, the functional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation which allowed to solve the problem analytically for large sizes of matrices. We show that $\rho(E)$ depends crucially on the control parameter that drives the system through the transition between the ergodic and the fractal phases and it can be used as an order parameter.</description>

      <title>Generalizing multiple memories from a single drive: The hysteron latch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07177v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Far-from-equilibrium systems can form memories of previous deformations or driving. In systems from sheared glassy materials to buckling beams to crumpled sheets, this behavior is dominated by return-point memory, in which revisiting a past extremum of driving restores the system to a previous state. Cyclic driving with both positive and negative strains forms multiple nested memories -- as in a single-dial combination lock -- while asymmetric driving (only positive strain) cannot. We study this case in a general model of hysteresis that considers discrete elements called hysterons. We show how two hysterons with a frustrated interaction can violate return-point memory, realizing multiple memories of asymmetric driving. This reveals a general principle for designing systems that store sequences of cyclic driving, whether symmetric or asymmetric. In disordered systems, asymmetric driving is a sensitive tool for the direct measurement of frustration.</description>

      <title>Instability cascades in crumpling mylar sheets follow a log-Poisson statistic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of aging following a hard quench into a glassy state is characterized universally, for a wide class of materials, by logarithmic evolution of state variables and a power-law decay of two-time correlation functions that collapse only for the ratio of those times. This stands in stark contrast with relaxation in equilibrium materials, where time-translational invariance holds. It is by now widely recognized that these aging processes, which ever so slowly relax a complex disordered material after a quench, are facilitated by activated events. Yet, theories often cited to describe such a non-equilibrium process can be shown to miss pertinent aspects that are inherent to many experiments. A case in point are recent experiments on crumpling sheets of mylar loaded by a weight whose acoustic emissions are measured while the material buckles. Analyzing those local avalanches shows that crumpling is a log-Poisson process activated by increasingly rare record-sized fluctuations in a slowly stiffening material. Crumpling thus adds to a range of glassy materials exhibiting the log-Poisson property, which can be used to discriminate between theories.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a change of perspective on tensor network states that is defined by the computational graph of the contraction of an amplitude. The resulting class of states, which we refer to as tensor network functions, inherit the conceptual advantages of tensor network states while removing computational restrictions arising from the need to converge approximate contractions. We use tensor network functions to compute strict variational estimates of the energy on loopy graphs, analyze their expressive power for ground-states, show that we can capture aspects of volume law time evolution, and provide a mapping of general feed-forward neural nets onto efficient tensor network functions. Our work expands the realm of computable tensor networks to ones where accurate contraction methods are not available, and opens up new avenues to use tensor networks.</description>

      <title>Networks with many structural scales: a Renormalization Group perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scale invariance profoundly influences the dynamics and structure of complex systems, spanning from critical phenomena to network architecture. Here, we propose a precise definition of scale-invariant networks by leveraging the concept of a constant entropy-loss rate across scales in a renormalization-group coarse-graining setting. This framework enables us to differentiate between scale-free and scale-invariant networks, revealing distinct characteristics within each class. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive inventory of genuinely scale-invariant networks, both natural and artificially constructed, demonstrating, e.g., that the human connectome exhibits notable features of scale invariance. Our findings open new avenues for exploring the scale-invariant structural properties crucial in biological and socio-technological systems.</description>

      <title>Risk and cross validation in ridge regression with correlated samples</title>

Abstract: Recent years have seen substantial advances in our understanding of high-dimensional ridge regression, but existing theories assume that training examples are independent. By leveraging techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Designing precise dynamical steady states in disordered networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elastic structures can be designed to exhibit precise, complex, and exotic functions. While recent work has focused on the quasistatic limit governed by force balance, the mechanics at a finite driving rate are governed by Newton's equations. The goal of this work is to study the feasibility, constraints, and implications of creating disordered structures with exotic properties in the dynamic regime. The dynamical regime offers responses that cannot be realized in quasistatics, such as responses at an arbitrary phase, frequency-selective responses, and history-dependent responses. We employ backpropagation through time and gradient descent to design spatially specific steady states in disordered spring networks. We find that a broad range of steady states can be achieved with small alterations to the structure, operating both at small and large amplitudes. We study the effect of varying the damping, which interpolates between the underdamped and the overdamped regime, as well as the amplitude, frequency, and phase. We show that convergence depends on several competing effects, including chaos, large relaxation times, a gradient bias due to finite time simulations, and strong attenuation. By studying the eigenmodes of the linearized system, we show that the systems adapt very specifically to the task they were trained to perform. Our work demonstrates that within physical bounds, a broad array of exotic behaviors in the dynamic regime can be obtained, allowing for a richer range of possible applications.</description>

      <title>Temporal localization of optical waves supported by a copropagating quasiperiodic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on time crystals concerns the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry in time, as well as the realization of phenomena and phases known from solid-state physics in the time domain. Periodically driven systems of massive particles are widely used in these studies. In the present work, we consider a photonic system and demonstrate that stable nonlinear propagation of a strong optical wave in a fiber leads to the establishment of quasi-periodic oscillations in the electromagnetic field intensity. A second, weaker signal optical wave propagating in the fiber senses these oscillations and, as a result, undergoes exponential localization in time. This is a temporal analogue of Aubry-Andre localization. If an optical detector is placed at a certain position in the fiber, the temporal localization of the probe wave will be observed in the form of the signal which emerges and then decays as a function of time.</description>
