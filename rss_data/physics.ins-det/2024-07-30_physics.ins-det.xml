      <title>Comparison of Geometrical Layouts for Next-Generation Large-volume Cherenkov Neutrino Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water-(Ice-) Cherenkov neutrino telescopes have played a pivotal role in the search and discovery of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. Experimental collaborations are developing and constructing next-generation neutrino telescopes with improved optical modules (OMs) and larger geometrical volumes to increase their efficiency in the multi-TeV energy range and extend their reach to EeV energies. Although most existing telescopes share similar OM layouts, more layout options should be explored for next-generation detectors to maximize discovery capability. In this work, we study a set of layouts at different geometrical volumes and evaluate the signal event selection efficiency and reconstruction fidelity under both an only trigger-level linear regression algorithm and an offline Graph Neural Network (GNN) reconstruction. Our methodology and findings serve as first steps toward an optimized, global network of neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>ESAC (EQ-SANS Assisting Chatbot): Application of Large Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Enhanced User Experience at EQ-SANS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron scattering experiments have played vital roles in exploring materials properties in the past decades. While user interfaces have been improved over time, neutron scattering experiments still require specific knowledge or training by an expert due to the complexity of such advanced instrumentation and the limited number of experiments each person may perform each year. This paper introduces an innovative chatbot application that leverages Large Language Models(LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies to significantly enhance the user experience at the EQ-SANS, a small-angle neutron scattering instrument at the Spallation Neutron Source of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Through a user-centric design approach, the EQ-SANS Assisting Chatbot (ESAC) serves as an interactive reference for users, thereby facilitating the use of the instrument by visiting scientists. By bridging the gap between the users of EQ-SANS and the control systems required to perform their experiments, the ESAC sets a new standard for interactive learning and support for the scientific community using large-scale scientific facilities.</description>

      <title>Study of charging-up of PCB planes for neutrino experiment readout</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of double-faced, metallized, perforated PCB planes, segmented into strips for the anodic read-out of ionization signals in liquid argon TPCs, is emerging as a promising technology for charge readout in liquid argon TPCs used in large volume detectors.As a proof of concept, a prototype liquid Argon TPC hosting this new anode configuration based on single side perforated PCB planes has been constructed and exposed to cosmic rays at LNL in Italy. Tests were performed with both the metallized and insulating sides of the anode facing the drift volume, providing the first evidence of the focusing effect on drift electron trajectories through the PCB holes due to charge accumulation on the insulator surface.</description>

      <title>A camera system for real-time optical calibration of water-based neutrino telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibrating the optical properties within the detection medium of a neutrino telescope is crucial for determining its angular resolution and energy scale. For the next generation of neutrino telescopes planned to be constructed in deep water, such as the TRopIcal DEep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT), there are additional challenges due to the dynamic nature and potential non-uniformity of the water medium. This necessitates a real-time optical calibration system distributed throughout the large detector array. This study introduces a custom-designed CMOS camera system equipped with rapid image processing algorithms, providing a real-time optical calibration method for TRIDENT and other similar projects worldwide. In September 2021, the TRIDENT Pathfinder experiment (TRIDENT Explorer, T-REX for short) successfully deployed this camera system in the West Pacific Ocean at a depth of 3420 meters. Within 30 minutes, about 3000 images of the T-REX light source were captured, allowing for the in-situ measurement of seawater attenuation and absorption lengths under three wavelengths. This deep-sea experiment for the first time showcased a technical demonstration of a functioning camera calibration system in a dynamic neutrino telescope site, solidifying a substantial part of the calibration strategies for the future TRIDENT project.</description>

      <title>Open-Source CubeSat Solar Panels: Design, Assembly, Testing, and On-Orbit Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cube satellites, or CubeSats, are small satellites commonly used to perform Earth imaging and on-orbit scientific experiments. CubeSats are often powered using expensive, inflexible commercial-off-the-shelf solar panels, largely due to a lack of flight-qualified open-source alternatives. Here, we describe the design of customizable, deployable solar panels, offering an open-source, cost-effective alternative. Towards a fully open-source CubeSat, our designs have mission-tailored power generation capabilities and simple electrical and mechanical integration. The solar panel designs were demonstrated on-orbit on three satellites in the Northern SPIRIT constellation and will be on AlbertaSat's Ex-Alta~3 satellite, which will launch in 2025. The design files, assembly procedures, and best practices will be open-source-published online. This work lowers the barrier of entry into space, making satellite design easier and less expensive -- students helping students design better satellites.</description>

      <title>Photon energy reconstruction with the MEG II liquid xenon calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MEG II experiment searches for a charged-lepton-flavour-violating $\mu \to e \gamma$ with the target sensitivity of $6 \times 10^{-14}$. A liquid xenon calorimeter with VUV-sensitive photosensors measures photon position, timing, and energy. This paper concentrates on the precise photon energy reconstruction with the MEG II liquid xenon calorimeter. Since a muon beam rate is $3\text{-}5 \times 10^{7}~\text{s}^{-1}$, multi-photon elimination analysis is performed using waveform analysis techniques such as a template waveform fit. As a result, background events in the energy range of 48-58 MeV were reduced by 34 %. The calibration of an energy scale of the calorimeter with several calibration sources is also discussed to achieve a high resolution of 1.8 %.</description>

      <title>Comparative studies of plastic scintillator strips with high technical attenuation length for the total-body J-PET scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastic scintillator strips are considered as one of the promising solutions for the cost-effective construction of total-body positron emission tomography, (PET) system. The purpose of the performed measurements is to compare the transparency of long plastic scintillators with dimensions 6 mm x 24 mm x 1000 mm and with all surfaces polished. Six different types of commercial, general purpose, blue-emitting plastic scintillators with low attenuation of visible light were tested, namely: polyvinyl toluene-based BC-408, EJ-200, RP-408, and polystyrene-based Epic, SP32 and UPS-923A. For determination of the best type of plastic scintillator for totalbody Jagiellonian positron emission tomograph (TB-J-PET) construction, emission and transmission spectra, and technical attenuation length (TAL) of blue light-emitting by the scintillators were measured and compared. The TAL values were determined with the use of UV lamp as excitation source, and photodiode as light detector. Emission spectra of investigated scintillators have maxima in the range from 420 nm to 429 nm. The BC-408 and EJ-200 have the highest transmittance values of about 90% at the maximum emission wavelength measured through a 6 mm thick scintillator strip and the highest technical attenuation length reaching about 2000 mm, allowing assembly of long detection modules for time-of-flight (TOF) J-PET scanners. Influence of the 6 mm x 6 mm, 12 mm x 6 mm, 24 mm x 6 mm cross-sections of the 1000 mm long EJ-200 plastic scintillator on the TAL and signal intensity was measured. The highest TAL value was determined for samples with 24 mm x 6 mm cross-section.</description>

      <title>A high rate and high timing photoelectric detector prototype with RPC structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the need for a high counting rate and high time resolution in future high-energy physics experiments, a prototype of a gas photodetector with an RPC structure was developed. Garfield++ simulated the detector's performance, and the single photoelectron performance of different mixed gases was tested with an ultraviolet laser. The detector uses a low resistivity ($\sim1.4\cdot 10^{10} \Omega\cdot cm$) float glass so that its rate capability is significantly higher than that of ordinary float glass($10^{12}\sim10^{14} \Omega\cdot cm$), the laser test results show that in MRPC gas($R134a/iC_{4}H_{10}/SF_{6}(85/10/5)$), the single photoelectron time resolution is best to reach 20.3 ps at a gas gain of $7\cdot 10^{6}$. Increasing the proportion of $iC_{4}H_{10}$ can effectively reduce the probability of photon feedback, without changing the time resolution and maximum gain. In addition to being applied to high-precision time measurement scenarios (eg:T0, TOF), the detector can also quantitatively test the single photoelectron performance of different gases and will be used to find eco-friendly MRPC gases.</description>

      <title>Performance of a triple-GEM detector with capacitive-sharing 3-coordinate (X-Y-U)-strip anode readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of capacitive-sharing readout, described in detail in a previous study, offers the possibility for the development of high-performance three-coordinates (X-Y-U)-strip readout for Micro Pattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs) using simple standard PCB fabrication techniques. Capacitive-sharing (X-Y-U)-strip readout allows simultaneous measurement of the Cartesian coordinates x and y of the position of the particles together with a third coordinate u along the diagonal axis in a single readout PCB. This provides a powerful tool to address multiple-hit ambiguity and enable pattern recognition capabilities in moderate particle flux environment of collider or fixed target experiments in high energy physics HEP) and nuclear physics (NP). We present in this paper the performance of a 10 cm {\times} 10 cm triple-GEM detector with capacitive-sharing (X-Y-U)-strip anode readout. Spatial resolutions of the order of {\sigma}^res_x = 71.6 {\pm} 0.8 {\mu}m for X-strips, {\sigma}^res_y = 56.2 {\pm} 0.9 {\mu}m for Y-strips and {\sigma}^res_u = 75.2 {\pm} 0.9 {\mu}m for U-strips have been obtained at a beam test at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab). Modifications of the readout design of future prototypes to improve the spatial resolution and challenges in scaling to large-area MPGDs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Use of current-potential patches to obtain fundamental improvements to the coils of magnetic fusion devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central issue in the design of any magnetic fusion device is the coils that produce the external magnetic fields. The freedom that remains unstudied in the design of coils is enormous. This freedom could be quickly studied computationally at low cost with high reliability. This paper explains how this could be done using the concept of current-potential patches that was developed in Todd Elder's thesis.</description>

      <title>Attosecond transient grating spectroscopy with near-infrared grating pulses and an extreme ultraviolet diffracted probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transient grating spectroscopy has become a mainstay among metal and semiconductor characterization techniques. Here we extend the technique towards the shortest achievable timescales by using tabletop high-harmonic generation of attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses that diffract from transient gratings generated with 500-1000 nm sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) pulses. We demonstrate the power of attosecond transient grating spectroscopy (ATGS) by investigating the ultrafast photoexcited dynamics in an Sb semimetal thin film. ATGS provides an element-specific, background-free signal, unfettered by spectral congestion, in contrast to transient absorption spectroscopy. With the ATGS measurements in Sb polycrystalline thin films, we observe the generation of coherent phonons and investigate the lattice and carrier dynamics. Among the latter processes, we extract carrier thermalization, hot carrier cooling, and electron-hole recombination, which are on the order of 20 fs, 50 fs, and 2 ps, timescales, respectively. Furthermore, simultaneous collection of transient absorption and transient grating data allows us to extract the total complex dielectric constant in the sample dynamics, including the real-valued refractive index, from which we are also able to investigate carrier-phonon interactions and longer-lived phonon dynamics. The outlined experimental technique expands the capabilities of transient grating spectroscopy and attosecond spectroscopies by providing a wealth of information concerning carrier and lattice dynamics with an element-selective technique, at the shortest achievable timescales.</description>

      <title>Improving the Accuracy of Temperature Measurement on TEM samples using Plasmon Energy Expansion Thermometry (PEET): Addressing Sample Thickness Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and microelectronic mechanical systems (MEMS) based microheaters have enabled in-situ materials characterization at the nanometer scale at elevated temperature. In addition to resolving the structural information at elevated temperatures, detailed knowledge of the local temperature distribution inside the sample is essential to reveal thermally induced phenomena and processes. Here, we investigate the accuracy of plasmon energy expansion thermometry (PEET) as a method to map the local temperature in a tungsten (W) lamella in a range between room temperature and 700 degC. In particular, we address the influence of sample thickness in the range of a typical electron-transparent TEM sample (from 30 nm to 70 nm) on the temperature-dependent plasmon energy. The shift in plasmon energy, used to determine the local sample temperature, is not only temperature-dependent, but in case of W also thickness-dependent in sample thicknesses below approximately 60 nm. The results highlight the importance of considering sample thickness (and especially thickness variations) when analyzing the local bulk plasmon energy for temperature measurement using PEET. However, in case of W, an increasing beam broadening (FWHM) of the bulk plasmon peak with decreasing sample thickness can be used to improve the accuracy of PEET in TEM lamellae with varying sample thickness.</description>

      <title>An indirect geometry crystal time-of-flight spectrometer for FRM II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a concept for an indirect geometry crystal time-of-flight spectrometer, which we propose for a source similar to the FRM-II reactor in Garching. Recently, crystal analyzer spectrometers at modern spallation sources have been proposed and are under construction. The secondary spectrometers of these instruments are evolutions of the flat cone multi-analyzer for three-axis spectrometers (TAS). The instruments will provide exceptional reciprocal space coverage and intensity to map out the excitation landscape in novel materials. We will discuss the benefits of combining a time-of-flight primary spectrometer with a large crystal analyzer spectrometer at a continuous neutron source. The dynamical range can be very flexibly matched to the requirements of the experiment without sacrificing the neutron intensity. At the same time, the chopper system allows a quasi-continuous variation of the initial energy resolution. The neutron delivery system of the proposed instrument is based on the novel nested mirror optics, which images neutrons from the position of the pulse cutting chopper representing a bright virtual source onto the sample. The spot size of less than 1 cm x 1 cm at the virtual source allows the realization of very short neutron pulses by the choppers, while the small and well-defined spot size at the sample position provides an excellent energy resolution of the secondary spectrometer.</description>

      <title>A Novel Diamond-like Carbon based photocathode for PICOSEC Micromegas detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08712v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The PICOSEC Micromegas (MM) detector is a precise timing gaseous detector based on a MM detector operating in a two-stage amplification mode and a Cherenkov radiator. Prototypes equipped with cesium iodide (CsI) photocathodes have shown promising time resolutions as precise as 24 picoseconds (ps) for Minimum Ionizing Particles. However, due to the high hygroscopicity and susceptibility to ion bombardment of the CsI photocathodes, alternative photocathode materials are needed to improve the robustness of PICOSEC MM. Diamond-like Carbon (DLC) film have been introduced as a novel robust photocathode material, which have shown promising results. A batch of DLC photocathodes with different thicknesses were produced and evaluated using ultraviolet light. The quantum efficiency measurements indicate that the optimized thickness of the DLC photocathode is approximately 3 nm. Furthermore, DLC photocathodes show good resistance to ion bombardment in aging test compared to the CsI photocathode. Finally, a PICOSEC MM prototype equipped with DLC photocathodes was tested in muon beams. A time resolution of around 42 ps with a detection efficiency of 97% for 150 GeV/c muons were obtained. These results indicate the great potential of DLC as a photocathode for the PICOSEC MM detector.</description>

      <title>Quantum Illumination and Quantum Radar: A Brief Overview</title>

Abstract: Quantum illumination (QI) and quantum radar have emerged as potentially groundbreaking technologies, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to revolutionise the field of remote sensing and target detection. The protocol, particularly in the context of quantum radar, has been subject to a great deal of aspirational conjecture as well as criticism with respect to its realistic potential. In this review, we present a broad overview of the field of quantum target detection focusing on QI and its potential as an underlying scheme for a quantum radar operating at microwave frequencies. We provide context for the field by considering its historical development and fundamental principles. Our aim is to provide a balanced discussion on the state of theoretical and experimental progress towards realising a working QI-based quantum radar, and draw conclusions about its current outlook and future directions.</description>
