      <title>Functional Amyloid Fibrils as Versatile Tools for Novel Biomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional amyloid fibrils, once primarily associated with amyloidosis, are now recognized for their exceptional potential as biomaterials due to their unique structural features, including remarkable mechanical strength, high stability, and self-assembly capabilities. This review highlights their transformative applications across a wide range of industries, from cutting-edge drug delivery systems and next-generation biosensors to tissue engineering, surface technologies, energy storage, and environmental solutions. Their versatility extends into innovative sectors like information transfer systems, cell adhesion, protein fusion, food technology, and novel catalytic systems. Despite significant progress, critical gaps remain in the research. This review not only consolidates current applications but also underscores the vast potential for future advancements, positioning functional amyloids as key players in emerging biomaterials technologies.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-dependent Isotope Effect Supports Radical Pair Mechanism in Tubulin Polymerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak magnetic fields and isotopes have been shown to influence biological processes; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, particularly because the corresponding interaction energies are far below thermal energies, making classical explanations challenging or impossible. Microtubules, dynamic cytoskeletal fibers, offer an ideal system to test weak magnetic field effects due to their self-assembling capabilities, sensitivity to magnetic fields, and their central role in cellular processes. In this study, we use a combination of experiments and simulations to explore how nuclear spin dynamics affect microtubule polymerization by examining interactions between magnesium isotope substitution and weak magnetic fields. Our experiments reveal an isotope-dependent effect, which can be explained via a radical pair mechanism, explicitly arising from nuclear spin properties rather than isotopic mass differences. This nuclear spin-driven isotope effect is notably enhanced under an applied weak magnetic field of approximately 3 mT. Our theoretical model based on radical pairs achieves quantitative agreement with our experimental observations. These results establish a direct connection between quantum spin dynamics and microtubule assembly, providing new insights into how weak magnetic fields influence cellular and biomolecular functions.</description>
