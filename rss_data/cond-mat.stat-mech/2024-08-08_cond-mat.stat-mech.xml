      <description>arXiv:2408.03401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specific heat studies of the Sr$_{1-x}$Ba$_x$Mn$_{1-y}$Ti$_y$O$_3$ polycrystalline samples performed by the relaxation and DSC methods over the temperature range 2 - 450 K are reported. Anomalies accompanying the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic and ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions were measured and analyzed. The system studied is a promising multiferroic material of the 2$^{\text {nd}}$ type, in which a strong coupling between the magnetic and electric systems can be related to the fact that the same Mn$^{4+}$ ions are responsible for the two orderings. Analysis of the anomaly at the magnetic transition was done by using the advanced theory of the continuous transitions, in which the presence of higher order terms in the free energy is considered, and the parameters of the critical behavior of the system were estimated. It was found that, despite of earlier predictions, the transition loses the continuous character and can become the 1$^{\text {st}}$ order process for the Ti-containing samples. The anomalies accompanying the 1$^{\text{st}}$ order high-temperature ferroelectric transition were found to be hardly visible by using both techniques, which was ascribed to a wide temperature range of coexistence of the dielectric and ferroelectric phases.</description>

      <title>Scale-to-Scale Information Flow Amplifies Turbulent Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In three-dimensional turbulence, information of turbulent fluctuations at large scales is propagated to small scales. Here, we investigate the relation between the information flow and turbulent fluctuations. We first establish a connection between the information flow and phase-space contraction rate. From this relation, we then prove a universal inequality between the information flow and turbulent fluctuations, which states that the information flow from large to small scales amplifies turbulent fluctuations at small scales. This inequality can also be interpreted as a quantification of Landau's objection to the universality of turbulent fluctuations. We also discuss the difference between the information flow and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy.</description>

      <title>Resolving the kinetics of an ensemble of muscle myosin motors via a temperature-dependent fitting procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A data fitting procedure is devised and thoroughly tested to provide self-consistent estimates of the relevant mechanokinetic parameters involved in a plausible scheme underpinning the output of an ensemble of myosin II molecular motors mimicking the muscle contraction. The method builds on a stochastic model accounting for the force exerted by the motor ensemble operated both in the low and high force-generating regimes corresponding to different temperature ranges. The proposed interpretative framework is successfully challenged against simulated data, meant to mimic the experimental output of a unidimensional synthetic nanomachine powered by pure muscle myosin isoforms.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Transition due to particle losses in a monitored fermionic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been interest in the dynamics of monitored quantum systems using linear jump operators related to the creation or annihilation of particles. Here we study the dynamics of the entanglement entropy under quantum jumps that induce local particle losses in a model of free fermions with hopping and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ pairing. We explore the different steady-state entanglement regimes by interpolating between monitored free fermions with U(1) symmetry and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fermions. In the absence of pairing, the U(1) symmetric model approaches the vacuum at long times, with the entanglement entropy showing non-monotonic behavior over time that we capture with a phenomenological quasiparticle ansatz. In this regime, quantum jumps play a key role, and we highlight this by exactly computing their waiting-time distribution. On the other hand, the interplay between losses and pairing in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ case gives rise to quantum trajectories with entangled steady-states. We show that by tuning the several system parameters, a measurement-induced entanglement transition occurs where the entanglement entropy scaling changes from logarithmic to area-law. We compare this transition with the one derived in the no-click limit and observe qualitative agreement in most of the phase diagram. Furthermore, the statistics of entanglement gain and loss are analyzed to better understand the impact of the linear jump operators.</description>

      <title>Fundamental physical constants set the observability and operation of phase and other transitions and increase entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approaching the challenge to understand fundamental physical constants (FPCs) started with understanding the role these constants play in high-energy nuclear physics and astrophysics. Condensed matter physics was relatively unexplored in this regard. More recently, it was realised that FPCs set lower or upper bounds on key condensed matter properties. In this Perspective, we discuss a wider role played by FPCs in condensed matter physics: at given environmental conditions, FPCs set the observability and operation of entire physical effects and phenomena. We discuss first and second-order phase transitions and emerging new states including long-lived metastable states. We also discuss transitions between metastable states, chemical reactions and their products. These examples show that different values of FPCs would disable these transitions, and new phases as a result of these transitions would not emerge. This suggests that the current values of FPCs, by enabling transitions which give rise to new states, act to increase the phase space and entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive exact, universal, closed-form quantum Monte Carlo estimators for finite temperature energy susceptibility and fidelity susceptibility for essentially arbitrary Hamiltonians. We demonstrate how our method can be used to study quantum phase transitions without knowledge of an order parameter and without the need to design system-specific ergodic quantum Monte Carlo update rules by applying it to a class of random models.</description>

      <title>Dynamical patterns in active-passive particle mixtures with non-reciprocal interactions: Exact hydrodynamic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of dynamical patterns is one of the most striking features of non-equilibrium physical systems. Recent work has shown that such patterns arise generically from forces that violate Newton's third law, known as non-reciprocal interactions. These non-equilibrium phenomena are challenging for modern theories. Here, we introduce a model mixture of active (self-propelled) and passive (diffusive) particles with non-reciprocal effective interactions, which is amenable to exact mathematical analysis. We exploit state-of-the-art methods to derive exact hydrodynamic equations for the particle densities. We study the resulting collective behavior, including the linear stability of homogeneous states and phase coexistence in large systems. This reveals a novel phase diagram with the spinodal associated with active phase separation protruding through the associated binodal, heralding the emergence of dynamical steady states. We analyze these states in the thermodynamic limit of large system size, showing, for example, that sharp interfaces may travel at finite velocities, but traveling phase-separated states are forbidden. The model's mathematical tractability enables precise new conclusions beyond those available by numerical simulation of particle models or field theories.</description>

Abstract: For the Fermi gas filling the space inside a cubic cavity of a fixed volume, at arbitrary temperatures and number of particles, the thermodynamic characteristics are calculated, namely: entropy, thermodynamic potential, energy, pressure, heat capacities and thermodynamic coefficients. The discrete structure of energy levels is taken into account and size effects at low temperatures are studied. The transition to the continual limit is considered.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation of coherences in noisy mesoscopic quantum systems with diffusive transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motivation for this thesis is to find a fluctuating hydrodynamic description of quantum coherent effects in mesoscopic quantum systems with diffusive transport properties. Coherent effects are inscribed into the coherences (two-point Green's function) on which we focus as the building blocks of such a theory. Our approach is rather mathematical and not related to concrete experiments. We study the quantum symmetric simple exclusion process (QSSEP), a potentially iconic model describing transport of noisy free fermions on a 1D lattice, which has the minimal structure to capture what we are interested in: Long-ranged coherences and diffusive transport. In mean, QSSEP reduces to the symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP), a classical toy model that was important in the development of the macroscopic fluctuation theory, a fluctuating hydrodynamic description of diffusive transport in classical systems. Studying QSSEP we hope to make progress towards a quantum coherent extension of the macroscopic fluctuation theory.
  The thesis summarizes many results we have obtained about QSSEP in the last three years, such as the dynamical equation and an exact stationary solution for correlation functions of coherences at hydrodynamic scales, the distribution of entanglement in QSSEP and an argument why QSSEP might be an effective noisy description for more generic mesoscopic quantum systems. Many of these results are due to a relation between the statistical properties of coherences in QSSEP and free probability theory. We devote a whole chapter to this relation and present, as a by-product, a method to characterize the spectrum of subblocks of a large class of structured random matrices.</description>

Abstract: Several systems display an equilibrium condensation transition, where a finite fraction of a conserved quantity is spatially localized. The presence of two conservation laws may induce the emergence of such transition in an out-of-equilibrium setup, where boundaries are attached to different and subcritical heat baths. We study this phenomenon in a class of stochastic lattice models, where the local energy is a general convex function of the local mass, mass and energy being both globally conserved in the isolated system. We obtain exact results for the nonequilibrium steady state (spatial profiles, mass and energy currents, Onsager coefficients) and we highlight important differences between equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium condensation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is often stated that the second law of thermodynamics follows from the condition that at some given time in the past the entropy was lower than it is now. Formally, this condition is the statement that $E[S(t)|S(t_0)]$, the expected entropy of the universe at the current time $t$ conditioned on its value $S(t_0)$ at a time $t_0$ in the past, is an increasing function of $t $. We point out that in general this is incorrect. The epistemic axioms underlying probability theory say that we should condition expectations on all that we know, and on nothing that we do not know. Arguably, we know the value of the universe's entropy at the present time $t$ at least as well as its value at a time in the past, $t_0$. However, as we show here, conditioning expected entropy on its value at two times rather than one radically changes its dynamics, resulting in a unexpected, very rich structure. For example, the expectation value conditioned on two times can have a maximum at an intermediate time between $t_0$ and $t$, i.e., in our past. Moreover, it can have a negative rather than positive time derivative at the present. In such "Boltzmann bridge" situations, the second law would not hold at the present time. We illustrate and investigate these phenomena for a random walk model and an idealized gas model, and briefly discuss the role of Boltzmann bridges in our universe.</description>

Abstract: Several closely related ab initio thermal mean-field theories for fermions, both well-established and new ones, are compared with one another at the formalism level and numerically. The theories considered are Fermi-Dirac theory, thermal Hartree-Fock (HF) theory, two modifications of the thermal single-determinant approximation of Kaplan and Argyres, and first-order finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory based on zero-temperature or thermal HF reference. The thermal full-configuration-interaction theory is used as the benchmark.</description>

Abstract: We present the first principles construction of the low-energy effective action for bosonic self-organized quantum quasicrystals. Our generalized elasticity approach retains the appropriate number of phase- and corresponding conjugate density- degrees-of-freedom required for a proper description of the Goldstone modes. For the dodecagonal and decagonal quasicrystal structures we obtain collective longitudinal and transversal excitations with an isotropic speed of sound. Meanwhile, for the octagonal structure, the coupling between phononic and phasonic degrees of freedom leads in turn to hybridization of the latter with the condensate sound mode, producing collective excitations with a longitudinal and transversal component, and an anisotropic speed of sound. Finally, we discuss the fate of each excitation mode at the low and high density phase transitions limiting the quantum quasicrystal phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the observables of the one-dimensional model for anomalous transport in semiconductor devices where diffusion arises from scattering at dislocations at fixed random positions, known as L\'evy-Lorentz gas. Due to complex stochasticity in the system, direct investigations of such non-trivial dynamics are not possible; therefore, to gain insight into the microscopic properties, we use deterministic dynamics known as the Slicer Map and Fly-and-Die dynamics. We analytically derive the generalized position auto-correlation function of these dynamics and study the special case, the 3-point position correlation function. For this, we derive single parameter-dependent scaling and compare it with the numerically estimated 3-point position auto-correlation of the L\'evy-Lorentz gas, for which the analytical expression is still an open question. Here we obtained a remarkable agreement between them, irrespective of any functional relationship with time. Moreover, we demonstrate that the position moments and the position auto-correlations of these systems scale in the same fashion, provided the times are large enough and far enough apart. Other observables, such as velocity moments and correlations, are reported to distinguish the systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymptotically, we analytically derive the form of eigenvectors for two Fisher-Hartwig symbols besides those which were previously investigated in a $2016$ work due to Movassagh and Kadanoff, in which the authors characterized the eigenpairs of Toeplitz matrices generated by Fisher-Hartwig symbols with one singularity. To perform such computations, we extend their methods which consists of formulating an eigenvalue problem, obtained by a Wiener-Hopf method, from which a suitable winding number is defined for passing to Fourier space, and introducing a factorization dependent upon the winding number, for other Fisher-Hartwig symbols which have previously been defined in the literature. Following the computations required for the proof after obtaining the asymptotic approximation of the eigenvectors, we provide a table from which eigenvalues of one Fisher-Hartwig symbol for different complex valued functions $b$ can be inferred.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum circuit model which emulates the interface growth of the classical raise-and-peel model. Our model consists of Clifford unitary gates interspersed with projective measurements, applied according to prescribed feedback rules. We numerically find via large-scale simulations that, depending on the feedback rules, the system may undergo several measurement-induced entanglement transitions, including continuous transitions within a universality class not previously observed in hybrid random Clifford systems as well as a first-order transition.</description>

      <title>From the Fokker-Planck equation to a contact Hamiltonian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07334</link>

Abstract: The Fokker-Planck equation is one of the fundamental equations in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, and this equation is known to be derived from the Wasserstein gradient flow equation with a free energy. This gradient flow equation describes relaxation processes and is formulated on a Riemannian manifold. Meanwhile contact Hamiltonian systems are also known to describe relaxation processes. Hence a relation between these two equations is expected to be clarified, which gives a solid foundation in geometric statistical mechanics. In this paper a class of contact Hamiltonian systems is derived from a class of the Fokker-Planck equations on Riemannian manifolds. In the course of the derivation, the Fokker-Planck equation is shown to be written as a diffusion equation with a weighted Laplacian without any approximation, which enables to employ a theory of eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of generalized XY model using tensor renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the higher-order tensor renormalization group method to study the two-dimensional generalized XY model that admits integer and half-integer vortices. This model is the deformation of the classical XY model and has a rich phase structure consisting of nematic, ferromagnetic, and disordered phases and three transition lines belonging to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) and Ising class. We explore the model for a wide range of temperatures, $T$, and the deformation parameter, $\Delta$, and compute specific heat along with integer and half-integer magnetic susceptibility, finding both BKT-like and Ising-like transitions and the region where they meet.</description>

      <title>Physics of a granular pile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the onset of the subject, granular media have been defying the toolkit of statistical mechanics thus preventing from understanding their thermodynamical and rheological properties and making them one of the key remaining mysteries in science. In the present work, we offer a resolution to this problem in the case of static granular media by considering a collective behavior of 2D identical balls forming a granular pile in the gravity field, which allows us to develop its thermodynamics and rheology from the first principles. Besides the uncertainty due to rough substrate on which the pile is built, we uncover another one due to ambiguities occurring in the positions of some interior balls. Both are responsible for the thermodynamic description of the granular pile, which proves to be anything but ordinary. In particular, we show that a pile is characterized by three temperatures: one is infinite, the other is negative, and the third is of higher-order. Also, considering the fields of ball displacements $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ and the normal force deviations $\delta\boldsymbol{N}$ from the ideal isosceles triangular structure of a regular pile reveals the hyperbolic nature of the $\boldsymbol{\xi}$-field and ability of the $\delta\boldsymbol{N}$-field to change the characteristic type from hyperbolic to elliptic. The latter property not only explains the origin of force chains and provides an adequate description of the rheology of static granular media, but turned out to be instrumental for understanding of granular media thermodynamics. Our model should provide a basis for further grasping of granular media properties, in general.</description>

      <title>Quantum inverse scattering for the 20-vertex model up to Dynkin automorphism: crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, weak integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a novel application of the quantum-inverse scattering method for the 20-vertex model, building upon seminal work from Faddeev and Takhtajan on the study of Hamiltonian systems, with applications to crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, and integrability. In comparison to a previous work of the author in late $2023$ which characterized integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the 6-vertex model from integrability of inhomogeneous limit shapes, formalized in a work of Keating, Reshetikhin and Sridhar, notions similar to those of integrability can be realized for the 20-vertex model by studying new classes of higher-dimensional L-operators. In comparison to two-dimensional L-operators expressed in terms of Pauli basis elements, three-dimensional L-operators provided by Boos and colleagues have algebraic, combinatorial, and geometric, qualities, all of which impact leading order approximations of correlations, products of L-operators, the transfer matrix, and the quantum monodromy matrix in finite volume. In comparison to the inhomogeneous 6-vertex model, the 20-vertex model does not enjoy as strong of an integrability property through the existence of suitable action-angle variables, which is of interest to further explore, possibly from information on limit shapes given solutions to the three-dimensional Euler-Lagrange equations.</description>

      <title>Local ergotropy and its fluctuations across a dissipative quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit open Rabi model, focusing on local ergotropy - the maximum extractable work by acting solely on the two qubits - within a parameter regime where a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dissipative phase transition occurs. First, we aim to define a protocol for charging, storing, and discharging the two-qubit system, interpreted as the working principle of an open quantum battery. Second, we examine the impact of the phase transition on ergotropy and identify potential markers. To achieve these goals, we construct an ad-hoc charging unitary operator, leveraging our knowledge of the ground state near the transition to bring it into a decoherence-free state during storage. Using advanced numerical techniques based on matrix product state representation, we reveal that high couplings to an external bath approximately double the local ergotropy immediately post-charging. Over time we observe oscillatory behaviors in ergotropy and its fluctuations, which undergo significant changes near the transition, signaling its occurrence. Furthermore, we optimize local ergotropy over time using a physically inspired ansatz, enabling continuous work extraction (local ergotropy never reaches zero). Our work proposes a tunable, experimentally realizable protocol for work extraction, leveraging decoherence-free states and phase transitions. Additionally, it sheds light on the complex interaction between ergotropy and quantum phase transitions.</description>
