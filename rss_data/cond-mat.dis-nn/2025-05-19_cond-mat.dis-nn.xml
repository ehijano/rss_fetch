      <title>Exact multiple anomalous mobility edges in a flat band geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous mobility edges(AMEs), separating localized from {multifractal critical states}, represent a novel form of localization transition in quasiperiodic systems. However, quasi-periodic models exhibiting exact {AMEs} remain relatively rare, limiting the understanding of these transitions. In this work, we leverage the geometric structure of flat band models to construct exact {AMEs}. Specifically, we introduce an anti-symmetric diagonal quasi-periodic mosaic modulation, which consists of both quasi-periodic and constant potentials, into a cross-stitch flat band lattice. When the constant potential is zero, the system resides entirely in a localized phase, with its dispersion relation precisely determined. For non-zero constant potentials, we use a simple method to derive analytical solutions for a class of {AMEs}, providing exact results for both the {AMEs} and the system's localization and critical properties. Additionally, we propose a classical electrical circuit design to experimentally realize the system. This study offers valuable insights into the existence and characteristics of {AMEs} in quasi-periodic systems.</description>

      <title>Sequential topology: iterative topological phase transitions in finite chiral structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present theoretical and experimental results probing the rich topological structure of arbitrarily disordered finite tight binding Hamiltonians with chiral symmetry. We extend the known classification by considering the topological properties of phase boundaries themselves. That is, can Hamiltonians that are confined to being topologically marginal, also have distinct topological phases? For chiral structures, we answer this in the affirmative, where we define topological phase boundaries as having an unavoidable increase in the degeneracy of real space zero modes. By iterating this question, and considering how to enforce a Hamiltonian to a phase boundary, we give a protocol to find the largest dimension subspace of a disordered parameter space that has a certain order degeneracy of zero energy states, which we call \textit{sequential topology}. We show such degeneracy alters localisation and transport properties of zero modes, allowing us to experimentally corroborate our theory using a state-of-the-art coaxial cable platform. Our theory applies to systems with an arbitrary underlying connectivity or disorder, and so can be calculated for any finite chiral structure. Technological and theoretical applications of our work are discussed.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous probes of pseudogap and disorder by hard x-ray photoemission applied for a candidate thermoelectric Al-Pd-Ru quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk electronic structure of Al-Pd-Ru quasicrystal (QC) have been investigated by hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES). We have found an intrinsic pseudogap structure in which the spectral weight in the vicinity of the Fermi level (E_F) is remarkably suppressed at any photon energy. The valence-band HAXPES spectra and the asymmetry of the core-level peaks indicate a contribution of the Al sites to the electronic structure in the vicinity of E_F with less contributions from the Pd and Ru sites. The disorder effects are found in the core-level lineshapes of the Al-Pd-Ru QC, of which the widths are much broader than those of the other reference crystalline solids with less disorder.</description>

      <title>Emergent Thermalization Thresholds in Unitary Dynamics of Inhomogeneously Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the avalanche scenario for many-body localization (MBL) instability, we reverse the conventional set-up and ask whether a large weakly-disordered chain can thermalize a smaller, strongly-disordered chain when the composite system evolves unitarily. Using transport as a dynamical probe, we identify three distinct thermalization regimes as a function of the disorder strength of the smaller chain: (i) complete thermalization with self-averaging at weak disorder, (ii) realization-dependent thermalization with strong sample-to-sample fluctuations at intermediate disorder, and (iii) absence of thermalization at strong disorder. We find that the non-self-averaging regime broadens with the size of the weakly-disordered chain, revealing a nuanced interplay between disorder and system size. These results highlight how inhomogeneous disorder can induce emergent thermalization thresholds in closed quantum systems, providing direct access to disorder regimes where thermalization or its absence can be reliably observed.</description>

      <title>Where You Place the Norm Matters: From Prejudiced to Neutral Initializations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normalization layers, such as Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization, are central components in modern neural networks, widely adopted to improve training stability and generalization. While their practical effectiveness is well documented, a detailed theoretical understanding of how normalization affects model behavior, starting from initialization, remains an important open question. In this work, we investigate how both the presence and placement of normalization within hidden layers influence the statistical properties of network predictions before training begins. In particular, we study how these choices shape the distribution of class predictions at initialization, which can range from unbiased (Neutral) to highly concentrated (Prejudiced) toward a subset of classes. Our analysis shows that normalization placement induces systematic differences in the initial prediction behavior of neural networks, which in turn shape the dynamics of learning. By linking architectural choices to prediction statistics at initialization, our work provides a principled understanding of how normalization can influence early training behavior and offers guidance for more controlled and interpretable network design.</description>

      <title>Is Grokking a Computational Glass Relaxation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding neural network's (NN) generalizability remains a central question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying mechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration. This mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density) landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new potential ways for optimizer design.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Simulation of 1D Long-Range Interacting Systems at Any Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method that ensures efficient computation of one-dimensional quantum systems with long-range interactions across all temperatures. Our algorithm operates within a quasi-polynomial runtime for inverse temperatures up to $\beta={\rm poly}(\ln(n))$. At the core of our approach is the Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm, which typically does not guarantee efficiency. We have created a new truncation scheme for the matrix product operator of the quantum Gibbs states, which allows us to control the error analytically. Additionally, our method can be applied to simulate the time evolution of systems with long-range interactions, achieving significantly better precision than that offered by the Lieb-Robinson bound.</description>

      <title>Learning transitions in classical Ising models and deformed toric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditional probability distributions describe the effect of learning an initially unknown classical state through Bayesian inference. Here we demonstrate the existence of a learning transition, having signatures in the long distance behavior of conditional correlation functions, in the two-dimensional classical Ising model. This transition, which arises when learning local energy densities, extends all the way from the infinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The intersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising transition is a novel tricritical point. Our model for learning also describes the effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which interpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial product state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies that the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak measurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum phase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a replica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out the phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo techniques. Our methods can be extended to study the more general effects of learning on both classical and quantum states.</description>
