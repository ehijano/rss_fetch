      <title>3-Dimensional Model Based Iterative Reconstruction of Magnetisation in a Nanowire Structure Using Holographic Vector Field Electron Tomography Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods for characterisation of 3D magnetic spin structures are necessary to advance the performance of 3D magnetic nanoscale technologies. However, as the component dimensions approach the nanometre range, it becomes more challenging to analyse 3D magnetic configurations with the appropriate spatial resolution. In this paper, we present a method based on Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in which model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) is used to reconstruct the most probable magnetisation in an exemplar nanostructure. This method is based on relating electron phase measurements to the magnetic configuration of the nanostructure, and therefore, the method is subject to certain limitations. In this proof-of-concept experiment, MBIR was tested on an L-shaped ferromagnetic cobalt nanowire, fabricated using focused electron beam induced deposition. Off-axis electron holography was used to acquire a tomographic tilt series of electron holograms, which were analysed to measure magnetic electron phase shift over two tilt arcs with up to $ \pm 60$ deg tilt range. Then, a 3D magnetisation vector field consistent with the tomographic phase measurements was reconstructed, revealing multiple magnetic domains within the nanowire. The reconstructed magnetisation is accurate for magnetic domains larger than 50 nm, and higher resolution can be achieved by the continued development of tomographic reconstruction algorithms.</description>

      <title>Excitons and trions in CrSBr bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically the neutral and charged excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors with anisotropic dispersion of charge carriers. Such a situation is realized in CrSBr-based van der Waals heterostructures. We calculate the binding energies of excitons and trions and explore their dependence on the mass ratio, dielectric screening, and interlayer distance in bilayer structures. We also address the correlations between the excitons and the Fermi sea of resident electrons and the effects of exciton-light coupling, including the radiative decay and long-range electron-hole interaction. The estimates for CrSBr bilayers are in reasonable agreement with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Charge and heat pumping in the Rice-Mele chain at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that quantized topological charge pumping takes place in the half filled Rice-Mele chain performing a closed cycle in parameter space. We extend previous studies to the case of charge and heat transport at arbitrary filling and temperature using the corresponding continuity equation with focus in the non-interacting case. The amount of charge and heat transported for any adiabatic time dependence of the parameters is given by a double integral of an analytical function. We find that quantized transport is lost except in trivial cases. In particular, for popular pumping circuits used which lead to quantized non-trivial charge transport at zero temperature, the heat transported in the cycle vanishes. For other pumping circuits, there is a heat transport among even and odd sites of the chain and the environment. As the temperature is increased, the transported charge and heat decrease and vanish at infinite temperature.</description>

      <title>Intertwined topological phases in TaAs2 nanowires with giant magnetoresistance and quantum coherent surface transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanowires (NWs) of topological materials are emerging as an exciting platform to probe and engineer new quantum phenomena that are hard to access in bulk phase. Their quasi-one-dimensional geometry and large surface-to-bulk ratio unlock new expressions of topology and highlight surface states. TaAs2, a compensated semimetal, is a topologically rich material harboring nodal-line, weak topological insulator (WTI), C2-protected topological crystalline insulator, and Zeeman field-induced Weyl semimetal phases. We report the synthesis of TaAs2 NWs in situ encapsulated in a dielectric SiO2 shell, which enabled us to probe rich magnetotransport phenomena, including metal-to-insulator transition and strong signatures of topologically non-trivial transport at remarkably high temperatures, direction-dependent giant positive and negative magnetoresistance, and a double pattern of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations, demonstrating coherent surface transport consistent with the two Dirac cones of a WTI surface. The coexistence and susceptibility of topological phases to external stimuli have potential applications in spintronics and nanoscale quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</description>

      <title>Third-order and fifth-order nonlinear spin-current generation in $g$-wave and $i$-wave altermagnets and perfect spin-current diode based on $f$-wave magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A prominent feature of $d$-wave altermagnets is the pure spin current generated in the absence of spin-orbit interactions. In the context of symmetry, there are the $s$-wave, the $p$-wave, the $d$-wave, the $f$-wave, the $g$-wave and the $i$-wave magnets. In this paper, making an analytic study of two-band Hamiltonian systems coupled with electrons, we demonstrate unexpectedly that only the $\ell $-th order nonlinear spin current proportional to $E^{\ell }$ is generated in higher-symmetric magnets when the number of the nodes is $\ell +1$. Here $E$ is applied electric field. Indeed, only the third-order nonlinear spin current is generated in $g$-wave altermagnets in two and three dimensions, while only the fifth-order spin current is generated in $i$-wave altermagnets in two dimensions. In particular, only the second-order nonlinear spin current is generated in $f$% -wave magnets in two dimensions, which leads to a perfect nonreciprocal spin current. Namely, it can be used as a perfect spin-current diode. They are useful for efficient spin-current generation. On the other hand, there is no spin-current generation in $p$-wave magnets in two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics of a quasi-one-dimensional electron in the quantum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study electron spin dynamics whose movement is restricted to the lowest one dimensional subband channel ($G \le 2e^2/h $), through nuclear spin relaxation rate measurement ($1/T_1$). We observe an unusual double-peak structure in the $1/T_1$ profile below the lowest subband level, where the up and down spin edge channel is still largely overlap. This profile significantly deviates from the behavior predicted by a non-interacting electron model, in which the only source of relaxation is through thermal fluctuations near the Fermi level. Our experimental results, supported by theoretical calculations, suggest that enhanced electron-electron interactions at the center of a quantum point contact are the likely origin of the observed double-peak structures.</description>

      <title>Charge-induced energy shift of a single-spin qubit under a magnetic-field gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An electron confined by a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) can be displaced by changes in electron occupations of surrounding QDs owing to the Coulomb interaction. For a single-spin qubit in an inhomogeneous magnetic field, such a displacement of the host electron results in a qubit energy shift which must be handled carefully for high-fidelity operations. Here we spectroscopically investigate the qubit energy shift induced by changes in charge occupations of nearby QDs for a silicon single-spin qubit in a magnetic-field gradient. Between two different charge configurations of an adjacent double QD, a spin qubit shows an energy shift of about 4 MHz, which necessitates strict management of electron positions over a QD array. We confirm a correlation between the qubit frequency and the charge configuration by using a postselection analysis.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced enhancement of the efficiency in a quantum Hall thermal machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a thermal machine based on a single closed quantum Hall edge channel forming a quantum dot. It is tunneling coupled with two quantum Hall states at $\nu=2$ kept at different temperatures, the hot one being also driven out-of-equilibrium by means of a periodic train of Lorentzian voltage pulses. This geometry is ideal to characterize the role played by the electron-electron interaction present within these channels on the efficiency of the machine. Here, it is possible to identify regions in the parameter space where the interaction leads to an improvement of the performances of the devices.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent photovoltage in graphene/MoS2-based field-effect transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that Terahertz sensors can effectively detect the spin resonances of Dirac fermions in graphene. The associated photovoltaic measurement technique allows for the investigation of the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in graphene as well as its topological properties from microwave to Terahertz frequencies. In this work, using graphene/MoS2-based Field-Effect Transistors, we observed a magnetic resonance photovoltage signal in the Gigahertz range that is independent of the gate bias. The dispersion of the associated spin-flip transitions remains intriguingly unaffected by the MoS2 layer. In parallel, the spin-related signal consistently appears as a drop in photovoltage, regardless of the signal's polarity or origin, whether it arises from plasma wave rectification or thermoelectric effects. This behavior is interpreted as a decrease in the system's spin polarization due to spin-dependent recombination or scattering of photocarriers. Understanding the various photovoltaic signals in highly sensitive Gigahertz/Terahertz sensors paves the way for exploring spin-dependent mechanisms in two-dimensional quantum materials, influenced by proximity effects such as spin-orbit coupling, topology, and magnetism.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Non-relativistic Edelstein effect in p-wave magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin and efficiency of charge-to-spin conversion, known as the Edelstein effect (EE), has been typically linked to spin-orbit coupling mechanisms, which require materials with heavy elements within a non-centrosymmetric environment. Here we demonstrate that the high efficiency of spin-charge conversion can be achieved even without spin-orbit coupling in the recently identified coplanar p-wave magnets. The non-relativistic Edelstein effect (NREE) in these magnets exhibits a distinct phenomenology compared to the relativistic EE, characterized by a strongly anisotropic response and an out-of-plane polarized spin density resulting from the spin symmetries. We illustrate the NREE through minimal tight-binding models, allowing a direct comparison to different systems. Through first-principles calculations, we further identify the p-wave candidate material CeNiAsO as a high-efficiency NREE material, revealing a 25 times larger response than the maximally achieved relativistic EE and other reported NREE in non-collinear magnetic systems with broken time-reversal symmetry. This highlights the potential for efficient spin-charge conversion in p-wave magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Fully nonequilibrium Hall response from Berry curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In topological materials, Berry curvature leads to intrinsic Hall responses. Focusing on time-reversal symmetric systems with broken inversion symmetry, a spontaneoous (zero magnetic field) Hall effect is expected to develop under an applied electric field. Motivated by recent developments in Weyl-Kondo semimetals, here we advance a fully nonequilibrium (FNE) Hall response due to the Berry curvature. In particular, we show that, while the spontaneous Hall current is quadratic in the previously described regime of weak electric field, due to the contribution from the dipole moment of the Berry curvature, the FNE Hall response for non-perturbative electric fields is not controlled by the Berry curvature dipole. Remarkably, the FNE Hall response resembles what happens in systems that break the microscopic time-reversal symmetry. We illustrate the universality of these results by comparing them with their counterparts in systems with any higher-multipole of the Berry curvature. The implications of our results for the understanding of strongly correlated topological semimetals are discussed.</description>

      <title>Unconventional gapping behavior in a kagome superconductor</title>

Abstract: Determining the types of superconducting order in quantum materials is a challenge, especially when multiple degrees of freedom, such as bands or orbitals, contribute to the fermiology and when superconductivity competes, intertwines, or coexists with other symmetry-breaking orders. Here, we study the Kagome-lattice superconductor CsV3Sb5, in which multiband superconductivity coexists with a charge order that substantially reduces the compound's space group symmetries. Through a combination of thermodynamic as well as electrical and thermal transport measurements, we uncover two superconducting regimes with distinct transport and thermodynamic characteristics, while finding no evidence for a phase transition separating them. Thermodynamic measurements reveal substantial quasiparticle weight in a high-temperature regime. At lower temperatures, this weight is removed via the formation of a second gap. The two regimes are sharply distinguished by a pronounced enhancement of the upper critical field at low temperatures and by a switch in the anisotropy of the longitudinal thermal conductivity as a function of in-plane magnetic field orientation. We argue that the band with a gap opening at lower temperatures continues to host low-energy quasiparticles, possibly due to a nodal structure of the gap. Taken together, our results present evidence for band-selective superconductivity with remarkable decoupling of the (two) superconducting gaps. The commonly employed multiband scenario, whereby superconductivity emerges in a primary band and is then induced in other bands appears to fail in this unconventional kagome superconductor. Instead, band-selective superconducting pairing is a paradigm that seems to unify seemingly contradicting results in this intensely studied family of materials and beyond.</description>

      <title>Synchronized motion of gold nanoparticles in an optothermal trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezers have revolutionized particle manipulation at the micro- and nanoscale, playing a critical role in fields such as plasmonics, biophysics, and nanotechnology. While traditional optical trapping methods primarily rely on optical forces to manipulate and organize particles, recent studies suggest that optothermal traps in surfactant solutions can induce unconventional effects such as enhanced trapping stiffness and increased diffusion. Thus, there is a need for further exploration of this system to gain a deeper understanding of the forces involved. This work investigates the behaviour of gold nanoparticles confined in an optothermal trap around a heated anchor particle in a surfactant (CTAC) solution. We observe unexpected radial confinement and synchronized rotational diffusion of particles at micrometre-scale separations from the anchor particle. These dynamics differ from known optical binding and thermophoretic effects, suggesting unexplored forces facilitated by the surfactant environment. This study expands the understanding of optothermal trapping driven by anchor plasmonic particles and introduces new possibilities for nanoparticle assembly, offering insights with potential applications in nanoscale fabrication and materials science.</description>

      <title>Mechanical stability conditions for 3D and 2D crystals under arbitrary load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper gathers and unifies mechanical stability conditions for all symmetry classes of 3D and 2D materials under arbitrary load. The methodology is based on the spectral decomposition of the fourth-order stiffness tensors mapped to a second-order tensors using orthonormal (Mandel) notation, and the verification of the positivity of the so-called Kelvin moduli. An explicit set of stability conditions for 3D and 2D crystals of higher symmetry is also included, as well as a Mathematica notebook that allows mechanical stability analysis for crystals, stress-free and stressed, of arbitrary symmetry under arbitrary loads.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of Photonic Temporal Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exotic forms of wave control have been emerging by engineering matter in space and time. In this framework, temporal photonic interfaces, i.e., abrupt changes in the electromagnetic properties of a material, have been shown to induce temporal scattering phenomena dual to spatial reflection and refraction, at the basis of photonic time crystals and space-time metamaterials. Despite decades-old theoretical studies on these topics, and recent experimental demonstrations, the careful modeling of these phenomena has been lagging behind. Here, we develop from first principles a rigorous model of the electrodynamics of temporal photonic interfaces, highlighting the crucial role of the mechanisms driving time variations. We demonstrate that the boundary conditions and conservation laws associated with temporal scattering may substantially deviate from those commonly employed in the literature, based on their microscopic implementation. Our results open new vistas for both fundamental investigations over light-matter interactions in time-varying structures and for the prospect of their future implementations and applications in optics and photonics.</description>

      <title>Typical altermagnetism with huge nonrelativistic spin-split and flat band in the bulk CoF$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a third phase named altermagnet, has been introduced to describe a special magnetic state and some materials are classified as altermagnets. Here, our first principles calculations indicate that the bulk CoF$_2$ is an altermagnet with a huge spin-split and flat bands near the Fermi energy. By comparing the results with and without spin-orbit coupling, it can be shown that the huge spin splitting is not caused by relativistic effects but rather by a special symmetry. There are also flat bands near the Fermi energy which can be adjusted by changing the direction of the magnetic moment. From the band structure, we obtain a spin-resolved effective low-energy model that describes a quasi-two-dimensional hole gas with two independent spin components, leading to exotic transport phenomena that are distinct from those in conventional two-dimensional or bulk materials. Therefore, the bulk CoF$_2$ is a typical altermagnet with a huge nonrelativistic spin-split and flat bands which deserves further study for the potential spintronics and electronics applications.</description>

      <title>Work-function and structures of (100), (111) and (101) Au surfaces with/without oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (100), (101), and (111) Au surfaces with chemisorbed oxygen of varying coverages are studied using density and hybrid functional theories and experiments. This clarifies the work function (f), surface structures, stability, and density of states. f of the (100), (101), and (111) Au surfaces calculated using the hybrid functional is 5.06-5.23 eV, and consistent with the reported experimental f of polycrystalline Au films (5.1 +- 0.1 eV). The hybrid functional calculations on f at (100) and (101) AuO surfaces agree with the experimental f. However, in the reported and present experiments, the difference in f between the Au and AuO surfaces (Df) is 0.8-0.9 eV. The reported theoretical Df at (111) surface (3 eV) completely contradicts this value, which has been unresolved. We find that when O atoms are at (111) surface and subsurface, the theoretical Df at (111) agrees with experimental Df (0.8-0.9 eV). This state is considered to correspond to the experiments, because the oxygen-chemisorption is more stable in this state than when O atoms are at (111) surface only. This property is unique to the (111) surface. The prediction of chemisorbed-oxygen-induced disorders that are experimentally observed provides more evidence for the veracity of these calculations.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics and phonon dispersion of van der Waals layered ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) layered ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 shows great potential in two-dimensional spintronic application due to its robust room-temperature ferromagnetism and large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Despite the tremendous progress in the spintronic and electronic studies of Fe3GaTe2, much less effort has been spent on the understanding of lattice dynamics and its possible interaction with spintronic and electronic degrees of freedom in Fe3GaTe2. In this work, by combining Raman spectroscopic data in a wide range of pressure (atmospheric pressure~19.5 GPa) and temperature (80 K~690 K) with first-principles calculation results, we systematically studied the lattice dynamics and phonon dispersion of Fe3GaTe2. Our results show that the phonon energies of Fe3GaTe2 located at 126.0 cm-1 and 143.5 cm-1 originate from the E_2g^2 and A_1g^1 vibration modes, respectively, and the nature of the E_2g^2 mode is anharmonic while that of the A_1g^1 mode is quasi-harmonic. Furthermore, the spin-phonon coupling in Fe3GaTe2 is discovered by identifying the anomalies in the Raman data right below the Curie temperature of 360 K, in which the phonon energies and the full widths at half maximum of the E_2g^2 mode clearly deviate from the classical anharmonic model. Our findings are valuable for fundamental studies and potential applications of vdW Fe3GaTe2-based materials and devices under variable temperature and pressure conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twistronics has received much attention as a new method to manipulate the properties of 2D van der Waals structures by introducing moir\'e patterns through a relative rotation between two layers. Here we begin a theoretical exploration of twistronics beyond the realm of van der Waals materials by developing a first-principles description of the electronic structure and interlayer interactions of ultrathin perovskite bilayers. We construct both an ab initio tight-binding model as well as a minimal 3-band effective model for the valence bands of monolayers and bilayers of oxides derived from the Ruddlesden-Popper phase of perovskites, which is amenable to thin-layer formation. We illustrate the approach with the specific example of Sr$_2$TiO$_4$ layers but also provide model parameters for Ca$_2$TiO$_4$ and Ba$_2$TiO$_4$ .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered materials have attracted significant interest because of their unique properties. Van der Waals heterostructures based on transition-metal dichalcogenides have been extensively studied because of potential optoelectronic applications. We investigate the optical response of a light-emitting tunneling structure based on a WSe\textsubscript{2} monolayer as an active emission material using the photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) experiments performed at low temperature of 5~K. We found that the application of the bias voltage allows us to change both a sign and a value of free carriers concentrations. Consequently, we address the several excitonic complexes emerging in PL spectra under applied bias voltage. The EL signal was also detected and ascribed to the emission in a high-carrier-concentration regime. The results show that the excitation mechanisms in the PL and EL are different, resulting in various emissions in both types of experimental techniques.</description>

Abstract: We use time-resolved thermometry to monitor the decay of nonequilibrium quasiparticles in superconducting Al in the temperature range from $0.3\,$K to $1.2\,$K. The quasiparticle lifetime at higher temperatures ($T&gt;0.7\,$K) agrees well with the calculated energy flow from electrons to phonons, but at lower temperatures it is significantly shorter than the theory predicts. We show well-defined internal equilibrium of quasiparticle system in the studied thermal transients, which implicates that quasiparticle-quasiparticle relaxation is much faster than electron-phonon interaction.</description>

      <title>Strongly nonlinear nanocavity exciton-polaritons in gate-tunable monolayer semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong coupling between light and matter in an optical cavity provides a pathway to giant polariton nonlinearity, where effective polariton-polariton interactions are mediated by materials' nonlinear responses. The pursuit of such enhanced nonlinearity at low optical excitations, potentially down to the single-particle level, has been a central focus in the field, inspiring the exploration of novel solid-state light-matter systems. Here, we experimentally realize extremely nonlinear and robust cavity exciton-polaritons by coupling a charge-tunable MoSe2 monolayer to a photonic crystal nanocavity. We show that the observed polariton nonlinearity arises from increased exciton dephasing at high populations, leading to diminished exciton-photon coupling and ultimately the breakdown of the strong coupling condition. Remarkably, the strong mode confinement of the nanocavity enables all-optical switching of the cavity spectrum at ultralow optical excitation energies, down to ~4 fJ, on picosecond timescales. Our work paves the way for further exploration of 2D nonlinear exciton-polaritons, with promising applications in both classical and quantum all-optical information processing.</description>

Abstract: Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in a 2D topological insulator due to Majorana bound states is studied via the Lorenz ratio in the single-particle picture. We study the scaling of the Lorenz ratio in the presence and absence of Majorana bound states with inelastic scattering modeled using a Buttiker voltage-temperature probe. We compare our results with that seen in a quantum dot junction in the Luttinger liquid picture operating in the topological Kondo regime. We explore the scaling of the Lorentz ratio in our setup when either phase and momentum relaxation or phase relaxation is present. This scaling differs from that predicted by the Luttinger liquid picture for both uncoupled and coupled Majorana cases.</description>

Abstract: Topology, like symmetry, is a fundamental concept in understanding general properties of physical systems. In condensed matter, nontrivial topology may manifest itself as singular features in the energy spectrum or the quantization of electrical properties such as conductance and magnetic flux. Using microwave spectroscopy, we determine that a superconducting circuit with three Josephson tunnel junctions in parallel can possess degeneracies indicative of \emph{intrinsic} nontrivial topology. We identify three topological invariants, one of which is related to a hidden quantum mechanical supersymmetry. Measurements show that devices fabricated in different topological regimes fall on a simple phase diagram which should be robust to junction imperfections and geometric inductance. Josephson tunnel junction circuits, which are readily fabricated with conventional microlithography techniques, allow access to a wide range of topological systems that may have no condensed matter analog. Notable spectral features of these circuits, such as degeneracies and flat bands, may find use in quantum information, sensing, and metrology.</description>

Abstract: A Josephson junction, formed between two phase-biased superconductors and a normal metal, hosts a discrete spectrum of Andreev bound states (ABS). In this paper, we develop a theory for long ballistic Andreev interferometers in two-dimensional metals. We consider three frameworks in our theoretical analysis: (i) perturbation theory in the tunneling amplitudes; (ii) non-perturbative transport theory; and (iii) physically motivated approximations to visualize the conductance maps in the (flux, voltage) plane. We find a non-standard phase-sensitive Andreev reflection process in ballistic interferometers that couples the supercurrent to the non-equilibrium populations of the ABS in the normal region. Furthermore, our model shows that conductance spectroscopy follows the spectrum of the ABS in long junctions. We also discuss our results in terms of the semiclassical theory, the classical orbits being the one-dimensional Andreev tubes. Our theoretical analysis captures the results of recent experiments by the Penn State and Harvard groups.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected flatness in chiral moir\'e heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of delicate correlated phases in twisted heterostructures of graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides suggests that moir\'e flat bands are intrinsically resilient against certain types of disorder. Here, we investigate the robustness of moir\'e flat bands in the chiral limit of the Bistrizer-MacDonald model -- applicable to both platforms in certain limits -- and demonstrate drastic differences between the first magic angle and higher magic angles in response to chiral symmetric disorder that arise, for instance, from lattice relaxation. Using a hidden constant of motion, we decompose the non-abelian gauge field induced by interlayer tunnelings into two decoupled abelian ones, whose effective magnetic field splits into an anomalous contribution and a fluctuating part. The anomalous field maps the moir\'e flat bands onto a zeroth Dirac Landau level, whose flatness withstands any chiral symmetric perturbation due to a topological index theorem -- thereby underscoring a topological mechanism for band flatness. Only the first magic angle can fully harness this topological protection due to its weak fluctuating magnetic field. In higher magic angles, the amplitude of fluctuations largely exceeds the anomalous contribution, which we find results in an extremely large sensitivity to microscopic details. Through numerical simulations, we study various types of disorder and identify the processes that are enhanced or suppressed in the chiral limit. Interestingly, we find that the topological suppression of disorder broadening persists away from the chiral limit and is further accentuated by isolating a single sublattice polarized flat band in energy. Our analysis suggests the Berry curvature hotspot at the top of the $K$ and $K'$ valence band in the transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers is essential for the stability of its moir\'e flat bands and their correlated states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a nonlocal transport phenomenon that creates/detects Cooper-pair correlations between distant places. It is also the basis of Cooper-pair splitting to generate remote entanglement. Although CAR has been extensively studied in semiconductors proximity-coupled to a superconductor, it has been very difficult to observe it in a topological insulator (TI). Here we report the first observation of CAR in a proximitized TI nanowire (TINW). We performed local and nonlocal conductance spectroscopy on mesoscopic TINW devices in which superconducting (Nb) and metallic (Pt/Au) contacts are made on a bulk-insulating TINW. The local conductance detected a hard gap, accompanied by the appearance of Andreev bound states that can reach zero-bias, while a negative nonlocal conductance was occasionally observed upon sweeping the chemical potential, giving evidence for CAR. Surprisingly, the CAR signal was detected even over 1.5 $\mu$m, which implies that pair correlations extend over a length scale much longer than the expected superconducting coherence length of either Nb or the proximitised TINW. Such a long-range CAR effect is possibly due to an intricate role of disorder in proximitized nanowires. Also, our 0.9-$\mu$m device presented a decent Cooper-pair splitting efficiency of up to 0.5.</description>

Abstract: Visualizing the electron dynamics in four dimensions of space and time is crucial to the understanding of several ubiquitous processes in nature. Hence, ultrafast X-ray and electron imaging tools have been developed to probe the dynamics of matter by means of the time-resolved diffraction imaging (TRDI). In this work, we report an extension of the theory underlying the TRDI to the case of the laser-driven electron dynamics in solid state systems. We demonstrate that the TRDI signal encodes essential information about the time-dependent electron density of the system under study and thus makes it possible to decipher the ultrafast quantum dynamics and the electron transfer phenomena in solids. We apply the developed approach to image the laser-driven electron dynamics in neutral graphene showing that the predictions made by the fully quantum version of the TRDI deviate significantly from those obtained with the conventional semiclassical approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose two theoretical models of a metallic N\'{e}el ordered antiferromagnet with charge-density wave order which shows the anomalous Hall effect. In our models a combination of the N\'{e}el order and the charge-density wave order results in spin splitting of the conducting fermions. In addition, spin-orbit coupling is required to drive the anomalous Hall effect. In the first model we analyzed the effects of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling, and of the intrinsic $d-$wave spin-orbit coupling in the second model.</description>

      <title>Exchange anisotropies in microwave-driven singlet-triplet qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hole spin qubits are rapidly emerging as the workhorse of semiconducting quantum processors because of their large spin-orbit interaction, enabling fast all-electric operations at low power. However, spin-orbit interaction also causes non-uniformities in devices, resulting in locally varying qubit energies and site-dependent anisotropies. While these anisotropies can be used to drive single-spins, if not properly harnessed, they can hinder the path toward large-scale quantum processors. Here, we report on microwave-driven singlet-triplet qubits in planar germanium and use them to investigate the anisotropy of two spins in a double quantum dot. We show two distinct operating regimes depending on the magnetic field direction. For in-plane fields, the two spins are largely anisotropic, and electrically tunable, which enables to measure all the available transitions; coherence times exceeding 3 $\mu$s are extracted. For out-of-plane fields, they have an isotropic response but preserve the substantial energy difference required to address the singlet-triplet qubit. Even in this field direction, where the qubit lifetime is strongly affected by nuclear spins, we find 400 ns coherence times. Our work adds a valuable tool to investigate and harness the anisotropy of spin qubits and can be implemented in any large-scale NxN device, facilitating the path towards scalable quantum processors.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Discovery of Kagome Materials in Transition Metal Oxide Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome materials are known for hosting exotic quantum states, including quantum spin liquids, charge density waves, and unconventional superconductivity. The search for kagome monolayers is driven by their ability to exhibit neat and well-defined kagome bands near the Fermi level, which are more easily realized in the absence of interlayer interactions. However, this absence also destabilizes the monolayer forms of many bulk kagome materials, posing significant challenges to their discovery. In this work, we propose a strategy to address this challenge by utilizing oxygen vacancies in transition metal oxides within a "1+3" design framework. Through high-throughput computational screening of 349 candidate materials, we identified 12 thermodynamically stable kagome monolayers with diverse electronic and magnetic properties. These materials were classified into three categories based on their lattice geometry, symmetry, band gaps, and magnetic configurations. Detailed analysis of three representative monolayers revealed kagome band features near their Fermi levels, with orbital contributions varying between oxygen 2p and transition metal d states. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the "1+3" strategy, offering a promising approach to uncovering low-dimensional kagome materials and advancing the exploration of their quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions in a topological superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum phase transitions in a topological Josephson junction with an embedded ferromagnetic layer, revealing a rich landscape of critical phenomena. The low-energy excitations comprise Majorana fermions propagating along the junction, coupled to the magnons in the ferromagnet. Based on mean-field and renormalization group arguments, we predict Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions in this system, both in the case of a magnetic easy-plane and weak easy-axis anisotropy. In the latter case, this is based on an emergent effective easy-plane, spanned by the easy-axis and the component of the magnetization which couples to the Majoranas. We conclude by presenting a conjecture for the full phase diagram of the model. It covers BKT transitions as well as exotic multicritical and supersymmetric points known from related models of interacting real fermions and bosons.</description>

      <title>Isolated zero mode in a quantum computer from a duality twist</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02387v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the interplay of dualities, generalized symmetries, and topological defects beyond theoretical models is an important challenge in condensed matter physics and quantum materials. A simple model exhibiting this physics is the transverse-field Ising model, which can host atopological defect that performs the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. When acting on one point in space, this duality defect imposes the duality twisted boundary condition and binds a single zero mode. This zero mode is unusual as it lacks a localized partner in the same $Z_2$ sector and has an infinite lifetime, even in finite systems. Using Floquet driving of a closed Ising chain with a duality defect, we generate this zero mode in a digital quantum computer. We detect the mode by measuring its associated persistent autocorrelation function using an efficient sampling protocol and a compound strategy for error mitigation. We also show that the zero mode resides at the domain wall between two regions related by a Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. Finally, we highlight the robustness of the isolated zero mode to integrability- and symmetry-breaking perturbations. Our findings provide a method for exploring exotic topological defects, associated with noninvertible generalized symmetries, in digitized quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Engineering Symmetry Breaking Interfaces by Nanoscale Structural-Energetics in Orthorhombic Perovskite Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The atomic configuration of phases and their interfaces is fundamental to materials design and engineering. Here, we unveil a transition metal oxide interface, whose formation is driven by energetic influences - epitaxial tensile strain versus oxygen octahedra connectivity - that compete in determining the orientation of an orthorhombic perovskite film. We study this phenomenon in a system of LaVO$_3$ grown on (101) DyScO$_3$, using atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy to measure intrinsic markers of orthorhombic symmetry. We identify that the film resolves this energetic conflict by switching its orientation by 90 degrees at an atomically-flat plane within its volume, not at the film/substrate interface. At either side of this "switching plane", characteristic orthorhombic distortions tend to zero to couple mismatched oxygen octahedra rotations. The resulting boundary is highly energetic, which makes it a priori unlikely; by using second-principles atomistic modeling, we show how its formation requires structural relaxation of an entire film grown beyond a critical thickness measuring tens of unit cells. The switching plane breaks the inversion symmetry of the Pnma orthorhombic structure, and sharply joins two regions, a thin intermediate layer and the film bulk, that are held under different mechanical strain states. By therefore contacting two distinct phases of one compound that would never otherwise coexist, this alternative type of interface opens new avenues for nanoscale engineering of functional systems, such as a chemically-uniform but magnetically inhomogeneous heterostructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temperature constraints are highly desirable in the experimental setup when seeking the synthesis of new carbon structures. Fluctuations of the Dirac field result in temperature-dependent corrections to the Helfrich-Canham formulation, which governs the classical elasticity of the graphene membrane at equilibrium. Here, we examine the emergent shapes allowed by the effective model up to quadratic order in Ricci curvature and discuss the constraints required to observe them. We determine the mechanical stability conditions and provide a phase diagram characterized by the appearance of a critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ that distinguishes between carbon nanotube and fullerene phases. The observation of minimal and developable surfaces is anticipated in the high- and low-temperature regimes, respectively. Additionally, a Beltrami trumpet surface is forecasted when the membrane is subjected to an external source balancing out internal Helfrich stresses.</description>

      <title>Designing Phase Sensitive Probes of Monopole Superconducting Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distinct from familiar $s$-, $p$-, or $d$-wave pairings, the monopole superconducting order represents a novel class of pairing order arising from nontrivial monopole charge of the Cooper pair. In the weak-coupling regime, this order can emerge when pairing occurs between Fermi surfaces with different Chern numbers in, for example, doped Weyl semimetal systems. However, the phase of monopole pairing order is not well-defined over an entire Fermi surface, making it challenging to design experiments sensitive to both its symmetry and topology. To address this, we propose a scheme based on symmetry and topological principles to identify this elusive pairing order through a set of phase-sensitive Josephson experiments. By examining the discrepancy between global and local angular momentum of the pairing order, we can unveil the monopole charge of the pairing order. We demonstrate the proposed probe of monopole pairing order through analytic and numerical studies of Josephson coupling in models of monopole superconductor junctions. This work opens a promising avenue to uncover the unique topological properties of monopole pairing orders and to distinguish them from known pairing orders based on spherical harmonic symmetry.</description>

      <title>Correlation versus Dissipation in a Non-Hermitian Anderson Impurity Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the competition between strong correlations and dissipation in quantum impurity systems from the Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime by developing a slave-boson theory for a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss. Notably, in the non-Hermitian Kondo regime, strong correlations qualitatively change the nature of dissipation through renormalization effects, where the effective one-body loss is suppressed and emergent many-body dissipation characterized by the complex-valued hybridization is generated. We unveil the mechanism of a dissipative quantum phase transition of the Kondo state on the basis of this renormalization effect, which counterintuitively enhances the lifetime of the impurity against loss. We also find a crossover from the non-Hermitian Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime dominated by one-body dissipation. Our results can be tested in a wide variety of setups such as quantum dots coupled to electronic leads and quantum point contacts in ultracold Fermi gases.</description>

Abstract: We explore the possibility of obtaining new superconductor candidates from functionalized MXene compounds Zr$_2$NS$_2$, Zr$_2$NCl$_2$, and Sc$_2$NCl$_2$ based on $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT). The predicted superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure may reach up to 9.48 K (Zr$_2$NS$_2$). Strain-induced $T_c$ enhancement is demonstrated with an example case for Zr$_2$NCl$_2$. We note a correlation between the profiles of superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ across the Fermi surface for all compounds, which are likely influenced by their modified electronic bandstructure components.</description>

      <title>Enhanced laser-induced single-cycle terahertz generation in a spintronic emitter with a gradient interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of spintronic emitters of broadband THz pulses relies on designing heterostructures where processes of laser-driven spin current generation and subsequent spin-to-charge current conversion are the most efficient. An interface between ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers in the emitter is one of the critical elements. Here, we study experimentally single-cycle THz pulse generation from a laser-pulse excited Pt/Co emitter with a composition gradient interface between Pt and Co and compare it with the emission from a conventional Pt/Co structure with an abrupt interface. We find that the gradient interface enhances the efficiency of optics-to-THz conversion by a factor of two in a wide range of optical fluences up to 3 mJ cm$^{-2}$. We reveal that this enhancement is caused by a pronounced increase in transmittance of the laser-driven spin-polarized current through the gradient interface compared to the abrupt one. Furthermore, we find that such a transmission deteriorates with laser fluence due to the spin accumulation effect.</description>
