      <title>Next challenges in semi-leptonic B decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice calculation of $B\to D^{(*)}\ell\bar\nu$ decay form factors is now available from multiple lattice collaborations for both zero-recoil limit and non-zero recoil kinematics. Yet, there are a number of challenges we face to better control the systematic errors and to extend the application of lattice calculations to related quantities. The subjects are chosen from my own perspective and not meant to be conprehensive.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding of the inclusive vs exclusive puzzle in the $|V_{cb}|$ determinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice calculation may play an important role to understand the cause of the long-standing puzzle among the determination of $|V_{cb}|$. The key element is the computation of the inclusive decay rate, for which the formalism is under development. The method has its own problem: the approximation of the phase-space factor and finite volume effect. I discuss the current status of such study and future prospects.</description>

      <title>The distribution amplitude of the $\eta_c$-meson at leading twist from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution amplitudes are functions of non-perturbative matrix elements describing the hadronization of quarks and gluons. Thanks to factorization theorems, they can be used to compute the scattering amplitude of high-energy processes. Recently, new ideas have allowed their computation using lattice QCD, which should provide us with a general, fully relativistic determination. We present the first lattice calculation of the $\eta_c$-meson distribution amplitude at leading twist. Starting from the relevant matrix element in discrete Euclidean space on a set of $N_f=2$ CLS ensembles, we explain the method to connect to continuum Minkowski spacetime. After addressing several sources of systematic uncertainty, we compare to Dyson-Schwinger and non-relativistic QCD determinations of this quantity. We find significant deviations between the latter and our result even at small Ioffe times.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05018v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the discretized version of the sigma-model with supersphere target space $OSp(N+2m|2m)/OSp(N+2m-1|2m)$ and present a preliminary numerical study of bosonic and fermionic two-point functions for the cases $OSp(3|2)$ and $OSp(5|2)$. We observe consistency with the expectations of this supersymmetric setup and discuss the sign problem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the Polyakov--Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model considering the effects of an effective chiral chemical potential. We offer a new parametrization of the Polyakov loop potential depending on temperature and the chemical potential which, when used together with a proper regularization scheme of vacuum contributions, predicts results consistent with those from lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Anomaly inflow for dipole symmetry and higher form foliated field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In accordance with recent progress of fracton topological phases, unusual topological phases of matter hosting fractionalized quasiparticle excitations with mobility constraints, new type of symmetry is studied -- multipole symmetry, associated with conservation of multipoles. Based on algebraic relation between dipole and global charges, we introduce a series of $(d+1)$-dimensional BF theories with $p$-form gauge fields, which admit dipole of spatially extended excitations, and study their physical properties. We elucidate that gauge invariant loops have unusual form, containing linear function of the spatial coordinate, which leads to the position dependent braiding statistics and unusual ground state degeneracy dependence on the system size. We also show that the theories exhibit a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between $p$-form and $(d-p)$-form dipole symmetries, which is canceled by an invertible theory defined in one dimensional higher via anomaly inflow mechanism.</description>

      <title>Born-Oppenheimer Potentials for $SU(3)$ Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop parameterizations of 8 of the lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials for quarkonium hybrid mesons as functions of the separation $r$ of the static quark and antiquark sources. The parameters are determined by fitting results calculated using pure $SU(3)$ lattice gauge theory. The parameterizations have the correct limiting behavior at small $r$, where the potentials form multiplets associated with gluelumps. They have the correct limiting behavior at large $r$, where the potentials form multiplets associated with excitations of a relativistic string. There is a narrow avoided crossing in the small-$r$ region between two potentials with the same Born-Oppenheimer quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of asymmetric staple-shaped Wilson-line operators in lattice and continuum perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the renormalization of nonlocal quark bilinear operators containing an asymmetric staple-shaped Wilson line at the one-loop level in both lattice and continuum perturbation theory. These operators enter the first-principle calculation of transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in lattice QCD using the formulation of Large Momentum Effective Theory. We provide appropriate RI$'$-type conditions that address the power and logarithmic divergences, as well as the mixing among staple operators of different Dirac structures, using a number of different possible projectors. A variant of RI$'$, including calculations of rectangular Wilson loops, which cancel the pinch-pole singularities of the staple operators at infinite length and reduce residual power divergences, is also employed. We calculate at one-loop order the conversion matrix, which relates the quasi-TMDPDFs in the RI$'$-type schemes to the reference scheme $\overline{\rm MS}$ for arbitrary values of the renormalization momentum scale and of the dimensions of the staple.</description>

      <title>The quark-mass dependence of the potential energy between static colour sources in the QCD vacuum with light and strange quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-lying energy spectrum of the static-colour-source-anti-source system in a vacuum containing light and strange quarks is computed using lattice QCD for a range of different light quark masses. The resulting levels are described using a simple model Hamiltonian and the parameters in this model are extrapolated to the physical light-quark masses. In this framework, the QCD string tension is found to be $\sqrt{\sigma}=445(3)_{\rm stat}(6)_{\rm sys}$ MeV.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_3$ lattice gauge theory as a toy model for dense QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the $(3+1)$-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_3$ lattice gauge theory coupled with the 2-flavor Wilson-Dirac fermion as a toy model for studying quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at nonzero density. We study its phase diagram in the space of the lattice gauge couplings $g^2$ and the quark chemical potentials $\mu$ and discuss the similarity and difference compared with anticipated behaviors of actual QCD. This model also provides a testing ground for various algorithms of the numerical Hamiltonian formalism as its Hilbert space is finite-dimensional in a finite box.</description>

      <title>Gauge Invariant and Anyonic Symmetric Transformer and RNN Quantum States for Quantum Lattice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.07243v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetries such as gauge invariance and anyonic symmetry play a crucial role in quantum many-body physics. We develop a general approach to constructing gauge invariant or anyonic symmetric autoregressive neural network quantum states, including a wide range of architectures such as Transformer and recurrent neural network (RNN), for quantum lattice models. These networks can be efficiently sampled and explicitly obey gauge symmetries or anyonic constraint. We prove that our methods can provide exact representation for the ground and excited states of the 2D and 3D toric codes, and the X-cube fracton model. We variationally optimize our symmetry incorporated autoregressive neural networks for ground states as well as real-time dynamics for a variety of models. We simulate the dynamics and the ground states of the quantum link model of $\text{U(1)}$ lattice gauge theory, obtain the phase diagram for the 2D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, determine the phase transition and the central charge of the $\text{SU(2)}_3$ anyonic chain, and also compute the ground state energy of the SU(2) invariant Heisenberg spin chain. Our approach provides powerful tools for exploring condensed matter physics, high energy physics and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Sound velocity peak induced by the chiral partner in dense two-color QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the peak structure of the sound velocity was observed in the lattice simulation of two-color and two-flavor QCD at the finite quark chemical potential. The comparison with the chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) result was undertaken, however, the ChPT failed in reproducing the peak structure. In this study, to extend the ChPT framework, we incorporate contributions of the $\sigma$ meson, that is identified as the chiral partner of pions, on top of the low-energy pion dynamics by using the linear sigma model (LSM). Based on the LSM we derive analytic expressions of the thermodynamic quantities as well as the sound velocity within a mean-field approximation. As a result, we find that those quantities are provided by sums of the ChPT results and corrections, where the latter is characterized by a mass difference between the chiral partners, the $\sigma$ meson and pion. The chiral partner contributions are found to yield a peak in the sound velocity successfully. We furthermore show that the sound velocity peak emerges only when $m_\sigma &gt;\sqrt{3}m_\pi$ and $\mu_q &gt; m_\pi$, with $m_{\sigma(\pi)}$ and $\mu_q$ being the $\sigma$ meson (pion) mass and the quark chemical potential, respectively. The correlation between the sound velocity peak and the sign of the trace anomaly is also addressed.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap for Finite N Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for analyzing finite $N$ lattice Yang-Mills theory and finite $N$ matrix models. Utilizing this framework, we examine the bootstrap approach to SU(2) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory in 2,3 and 4 dimensions. The SU(2) Makeenko-Migdal loop equations on the lattice are linear and closed exclusively on single-trace Wilson loops. This inherent linearity significantly enhances the efficiency of the bootstrap approach due to the convex nature of the problem, permitting the inclusion of Wilson loops up to length 24. The exact upper and lower margins for the free energy per plaquette, derived from our bootstrap method, demonstrate good agreement with Monte Carlo data, achieving precision within $0.1\%$ for the physically relevant range of couplings in both three and four dimensions. Additionally, our bootstrap data provides estimates of the string tension, in qualitative agreement with existing Monte Carlo computations.</description>
