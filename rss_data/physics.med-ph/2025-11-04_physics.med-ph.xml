      <title>Variational Percolation Bounds for Cellular Membrane Occlusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malignant membranes cluster nutrient transporters within glycan-rich domains, sustaining metabolism through redundant intake routes. A theoretical framework links interfacial chemistry to transport suppression and energetic or redox collapse. The model unites a screened Poisson-Nernst-Planck electrodiffusion problem, an interfacial potential of mean force, and a reduced energetic-redox module connecting flux to ATP/NADPH balance. From this structure, capacitary-spectral bounds relate total flux to the inverse principal eigenvalue (J_tot &lt;= C*exp(-beta*chi_eff)*P(theta)). Two near-orthogonal levers, geometry and field strength, govern a linear suppression regime below a percolation-type knee, beyond which conductance collapses. A composite intake index Xi = w_G*J_GLUT + w_A*J_LAT/ASCT + w_L*J_MCT dictates energetic trajectories: once below a maintenance threshold, ATP and NADPH fall jointly and redox imbalance drives irreversible commitment. Normal membranes, with fewer transport mouths and weaker fields, remain above this threshold, defining a natural selectivity window. The framework demonstrates existence, regularity, and spectral monotonicity for the self-adjoint PNP operator, establishing a geometric-spectral transition that links molecular parameters such as branching and sulfonation to measurable macroscopic outcomes with predictive precision.</description>

      <title>Treat-through OLED Displays: Dosimetry and performance of OLED AVATAR screens for Megavoltage Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AVATAR system utilizes a radiolucent video display to help relax and immobilize pediatric patients during radiotherapy. This study investigates the use of OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) displays, which offer superior image quality and faster alignment compared to traditional projector-based systems, albeit with slightly increased thickness. The dose perturbations caused by these screens were assessed to evaluate their suitability for radiotherapy.
  A 20 cm OLED screen was positioned in the patient's line of sight, between the patient's head and the radiation source. The screen comprises a 0.25 mm thick flexible OLED panel and a custom carbon fiber backing (0.3 to 0.6 mm thick), with most electronic components relocated via ribbon cable. 6 MV portal images were captured with and without the screen to create transmission maps. Additionally, parallel plate ion chamber measurements were taken at the surface and at depth in a solid water phantom. The OLED's radiation tolerance was tested with a 100 Gy dose delivery and 12 months of use in an active radiotherapy linac vault.
  The portal image transmission maps indicated an average attenuation difference of 0.3\% (SD = 0.37 \%) between measurements with and without the AVATAR screen, with a maximum point attenuation of 3\%. Ion chamber measurements revealed a 0.31\% decrease in dose at 2 cm depth and a 7.04 \% increase at the surface under an anterior-posterior beam. For a VMAT arc, the dose difference was 0.04 \% at 2 cm depth and 0.1\% at the phantom surface.
  The minimal dose deviations indicate that these screens are suitable for megavoltage arc therapy without significantly affecting the target dose. While surface dose is slightly increased for static anterior beams, it remains low. For lower photon energies or particle beams, larger perturbations may occur, necessitating further measurements or beam entry avoidance.</description>

      <title>Active learning-based variance reduction for Monte Carlo simulations: A feasibility study for the nanodosimetry around a gold nanoparticle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: This work presents a data-driven importance sampling-based variance reduction (VR) scheme inspired by active learning. The method is applied to the estimation of an optimal impact-parameter distribution in the calculation of ionization clusters around a gold nanoparticle (NP). Here, such an optimal importance distribution can not be inferred from principle. Approach: An iterative optimization procedure is set up that uses a Gaussian Process Sampler to propose optimal sampling distributions based on a loss function. The loss is constructed based on appropriate heuristics. The optimization code obtains estimates of the number of ionization clusters in shells around the NP by interfacing with a Geant4 simulation via a dedicated Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) interface. Main results: It is shown that the so-derived impact-parameter distribution easily outperforms the actual, uniform irradiation case. The results resemble those obtained with other VR schemes but do still slightly overestimate background contributions. Significance: While the method presented is a proof-of-principle, it provides a novel method of estimating importance distributions in ill-posed scenarios. The presented TCP interface described here is a simple and efficient method to expose compiled Geant4 code to other scripts, written for example, in Python.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Materials for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various coils for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are widely available for clinical and research use. These coils are almost all designed as air coils, which require large levels of energy to achieve a given magnetic flux density and in turn electric field strength, whereas in other sectors, such as power electronics or electrical machines, magnetic materials have been used for a long time to achieve higher efficiencies. We tested the impact on the electric and magnetic properties of different soft magnetic materials, including various ferrite cores, laminated sheet materials of nonisotropic corn-oriented silicon-steel, non-oriented silicon-steel, as well as cobalt-iron, and soft magnetic compound powder cores with insulated particles. Every material led to a reduction in coil current and voltage for the same target electric field strength. For the same field energy, every material yielded lower losses. Most common materials saturated already at very low currents. More material in thicker layers could shift the saturation point but at the cost of high weight. Due to their low saturation flux density, ferrites appear unsuitable for the high amplitude requirements of TMS. Laminated sheet materials and powder cores reduce the pulse energy, but the laminated sheet material adds more weight for the same effect than powder cores. Thus, appropriate magnetic materials can reduce the required pulse energy. Saturation flux density is the most relevant parameter, whereas the permeability beyond a certain base level is practically irrelevant. Most importantly, the weight of a magnetic-core coil may always be increased compared to an air coil for the same target field.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed Catheter-Integrated Pressure Sensing System for Endoluminal Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in flexible catheters pave the way for minimally invasive diagnosis and treatment of luminal organs and tubular structures through endoluminal interventions. A key challenge is in establishing non-constraining pressure monitoring at the interfaces between medical catheters and intraluminal anatomy exhibiting curvilinear contours, structural variability, and time-dependent physiological motion. This work presents a scalable and multi-purpose pressure sensing system for multidirectional monitoring of tissue interactions, establishing a robust solution for deploying diagnostic and therapeutic instruments in various types of endoluminal interventions. This approach provides an integrated system encompassing pressure sensors, catheters, and signal acquisition devices. A poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) film is miniaturized and configured into a multiplexed piezoelectric-based pressure sensor, providing flexibility and scalability in conforming to medical catheters with curved surfaces. The catheter is fabricated with a cost-effective and highly scalable fiber drawing technology, establishing a means of fast prototyping catheters with bespoke structures for sensor integration and medical instrument integration. The system achieves enhanced pressure detection sensitivity and a comparable sensing range, compared with state-of-the-art catheter-integrated sensors. Through in-vitro phantom studies, the system performs precise multi-directional sensing within various clinical endoluminal scenarios, showing its potential in digitalizing tissue interactions during endoluminal interventions.</description>

      <title>Microdosimetry Aspects in Diffusing Alpha-emitters Radiation Therapy. Part I: Effect of Broad Nucleus Size Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusing alpha-emitters Radiation Therapy ("Alpha DaRT") is a new treatment modality focusing on the use of alpha particles against solid tumors. The introduction of Alpha DaRT in clinical settings calls for the development of detailed tumor dosimetry, which addresses biological responses such as cell survival and tumor control probabilities at the microscopic scale. In this study, we present a microdosimetric model that links the macroscopic alpha dose, cell survival, and tumor control probability while explicitly accounting for broad distributions of spherical nucleus radii. The model combines analytic expressions for nucleus-hit statistics by alpha particles with Monte Carlo-based specific-energy deposition to compute survival for cells whose nucleus radii are sampled from artificial and empirically derived distributions. The results indicate that introducing finite-width nucleus size distributions causes survival curves to depart from the exponential trend observed for uniform cell populations. We show that the width of the nucleus size distribution strongly influences the survival gap between radiosensitive and radioresistant populations, diminishing the influence of intrinsic radiosensitivity on cell survival. Tumor control probability is highly sensitive to the minimal nucleus size included in the size distribution, indicating that realistic lower thresholds are essential for credible predictions.Our findings highlight the importance of careful characterization of clonogenic nucleus sizes, with particular attention to the smallest nuclei represented in the data. Without addressing these small-nucleus contributions, tumor control probability may be substantially underestimated. Incorporating realistic nucleus size variability into microdosimetric calculations is a key step toward more accurate tumor control predictions for Alpha DaRT and other alpha-based treatment modalities.</description>

      <title>A Multiscale Framework for In Silico Thrombus Generation and Photoacoustic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thrombus microstructure plays a critical role in determining the treatment success for thrombus-related diseases such as stroke and deep vein thrombosis. However, no in vivo diagnostic method can fully capture thrombus microstructure yet. Photoacoustic imaging is uniquely positioned to provide information on thrombi composition as it relays optical absorption information from diffuse photons at acoustic propagation depths. Computational modeling enables systematic exploration of microstructural effects on imaging signals, offering insights into developing improved in vivo diagnostic techniques. However, no photoacoustic simulation platform can model microstructural features within centimeter-scale phantoms at reasonable computational cost. Here, we present REFINE, a topology-driven framework for generating in silico thrombi replicating its key replicating their key microstructural traits. REFINE enables controlled, recursive optimization of thrombus topology, making it suitable for accurate photoacoustic modeling and potentially powerful for biomechanical analyses. These digital thrombi are embedded into a multiscale photoacoustic simulation platform that bridges microscale acoustic modeling with macroscale thrombus geometries, enabling efficient and realistic simulation of photoacoustic signal responses. We created unique thrombi microstructure for various compositions and porosities. Our simulation framework effectively links microstructural features to macroscale imaging outcomes, in agreement with previous empirical studies. Our results demonstrate that thrombus microstructure significantly affects photoacoustic spectral responses and can be modeled in silico. These findings highlight that multiscale photoacoustic simulation is a powerful tool for characterizing tissue microstructure and that our framework enables in silico thrombi analysis and diagnostic imaging strategy development</description>

      <title>A systematic evaluation of uncertainty quantification techniques in deep learning: a case study in photoplethysmography signal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In principle, deep learning models trained on medical time-series, including wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor data, can provide a means to continuously monitor physiological parameters outside of clinical settings. However, there is considerable risk of poor performance when deployed in practical measurement scenarios leading to negative patient outcomes. Reliable uncertainties accompanying predictions can provide guidance to clinicians in their interpretation of the trustworthiness of model outputs. It is therefore of interest to compare the effectiveness of different approaches. Here we implement an unprecedented set of eight uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques to models trained on two clinically relevant prediction tasks: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) detection (classification), and two variants of blood pressure regression. We formulate a comprehensive evaluation procedure to enable a rigorous comparison of these approaches. We observe a complex picture of uncertainty reliability across the different techniques, where the most optimal for a given task depends on the chosen expression of uncertainty, evaluation metric, and scale of reliability assessed. We find that assessing local calibration and adaptivity provides practically relevant insights about model behaviour that otherwise cannot be acquired using more commonly implemented global reliability metrics. We emphasise that criteria for evaluating UQ techniques should cater to the model's practical use case, where the use of a small number of measurements per patient places a premium on achieving small-scale reliability for the chosen expression of uncertainty, while preserving as much predictive performance as possible.</description>

      <title>High-Power Dual-Channel Field Chamber for High-Frequency Magnetic Neuromodulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several novel methods, including magnetogenetics and magnetoelectric stimulation, use high frequency alternating magnetic fields to precisely manipulate neural activity. To quantify the behavioral effects of such interventions in a freely moving mouse, we developed a dual-channel magnetic chamber, specifically designed for rate-sensitive magnetothermal-genetic stimulation, and adaptable for other uses of alternating magnetic fields. Through an optimized coil design, the system allows independent control of two spatially orthogonal uniform magnetic fields delivered at different frequencies within a 10 cm x 10 cm x 6 cm chamber. The two channels have nominal frequencies of 50 and 550 kHz with peak magnetic field strengths of 88 and 12.5 mT, achieved with resonant coil drives having peak voltages of 1.6 and 1.8 kV and currents of 1.0 and 0.26 kA, respectively. Additionally, a liquid cooling system enables magnetic field generation for second-level duration, and an observation port and camera allow video capture of the animal's behavior within the chamber. The system generates high-amplitude magnetic fields across two widely separated frequency channels with negligible interference (&lt; 1%). Relatively uniform magnetic field distribution (+/-10% across 94% of the chamber volume) is maintained throughout the chamber, and temperature increase of the inner side of the coil enclosure during the operation is limited to &lt; 0.35 {\deg}C/s to ensure in vivo safety. Using cobalt-doped and undoped iron oxide nanoparticles, we demonstrate channel-specific heating rates of 3.5 {\deg}C/s and 1.5 {\deg}C/s, respectively, validating frequency-selectivity. Both channels can run continuously for four seconds stably.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Elicitation with Large Language Models for Interpretable Cancer Stage Identification from Pathology Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer staging is critical for patient prognosis and treatment planning, yet extracting pathologic TNM staging from unstructured pathology reports poses a persistent challenge. Existing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) strategies often depend on large annotated datasets, limiting their scalability and adaptability. In this study, we introduce two Knowledge Elicitation methods designed to overcome these limitations by enabling large language models (LLMs) to induce and apply domain-specific rules for cancer staging. The first, Knowledge Elicitation with Long-Term Memory (KEwLTM), uses an iterative prompting strategy to derive staging rules directly from unannotated pathology reports, without requiring ground-truth labels. The second, Knowledge Elicitation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KEwRAG), employs a variation of RAG where rules are pre-extracted from relevant guidelines in a single step and then applied, enhancing interpretability and avoiding repeated retrieval overhead. We leverage the ability of LLMs to apply broad knowledge learned during pre-training to new tasks. Using breast cancer pathology reports from the TCGA dataset, we evaluate their performance in identifying T and N stages, comparing them against various baseline approaches on two open-source LLMs. Our results indicate that KEwLTM outperforms KEwRAG when Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (ZSCOT) inference is effective, whereas KEwRAG achieves better performance when ZSCOT inference is less effective. Both methods offer transparent, interpretable interfaces by making the induced rules explicit. These findings highlight the promise of our Knowledge Elicitation methods as scalable, high-performing solutions for automated cancer staging with enhanced interpretability, particularly in clinical settings with limited annotated data.</description>

      <title>NIR-II Fluorescence Project Technology for Augmented Reality Surgical Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NIR-II fluorescence imaging provides superior tissue penetration and clarity, yet its clinical use in surgical navigation is hindered by a critical workflow issue. Surgeons must divert their attention between the operative field and external monitors, increasing cognitive load and disrupting procedures. Current strategies have failed to resolve this fundamental problem. Here, we developed a co-axial NIR-II fluorescence projection navigation system to enable real-time, in situ visualization. This system creates an intraoperative augmented reality by directly projecting high-precision, pseudocolored fluorescence images onto the surgical field, spatially integrating functional signals with patient anatomy. Validated through in vitro, in vivo, and clinical patient studies, our system eliminates visual field switching, reduces intraoperative distraction, and preserves natural stereoscopic vision. This approach represents a paradigm shift toward a more coherent, efficient, and ergonomically optimized optical imaging modality for surgical navigation.</description>

      <title>Dual-Input Dynamic Convolution for Positron Range Correction in PET Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positron range (PR) blurring degrades positron emission tomography (PET) image resolution, particularly for high-energy emitters like gallium-68 (68Ga). We introduce Dual-input Dynamic Convolution (DDConv), a novel computationally efficient approach trained with voxel-specific PR point spread functions (PSFs) from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and designed to be utilized within an iterative reconstruction algorithm to perform PR correction (PRC). By dynamically inferring local blurring kernels through a trained convolutional neural network (CNN), DDConv captures complex tissue interfaces more accurately than prior methods. Crucially, it also computes the transpose of the PR operator, ensuring consistency within iterative PET reconstruction. Comparisons with a state-of-the-art, tissue-dependent correction confirm the advantages of DDConv in recovering higher-resolution details in heterogeneous regions, including bone-soft tissue and lung-soft tissue boundaries. Experiments across digital phantoms and MC-simulated data show that DDConv offers near-MC accuracy, and outperforms the state-of-the-art technique, namely spatially-variant and tissue-dependent (SVTD), especially in areas with complex material interfaces. Results from physical phantom experiments further confirmed DDConv's robustness and practical applicability: while both DDConv and SVTD performed similarly in homogeneous soft-tissue regions, DDConv provided more accurate activity recovery and sharper delineation at heterogeneous lung-soft tissue interfaces.</description>

      <title>The role of friction forces in arterial mechanical thrombectomy: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the superiority of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in treating acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Stent retriever (SR) and aspiration techniques are the standard methods for removing occluded emboli, with evolving technologies improving MT efficiency. However, procedural success remains uncertain. Frictional forces, specifically clot-vessel, clot-SR, and SR-vessel interactions, play a critical role in MT outcomes. This review examines frictional forces during MT and their impact on success, analyzing publications from 2015 to 2025. We focus on studies that calculated friction or retrieval forces using in vitro models. We have also included current trends, limitations, and future perspectives on studying and understanding frictional forces and their implementation into in silico models. Findings indicate that fibrin-rich clots are more difficult to retrieve than red blood cell (RBC)-rich clots due to their higher friction coefficient, three to four times greater, an observation supported by multiple studies. SR-vessel and SR-clot friction also influence MT effectiveness. SR-vessel interaction plays a crucial role in acutely curved vessels, as SR compression reduces its efficiency. In SR-clot interaction, RBC-rich clot fragmentation is linked to relative interaction forces. In summary, obtaining in vivo frictional values remains challenging, and inconsistencies persist in past in vitro studies. Further, a deeper understanding of frictional forces is essential for optimizing MT, improving current SRs, and developing next-generation thrombectomy technologies.</description>

      <title>Joint Reconstruction of Activity and Attenuation in PET by Diffusion Posterior Sampling in Wavelet Coefficient Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18782v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attenuation correction (AC) is necessary for accurate activity quantification in positron emission tomography (PET). Conventional reconstruction methods typically rely on attenuation maps derived from a co-registered computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. However, this additional scan may complicate the imaging workflow, introduce misalignment artifacts and increase radiation exposure. In this paper, we propose a joint reconstruction of activity and attenuation (JRAA) approach that eliminates the need for auxiliary anatomical imaging by relying solely on emission data. This framework combines wavelet diffusion model (WDM) and diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) to reconstruct fully three-dimensional (3-D) data. Experimental results show our method outperforms maximum likelihood activity and attenuation (MLAA) and MLAA with U-Net-based post processing, and yields high-quality noise-free reconstructions across various count settings when time-of-flight (TOF) information is available. It is also able to reconstruct non-TOF data, although the reconstruction quality significantly degrades in low-count (LC) conditions, limiting its practical effectiveness in such settings. Nonetheless, a non-TOF Biograph mMR data reconstruction with joint scatter estimation highlights the potential of the method for clinical applications. This approach represents a step towards stand-alone PET imaging by reducing the dependence on anatomical modalities while maintaining quantification accuracy, even in low-count scenarios when TOF information is available. Code will soon be available on GitHub at https://github.com/clemphg/jraa-dps.</description>

      <title>Modality-AGnostic Image Cascade (MAGIC) for Multi-Modality Cardiac Substructure Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Cardiac substructure delineation is emerging in treatment planning to minimize the risk of radiation-induced heart disease. Deep learning offers efficient methods to reduce contouring burden but currently lacks generalizability across different modalities and overlapping structures. This work introduces and validates a Modality-AGnostic Image Cascade (MAGIC) deep-learning pipeline for comprehensive and multi-modal cardiac substructure segmentation. MAGIC is implemented through replicated encoding and decoding branches of an nnU-Net backbone to handle multi-modality inputs and overlapping labels. First benchmarked on the multi-modality whole-heart segmentation (MMWHS) dataset including cardiac CT-angiography (CCTA) and MR modalities, twenty cardiac substructures (heart, chambers, great vessels (GVs), valves, coronary arteries (CAs), and conduction nodes) from clinical simulation CT (Sim-CT), low-field MR-Linac, and cardiac CT-angiography (CCTA) modalities were delineated to train semi-supervised (n=151), validate (n=15), and test (n=30) MAGIC. For comparison, fourteen single-modality comparison models (two MMWHS modalities and four subgroups across three clinical modalities) were trained. Methods were evaluated for efficiency and against reference contours through the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and two-tailed Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test (p&lt;0.05). Average MMWHS DSC scores across CCTA and MR inputs were 0.88(0.08) and 0.87(0.04) respectively with significant improvement over unimodal baselines. Average 20-structure DSC scores were 0.75(0.16) for Sim-CT, 0.68(0.21) for MR-Linac, and 0.80(0.16) for CCTA. Furthermore, &gt;80% and &gt;70% reductions in training time and parameters were achieved, respectively. MAGIC offers an efficient, lightweight solution capable of segmenting multiple image modalities and overlapping structures in a single model without compromising segmentation accuracy.</description>

      <title>HEEPidermis: a versatile SoC for BioZ recording</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological impedance (BioZ) is an information-packed modality that allows for non-invasive monitoring of health and emotional state. Currently, most research involving tissue impedance is based on bulky or fixed-purpose hardware, which limits the scope of research and the possibilities of experiments. In this work, we present HEEPidermis: a System-on-Chip (SoC) which integrates all the blocks needed for tissue impedance measurement, including two 8-bit, arbitrary-signal current DACs, two VCO-based ADCs, and a RISC-V CPU to enable on-chip feature extraction for closed-loop operation. An event-based sub-sampler improves storage and energy efficiency for long-term recording. In addition to the versatile SoC, the digital back-end and behavioral models of the analog front-end are open-source, allowing fast system-level simulations or repurposing. The SoC was taped out on TSMC 65 nm LP process.</description>
