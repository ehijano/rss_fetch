      <title>L\'evy-Driven Option Pricing without a Riskless Asset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Lindquist-Rachev (LR) option-pricing framework--which values derivatives in markets lacking a traded risk-free bond--by introducing common Levy jump dynamics across two risky assets. The resulting endogenous "shadow" short rate replaces the usual risk-free yield and governs discounting and risk-neutral drifts. We focus on two widely used pure-jump specifications: the Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) process and the Carr-Geman-Madan-Yor (CGMY) tempered-stable process. Using Ito-Levy calculus we derive an LR partial integro-differential equation (LR-PIDE) and obtain European option values through characteristic-function methods implemented with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Fourier-cosine (COS) algorithms. Calibrations to S and P 500 index options show that both jump models materially reduce pricing errors and fit the observed volatility smile far better than the Black-Scholes benchmark; CGMY delivers the largest improvement. We also extract time-varying shadow short rates from paired asset data and show that sharp declines coincide with liquidity-stress episodes, highlighting risk signals not visible in Treasury yields. The framework links jump risk, relative asset pricing, and funding conditions in a tractable form for practitioners.</description>

      <title>Optimal mean-variance portfolio selection under regime-switching-induced stock price shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate mean-variance (MV) portfolio selection problems with jumps in a regime-switching financial model. The novelty of our approach lies in allowing not only the market parameters -- such as the interest rate, appreciation rate, volatility, and jump intensity -- to depend on the market regime, but also in permitting stock prices to experience jumps when the market regime switches, in addition to the usual micro-level jumps. This modeling choice is motivated by empirical observations that stock prices often exhibit sharp declines when the market shifts from a ``bullish'' to a ``bearish'' regime, and vice versa. By employing the completion-of-squares technique, we derive the optimal portfolio strategy and the efficient frontier, both of which are characterized by three systems of multi-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Among these, two systems are linear, while the first one is an $\ell$-dimensional, fully coupled, and highly nonlinear Riccati equation. In the absence of regime-switching-induced stock price shocks, these systems reduce to simple linear ODEs. Thus, the introduction of regime-switching-induced stock price shocks adds significant complexity and challenges to our model. Additionally, we explore the MV problem under a no-shorting constraint. In this case, the corresponding Riccati equation becomes a $2\ell$-dimensional, fully coupled, nonlinear ODE, for which we establish solvability. The solution is then used to explicitly express the optimal portfolio and the efficient frontier.</description>

      <title>Max- and min-stability under first-order stochastic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Max-stability is the property that taking a maximum between two inputs results in a maximum between two outputs. We study max-stability with respect to first-order stochastic dominance, the most fundamental notion of stochastic dominance in decision theory. Under two additional standard axioms of nondegeneracy and lower semicontinuity, we establish a representation theorem for functionals satisfying max-stability, which turns out to be represented by the supremum of a bivariate function. A parallel characterization result for min-stability, that is, with the maximum replaced by the minimum in max-stability, is also established. By combining both max-stability and min-stability, we obtain a new characterization for a class of functionals, called the Lambda-quantiles, that appear in finance and political science.</description>

      <title>CLVR Ordering of Transactions on AMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a trade ordering rule that aims to reduce intra-block price volatility in Automated Market Maker (AMM) powered decentralized exchanges. The ordering rule introduced here, Clever Look-ahead Volatility Reduction (CLVR), operates under the (common) framework in decentralized finance that allows some entities to observe trade requests before they are settled, assemble them into "blocks", and order them as they like. On AMM exchanges, asset prices are continuously and transparently updated as a result of each trade and therefore, transaction order has high financial value. CLVR aims to order transactions for traders' benefit. Our primary focus is intra-block price stability (minimizing volatility), which has two main benefits for traders: it reduces transaction failure rate and allows traders to receive closer prices to the reference price at which they submit their transactions accordingly. We show that CLVR constructs an ordering which approximately minimizes price volatility with a small computation cost and can be trivially verified externally.</description>
