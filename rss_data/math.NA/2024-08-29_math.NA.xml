      <title>Influence of gauges in the numerical simulation of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) model requires the choice of a gauge for the problem to be mathematically well-posed. In the literature, three gauges are commonly used: the Coulomb gauge, the Lorenz gauge and the temporal gauge. It has been noticed [J. Fleckinger-Pell\'e et al., Technical report, Argonne National Lab. (1997)] that these gauges can be continuously related by a single parameter considering the more general $\omega$-gauge, where $\omega$ is a non-negative real parameter. In this article, we study the influence of the gauge parameter $\omega$ on the convergence of numerical simulations of the TDGL model using finite element schemes. A classical benchmark is first analysed for different values of $\omega$ and artefacts are observed for lower values of $\omega$. Then, we relate these observations with a systematic study of convergence orders in the unified $\omega$-gauge framework. In particular, we show the existence of a tipping point value for $\omega$, separating optimal convergence behaviour and a degenerate one. We find that numerical artefacts are correlated to the degeneracy of the convergence order of the method and we suggest strategies to avoid such undesirable effects. New 3D configurations are also investigated (the sphere with or without geometrical defect).</description>

      <title>SAV-based entropy-dissipative schemes for a class of kinetic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce novel entropy-dissipative numerical schemes for a class of kinetic equations, leveraging the recently introduced scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach. Both first and second order schemes are constructed. Since the positivity of the solution is closely related to entropy, we also propose positivity-preserving versions of these schemes to ensure robustness, which include a scheme specially designed for the Boltzmann equation and a more general scheme using Lagrange multipliers. The accuracy and provable entropy-dissipation properties of the proposed schemes are validated for both the Boltzmann equation and the Landau equation through extensive numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the error of conformal finite element method for nonlocal diffusion model. We consider the mesh with and without shape regularity. For shape regular mesh, finite element method is asymptotic preserving. For shape irregular mesh, conformal finite element method also converges as long as $h^{k+1}/\delta$ goes to 0.</description>

      <title>Fast-convergent two-level restricted additive Schwarz methods based on optimal local approximation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a two-level restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) method for multiscale PDEs, built on top of a multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM). The method uses coarse spaces constructed from optimal local approximation spaces, which are based on local eigenproblems posed on (discrete) harmonic spaces. We rigorously prove that the method, used as an iterative solver or as a preconditioner for GMRES, converges at a rate of $\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ represents the error of the underlying MS-GFEM. The exponential convergence property of MS-GFEM, which is indepdendent of the fine mesh size $h$ even for highly oscillatory and high contrast coefficients, thus guarantees convergence in a few iterations with a small coarse space. We develop the theory in an abstract framework, and demonstrate its generality by applying it to various elliptic problems with highly heterogeneous coefficients, including $H({\rm curl})$ elliptic problems. The performance of the proposed method is systematically evaluated and illustrated via applications to two and three dimensional heterogeneous PDEs, including challenging elasticity problems in realistic composite aero-structures.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Low-Rank Riemannian Optimization for Symmetric Positive Definite Linear Matrix Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the numerical solution of large-scale symmetric positive definite matrix equations of the form $A_1XB_1^\top + A_2XB_2^\top + \dots + A_\ell X B_\ell^\top = F$, as they arise from discretized partial differential equations and control problems. One often finds that $X$ admits good low-rank approximations, in particular when the right-hand side matrix $F$ has low rank. For $\ell \le 2$ terms, the solution of such equations is well studied and effective low-rank solvers have been proposed, including Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) methods for Lyapunov and Sylvester equations. For $\ell &gt; 2$, several existing methods try to approach $X$ through combining a classical iterative method, such as the conjugate gradient (CG) method, with low-rank truncation. In this work, we consider a more direct approach that approximates $X$ on manifolds of fixed-rank matrices through Riemannian CG. One particular challenge is the incorporation of effective preconditioners into such a first-order Riemannian optimization method. We propose several novel preconditioning strategies, including a change of metric in the ambient space, preconditioning the Riemannian gradient, and a variant of ADI on the tangent space. Combined with a strategy for adapting the rank of the approximation, the resulting method is demonstrated to be competitive for a number of examples representative for typical applications.</description>

      <title>A Novel Interpolation-Based Method for Solving the One-Dimensional Wave Equation on a Domain with a Moving Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of solving the one-dimensional wave equation on a domain with moving boundary. In J.Math.Phys.11, 2679 (1970), Moore introduced an interesting method to do so. As only in rare cases, a closed analytical solution is possible, one must turn to perturbative expansions of Moore's method. We investigate the then made minimal assumption for convergence of the perturbation series, namely that the boundary position should be an analytic function of time. Though, we prove here that the latter requirement is not a sufficient condition for Moore's method to converge. We then introduce a novel numerical approach based on interpolation which also works for fast boundary dynamics. In comparison with other state-of-the-art numerical methods, our method offers greater speed if the wave solution needs to be evaluated at many points in time or space, whilst preserving accuracy. We discuss two variants of our method, either based on a conformal coordinate transformation or on the method of characteristics, together with interpolation.</description>

      <title>On the stability of finite-volume schemes on non-uniform meshes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the L2 stability of high-order finite-volume schemes for the 1D transport equation on non-uniform meshes. We consider the case when a small periodic perturbation is applied to a uniform mesh. For this case, we establish a sufficient stability condition. This allows to prove the (p+1)-th order convergence of finite-volume schemes based on p-th order polynomials.</description>

      <title>On the data-sparsity of the solution of Riccati equations with applications to feedback control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving large-scale continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations is a significant challenge in various control theory applications. This work demonstrates that when the matrix coefficients of the equation are quasiseparable, the solution also exhibits numerical quasiseparability. This property enables us to develop two efficient Riccati solvers. The first solver is applicable to the general quasiseparable case, while the second is tailored to the particular case of banded coefficients. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on both synthetic examples and case studies from the control of partial differential equations and agent-based models.</description>

      <title>Evaporation-driven tear film thinning and breakup in two space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaporation profiles have a strong effect on tear film thinning and breakup (TBU), a key factor in dry eye disease (DED). In experiments, TBU is typically seen to occur in patterns that locally can be circular (spot), linear (streak), or intermediate . We investigate a two-dimensional (2D) model of localized TBU using a Fourier spectral collocation method to observe how the evaporation distribution affects the resulting dynamics of tear film thickness and osmolarity, among other variables. We find that the dynamics are not simply an addition of individual 1D solutions of independent TBU events, and we show how the TBU quantities of interest vary continuously from spots to streaks for the shape of the evaporation distribution. We also find a significant speedup by using a proper orthogonal decomposition to reduce the dimension of the numerical system. The speedup will be especially useful for future applications of the model to inverse problems, allowing the clinical observation at scale of quantities that are thought to be important to DED but not directly measurable in vivo within TBU locales.</description>

      <title>Schwarz methods with PMLs for Helmholtz problems: fast convergence at high frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss parallel (additive) and sequential (multiplicative) variants of overlapping Schwarz methods for the Helmholtz equation in $\mathbb{R}^d$, with large real wavenumber and smooth variable wave speed. The radiation condition is approximated by a Cartesian perfectly-matched layer (PML). The domain-decomposition subdomains are overlapping hyperrectangles with Cartesian PMLs at their boundaries. In a recent paper ({\tt arXiv:2404.02156}), the current authors proved (for both variants) that, after a specified number of iterations -- depending on the behaviour of the geometric-optic rays -- the error is smooth and smaller than any negative power of the wavenumber $k$. For the parallel method, the specified number of iterations is less than the maximum number of subdomains, counted with their multiplicity, that a geometric-optic ray can intersect. The theory, which is given at the continuous level and makes essential use of semi-classical analysis, assumes that the overlaps of the subdomains and the widths of the PMLs are all independent of the wavenumber. In this paper we extend the results of {\tt arXiv:2404.02156} by experimentally studying the behaviour of the methods in the practically important case when both the overlap and the PML width decrease as the wavenumber increases. We find that (at least for constant wavespeed), the methods remain robust to increasing $k$, even for miminal overlap, when the PML is one wavelength wide.</description>

      <title>CUR for Implicit Time Integration of Random Partial Differential Equations on Low-Rank Matrix Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical low-rank approximation allows for solving large-scale matrix differential equations (MDEs) with significantly fewer degrees of freedom and has been applied to a growing number of applications. However, most existing techniques rely on explicit time integration schemes. In this work, we introduce a cost-effective Newton's method for the implicit time integration of stiff, nonlinear MDEs on low-rank matrix manifolds. Our methodology is focused on MDEs resulting from the discretization of random partial differential equations (PDEs). Cost-effectiveness is achieved by solving the MDE at the minimum number of entries required for a rank-$r$ approximation. We present a novel CUR low-rank approximation that requires solving the parametric PDE at $r$ strategically selected parameters and $\mathcal{O}(r)$ grid points using Newton's method. The selected random samples and grid points adaptively vary over time and are chosen using the discrete empirical interpolation method or similar techniques. The proposed methodology is developed for high-order implicit multistep and Runge-Kutta schemes and incorporates rank adaptivity, allowing for dynamic rank adjustment over time to control error. Several analytical and PDE examples, including the stochastic Burgers' and Gray-Scott equations, demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the presented methodology.</description>

Abstract: Modelling and simulating mine countermeasures (MCM) search missions performed by autonomous vehicles equipped with a sensor capable of detecting mines at sea is a challenging endeavour. In this work, we present a novel way to model and account for sand ripples present on the bottom of the ocean while calculating trajectories for the autonomous vehicles by means of a stochastic optimal control framework. It is known from the scientific literature that these ripples impact the sea mine detection capabilities of the autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LSMR is a widely recognized method for solving least squares problems via the double QR decomposition. Various preconditioning techniques have been explored to improve its efficiency. One issue that arises when implementing these preconditioning techniques is the need to solve two linear systems per iterative step. In this paper, to tackle this issue, among others, a modified LSMR method (MLSMR), in which only one linear system per iterative step needs to be solved instead of two, is introduced, and then it is integrated with the idea of flexible GMRES to yield a flexible MLSMR method (FMLSMR). Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed FMLSMR method.</description>

      <title>An exponential map free implicit midpoint method for stochastic Lie-Poisson systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integrator for a class of stochastic Lie-Poisson systems driven by Stratonovich noise is developed. The integrator is suited for Lie-Poisson systems that also admit an isospectral formulation, which enables scalability to high-dimensional systems. Its derivation follows from discrete Lie-Poisson reduction of the symplectic midpoint scheme for stochastic Hamiltonian systems. We prove almost sure preservation of Casimir functions and coadjoint orbits under the numerical flow and provide strong and weak convergence rates of the proposed method. The scalability, structure-conservation, and convergence rates are illustrated numerically for the (generalized) rigid body, point vortex dynamics, and the two-dimensional Euler equations on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Data-driven reduced order modeling of a two-layer quasi-geostrophic ocean model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-layer quasi-geostrophic equations (2QGE) is a simplified model that describes the dynamics of a stratified, wind-driven ocean in terms of potential vorticity and stream function. Its numerical simulation is plagued by a high computational cost due to the size of the typical computational domain and the need for high resolution to capture the full spectrum of turbulent scales. In this paper, we present a data-driven reduced order model (ROM) for the 2QGE that drastically reduces the computational time to predict ocean dynamics, especially when there are variable physical parameters. The main building blocks of our ROM are: i) proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and ii) long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. Snapshots data are collected from a high-resolution simulation for part of the time interval of interest and for given parameter values in the case of variable parameters. POD is applied to each field variable to extract the dominant modes and a LSTM model is trained on the modal coefficients associated with the snapshots for each variable. Then, the trained LSTM models predict the modal coefficients for the remaining part of the time interval of interest and for a new parameter value. To illustrate the predictive performance of our POD-LSTM ROM and the corresponding time savings, we consider an extension of the so-called double-gyre wind forcing test. We show that the POD-LSTM ROM is accurate in predicting both time-averaged fields and time-dependent quantities (modal coefficients, enstrophy, and kinetic energy), even when retaining only 10-20\% of the singular value energy of the system. The computational speed up for the prediction is about up to 1E+07 compared to a finite volume based full order method.</description>

      <title>Sparse Recovery for Overcomplete Frames: Sensing Matrices and Recovery Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signal models formed as linear combinations of few atoms from an over-complete dictionary or few frame vectors from a redundant frame have become central to many applications in high dimensional signal processing and data analysis. A core question is, by exploiting the intrinsic low dimensional structure of the signal, how to design the sensing process and decoder in a way that the number of measurements is essentially close to the complexity of the signal set. This chapter provides a survey of important results in answering this question, with an emphasis on a basis pursuit like convex optimization decoder that admits a wide range of random sensing matrices. The results are quite established in the case signals are sparse in an orthonormal basis, while the case with frame sparse signals is much less explored. In addition to presenting the latest results on recovery guarantee and how few random heavier-tailed measurements fulfill these recovery guarantees, this chapter also aims to provide some insights in proof techniques. We also take the opportunity of this book chapter to publish an interesting result (Theorem 3.10) about a restricted isometry like property related to a frame.</description>

      <title>A collision-oriented interacting particle system for Landau-type equations and the molecular chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a collision-oriented particle system to approximate a class of Landau-type equations. This particle system is formally derived from a particle system with random collisions in the grazing regime, and happens to be a special random batch system with random interaction in the diffusion coefficient. The difference from usual random batch systems with random interaction in the drift is that the batch size has to be $p=2$. We then analyze the convergence rate of the proposed particle system to the Landau-type equations using the tool of relative entropy, assuming that the interaction kernels are regular enough. A key aspect of our approach is the gradient estimates of logarithmic densities, applied to both the Landau-type equations and the particle systems. Compared to existing particle systems for the approximation of Landau-type equations, our proposed system not only offers a more intrinsic reflection of the underlying physics but also reduces the computational cost to $O(N)$ per time step when implemented numerically.</description>

      <title>Fourier Spectral Physics Informed Neural Network: An Efficient and Low-Memory PINN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With growing investigations into solving partial differential equations by physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), more accurate and efficient PINNs are required to meet the practical demands of scientific computing. One bottleneck of current PINNs is computing the high-order derivatives via automatic differentiation which often necessitates substantial computing resources. In this paper, we focus on removing the automatic differentiation of the spatial derivatives and propose a spectral-based neural network that substitutes the differential operator with a multiplication. Compared to the PINNs, our approach requires lower memory and shorter training time. Thanks to the exponential convergence of the spectral basis, our approach is more accurate. Moreover, to handle the different situations between physics domain and spectral domain, we provide two strategies to train networks by their spectral information. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, We validate the aforementioned merits of our proposed network.</description>

      <title>An automated and time efficient framework for simulation of coronary blood flow under steady and pulsatile conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is the gold standard for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). FFRCT uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to evaluate FFR non-invasively by simulating coronary flow in geometries reconstructed from computed tomography (CT). However, it faces challenges related to the cost of computing and uncertainties in defining patient-specific boundary conditions (BCs). We investigated using time-averaged steady BCs instead of pulsatile ones to reduce computational time and deployed a self-adjusting method for tuning BCs to patient clinical data. 133 coronary arteries were reconstructed from CT images of CAD patients. For each vessel, invasive FFR was measured. Steady BCs for CFD were defined in two steps: i) rest BCs were extrapolated from clinical and image-derived data; ii) hyperemic BCs were computed from resting conditions. Flow rate was iteratively adjusted during the simulation until patient aortic pressure was matched. Pulsatile BCs were defined using the convergence values of steady BCs. Lesion-specific hemodynamic indexes were computed and compared between groups of patients indicated for surgery and those not. The whole pipeline was implemented as a straightforward, fully automated process. Steady and pulsatile FFRCT showed a strong correlation (r=0.988) and correlated with invasive FFR (r=0.797). The per-point difference between the pressure and FFRCT field predicted by the two methods was below 0.01 and 0.02, respectively. Both approaches exhibited good diagnostic performance: accuracy was 0.860 and 0.864, with AUCs of 0.923 and 0.912, for steady and pulsatile cases, respectively. Computational time for steady BCs CFD was approximately 30-fold lower than for the pulsatile case. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using steady BCs CFD for computing FFRCT in coronary arteries and its performance in a fully automated pipeline.</description>

      <title>Regularity of vector fields with piecewise regular curl and divergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove piecewise Sobolev regularity of vector fields that have piecewise regular curl and divergence, but may fail to be globally continuous. The main idea behind our approach is to employ recently developed parametrices for the curl-operator and the regularity theory of Poisson transmission problems. We conclude our work by applying our findings to the heterogeneous time-harmonic Maxwell equations with either a) impedance, b) natural or c) essential boundary conditions and providing wavenumber-explicit piecewise regularity estimates for these equations.</description>

      <title>UltimateKalman: Flexible Kalman Filtering and Smoothing Using Orthogonal Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: UltimateKalman is a flexible linear Kalman filter and smoother implemented in three popular programming languages: MATLAB, C, and Java. UltimateKalman is a slight simplification and slight generalization of an elegant Kalman filter and smoother that was proposed in 1977 by Paige and Saunders. Their algorithm appears to be numerically superior and more flexible than other Kalman filters and smoothers, but curiously has never been implemented or used before. UltimateKalman is flexible: it can easily handle time-dependent problems, problems with state vectors whose dimensions vary from step to step, problems with varying number of observations in different steps (or no observations at all in some steps), and problems in which the expectation of the initial state is unknown. The programming interface of UltimateKalman is broken into simple building blocks that can be used to construct filters, single or multi-step predictors, multi-step or whole-track smoothers, and combinations. The paper describes the algorithm and its implementation as well as with a test suite of examples and tests.</description>

      <title>A convex dual problem for the rational minimax approximation and Lawson's iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the discrete rational minimax approximation in the complex plane is challenging. Apart from Ruttan's sufficient condition, there are few other sufficient conditions for global optimality. The state-of-the-art rational approximation algorithms, such as the adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA), AAA-Lawson, and the rational Krylov fitting (RKFIT) method, perform highly efficiently, but the computed rational approximations may not be minimax solutions. In this paper, we propose a convex programming approach, the solution of which is guaranteed to be the rational minimax approximation under Ruttan's sufficient condition. Furthermore, we present a new version of Lawson's iteration for solving this convex programming problem. The computed solution can be easily verified as the rational minimax approximation. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that this updated version of Lawson's iteration generally converges monotonically with respect to the objective function of the convex optimization. It is an effective competitive approach for computing the rational minimax approximation, compared to the highly efficient AAA, AAA-Lawson, and the stabilized Sanathanan-Koerner iteration.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Randomized Householder-Cholesky QR Factorization with Multisketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CholeskyQR2 and shifted CholeskyQR3 are two state-of-the-art algorithms for computing tall-and-skinny QR factorizations since they attain high performance on current computer architectures. However, to guarantee stability, for some applications, CholeskyQR2 faces a prohibitive restriction on the condition number of the underlying matrix to factorize. Shifted CholeskyQR3 is stable but has $50\%$ more computational and communication costs than CholeskyQR2. In this paper, a randomized QR algorithm called Randomized Householder-Cholesky (\texttt{rand\_cholQR}) is proposed and analyzed. Using one or two random sketch matrices, it is proved that with high probability, its orthogonality error is bounded by a constant of the order of unit roundoff for any numerically full-rank matrix, and hence it is as stable as shifted CholeskyQR3. An evaluation of the performance of \texttt{rand\_cholQR} on a NVIDIA A100 GPU demonstrates that for tall-and-skinny matrices, \texttt{rand\_cholQR} with multiple sketch matrices is nearly as fast as, or in some cases faster than, CholeskyQR2. Hence, compared to CholeskyQR2, \texttt{rand\_cholQR} is more stable with almost no extra computational or memory cost, and therefore a superior algorithm both in theory and practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11993v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the design of an invariant measure-preserving transformed dynamics for the numerical treatment of Langevin dynamics based on rescaling of time, with the goal of sampling from an invariant measure. Given an appropriate monitor function which characterizes the numerical difficulty of the problem as a function of the state of the system, this method allows the stepsizes to be reduced only when necessary, facilitating efficient recovery of long-time behavior. We study both the overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. We investigate how an appropriate correction term that ensures preservation of the invariant measure should be incorporated into a numerical splitting scheme. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the technique in several model systems, including a Bayesian sampling problem with a steep prior.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Variational Physics-Informed Neural Networks Using Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Physics-Informed Neural Networks often suffer from poor convergence when using stochastic gradient-descent-based optimizers. By introducing a Least Squares solver for the weights of the last layer of the neural network, we improve the convergence of the loss during training in most practical scenarios. This work analyzes the computational cost of the resulting hybrid Least-Squares/Gradient-Descent optimizer and explains how to implement it efficiently. In particular, we show that a traditional implementation based on backward-mode automatic differentiation leads to a prohibitively expensive algorithm. To remedy this, we propose using either forward-mode automatic differentiation or an ultraweak-type scheme that avoids the differentiation of trial functions in the discrete weak formulation. The proposed alternatives are up to one hundred times faster than the traditional one, recovering a computational cost-per-iteration similar to that of a conventional gradient-descent-based optimizer alone. To support our analysis, we derive computational estimates and conduct numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional problems.</description>
