      <title>Assessing the potential of state-of-the-art machine learning and physics-informed machine learning in predicting sea surface temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing adoption of machine learning (ML) in modelling atmospheric and oceanic processes offers a promising alternative to traditional numerical methods. It is essential to benchmark the performance of both ML and physics-informed ML (PINN) models to evaluate their predictive skill, particularly for short- to medium-term forecasting. In this study, we utilize gridded sea surface temperature (SST) data and six atmospheric predictors (cloud cover, relative humidity, solar radiation, surface pressure, u-component of velocity, and v-component of velocity) to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in SST predictions.</description>

      <title>Multi-model evidence of future tropical Atlantic precipitation change modulated by AMOC decline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projections from global climate models reveal a significant inter-model spread in future rainfall changes in the tropical Atlantic by the end of the 21st century, including alterations to the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and monsoonal regions. While existing studies have identified various sources of uncertainty, our research uncovers a prominent role played by the decline of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) for the inter-model spread. Firstly we examine 30 climate model simulations (using the ssp5-8.5 scenario) from the CMIP6 archive and show that models that present a more substantial AMOC decline exhibit an equatorward shift of the ascending branch of the Atlantic regional Hadley circulation, resulting in a southward displacement of the ITCZ. Conversely, models characterized by a smaller AMOC decline do not indicate any ITCZ displacement. Secondly, we use targeted experiments (using the abrupt 4xCO2 experiment) to specifically isolate the effects of a weakened AMOC from the changes in precipitation that would occur if, under continuous global warming, the AMOC did not weaken. Our results demonstrate that net precipitation anomalies in the abrupt 4xCO2 experiments are displaced southwards compared to the simulation with fixed AMOC strength, corroborating our previous findings. Our study has implications for understanding the mechanisms driving future changes in tropical Atlantic precipitation, and underscores the central role played by the AMOC in future climate change.</description>

      <title>Learning Surrogate Rainfall-driven Inundation Models with Few Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flood hazard assessment demands fast and accurate predictions. Hydrodynamic models are detailed but computationally intensive, making them impractical for quantifying uncertainty or identifying extremes. In contrast, machine learning surrogates can be rapid, but training on scarce simulated or observed extreme data can also be ineffective. This work demonstrates the development of an effective surrogate model for flood hazard prediction by initializing deep learning (ResNet-18) with ensemble-approximated Conditional Gaussian Processes (EnsCGP) and finalizing it with a bias correction. The proposed methodology couples EnsCGP with a ResNet-18 architecture to estimate flood depth and uses ensemble optimal estimation for bias correction. The surrogate model was trained and evaluated using rainfall data from Daymet and hydrodynamic simulations from LISFLOOD-FP, spanning the period from 1981 to 2019. The training involved using data up to a certain year and testing on the subsequent year, iteratively progressing through the dataset. This process required approximately 100 training iterations and extensive data. Inundation depths are estimated rapidly at runtime (approximately 0.006 seconds per event). Results over multiple years in the current climate over Chicago demonstrate an average R-squared greater than 0.96, with median relative errors in flood depth estimates of about 1 percent.</description>

      <title>Internal tides in the Mediterranean Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation and propagation sites of internal tides in the Mediterranean Sea are mapped through a comprehensive high-resolution numerical study. Two ocean general circulation models were used for this: NEMO v3.6, and ICON-O, both hydrostatic ocean models based on primitive equations with Boussinesq approximation, where NEMO is a regional Mediterranean Sea model with an Atlantic box, and ICON a global model. Internal tides are widespread in the Mediterranean Sea. The primary generation sites: the Gibraltar Strait, Sicily Strait/Malta Bank, and Hellenic Arc, are mapped through analysis of the tidal barotropic to baroclinic energy conversion. Semidiurnal internal tides can propagate for hundreds of kilometres from these generation sites into the Algerian Sea, Tyrrhenian Sea, and Ionian Sea respectively. Diurnal internal tides remain trapped along the bathymetry, and are generated in the central Mediterranean Sea and southeastern coasts of the basin. The total energy used for internal tide generation in the Mediterranean Sea is 2.89 GW in NEMO and 1.36 GW in ICON. Wavelengths of the first baroclinic modes of the M2 tide are calculated in various regions of the Mediterranean Sea where internal tides are propagating, comparing model outputs to a theory-based calculation. The models are also intercompared to investigate the differences between them in their representation of internal tides.</description>

      <title>Assessing the physical risks of climate change for the financial sector: a case study from Mexico's Central Bank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The financial sector is increasingly concerned with the physical risks of climate change, but economic and financial impact representations are still developing, particularly for chronic risks. Mexico's Central Bank conducted a comprehensive assessment using a suite of global models to evaluate both physical and transition risks. We present the analysis concerning with chronic physical risks, underlining innovations such as the use of a recent integrated assessment model that enables grid-cell level analysis and differentiates urban and non-urban areas, capturing the local effects of climate change more accurately. The model includes multiple damage functions and a probabilistic climate model for encompassing analyses and detailed economic impact insights. Under the Current Policies scenario, economic losses could exceed 35 percent of Mexico's GDP by 2100. Accounting for the urban heat island effect, losses could surpass 20 trillion (USD) in present value, over ten times Mexico's 2024 GDP. However, implementing a scenario aligned with the Paris Agreement significantly reduces these losses, showcasing the benefits of international mitigation efforts, though substantial residual impacts persist. This study emphasizes integrating chronic physical risks into financial evaluations, proposing new approaches, metrics, and methods that exploit detailed, spatially explicit measures to improve risk and loss estimation and facilitate communication.</description>

      <title>Improving sub-seasonal wind-speed forecasts in Europe with a non-linear model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-seasonal wind speed forecasts provide valuable guidance for wind power system planning and operations, yet the forecasting skills of surface winds decrease sharply after two weeks. However, large-scale variables exhibit greater predictability on this time scale. This study explores the potential of leveraging non-linear relationships between 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500) and surface wind speed to improve subs-seasonal wind speed forecasting skills in Europe. Our proposed framework uses a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) or a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to regress surface wind speed from Z500. Evaluations on ERA5 reanalysis indicate that the CNN performs better due to their non-linearity. Applying these models to sub-seasonal forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, various verification metrics demonstrate the advantages of non-linearity. Yet, this is partly explained by the fact that these statistical models are under-dispersive since they explain only a fraction of the target variable variance. Introducing stochastic perturbations to represent the stochasticity of the unexplained part from the signal helps compensate for this issue. Results show that the perturbed CNN performs better than the perturbed MLR only in the first weeks, while the perturbed MLR's performance converges towards that of the perturbed CNN after two weeks. The study finds that introducing stochastic perturbations can address the issue of insufficient spread in these statistical models, with improvements from the non-linearity varying with the lead time of the forecasts.</description>

      <title>Long-window hybrid variational data assimilation methods for chaotic climate models tested with the Lorenz 63 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hybrid 4D-variational data assimilation method for chaotic climate models is introduced using the Lorenz '63 model. This approach aims to optimise an Earth system model (ESM), for which no adjoint exists, by utilising an adjoint model of a different, potentially simpler ESM. The technique relies on synchronisation of the model to observed time series data employing the dynamical state and parameter estimation (DSPE) method to stabilise the tangent linear system by reducing all positive Lyapunov exponents to negative values. Therefore, long windows can be used to improve parameter estimation. In this new extension a second layer of synchronisation is added between the two models, with and without an adjoint, to facilitate linearisation around the trajectory of the model without an adjoint. The method is conceptually demonstrated by synchronising two Lorenz '63 systems, representing two ESMs, one with and the other without an adjoint model. Results are presented for an idealised case of identical, perfect models and for a more realistic case in which they differ from one another. If employed with a coarser ESM with an adjoint, the method will save computational power as only one forward run with the full ESM per iteration needs to be carried out. It is demonstrated that there is negligible error and uncertainty change compared to the 'traditional' optimisation of full ESM with an adjoint. In a variation of the method outlined, synchronisation between two identical models can be used to filter noisy data. This reduces optimised parametric model uncertainty by approximately one third. Such a precision gain could prove valuable for seasonal, annual, and decadal predictions.</description>

      <title>Projections of standardised energy indices in future climate scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Renewable energy is becoming an increasingly important component of energy systems. However, renewable energy production is heavily dependent on the prevailing weather conditions, which are changing as a result of climate change. It is therefore necessary to build energy systems that are robust to energy shortages caused by weather-dependent changes to energy demand and renewable energy production. To design such systems, we must monitor how changes in the climate are expected to influence future energy production and demand; this is important for policymakers to decide when, where, and by how much renewable energy installed capacities should be increased, for example. In this paper, we study the behaviour of standardised energy indices in future European climate projections, and use this to monitor how characteristics of energy production droughts in Europe are expected to change in the future. We use these results to make suggestions regarding how the energy mix should be adapted in the future to decrease the risk of energy production droughts.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for a Stochastic Multicloud Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers have attracted much attention in recent years. This is because the development of the actual quantum machine is accelerating. Research on how to use quantum computers is active in the fields such as quantum chemistry and machine learning, where vast amounts of computation are required. However, in weather and climate simulations, less research has been done despite similar computational demands. In this study, a quantum computing algorithm is applied to a problem of the atmospheric science. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using a quantum simulator. The results show that it can achieve the same simulations as a conventional algorithm designed for classical computers. More specifically, the stochastically fluctuating behavior of a multi-cloud model was obtained using classical Monte Carlo method, and comparable results are also achieved by utilizing probabilistic outputs of computed quantum states. Our results show that quantum computers have a potential to be useful for the atmospheric and oceanic science, in which stochasticity is widely inherent.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal graph neural networks for localized off-grid weather forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urgent applications like wildfire management and renewable energy generation require precise, localized weather forecasts near the Earth's surface. However, weather forecast products from machine learning or numerical weather models are currently generated on a global regular grid, on which a naive interpolation cannot accurately reflect fine-grained weather patterns close to the ground. In this work, we train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN) end-to-end to downscale gridded forecasts to off-grid locations of interest. This multi-modal GNN takes advantage of local historical weather observations (e.g., wind, temperature) to correct the gridded weather forecast at different lead times towards locally accurate forecasts. Each data modality is modeled as a different type of node in the graph. Using message passing, the node at the prediction location aggregates information from its heterogeneous neighbor nodes. Experiments using weather stations across the Northeastern United States show that our model outperforms a range of data-driven and non-data-driven off-grid forecasting methods. Our approach demonstrates how the gap between global large-scale weather models and locally accurate predictions can be bridged to inform localized decision-making.</description>
