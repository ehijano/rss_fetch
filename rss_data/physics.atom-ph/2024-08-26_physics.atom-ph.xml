      <title>Quantum pathways interference in laser-induced electron diffraction revealed by a semiclassical method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel method for strong-laser-field physics based on the combination of the semiclassical Herman-Kluk propagator and the strong-field approximation and demonstrate its high accuracy on the calculations of photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD) for atoms and molecules in intense lasers. For rescattered electrons, we show that for a given time that electron tunnels to the continuum, there are typically multiple trajectories that lead to the same final momentum in the high-energy region. These trajectories start with slightly different initial transverse momenta and carry different phases giving rise to the interference structures in the PMD, which can also be associated with the laser-free electron-ion differential cross section. This is in contrast to the well-known long and short trajectories, which result in different interference patterns. Our results can be used to extend current capabilities of the laser-induced electron diffraction and other ultrafast imaging and strong-field spectroscopic techniques.</description>

      <title>A triaxial vectorization technique for a single-beam zero-field atomic magnetometer to suppress cross-axis projection error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-field optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) have emerged as an important technology for biomagnetism due to their ulta-sensitive performance, contained within a non-cryogenic small-scale sensor-head. The compactness of such OPMs is often achieved through simplified detection schemes, which typically provide only single-axis magnetic field information. However, multi-axis static magnetic fields on non-measurement axes cause a systematic error that manifests as amplitude and phase errors across the measurement axis. Here we present a triaxial operational technique for a compact zero-field OPM which suppresses multi-axis systematic errors through simultaneous measurement and closed-loop active control of the static magnetic fields across all axes. The demonstrated technique requires magnetic modulation across two axes while providing static field information for all three axes. We demonstrate this technique on a rubidium laboratory-based zero-field magnetometer, achieving a bandwidth of 380 Hz with sensitivities of $&lt;25$ fT/$\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ across both transverse axes and $65$ fT/$\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ along the beam axis. Using the proposed triaxial technique, we demonstrate precise tracking of a 2 Hz triaxial vector test signal and suppression of systematic cross-axis projection errors over an extended period, $\simeq20$~min.</description>

      <title>Merging Two Molecular Beams of ND$_3$ up to the Liouville Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In low-energy collisions between two dipolar molecules, the long-range dipole-dipole interaction plays an important role in the scattering dynamics. Merged beam configurations offer the lowest collision energies achievable, but they generally can not be applied to most dipole-dipole systems as the electrodes used to merge one beam would deflect the other. This paper covers the design and implementation of a merged electrostatic guide whose geometry was numerically optimized for ND$_3$-ND$_3$ and ND$_3$-NH$_3$ collisions. This device guides both beams simultaneously and makes them converge up to an effective collision angle of 2$\mathrm{^\circ}$, yielding the optimal compromise between spatial overlap and the lowest possible collision energy. We present preliminary data for inelastic ND$_3$-ND$_3$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved pairing gap spectroscopy in a quantum simulator of fermionic superfluidity inside an optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use an ensemble of laser-cooled strontium atoms in a high-finesse cavity to cleanly emulate the technique of rf spectroscopy employed in studies of BEC-BCS physics in fermionic superfluids of degenerate cold gases. Here, we leverage the multilevel internal structure of the atoms to study the physics of Cooper pair breaking in this system. In doing so, we observe and distinguish the properties of two distinct many-body gaps, the BCS pairing gap and the spectral gap, using nondestructive readout techniques. The latter is found to depend on the populations of the internal atomic states, reflecting the chemical potential dependence predicted in fermionic superfluids. This work opens the path for more fully exploiting the rich internal structure of atoms in cavity QED emulators to study both analogous systems and also more exotic states yet to be realized.</description>

      <title>Atomic clock interferometry using optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clock interferometry refers to the coherent splitting of a clock into two different paths and recombining in a way that reveals the proper time difference between them. Unlike the comparison of two separate clocks, this approach allows testing how non-flat spacetime influences quantum coherence. Atomic clocks are currently the most accurate time keeping devices. Here we propose using optical tweezers to implement clock interferometry. Our proposed clock interferometer employs an alkaline-earth-like atom held in an optical trap at the magic wavelength. Through a combination of adiabatic, tweezer-based, splitting and recombining schemes and a modified Ramsey sequence on the clock states, we achieve a linear sensitivity to the gravitational time dilation. Moreover, the measurement of the time dilation is insensitive to relative fluctuations in the intensity of the tweezer beams. We analyze the tweezer clock interferometer and show that it is feasible with current technological capabilities. The proposed interferometer could test the effect of gravitational redshift on quantum coherence, and implement the quantum twin paradox.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of weighted graph optimization on a Rydberg atom array using local light-shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have emerged as a versatile platform towards scalable quantum computation and optimization. In this paper we present first demonstrations of weighted graph optimization on a Rydberg atom array using annealing with local light-shifts. We verify the ability to prepare weighted graphs in 1D and 2D arrays, including embedding a five vertex non-unit disk graph using nine physical qubits and demonstration of a simple crossing gadget. We find common annealing ramps leading to preparation of the target ground state robustly over a substantial range of different graph weightings. This work provides a route to exploring large-scale optimization of non-planar weighted graphs relevant for solving relevant real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Atomic fluorescence collection into planar photonic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence collection from individual emitters plays a key role in state detection and remote entanglement generation, fundamental functionalities in many quantum platforms. Planar photonics have been demonstrated for robust and scalable addressing of trapped-ion systems, motivating consideration of similar elements for the complementary challenge of photon collection. Here, using an argument from the reciprocity principle, we show that far-field photon collection efficiency can be simply expressed in terms of the fields associated with the collection optic at the emitter position alone. We calculate collection efficiencies into ideal paraxial and fully vectorial focused Gaussian modes parameterized in terms of focal waist, and further quantify the modest enhancements possible with more general beam profiles, establishing design requirements for efficient collection. Towards practical implementation, we design, fabricate, and characterize a diffractive collection element operating at $\lambda=397$ nm predicted to offer a total 0.25\% collection efficiency into a single waveguide mode. A more efficient design with more demanding fabrication requirements would offer $1.14\%$, and we indicate avenues to improved devices approaching the limits predicted for ideal beams. We point out a particularly simple integrated waveguide configuration for polarization-based remote entanglement generation enabled by integrated collection.</description>
