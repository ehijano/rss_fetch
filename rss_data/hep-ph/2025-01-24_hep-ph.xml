      <title>The Open Relativistic Two-body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The open relativistic two-body problem, when two interacting particles also are in external potentials, is considered in terms of the principle of the least action. Based on the consistent modification of the relativistic version Newton's third law in external fields, the exact covariant operator equations, which govern dynamics of either a scalar particle or each of the components of the 16 component spinor of spin-$1/2$ fermions, depending on the particle type, are derived in the center-mass and relative motion variables, beyond the consideration in the Breit frame only. The class of external fields and interaction potentials, when the two-body problem can be covariantly reformulated in (3+1) phase space of relative motion variables, uncoupled from the center-mass motion of such a system, is outlined. In the case of fermions the new $\gamma$-matrix basis generating the Dirac-like equation for the 16 component spinors in the (3+1) phase space is found. The chosen basis allows us to decouple the derived Dirac-like equation into four independent equations governing the dynamics of the four-component spinors. The developed approach is examined in studying the low-energy positronium states in magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Are there minimal exceptional aGUTs from stable 5D orbifolds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In analysing five dimensional orbifolds with exceptional gauge groups, we seek to find stable vacua configurations which satisfy the minimal requirements for asymptotic grand unified models. In this respect we show that no minimal asymptotic grand unified theory can be built. Our results point towards non-minimal models based on $E_6$: one featuring supersymmetry, and the other needing a modification of the Coleman-Weinberg potential to stabilise the breaking of $E_6$ to the standard model gauge group.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic leptogenesis with light-heavy sterile neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel leptogenesis scenario utilising the two-body decay of heavy right handed neutrino (RHN) via the electromagnetic dipole operator. While the requirement of the standard model (SM) gauge invariance requires such dipole operator only at dimension-6 forcing the generation of non-zero CP asymmetry from three-body decay with two-loop corrections, we write down dimension-5 dipole operators involving heavy RHN $N_R$ and its lighter counterpart $\nu_R$. This allows the generation of lepton asymmetry in $\nu_R$ from two-body decay of heavy RHN which later gets transferred to left handed leptons via sizeable Yukawa coupling with a neutrinophilic Higgs doublet. The asymmetry in left handed leptons is then converted to baryon asymmetry via electroweak sphalerons. The lepton number violation by heavy RHN also induces a one-loop Majorana mass of $\nu_R$ rendering the light neutrinos to be Majorana fermions. While smallness of the Majorana mass of $\nu_R$ prevents additional sources or washout of lepton asymmetry, it also constrains the scale of leptogenesis. For $\mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV scale leptogenesis, this leads to additional sterile neutrinos lighter than a few keV with interesting implications for a variety of observables including neutrino oscillation, warm dark matter as well as effective degrees of freedom within reach of future cosmic microwave background experiments. Additionally, heavy RHN can lead to observable monochromatic photon signatures at terrestrial experiments.</description>

      <title>Neutrinophilic $\mathbf{\Lambda}$CDM Extension for EMPRESS, DESI and Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of recent cosmological observations have indicated the presence of new physics beyond the $\mathbf{\Lambda}$CDM model. Combining observations from EMPRESS on helium abundance and DESI on baryon acoustic oscillations with Hubble tension, we show that all of them can be explained concurrently with a extension of the $\mathbf{\Lambda}$CDM model with primordial neutrino asymmetry $\xi_{\nu}$ and additional contribution to the effective number of neutrinos $\delta N_{\rm eff}$. Based on the accurate treatments of neutrino decoupling and BBN processes, we present state-of-the-art constraints on neutrino asymmetry for the fixed or varying $N_{\rm eff}$. Comparing different extensions of the $\mathbf{\Lambda}$CDM model, we show that the neutrinophilic $\mathbf{\Lambda}$CDM extension with $\xi_{\nu} = 0.056 \pm 0.017 $ and $\delta N_{\rm eff} = 0.41 \pm 0.16$ is preferred by current observations, while the Hubble tension in this model is also alleviated to be $2.2 \sigma$.</description>

      <title>Axion framework with color-mediated Dirac neutrino masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a KSVZ-type axion framework in which vector-like quarks (VLQ) and colored scalars generate Dirac neutrino masses radiatively. The global Peccei-Quinn symmetry (under which the exotic fermions are charged) addresses the strong CP problem and ensures the Dirac nature of neutrinos. The axion also accounts for the observed cosmological dark matter. We systematically explore all viable VLQ representations. Depending on the specific scenario, the framework predicts distinct axion-to-photon couplings, testable through haloscope and helioscope experiments, as well as potentially significant flavor-violating quark-axion interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review the contributions of Giorgio Parisi to perturbative QCD. Concentrated in a decade, they mark the transition of the theory of strong interactions from a set of loosely connected ideas based on models, to a quantum field theory that is now an integral part of the standard model of fundamental interactions. Parisi's contributions have established at a very early stage ideas, methods and tools that are now standard, and in several cases anticipated results that only became prominent in the XXIst century.</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Matter with MeVCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CubeSat technology is an emerging alternative to large-scale space telescopes due to its short development time and cost-effectiveness. MeVCube is a proposed CubeSat mission to study the least explored MeV gamma-ray sky, also known as the `MeV gap'. Besides being sensitive to a plethora of astrophysical phenomena, MeVCube can also be important in the hunt for dark matter. If dark matter is made up of evaporating primordial black holes, then it can produce photons in the sensitivity range of MeVCube. Besides, particle dark matter can also decay or annihilate to produce final state gamma-ray photons. We perform the first comprehensive study of dark matter discovery potential of a near-future MeVCube CubeSat mission. In all cases, we find that MeVCube will have much better discovery reach compared to existing limits in the parameter space. This may be an important step towards discovering dark matter through its non-gravitational interactions.</description>

      <title>Fast interpolation grids for the Drell-Yan process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern analyses of experimental data from hadron colliders rely on theory predictions at high orders in perturbation theory and a variety of input settings. Interpolation grids facilitate an almost instant re-evaluation of theory predictions for different input parton distributions functions (PDFs) or scale settings and are thus indispensable in the study of the parton content of the proton. While interpolation grids at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) exist for some key processes relevant for PDF determinations, a notable exception is the Drell-Yan process that constitutes the production of electroweak gauge bosons at hadron colliders and provides important constraints on the quark content of the proton. To address this gap, we report on a new interface between the parton-level Monte Carlo generator NNLOJET and the interpolation grid library PINEAPPL and demonstrate its use for the Drell-Yan process. Accompanying this note, we release Drell-Yan grids covering a wide range of measurements that commonly enter global determinations of PDFs. We use the grids to study accidental cancellation between partonic channels at NNLO and inspect the validity of a K-factor approximation that was widely employed previously.</description>

      <title>Type-III Scotogenic Model: Inflation, Dark Matter and Collider Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an extension of the Type-III scotogenic model by incorporating a real singlet scalar. This scalar plays a crucial role as the inflaton due to its non-minimal coupling with the Ricci scalar. The inflaton field subsequently decays into other particles within the Type-III scotogenic framework. In this framework, the inert scalar doublet and fermion triplet are crucial for neutrino mass generation and present strong candidates for 25\% energy budget or dark matter in the Universe. We study their relic abundance and potential for direct detection. Furthermore, we discuss possible observational signals that could be identified in future collider experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the most general local, Lorentz-invariant, effective field theory of scalars, fermions and gauge bosons up to mass dimension 6. We first obtain both a Green and a physical basis for such an effective theory, together with the on-shell reduction of the former to the latter. We then proceed to compute the renormalization group equations for the bosonic operators of this general effective theory at one-loop order.</description>

      <title>Distribution Functions of a Radially Excited Pion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonperturbatively-improved, symmetry-preserving approximation to the quantum field equations relevant in calculations of meson masses and interactions is used to deliver predictions for all distribution functions (DFs) of the ground state pion, $\pi_0$, and its first radial excitation, $\pi_1$, viz. valence, glue, and sea. Regarding Mellin moments of the valence DFs, the $m=0,1$ moments in both states are identical; but for each $m\geq 2$, that in the $\pi_0$ is greater than its partner in the $\pi_1$. Working with such information, pointwise reconstructions of the hadron-scale $\pi_{0,1}$ valence DFs are developed. The predicted $\pi_0$ valence DF is consistent with extant results. The $\pi_1$ valence DF is novel: it possesses three-peaks, with the central maximum partnered by secondary peaks on either side, each separated from the centre by a zero: the zeroes lie at $x\approx 0.2,0.8$ and the secondary peaks at $x\approx 0.1,0.9$. Evolution to $\zeta =3.2\,$GeV, a typical scale for nonperturbative calculations, is accomplished using an evolution scheme for parton DFs that is all-orders exact. At this higher scale, differences between the $\pi_{0,1}$ valence DFs remain significant, but analogous differences between glue and sea DFs are far smaller. This analysis shows that, owing to constraints imposed by chiral symmetry and the pattern by which it is broken in Nature, there are noticeable differences between the structural properties of the pion ground state and its radial excitations.</description>

      <title>Tetraquarks in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional loosely bound molecule interpretation of the $X(3872)$ is not compatible with the recent LHCb experimental measurement of the ratio of branching fractions $\mathcal{R}=\text{Br}(X\to\psi^\prime\gamma)/\text{Br}(X\to\psi\gamma)$. We systematically determine the entire tetraquark spectrum for $J=0,1,2$ and refine the calculation of $\mathcal{R}$ in an improved Born-Oppenheimer description of the $X(3872)$ compact tetraquark. This refinement yields a significantly better agreement with experimental data on ${\cal R}$ and on the spectroscopy of the states themselves. Extending the diquark-antidiquark paradigm to encompass tetraquarks that are linear superposition of open charm singlets and color octets, we discover that these exotic resonances manifest as compact shallow bound states of quarks in color force potentials.</description>

      <title>CosmiXs: Improved spectra for dark matter indirect detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectra of stable particles produced from dark matter (DM) are one of the most important ingredients to calculate the fluxes for DM indirect detection experiments. At energies above a few GeV, most of the particles are produced following a complex sequence of phenomena including resonance decays, QED and QCD final-state radiation, radiation of weak gauge bosons, hadronization and hadron decays. In this contribution, we discuss improvements on the calculation of the energy spectra at the source using state-of-the-art tools that include effects that were not taken previously into account. We include helicity information of the particles produced in the annihilation channels, which leads to proper inclusion of electroweak radiation during the entire showering history. These effects are taken into account using the Vincia, which is based on the helicity-dependent antenna shower formalism. Off-shell contributions are also taken into account for annihilation channels into $WW$ and $ZZ$ through the four-body processes into fermions and for DM masses below the gauge boson mass. We also revisit the tune of the Lund fragmentation function parameters in Pythia using LEP data at the $Z$-boson pole. The spectra of cosmic messengers are provided for DM masses between 5 GeV and 100 GeV and are publicly distributed in this \href{https://github.com/ajueid/CosmiXs.git}{GitHub repository}.</description>

      <title>Probing new scalars with the lepton anomalous magnetic moment and the weak equivalence principle violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new scalar particle with generic couplings to the standard-model particles is a possible source for the lepton anomalous magnetic moment and the violation of the weak equivalence principle. Here, one-loop contributions to the lepton anomalous magnetic moment, involving the scalar-photon and scalar-lepton couplings, are calculated. Then, with the recent experimental results of the electron anomalous magnetic moment, the muon anomalous magnetic moment, and the MICROSCOPE mission, we find that a scalar which couples merely to the photon or leptons can not be consistent with three experimental results. It has to couple to both the photon and leptons simultaneously. Improved constraints on scalar-lepton and scalar-photon couplings are set: $|\lambda_e|=(1.8-8.2)\times 10^{-6}$, $|\lambda_\mu|=(2.5-4.8)\times 10^{-4}$, and $|\lambda_\gamma|=(1.5-6.5)\times 10^{-14}$ ${\rm eV^{-1}}\, {\rm or}\,\, (1.4-6.1)\times 10^{-13}$ ${\rm eV^{-1}}$. We find that the naive scaling relationship between the scalar-muon coupling and the scalar-electron coupling is not favored by three experimental results. Furthermore, we show that the minimal standard-model extension by one scalar is also not favored for scalar mass below $10^4$ eV.</description>

      <title>Gluon polarization contribution to the spin alignment of vector mesons from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of vector mesons $\rho$, $\phi$, and $J/\Psi$ in both non-rotating and rotating thermal media using the soft-wall holographic QCD model with four flavours. By incorporating anisotropic backgrounds derived from the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton action, we incorporate rotational effects via a $U(1)$ gauge field, and the induced polarization of gluons is described by a rotation dependent dilation field. Spectral function analysis reveals that $\rho$ and $\phi$ mesons exhibit broad peaks at lower temperatures, indicating their presence in the medium, while these peaks disappear at higher temperatures. Rotation delays this melting process, increasing the dissociation temperature. In contrast, the $J/\Psi$ meson, owing to its heavy charm quark content, demonstrating its resilience to thermal effects. We further explore the global spin alignment of these mesons in the event plane frame. For the $\phi$ meson, the averaged $\rho_{00}$ over the full range of azimuthal angle shows weak temperature dependence at low transverse momentum ($p_T$) but significant suppression at high $p_T$, aligning with experimental observations. Rotation enhances $\rho_{00}$ at high $p_T$, a phenomenon attributed to angular momentum transfer via spin-orbit coupling. The $J/\Psi$ meson, however, displays insensitivity to temperature and rotation up to $p_T=5$ GeV, with a very small suppression observed at higher $p_T$, likely due to its heavy quark nature. Although $\rho$ meson spin alignment is not yet experimentally measured, it exhibits behaviour qualitatively similar to the $\phi$ meson, with thermal fluctuations dampening alignment and rotation enhancing it.</description>

      <title>A systematic investigation on vector dark matter-nucleus scattering in effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the general spin-one dark matter-nucleus interactions within the framework of effective field theories (EFT). We consider both the nonrelativistic (NR) and the relativistic EFT descriptions of the DM interactions with nucleons and quarks. In the NREFT framework, we present a complete list of NR operators for spin-one DM coupling to nucleons and compute their contributions to the DM response functions. Next, we consider all possible leading-order relativistic EFT operators between DM and light quarks and the photon, and perform NR reductions to match them onto the NREFT. We then derive the nuclear scattering rate from these interactions, and employ recent DM direct detection data (from both the nuclear recoil and the Migdal effect) to constrain all these EFT operators and DM electromagnetic properties. We find the elastic nuclear recoil data (from PandaX-4T, XENONnT, LZ, and DarkSide-50) set stringent bounds on the EFT coefficients for a DM mass above a few GeV while the Migdal effect datasets (from PandaX-4T, XENONnT, and DarkSide-50) can probe the DM mass region as small as 20 MeV. Lastly, we construct a UV complete model that can provide a complex spin-one DM candidate, and at the same time generate DM-quark/photon operators discussed in this work.</description>

      <title>Testing the hypothesis of vector X17 boson by D meson, Charmonium, and $\phi$ meson decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent ATOMKI experiments provided evidence pointing towards the existence of an X17 boson in the anomalous nuclear transitions of Beryllium-8, Helium-4, and Carbon-12. In this work, we consider X17 boson contributions to the previously measured $D$ meson decays which include $D_s^{*+} \rightarrow D_s^+ e^+ e^-$, $D_s^{*+} \rightarrow D_s^+ \gamma$, $D^{*0} \rightarrow D^0 e^+ e^-$, and $D^{*0} \rightarrow D^0 \gamma$, as well as the measured decays of $\psi(2S) \rightarrow \eta_c e^+ e^-$, $\psi(2S) \rightarrow \eta_c \gamma$, $\phi \rightarrow \eta e^+ e^-$, and $\phi \rightarrow \eta \gamma$. Using the data of the above meson decays, we perform a fitting to the coupling parameters $\varepsilon_u, \varepsilon_c$, and $\varepsilon_s$ by treating the couplings $\varepsilon_u$ and $\varepsilon_c$ as independent from each other rather than assuming the generation universality $\varepsilon_u =\varepsilon_c$. It is found that the above fitting renders $|\varepsilon_c|=3\times 10^{-4}$, $|\varepsilon_s|=4\times 10^{-5}$ and a huge magnitude for $\varepsilon_u$, which is in serious tension with $\left|\varepsilon_u\right|$ determined from ATOMKI measurements.</description>

      <title>Analysis of inflationary models in higher-dimensional uniform inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider higher-dimensional uniform inflation, in which the extra dimensions expand at the same rate as three-dimensional non-compact space during inflation. We compute the cosmological perturbation in $D+4$ dimensions and derive the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-scalar ratio $r$. We analyze five inflationary models: chaotic inflation, natural inflation, quartic hilltop inflation, inflation with spontaneously broken SUSY, and $R^2$ inflation. By combining the results from these models with the Planck 2018 constraints, we discuss that it is not desirable for the extra-dimensional space to expand at the same rate as the three-dimensional non-compact space, except for the case of one extra dimension.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose detecting dark photon (DP), a major candidate for wave dark matter, through polarimetry. The DP can modify Maxwell's equations, due to its kinetic mixing with regular photon, inducing an oscillating component in the electromagnetic field. This may leave an imprint in polarimetric light signals, characterised by a distinctive wave pattern in spacetime. As a demonstration, we apply this methodology to investigate ultralight DP produced through the superradiance of supermassive black holes. Then using the polarimetric measurements of the radiation from M87$^\ast$ at the Event Horizon Telescope, we show that all Stokes parameters can serve as a probe in conducting this task. Especially, the absence of significant temporal variation in the linear-polarisation position angle of the M87$^\ast$ images allows us to set novel limits on the photon-DP mixing parameter over the rarely-explored DP mass range of $10^{-22}$--$10^{-20}$eV, with the best reach of $\sim 10^{-8}$ achieved at $\sim 10^{-20.2}$eV. Given the universality of its underlying physics, we expect the DP polarimetry to be broadly applied for the DP detection in laboratory experiments and astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Three Methods for Triggering Core-collapse Supernova Explosions in Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the three-dimensional nature of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), simulations in spherical symmetry (1D) play an important role to study large model sets for the progenitor-remnant connection, explosion properties, remnant masses, and CCSN nucleosynthesis. To trigger explosions in 1D, various numerical recipes have been applied, mostly with gross simplifications of the complex microphysics governing stellar core collapse, the formation of the compact remnant, and the mechanism of the explosion. Here we investigate the two most popular treatments, piston-driven and thermal-bomb explosions, in comparison to 1D explosions powered by a parametric neutrino engine in the P-HOTB code. For this comparison we calculate CCSNe for eight stars and evolution times up to 10,000 s, targeting the same progenitor-specific explosion energies as obtained by the neutrino-engine results. Otherwise we employ widely-used ("classic") modelling assumptions, and alternatively to the standard contraction-expansion trajectory for pistons, we also test suitably selected Lagrangian mass shells adopted from the neutrino-driven explosions as "special trajectories." Although the 56Ni production agrees within roughly a factor of two between the different explosion triggers, neither piston nor thermal bombs can reproduce the correlation of 56Ni yields and explosion energies found in neutrino-driven explosions. This shortcoming as well as the problem of massive fallback witnessed in classical piston models, which diminishes or extinguishes the ejected nickel, can be largely cured by the special trajectories. These and the choice of the explosion energies, however, make the modelling dependent on pre-existing neutrino-driven explosion results.</description>

      <title>The neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum of nova outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nova outburst can produce a large number of neutrinos, whether it is the nuclear reaction process during the explosion or the shock wave acceleration proton process. We study the low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity of novae with CO white dwarf (WD) mass ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 $\rm M_{\odot}$ with different accretion rates $\dot{M}$, core temperatures $(T_{\mathrm{C}})$, and mixing degrees. We find that during the accretion phase, low-energy neutrinos are mainly produced by pp chains and plasma decay, and photon luminosity is greater than low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity. During the thermonuclear runaway (TNR) phase, low-energy neutrinos are mainly produced by the CNO cycle and photon-neutrino, and the low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity far exceeds the photon luminosity. We find that the more massive the WD, the shorter the cycle time and the higher the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity. The higher the accretion rate, the lower the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity. If the accretion mixing effect is not taken into account, the outburst interval becomes longer, the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity will be increased. And for the cooler nova model $(T_{\mathrm{C}}=1\times10^{7}\rm K)$, the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity will be lower during the accretion phase and higher at the TNR. We also predict the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum of the upcoming recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB). We estimate that the next T CrB outburst has a low-energy nuclear neutrino peak luminosity of $2.7\times10^{8}\ \rm L_{\nu,\odot}$ and a low-energy nuclear neutrino outburst duration of 88 days. In addition, we predict that the high-energy hadronic neutrino flux produced by T CrB nova can not be observed by the current-generation IceCube.</description>

      <title>A proposal for removing $\pi N$-state contamination from the nucleon induced pseudoscalar form factor in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the PACS10 project, the PACS collaboration has generated three sets of the PACS10 gauge configurations at the physical point with lattice volume larger than $(10\;{\rm fm})^4$ and three different lattice spacings. The isovector nucleon form factors had been already calculated by using two sets of the PACS10 gauge configurations. In our strategy, the smearing parameters of the nucleon interpolation operator were highly optimized to eliminate as much as possible the contribution of excited states in the nucleon two-point function. This strategy was quite successful in calculations of the electric ($G_E$), magnetic ($G_M$) and axial-vector ($F_A$) form factors, while the induced pseudoscalar ($F_P$) and pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factors remained strongly affected by residual contamination of $\pi N$-state contribution. In this work, we propose a simple method to remove the $\pi N$-state contamination from the $F_P$ form factor, and then evaluate the induced pseudoscalar charge $g_P^\ast$ and the pion-nucleon coupling $g_{\pi NN}$ from existing data in a new analysis. Applying this method to the $G_P$ form factor is also considered with a help of the axial Ward-Takahashi identity.</description>

      <title>Towards a parameter-free analysis of the QCD chiral phase transition and its universal critical behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To quantify the universal properties of chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD, we use an improved, renormalized order parameter for the chiral symmetry breaking. We construct ratios of this divergence-free order parameter from its values for different pairs of light quark masses. From this, we determine in a parameter-independent manner, the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ and the associated critical exponent $\delta$ of the universality class. We present first numerical results of these calculations on $N_\tau=8$ lattices, with staggered fermions.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Accurate Implementation of the Effective Fluid Approximation for Ultralight Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerically efficient and accurate implementation of the Passaglia-Hu effective fluid approximation for ultralight axions (ULAs) within the Boltzmann code CAMB. This method is specifically designed to evolve the axion field accurately across cosmological timescales, mitigating the challenges associated with its rapid oscillations. Our implementation is based on the latest version of CAMB, ensuring compatibility with other cosmological codes., e.g. for calculating cosmological parameter constraints. Compared to exact solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation, our method achieves sub-percent accuracy in the CMB power spectrum across a broad range of axion masses, from $10^{-28}\,\mathrm{eV}$ to $10^{-24}\,\mathrm{eV}$. We perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses incorporating our implementation, and find improved constraints on the axion mass and abundance compared to previous, simpler fluid-based approximations. For example, using \Planck\ PR4 and DESI BAO data, we find $2\sigma$ upper limits on the axion fraction $f_{\rm ax} &lt; 0.0082$ and physical density $\Omega_{\rm ax}h^2 &lt; 0.0010$ for $m=10^{-28}$ eV. The code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/adammoss/AxiCAMB}.</description>

Abstract: These notes contain -- apart from some physics -- scattered reminiscences of everyday life at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in G\"oteborg in the early eighties. The text has been in the making for many years. Some of it was written inspired by the Lars Brink 70-fest at The Solvay Institute in Brussels in 2014, but was never finished or published. Parts of the old text has now been replaced by a review of the quite unexpected recent renaissance for light-front higher spin theory. Lars sadly did not live to experience more than the very beginnings of this quite remarkable development. The text was finalized in the spring of 2023.</description>

      <title>Can $\nu$DM interactions solve the $S_8$ discrepancy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present compelling evidence that Dark Matter (DM)-neutrino interactions can resolve the persistent structure growth parameter discrepancy, $S_8 = \sigma_8\,\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$, between early and late universe observations. By incorporating cosmic shear measurements from current Weak Lensing (WL) surveys and leveraging an emulator based on true $N$-body simulations to account for nonlinear corrections, we demonstrate that an interaction strength of $u \sim 10^{-4}$ not only provides a coherent explanation for the high-multipole observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), but also alleviates the $S_8$ discrepancy. Combining early universe constraints with DES Y3 cosmic shear data yields a nearly $3\sigma$ detection of non-zero DM-neutrino interactions, marking a significant breakthrough in cosmological research. Our findings challenge the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm and highlight the potential of future large-scale structure surveys, which can rigorously test this interaction and unveil the fundamental properties of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Free-Streaming Neutrinos and Their Phase Shift in Current and Future CMB Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic neutrino background and other light relics leave distinct imprints in the cosmic microwave background anisotropies through their gravitational influence. Since neutrinos decoupled from the primordial plasma about one second after the big bang, they have been free-streaming through the universe. This induced a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic peaks as a unique signature. In this work, we constrain the free-streaming nature of these relativistic species and other light relics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics by establishing two complementary template-based approaches to robustly infer the size of this phase shift from the temperature and polarization power spectra. One template shifts the multipoles in these spectra, while the other novel template more fundamentally isolates the phase shift at the level of the underlying photon-baryon perturbations. Applying these methods to Planck data, we detect the neutrino-induced phase shift at about $10\sigma$ significance, which rises to roughly $14\sigma$ with additional data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope. We also infer that the data is consistent with the Standard Model prediction of three free-streaming neutrinos. In addition, we forecast the capabilities of future experiments which will enable significantly more precise phase-shift measurements, with the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 reducing the $1\sigma$ uncertainties to roughly 4.3% and 2.5%, respectively. More generally, we establish a new analysis pipeline for the phase shift induced by neutrinos and other free-streaming dark radiation which additionally offers new avenues for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model in a signature-driven and model-agnostic way.</description>

      <title>Inflaton Self Resonance, Oscillons, and Gravitational Waves in Small Field Polynomial Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the post-inflationary dynamics of a simple single-field model with a renormalizable inflaton potential featuring a near-inflection point at a field value $\phi_0$. Due to the concave shape of the scalar potential, the effective mass of the inflaton becomes imaginary during as well as for some period after slow-roll inflation. As a result, in the initial reheating phase, where the inflaton oscillates around its minimum with a large amplitude, some field fluctuations grow exponentially; this effect becomes stronger at smaller $\phi_0$. This aspect can be analyzed using the Floquet theorem. We also analytically estimate the backreaction time after which the perturbations affect the evolution of the average inflaton field. In order to fully analyze this non-perturbative regime, we perform a (classical) lattice simulation, which reveals that the exponential growth of field fluctuations can fragment the system. This leads to a large amount of non-Gaussianity at very small scales, but the equation of state remains close to matter-like. The evolution of the background field throughout the fragmentation phase can be understood using the Hartree approximation. For sufficiently small $\phi_0$ soliton-like objects, called oscillons in the literature, are formed. This leads to areas with high local over-density, $\delta \rho \gg \bar\rho$ where $\bar\rho$ is the average energy density. We speculate that this could lead to the formation of light primordial black holes, with lifetime $\gtrsim 10^{-19} \text{sec}$. Other possibly observational consequences, in particular gravitational waves in the $\text{MHz} - \text{GHz}$ range, are discussed as well. Although a complete analytical study is difficult in our case, we obtain a power law scaling for the potential observables on $\phi_0$.</description>

Abstract: Some previous studies based on IceCube neutrinos had found intriguing preliminary evidence that some of them might be GRB neutrinos with travel times affected by quantum properties of spacetime delaying them proportionally to their energy, an effect often labeled as "quantum-spacetime-induced in-vacuo dispersion". Those previous studies looked for candidate GRB neutrinos in a fixed (neutrino-energy-independent) time window after the GRB onset and relied rather crucially on crude estimates of the redshift of GRBs whose redshift has not been measured. We here introduce a complementary approach to the search of quantum-spacetime-affected GRB neutrinos which restricts the analysis to GRBs of sharply known redshift, and, in a way that we argue is synergistic with having sharp information on redshift, adopts a neutrino-energy-dependent time window. We find that knowing the redshift of the GRBs strengthens the analysis enough to compensate for the fact that of course the restriction to GRBs of known redshift reduces the number of candidate GRB neutrinos. And rather remarkably our estimate of the magnitude of the in-vacuo-dispersion effects is fully consistent with what had been found using the previous approach. Our findings are still inconclusive, since their significance is quantified by a $p$-value of little less than $0.01$, but provide motivation for monitoring the accrual of neutrino observations by IceCube and KM3NeT as well as for further refinements of the strategy of analysis here proposed.</description>

      <title>Topological $SU(3)_f$ approach for two-body $\Omega_c$ weak decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the two-body non-leptonic weak decays of $\Omega_c^0$ into final states ${\bf B}^{(*)}M$ and ${\bf B}^{(*)}V$, where ${\bf B}^{(*)}$ denotes an octet (a decuplet) baryon and $M(V)$ represents a pseudoscalar (vector) meson. We employ the topological $SU(3)_f$ approach to depict and parameterize the $W$-emission and $W$-exchange processes. We find that the topological parameters can be associated and combined, making them extractable for calculation. Consequently, we explain the partially measured branching fractions relative to ${\cal B}(\Omega_c^0\to \Omega^-\pi^+)$, recombined or kept as the following ratios: ${\cal B}(\Omega_c^0\to\Xi^{*0}\bar K^{*0})/{\cal B}(\Omega_c^0\to\Omega^-\rho^+)=0.28\pm 0.11$, ${\cal B}(\Omega_c^0\to\Xi^-\pi^+)/{\cal B}(\Omega_c^0\to\Xi^{0}\bar K^{0})=0.10\pm 0.02$, and ${\cal B}(\Omega_c^0 \to \Omega^- K^+)/{\cal B}(\Omega_c^0 \to \Omega^- \pi^+)=0.06\pm 0.01$. In particular, we present ${\cal B}(\Omega_c^0 \to \Xi^0 \pi^0)=(2.3\pm0.2)\times 10^{-4}$ as half the value of ${\cal B}(\Omega_c^0 \to \Xi^- \pi^+)$ in the approximate isospin relation, and highlight potential candidates for testing $SU(3)_f$ symmetry breaking.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational positivity bounds provide consistency conditions for effective field theories with gravity. They turn out to be phenomenologically useful by providing lower bounds in parameters of new physics beyond the Standard Models (BSM). In this paper, we derive constraints on millicharged fermion dark matter models with massless dark photon using gravitational positivity bounds. Combining them with upper bounds from cosmological and astrophysical observations, we can severely constrain the parameter space of the model. In particular, we show that when the dark matter mass is lighter than the solar core temperature, most of the parameter region is excluded by combining gravitational positivity bounds and the stellar bounds.</description>

      <title>Flavor dependent Critical endpoint from holographic QCD through machine learning</title>

Abstract: QCD phase diagram in the $T - \mu$ plane and the equation of state for pure gluon, 2-flavor, 2+1-flavor systems, and 2+1+1-flavor systems have been investigated using the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) framework at finite temperature and chemical potential. By inputting lattice QCD data for the equation of state and baryon number susceptibility at zero chemical potential into holographic model, all the parameters can be determined with the aid of machine learning algorithms. Our findings indicate that the deconfinement phase transition is of first order for the pure gluon system with critical temperature $T_c = 0.265$ GeV at vanishing chemical potential. The phase transition for the 2-flavor, 2+1-flavor systems, and 2+1+1-flavor systems are crossover at vanishing chemical potential and first-order at high chemical potential, and the critical endpoint (CEP) in the $T - \mu$ plane locates at ($\mu_B^c$=0.46 GeV, $T^c$=0.147 GeV), ($\mu_B^c$ = 0.74 GeV, $T^c$ = 0.094 GeV), and ($\mu_B^c$= 0.87 GeV,$T^c$ = 0.108 GeV), respectively. Additionally, the thermodynamic quantities of the system for different flavors at finite chemical potential are presented in this paper. It is observed that the difference between the 2+1-flavor and 2+1+1-flavor systems is invisible at vanishing chemical potential and low temperature. The location of CEP for 2+1+1-flavor system deviates explicitly from that of the 2+1-flavor system with the increase of chemical potential. Both 2+1-flavor and 2+1+1-flavor systems differ significantly from the 2-flavor system. Moreover, at zero temperature, the critical chemical potential is found to be $\mu_B$ = 1.1 GeV, 1.6 GeV, 1.9 GeV for the 2-flavor, 2+1-flavor and 2+1+1-flavor systems, respectively.</description>

      <title>NNLO PDFs driven by top-quark data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of state-of-the-art top-quark data collected at the Large Hadron Collider on parton distribution functions (PDFs). Following the ABMP methodology, the fit extracts simultaneously proton PDFs, the strong coupling $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ and heavy-quark masses at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy in QCD. It includes recent high-statistics data on absolute total inclusive cross sections for $t\bar{t}+X$, the sum of $(t + X)$ and $(\bar{t} + X)$ hadroproduction, and normalized inclusive data double-differential in the invariant mass and rapidity of the $t\bar{t}$ pair at $\sqrt{S}=13$ TeV. The gluon PDF at large $x$ and the top-quark mass value derived from these data are well compatible with the previous ABMP16 results, but with significantly smaller uncertainties, reduced by up to a factor of two. At NNLO in QCD we obtain for the strong coupling the value $\alpha_s^{(n_f=5)}(M_Z)= 0.1150 \pm 0.0009$ and for the top-quark mass in the ${\overline{\mbox{MS}}}$-scheme $m_t(m_t) = 160.6 \pm 0.6$ GeV, corresponding to $m_t^{\rm pole} = 170.2 \pm 0.7$ GeV in the on-shell scheme. The new fit, dubbed ABMPtt, is publicly released in grids in LHAPDF format.</description>

      <title>Production of $\psi (4040)$, $\psi (4160)$, and $\psi (4415)$ mesons in strong interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the inelastic scattering of charmed strange mesons by open-charm mesons in hadronic matter produced in Pb-Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, we study the production of $\psi (4040)$, $\psi (4160)$, and $\psi (4415)$ mesons. Master rate equations are established for inelastic scattering. The scattering is caused by quark interchange in association with color interactions between all constituent pairs in different mesons. We consider fifty-one reactions between charmed strange and open-charm mesons. Unpolarized cross sections for the reactions are obtained from a temperature-dependent interquark potential. The temperature dependence of the cross sections causes the contributions of the reactions to the production of $\psi (4040)$, $\psi (4160)$, and $\psi (4415)$ to change with decreasing temperature during the evolution of hadronic matter. For central Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV, the master rate equations reveal that the $\psi(4040)$ number density is larger than the $\psi(4160)$ number density which is larger than the $\psi(4415)$ number density.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of Cosmic Ray Electron Boosted Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a model of boosted dark matter (DM), where a fraction of DM is upscattered to relativistic energies by cosmic ray electrons. Such interactions responsible for boosting the DM also attenuate its flux at the Earth. Considering a simple model of constant interaction cross-section, we make analytical estimates of the variation of the attenuation ceiling with the DM mass and confirm it numerically. We then extend our analysis to a $Z'$-mediated leptophilic DM model. We show that the attenuation ceiling remains nearly model-independent for DM and mediator particles heavier than the electron, challenging some previous discussions on this topic. Using the XENONnT direct detection experiment, we illustrate how constraints based on energy-dependent scattering can significantly differ from those based on an assumed constant cross-section. This highlights the importance of re-evaluating these constraints in the context of specific models.</description>

      <title>Low scale leptogenesis under neutrino $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the literature, the neutrino $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry (which has the interesting predictions $\theta^{}_{23} =\pi/4$ and $\delta = \pm \pi/2$ for the atmospherical neutrino mixing angle and Dirac CP phase) is an attractive and widely studied candidate for the flavor symmetries in the neutrino sector. But it is known that, when the seesaw model is furnished with this symmetry, the leptogenesis mechanism (which provides an elegant explanation for the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the Universe) can only work in the two-flavor regime (which only holds for the right-handed neutrino masses in the range $10^9-10^{12}$ GeV). This prohibits us to have a low scale seesaw model (which has the potential to be directly accessed by running or upcoming collider experiments) that can have the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry and successful leptogenesis simultaneously. In this paper, for the first time, we demonstrate that the successful leptogenesis may also be achieved in low scale seesaw models furnished with the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry, by means of the flavor non-universality of the conversion efficiencies from the flavored lepton asymmetries to the baryon asymmetry via the sphaleron process. We perform the study in both the resonant leptogenesis regime and the leptogenesis via oscillations (ARS leptogenesis) regime.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent $M1$ radiative transitions of excited $B_c$ and heavy quarkonia with different polarizations in the light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the properties of pseudoscalar and vector charmonia, bottomonia, and $B_c$ mesons using the light-front quark model, focusing on the $M1$ radiative transition. For that purpose, we conduct a variational analysis with a QCD-motivated effective Hamiltonian, employing a trial wave function expanded in the harmonic oscillator basis functions up to the $3S$ state. We fit the model parameters to mass spectra and decay constants, obtaining reasonable agreement with experimental data and correctly reflecting the hierarchy of mass spectra and decay constants. In analyzing the $M1$ radiative transition, we consider both good ($\mu=+$) and transverse ($\mu={\perp}$) current components with both longitudinal $(h=0)$ and transverse $(h=\pm1)$ polarizations, demonstrating that the results from both components of currents and polarizations are identical. Self-consistency is achieved by substituting $M$ with $M_0$ when computing the operators for decay constants and radiative transitions. We also find that the difference between longitudinal and transverse polarizations of the observables may quantify the anisotropy of the model wave function. Our results on radiative transitions align reasonably well with experimental data, lattice QCD, and theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we also provide predictions for $B_c$ mesons that can be tested in experiments.</description>

Abstract: We perform the first global QCD analysis of electron-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering and related high-energy data including the beyond the Standard Model $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson, $Z'$. Contrary to the dark photon case, we find no improvement in the $\chi^2$ relative to the baseline result. The finding allows us to place exclusion limits on the coupling constant of the $Z'$ with mass in the range $M_{Z'} = 2$ to 160 GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nucleophobic axion models, wherein axion couplings to both protons and neutrons are simultaneously suppressed, can relax the stringent constraints from SN 1987A. However, it remains uncertain whether these models maintain their nucleophobic property under the influence of finite baryon density effects. These are especially relevant in astrophysical environments near saturation density, such as Supernovae (SNe). In this study, we demonstrate that the nucleophobic solution remains viable also at finite density. Furthermore, we show that the SN axion bound relaxes significantly in nucleophobic models, even when accounting for the integration over the non-homogeneous environment of the SN core.</description>

      <title>Charged Lepton Flavour Violating Meson Decays in Seesaw Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The occurrence of neutrino oscillations demands the existence of flavour violation in charged lepton sector. The relation between the branching ratios of different charged lepton flavour violating (CLFV) decay modes depends on the details of the neutrino mass model. In this work, we consider the three types of simple seesaw mechanisms of neutrino masses and study the correlation between the radiative CLFV decays and the meson CLFV decays. We find that the meson CLFV decay branching ratios are negligibly small in type-II seesaw mechanism whereas they are constrained to be at least three (two) orders of magnitude smaller than the radiative CLFV decay branching ratios in the case of type-I (type-III) seesaw mechanism. Thus the relationship between these two modes of CLFV decays helps in distinguishing between different types of seesaw mechanism. If, the branching ratios of CLFV decays of mesons are larger than those of radiative CLFV decays, it provides a strong hint that the neutrino mass generating mechanism is more complicated than simple seesaw.</description>

      <title>Verifying the Resonance Schemes of Unstable Particles at Lepton Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose practical ways of differentiating the various (Breit-Wigner, theoretical, and energy-dependent) resonance schemes of unstable particles at lepton colliders. First, the energy-dependent scheme can be distinguished from the other two by fitting the $Z$ lineshape scan and forward-backward asymmetries at LEP and future lepton colliders with the $Z$ mass $m_Z$, decay width $\Gamma_Z$, and coupling strength as fitting parameters. Although the Breit-Wigner and theoretical schemes work equally well, the scheme conversion requires the decay width $\Gamma_Z$ to scale inversely with $m_Z$ rather than the usual linear dependence from theoretical calculation. These contradicting behaviors can be used to distinguish the Breit-Wigner and theoretical schemes by the precision $Z$ measurements with single parameter ($m_Z$) fit at future lepton colliders. For the $WW$ threshold scan, its combination with the precise Fermi constant provides another way of distinguishing the Breit-Wigner and theoretical schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Lorentz invariant and little group covariant description of beta decay amplitudes relying on on-shell amplitude methods and the spinor variables for massive particles. The framework is employed to calculate Coulomb corrections to the decay amplitude and their contribution to T -odd correlation coefficients, including the D parameter. In the SM limit we recover the known results for the Coulomb contributions to D and update their numerical values. We also calculate new subleading contributions to D in the presence of non-standard scalar and tensor interactions. We also point out that two other T -odd correlation coefficients are generated in the SM at the same order as the D parameter, and provide their numerical values for selected transitions.</description>

      <title>Nucleon electric dipole form factor in QCD vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the QCD instanton vacuum, the C-even and C-odd nucleon Pauli form factors receive a large contribution from the underlying ensemble of pseudoparticles, that is sensitive to a finite QCD vacuum angle $\theta$. This observation is used to derive explicitly the electric dipole form factor for light quark flavors, and estimate the proton and neutron electric dipole moment induced by a small CP violating $\theta$. The results are in the range of some recently reported lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>$5 \sigma$ tension between Planck cosmic microwave background and eBOSS Lyman-alpha forest and constraints on physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find that combined Planck cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae data analyzed under $\Lambda$CDM are in 4.9$\sigma$ tension with eBOSS Ly$\alpha$ forest in inference of the linear matter power spectrum at wavenumber $\sim 1 h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and redshift = 3. Model extensions can alleviate this tension: running in the tilt of the primordial power spectrum ($\alpha_\mathrm{s} \sim -0.01$); a fraction $\sim (1 - 5)\%$ of ultra-light axion dark matter (DM) with particle mass $\sim 10^{-25}$ eV or warm DM with mass $\sim 10$ eV. The new DESI survey, coupled with high-accuracy modeling, will help distinguish the source of this discrepancy.</description>

      <title>SENSEI: First Direct-Detection Results on sub-GeV Dark Matter from SENSEI at SNOLAB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first results from a dark matter search using six Skipper-CCDs in the SENSEI detector operating at SNOLAB. We employ a bias-mitigation technique of hiding approximately 46% of our total data and aggressively mask images to remove backgrounds. Given a total exposure after masking of 100.72 gram-days from well-performing sensors, we observe 55 two-electron events, 4 three-electron events, and no events containing 4 to 10 electrons. The two-electron events are consistent with pileup from one-electron events. Among the 4 three-electron events, 2 appear in pixels that are likely impacted by detector defects, although not strongly enough to trigger our "hot-pixel" mask. We use these data to set world-leading constraints on sub-GeV dark matter interacting with electrons and nuclei.</description>

      <title>A search for the fine-structure constant evolution from fast radio bursts and type Ia supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for a space-time variation of the fundamental constants has been explored over the years to test our physical theories. In this paper, we use the dispersion measure ($DM$) of fast radio bursts (FRB) combined with type Ia supernovae (SNe) data to investigate a possible redshift evolution of the fine-structure constant ($\alpha$), considering the runaway dilaton scenario, which predicts $\frac{\Delta \alpha}{\alpha} = - \gamma\ln{(1+z)}$, where $\gamma$ is a constant proportional to the current value of the coupling between the dilaton field and hadronic matter. We derive all the relevant expressions for the $DM$ dependence concerning the fine-structure constant and constrain the parameter $\gamma$ from measurements of 17 well-localized FRBs and 1048 SNe data from the Pantheon compilation. We also use Monte Carlo simulations to forecast the constraining power of larger samples of FRB measurements for data sets with $N = 500$ and $N = 1000$ points. We found that the uncertainty on $\gamma$ can be improved by one order of magnitude and that limits on $\frac{\Delta \alpha}{\alpha}$ beyond $\sigma \sim 10^{-2}$ will depend crucially on better control of statistical and systematic uncertainties of upcoming FRB data.</description>

      <title>Generation of effective massive Spin-2 fields through spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativity and quantum field theory are the cornerstones of our understanding of physical processes, from subatomic to cosmic scales. While both theories work remarkably well in their tested domains, they show minimal overlap. However, our research challenges this separation by revealing that non-perturbative effects bridge these distinct domains. We introduce a novel mechanism wherein, at linear order, spin-2 fields around an arbitrary background acquire \emph{effective mass} due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of either global or local symmetry of complex scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. The action of the spin-2 field is identical to the extended Fierz-Pauli (FP) action, corresponding to the mass deformation parameter $\alpha = 1/2$. We show that this occurs due to the effect of SSB on the variation of the energy-momentum tensor of the matter field, which has a dominant effect during SSB. The extended FP action has a salient feature, compared to the standard FP action: the action has 6 degrees of freedom with no ghosts. For local $U(1)$ SSB, we establish that the effective mass of spin-2 fields is related to the mass of the gauge boson and the electric charge of the complex scalar field. Interestingly, our results indicate that the millicharged dark matter scalar fields, generating dark photons, can produce a mass of spin-2 fields of the same order as the Hubble constant $(H_0)$. Hence, we argue that the dark sector offers a natural explanation for the acceleration of the current Universe.</description>

      <title>Proton decay in de Sitter environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01892v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decay of proton in the de Sitter environment is governed by the temperature $T=H/\pi$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter. This temperature is twice larger than the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm GH}=H/2\pi$. This demonstrates the physical difference of two processes. The temperature $T=H/\pi$ determines the proton decay rate in the local process which takes well inside the cosmological horizon. While the Gibbons-Hawking temperature can be related to the processes which involve the Hawking photons or other particles radiated from the cosmological horizon. The same temperature $T=H/\pi$ determines the radiation of electron-positron pairs by positron or by other object in the de Sitter environment. Creation of matter and its thermalization in the de Sitter heat bath leads to the energy exchange between matter and quantum vacuum and finally to the decay of the de Sitter state towards the Minkowski vacuum. The lesson for the Unruh effect is also discussed. One may expect the similar separation of effects governed by two different temperatures: the effects related to the Rindler horizon with the Unruh temperature $T_{\rm U}=a/2\pi$ and the local radiation with $T=a/\pi=2T_{\rm U}$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the impact of neutrino mass hierarchies on neutrino mass constraints in light of recent DESI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent results from DESI combined with cosmic microwave background data give the tightest constraints on the sum of neutrino masses to date. However, these analyses approximate the neutrino mass hierarchy by three degenerate-mass (DM) neutrinos, instead of the normal (NH) and inverted hierarchies (IH) informed by terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments. Given the stringency of the upper limits from DESI data, we test explicitly whether the inferred neutrino constraints are robust to the choice of neutrino mass ordering using both Bayesian and frequentist methods. For Planck data alone, we find that the DM hierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically motivated hierarchies while showing a strong dependence on the assumed lower bound of the prior, confirming previous studies. For the combined Planck and DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, we find that assuming NH ($M_\mathrm{tot} &lt; 0.13\,\mathrm{eV}$) or IH ($M_\mathrm{tot} &lt; 0.16\,\mathrm{eV}$) loosens the Bayesian upper limits compared to the DM approximation ($M_\mathrm{tot} &lt; 0.086\,\mathrm{eV}$). The frequentist analysis shows that the different neutrino models fit the data equally well and the loosening of the constraints can thus be attributed to the lower bounds induced by NH and IH. Overall, we find that the DM hierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically motivated hierarchies also for Planck+DESI data as long as the corresponding lower neutrino mass bounds are imposed.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Speed of Sound in Heavy-Ion Collisions: A Study of Quantum Fluctuations and Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermalization of quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions is crucial for understanding its behavior as a relativistic fluid and the thermodynamic properties of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This study investigates the role of fluctuations in the relationship between transverse momentum and particle multiplicity, with a particular focus on their impact on extracting the QCD speed of sound. In a thermalized quark-gluon plasma, fluctuations are dominantly quantum in origin and follow a Gaussian distribution due to their independence from the thermodynamic response. In contrast, non-thermalized systems display non-Gaussian fluctuations, reflecting the breakdown of thermalization. By leveraging the Gaussianity condition of quantum fluctuations, the physical value of the speed of sound can be extracted statistically, even in the presence of significant event-by-event fluctuations. This framework provides a robust diagnostic tool for probing thermalization and extracting thermodynamic properties in both large and small collision systems.</description>
