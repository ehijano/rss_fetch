      <title>Commutative rings behind divisible residuated lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Divisible residuated lattices are algebraic structures corresponding to a more comprehensive logic than Hajek's basic logic with an important significance in the study of fuzzy logic. The purpose of this paper is to investigate commutative rings whose the lattice of ideals can be equipped with a structure of divisible residuated lattice. We show that these rings are multiplication rings. A characterization, more examples and their connections to other classes of rings are established. Furthermore, we analyze the structure of divisible residuated lattices using finite commutative rings. From computational considerations, we present an explicit construction of isomorphism classes of divisible residuated lattices (that are not BL-algebras) of small size n $(2 \le n \le 6)$ and we give summarizing statistics.</description>

      <title>Weakly right coherent monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A monoid $S$ is said to be weakly right coherent if every finitely generated right ideal of $S$ is finitely presented as a right $S$-act. It is known that $S$ is weakly right coherent if and only if it satisfies the following conditions: $S$ is right ideal Howson, meaning that the intersection of any two finitely generated right ideals of $S$ is finitely generated; and the right annihilator congruences of $S$ are finitely generated as right congruences. We examine the behaviour of these two conditions (in the more general setting of semigroups) under certain algebraic constructions and deduce closure results for the class of weakly right coherent monoids. We also show that the property of being right ideal Howson is related to the axiomatisability of a class of left acts satisfying a condition related to flatness.</description>

      <title>Twisted tensor products: Alexander-Whitney and Eilenberg-Zilber maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alexander-Whitney and Eilenberg-Zilber maps traditionally convert between the tensor product of standard resolutions and the standard resolution of a tensor product of algebras. We examine Alexander-Whitney and Eilenberg-Zilber maps for twisted tensor products, which include skew group algebras, smash products of Hopf algebras, Ore extensions, and universal enveloping algebras. These maps convert between the twist of standard resolutions and the standard resolution of a twist. We extend these to chain maps to and from twists of other resolutions. This allows one to transfer homological information between various resolutions of algebras and to expedite results on the deformation theory of twisted tensor product algebras.</description>

      <title>On endomorphism algebras of string almost gentle algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any arbitrary string almost gentle algebra, we consider specific subsets of its quiver's arrow set, denoted by $\mathcal{R}$. For each such $\mathcal{R}$, we introduce the finitely generated module $M_{\mathcal{R}}$ and define its associated $\mathcal{R}$-endomorphism algebra $A_{\mathcal{R}}$. In this paper, we show that the representation type of a string gentle algebra $A$, the representation type of the $\mathcal{R}$-endomorphism algebra $A_{\mathcal{R}}$ for some $\mathcal{R}$, the representation types of all $\mathcal{R}$-algebras, and the representation type of the Cohen-Macaulay Auslander algebra $A^{\mathrm{CMA}}$ of $A$ are equivalent. The results presented here reveal a deep structural connection between different classes of algebras derived from string gentle algebras. By showing the equivalence of representation types, this work offers new insights into the nature of endomorphism algebras and Cohen-Macaulay Auslander algebras, contributing to a broader understanding of their algebraic properties and classification.</description>

      <title>On the first-order theories of quaternions and octonions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04976v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be the language of rings. We provide an axiomatization of the $L$-theories of quaternions and octonions and we characterize the models of mentioned theories: they coincide, up to isomorphism, to quaternion and octonion algebras over a real closed field, respectively. We bi-interprete these theories in terms of real closed fields and we prove they are complete, model complete and they do not have quantifier elimination. Then, we focus on the class of ordered polynomials. Over $\mathbb{H}$ and $\mathbb{O}$ these polynomials are of special interest in hypercomplex analysis since they are slice regular. We deduce some fundamental properties of their zero loci from model completeness and we prove the failure of quantifier elimination for the fragment of ordered formulas.</description>
