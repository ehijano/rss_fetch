      <title>Confined monopoles and failure of the Lattice Weak Gravity Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost all known theories of quantum gravity satisfy the Lattice Weak Gravity Conjecture (LWGC), which posits that a consistent theory of quantum gravity must have a superextremal particle at every site in the charge lattice. However, a number of theories have been observed to violate the LWGC; such theories exhibit only a (finite index) sublattice of superextremal particles. This paper aims to identify universal features and patterns associated with LWGC violation across numerous examples in effective field theory, string theory, and M-theory. Some of these examples have appeared previously in the literature, while others are novel. In all such examples, we observe that LWGC failure is accompanied by the existence of fractionally charged monopoles confined by flux tubes, where superextremal particles exist everywhere in the sublattice dual to the superlattice of fractional confined monopole charges. The confining flux tubes become light when the failure of the LWGC becomes more extreme, so monopoles deconfine in the limit where LWGC-violating particles become infinitely massive. We also identify similarities between these confined monopoles, non-invertible symmetries, and the Hanany-Witten effect.</description>

      <title>Loop Blow-Up Inflation: a novel way to inflate with the K\"ahler moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topic of this talk is a new inflationary model in the context of Type IIB string compactifications called Loop Blow-Up Inflation, presented in arXiv:2403.04831. The original Blow-Up Inflation model, whose potential was purely non-perturbative, suffers from the $\eta$-problem, being sensitive to string-loop corrections. If these corrections are introduced in the nflationary potential, they become dominant over the non-perturbative contributions as soon as the inflaton is displaced from its minimum. Therefore, the inflationary potential takes a new inverse-power law behavior. We show that slow-roll inflation is not ultimately spoiled and focus on the post-inflationary history in different scenarios of microscopic Standard Model (SM) realization. Each of them gives precise predictions for the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio in agreement with CMB data .The model also predicts an amount of dark radiation potentially observable by next-generation CMB experiments. This article is a contribution to the proceedings of the Second General Meeting of the COST Action CA21106 Cosmic WISPers.</description>

      <title>Looking at bulk points in general geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holographic correspondence predicts that certain strongly coupled quantum systems describe an emergent, higher-dimensional bulk spacetime in which excitations enjoy local dynamics. We consider a general holographic state dual to an asymptotically AdS bulk spacetime, and study boundary correlation functions of local fields integrated against wavepackets. We derive a factorization formula showing that when the wavepackets suitably meet at a common bulk point, the boundary correlators develop sharp features controlled by flat-space-like bulk scattering processes. These features extend along boundary hyperboloids whose shape naturally reveals the bulk geometry. We discuss different choices of operator ordering, which lead to inclusive and out-of-time-ordered amplitudes, as well as fields of various spins and masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of BPS 3-vortex solutions. First, for unexcited vortices, we study the 2-dimensional moduli space of centred vortices with $y \to -y$ symmetry, and its metric. We identify the 1-dimensional subspaces describing the head-on collisions of equidistant collinear and equilateral triangle configurations, where geodesic motion results in $90^\circ$ and 60^\circ$ scattering, respectively. Second, by studying the frequency spectrum of vibrational shape modes along these subspaces, we explain how the force-free, geodesic motion is modified by shape mode excitations into a pattern of chaotic multi-bounce collisions.</description>

      <title>The holographic space-time model of inflation and its predictions for the CMB primordial spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1998 Carlip and Solodukhin independently conjectured the equality between fluctuations in the modular Hamiltonian of black holes and its expectation value. Banks and Zurek's 2021 work generalized this observation to any causal diamonds. We use this observation to calculate the precise normalization of primordial scalar and tensor power spectra in the Holographic Space-time (HST) model of inflation. In previous work Banks and Fischler outlined the general calculation of inflationary power spectra in this model, which we review here. Its conceptual basis is radically different from field theoretic inflation and it has no Transplanckian problems, but its predictions for power spectra will be shown to fit extant data equally well, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio agrees with experimental observations.

      <title>From BPS Spectra of Argyres-Douglas Theories to Families of 3d TFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertex operator algebras (VOAs) arise in protected subsectors of supersymmetric quantum field theories, notably in 4d ${\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal field theories (SCFT) via the Schur sector and in twisted 3d ${\mathcal N}=4$ theories via boundary algebras. These constructions are connected through twisted circle compactifications, which can be best understood from the dynamics of BPS particles in the Coulomb branch of the 4d SCFT. This data is encoded in an operator $\hat\Phi$ acting on the Hilbert space of an auxiliary quantum mechanics of BPS particles, whose trace yields the partition functions of a 3d topological field theory (TFT) bounding the VOA. We generalize this trace formula by considering higher powers of $\hat\Phi$, leading to a finite family of VOAs associated with a given 4d SCFT. Applying this framework to Argyres-Douglas theories labeled by $(A_1, G)$, where $G$ is an ADE-type group of rank up to 8, we extract the modular data of the family of boundary VOAs via TFT partition function calculations on Seifert manifolds. Our results suggest that the modular data obtained from different powers of $\hat\Phi$ are related by Galois transformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study periods of multi-parameter families of K3 surfaces, which are relevant to compute the maximal cuts of certain classes of Feynman integrals. We focus on their automorphic properties, and we show that generically the periods define orthogonal modular forms. Using exceptional isomorphisms between Lie groups of small rank, we show how one can use the intersection product on the periods to identify K3 surfaces whose periods can be expressed in terms of other classes of modular forms that have been studied in the mathematics literature. We apply our results to maximal cuts of three-loop banana integrals, and we show that depending on the mass configuration, the maximal cuts define ordinary modular forms or Hilbert, Siegel or hermitian modular forms.</description>

      <title>Feynman integrals, elliptic integrals and two-parameter K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-loop banana integral with three equal masses and the conformal two-loop five-point traintrack integral in two dimensions are related to a two-parameter family of K3 surfaces. We compute the corresponding periods and the mirror map, and we show that they can be expressed in terms of ordinary modular forms and functions. In particular, we find that the maximal cuts of the three-loop banana integral with three equal masses can be written as a product of two copies of the maximal cuts of the two-loop equal-mass sunrise integral. Our computation reveals a hidden symmetry of the banana integral not manifest from the Feynman integral representation, which corresponds to exchanging the two copies of the sunrise elliptic curve.</description>

      <title>Quantum black holes: supersymmetry and exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explanation of black hole entropy as statistical entropy is one of the big successes of string theory. In this article we review recent progress in this subject, focussing on understanding quantum effects on black hole entropy. Supersymmetry plays a key role in these developments and leads to prototype systems where we can discuss quantum effects to great precision. Our discussion has two strands, both of which involve the gravitational path integral that calculates the supersymmetric index. In the first strand we discuss supersymmetric black holes in the microcanonical ensemble, which are decoupled from the environment and can be treated as independent quantum systems. Using methods of supersymmetric localization one can arrive at the integer quantum degeneracies of such systems purely in terms of the gravitational variables. In the second strand we consider grand-canonical ensembles in gravity in which black holes arise as a finite-action excitation in asymptotically flat or Anti de Sitter space. In this context we discuss the saddle-points of the gravitational index, and how they reproduce the black hole action and entropy that agree with the index of the holographic superconformal field theory even beyond the leading order in the semiclassical approximation. Finally we discuss how the gravitational index informs us about the detailed structure of the non-perturbative sum over saddle points and the resulting phases of the theory. Throughout, we try to highlight the central role played by the methods as well as foundational concepts of supergravity in driving these developments.</description>

      <title>Mesons in a quantum Ising ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When two transverse-field Ising chains (TFICs) with magnetic order are coupled, the original free excitations become confined, giving rise to meson-like bound states. In this work, we study such bound states systematically. The mesons are characterized by their fermion number parity and chain-exchanging properties, which lead to distinct sets of mesonic states. The meson masses are determined by solving the Bethe-Salpter equation. An interesting observation is the additional degeneracy in the chain-exchanging odd sectors. Beyond the two particle approximation, we exploit the truncated free fermionic space approach to calculate the spectrum numerically. Corrections to the meson masses are obtained, and the degeneracy is further confirmed. The characterization and degeneracy can be connected to the situation when each chain is tuned to be quantum critical, where the system is described by the Ising$_h^2$ integrable model, a sine-Gordon theory with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold. Here we establish a clear correspondence between the particles in the bosonized form and their fermionic counterparts. Near this point, the stability of these particles is analyzed using the form factor perturbation scheme, where four particles are always present. Additionally, we calculate the evolution of the dominant dynamical structure factor for local spin operators, providing further insight into the low-energy excitations and their role in the system's behavior. The two-particle confinement framework as well as the parity classifications may inspire the study for other coupled bi-partite systems.</description>

      <title>Equivariant localization in supergravity in odd dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a localization formula for certain integrals on odd-dimensional manifolds with boundaries, equipped with a Killing vector, and employ this to localize the regularised on-shell action of a large class of supersymmetric solutions of five dimensional minimal gauged supergravity. Specifically, we consider asymptotically AdS_5
  solutions in the time-like class, in which the transverse K\"ahler foliation is assumed to be toric. We find that the background subtraction regularization method leads to an intriguing formula for the on-shell action, in terms of an analytic continuation of the Martelli-Sparks-Yau Sasakian volume. In particular, we show that the regularised on-shell action is
  a function of the toric data of an effective compact five-dimensional manifold, as well as of the supersymmetric Killing vector, outside the corresponding dual cone. As our main example we provide a derivation of the well-known entropy function of supersymmetric and rotating black holes in AdS_5, using only topological data.</description>

      <title>Massive vector field perturbations in the Schwarzschild spacetime from supersymmetric gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The master equation of the Proca field in the Schwarzschild spacetime is studied by using the Seiberg-Witten/quasinormal modes duality. We establish the dictionary between the parameters in gauge and gravity theories, since both sides lead to Heun-type equations. Applying the technique of instanton counting, we analytically find the eigenfrequencies of the quasinormal modes and quasi-bound states for massive vector fields around black holes, with the boundary conditions linked by the connection formula. The results show consistency with known numerical researches in the literature.</description>

      <title>Spin-$s$ $Q$-systems: Twist and Open Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz, which transforms the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian into the problem of solving a set of algebraic equations named Bethe equations. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system, which is a powerful tool to solve Bethe equations. We establish basic frameworks of the rational $Q$-system and confirm its completeness numerically in both cases. For twisted boundaries, we investigate the polynomiality conditions of the rational $Q$-system and derive physical conditions for singular solutions of Bethe equations. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. Hidden symmetries lead to the appearance of extra degeneracies in the Hilbert space, while the magnetic string is a novel type of exact string configuration, whose length depends on the boundary magnetic fields. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>LQG-modified dispersion relations and the problem of cosmic photons threshold anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our present contribution sets out to investigate how combined effects of Lorentz-symmetry violation (LSV) and Loop-Quantum-Gravity(LQG)-modified photon dispersion relations affect the threshold anomaly of cosmic photons. The point of departure is the post-Maxwellian version of Electromagnetism induced by LQG effects. We then consider the problem of gamma-ray attenuation by the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) dominated by the Breit-Wheeler Effect. By following this path, we aim at the establishment of a new bridge between LSV and astrophysical phenomena in the framework of LQG.</description>

      <title>One-Loop QCD Corrections to $\bar{u}d \rightarrow t\bar{t}W$ at $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a computation of the one-loop QCD corrections to top-quark pair production in association with a $W$ boson, including terms up to order $\varepsilon^2$ in dimensional regularization. Providing a first glimpse into the complexity of the corresponding two-loop amplitude, this result is a first step towards a description of this process at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD. We perform a tensor decomposition and express the corresponding form factors in terms of a basis of independent special functions with compact rational coefficients, providing a structured framework for future developments. In addition, we derive an explicit analytic representation of the form factors, valid up to order $\varepsilon^0$, expressed in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms. For the complete set of special functions required, we obtain a semi-numerical solution based on generalized power series expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in field theory and critical phenomena have focused on the characterization of boundary or defects in a conformally-invariant system. In this Letter we study the critical behavior of the three-dimensional Ising universality class in the presence of a surface, realizing the ordinary, the special, and the normal universality classes. By using high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of an improved model, where leading scaling corrections are suppressed, and a finite-size scaling analysis, we determine unbiased, accurate estimates of universal boundary operator product expansion coefficients. Furthermore, we improve the value of the scaling dimension of the surface field at the special transition by the estimate $\hat{\Delta}_\sigma = 0.3531(3)$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Collins-Soper kernel in inclusive DIS at threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the factorization of inclusive deep inelastic scattering near the kinematic threshold to explicitly track off-lightcone effects. Particle production develops around two opposite near-lightcone directions like in transverse-momentum-dependent processes, and the Collins-Soper kernel emerges as a universal function in the rapidity evolution of the relevant parton correlators. We clarify outstanding issues regarding soft radiation and rapidity divergences, and uncover a new way to calculate the Collins-Soper kernel on the lattice with collinear operators.</description>

      <title>The correspondence of generalised entropic cosmology theory with $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ modified gravity and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This talk is based on the collaboration with Sergei D. Odintsov. We investigate the correspondence between modified gravity theories and general entropic cosmology theory. Such a theory is proposed by an analogy with Jacobson's work, where the Einstein equation was derived from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We compare FLRW equations obtained in entropic gravity with those in modified gravity theories. It is found the correspondence of $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravities and general entropic gravity. We regard the $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravity theories as effective local theories corresponding to the entropic gravity theories and we investigate the gravitational waves. The obtained equation of the gravitational wave is identical to that in Einstein's gravity except that the gravitational coupling is modified by the functional form of the functions $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$. It is interesting that in the case of the Tsallis entropic cosmology, the gravitational coupling becomes small or large, which may suppress or enhance the emission of the gravitational wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter we first describe the early history of primordial black hole (PBH) research. We then discuss their possible formation mechanisms, including critical collapse from inflationary fluctuations and various types of phase transition. We next describe the numerous constraints on the number density of PBHs from various quantum and astrophysical processes. This was the main focus of research until recently but there is currently a shift of emphasis to the search for evidence for PBHs. We end by discussing this evidence, with particular emphasis on their role as dark matter candidates, sources of gravitational waves and seeds for supermassive black holes and early cosmic structures.</description>

      <title>Topological observables and $\theta$ dependence in high temperature QCD from lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study topology in Quantum Chromodynamics at high temperatures by means of lattice calculations. Simulations are performed with $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson twisted mass fermions at maximal twist with physical quark masses, and temperatures $T~\gtrsim~180$ MeV. The results obtained with three lattice spacings ranging between $0.057$ and $0.080$ fm are extrapolated to the continuum limit. We compare the results for the topological susceptibility obtained with the field-theoretic definition with those obtained from an observable constructed with the disconnected part of the chiral susceptibility, and we confirm their agreement -- within the largish errors -- on our range of temperatures. We also study the topological charge distribution, the next order cumulant $b_2$ and, for the first time, the Free Energy as a function of the $\theta$ angle. We find a rapid crossover to the Dilute Instanton Gas behaviour above $ T \simeq 300$ MeV for all the observables we have considered.</description>

      <title>Bounds on variations of the strange quark mass from Big Bang nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effect of a variation of the strange nucleon matrix element $\langle N| m_s \bar{s}s|N\rangle$ on the abundances of the light elements produced in the Big Bang. For that, we vary the nucleon mass in the leading eight reactions that involve neutrons, protons and the four lightest nuclei. We use various available Big Bang nucleosynthesis codes and find that the measured deuterium and $^4$He abundances set strict limits on the nucleon mass variations. This translates into an upper bound of possible variations of the strange quark mass, $\left| \Delta m_s/m_s \right| \leq 5.1\%$.</description>

      <title>Black hole solutions in the revised Deser-Woodard nonlocal theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the revised Deser-Woodard model of nonlocal gravity by reformulating the related field equations within a suitable tetrad frame. This transformation significantly simplifies the treatment of the ensuing differential problem while preserving the characteristics of the original gravitational theory. We then focus on static and spherically symmetric spacetimes in vacuum. Hence, we demonstrate that the gravitational theory under study admits a class of black hole solutions characterized by an inverse power-law correction to the Schwarzschild $g_{tt}$ metric function and a first-order perturbation of the $g_{rr}$ Schwarzschild component. Then, through a stepwise methodology, we analytically solve the full dynamics of the theory, finally leading to the reconstruction of the nonlocal distortion function, within which the new black hole solutions arise. Furthermore, we analyze the geometric properties of the obtained solutions and quantify the deviations from the Schwarzschild prediction. This work provides new insights into compact object configurations and advances our understanding of nonlocal gravity theories in the strong-field regime at astrophysical scales.</description>

      <title>Foundational aspects of spinor structures and exotic spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spinors are mathematical objects susceptible to the spacetime characteristics upon which they are defined. Not all spacetimes admit spinor structure; when it does, it may have more than one spinor structure, depending on topological properties. When more than one nonequivalent spinor structure is allowed in a given spacetime, the spinors resulting from the extra structures are called exotic. In this review, we revisit the topological conditions driving the discussion about the spacetime characteristics leading to the existence and (non)uniqueness of spinor structures in a relatively comprehensive manner, accounting for step-to-step demonstrations. In the sequel, we delve into the topologically corrected Dirac operator, explicitly obtaining it and exploring the physical consequences encoded in the exotic spinor dynamics. Finally, we overview early and recent achievements in the area, pointing out possible directions within this research program.</description>

      <title>Implications of Photon Mass: Vortextrap Magnetization of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss certain astrophysical implications of the photon mass. It offers a new mechanism of black hole magnetization, described as ``vortextrap magnetization" (VTM), which can generate a near-saturated magnetic field in astrophysical black holes. The extreme magnetic field is provided by a large number of Nielsen-Olesen type vortex lines piercing a black hole. In massive photon scenario the galactic magnetic field is a densely populated forest of overlapping magnetic flux tubes. These get trapped and collected by a black hole over a cosmological time-scale. The VTM mechanism neatly fits supermassive black holes with sizes matching the phenomenologically-acceptable values of the photon mass, and has implications for magnetic-field based particle acceleration. Even in absence of surrounding plasma, the near-saturated magnetic field is expected to result into an intense electromagnetic radiation as well as gravitational waves in black hole mergers. We provide a numerical simulation of the VTM phenomenon in a prototype system.</description>

      <title>Status of early dark energy after DESI: the role of $\Omega_m$ and $r_s H_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The EDE model is one of the promising solutions to the long-standing Hubble tension. This paper investigates the status of several EDE models in light of recent BAO observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and their implications for resolving the Hubble tension. The DESI Y1 BAO results deviate from the CMB and Type Ia supernova (SNeIa) observations in their constraints on the matter density $\Omega_m$ and the product of the sound horizon and the Hubble constant $r_s H_0$. Meanwhile, these EDE models happen to tend towards this deviation. Therefore, in this work, it is found that DESI Y1 BAO results strengthen the preference for EDE models and help to obtain a higher $H_0$. Even considering the Pantheon+ observations for SNeIa, which have an opposite tendency, DESI still dominates the preference for EDE. This was unforeseen in past SDSS BAO measurements and therefore emphasizes the role of BAO and SNeIa measurements in Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>On the phenomenological implications of a Pati-Salam model spontaneously broken by Higgs fields in fundamental representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a supersymmetric Pati-Salam model with small representations as a potential candidate for physics beyond the Standard Model. The model features a Higgs sector with bifundamental fields $H_R+\bar H_R=(4,1,2)+(\bar 4,1,2)$, $H_L+\bar H_L=(4,2,1)+(\bar 4,2,1)$ as well as a pair of bi-doublet fields $h_a=(1,2,2)$ where $ a=1,2$, with three families of fermions accommodated in $ (4,2,1)+(\bar 4,1,2)$ as usual. The matter spectrum is augmented with three copies of neutral singlets that mix with ordinary neutrinos to realize the seesaw mechanism. The model introduces supersymmetric R-symmetry and a global discrete $\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry ($n &gt; 2$) that prevents disastrous superpotential couplings, while its spontaneous breaking implies the existence of domain walls that are successfully addressed. Interestingly, the one-loop beta coefficient of the $SU(4)_C$ gauge coupling is zero in the minimal $\mathbb{Z}_3$ model, rendering the corresponding gauge coupling near-conformal in the UV. Meanwhile, Landau poles are avoided up to the Planck scale and proton decay is suppressed, resulting in a proton lifetime beyond current experimental bounds. By virtue of the extended Higgs sector, the key advantage of this PS model is its ability to disentangle quark and lepton masses through higher-dimensional effective operators, addressing a common limitation in GUT models with small Higgs representations. This makes the model more economical and easier to be constructed from string theory, particularly in several heterotic and F-theory models where Higgses in the adjoint representation are absent.</description>

Abstract: We present a generalized determinant as a function of $N$ distinct $N \times N$ complex matrices into a complex number. This function, originally introduced in the study of the chiral anomaly in QCD (PRD 97 (2018) 9, 091901 PRD 109 (2024) 7, L071502), in particular in connections to mesons, reduces to the usual determinant when all the matrices are taken as equal. Hence, we denote it as `polydeterminant'. Here, we explore its main algebraic properties as well as its geometric interpretation in detail.</description>

      <title>Critical Unstable Qubits: an Application to $B^0\bar{B}^0$-Meson System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend our previous work on a novel class of unstable qubits which we have identified recently and called them Critical Unstable Qubits (CUQs). The characteristic property of CUQs is that the energy-level and decay-width vectors, ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf \Gamma}$, are orthogonal to one another, and the key parameter $r = |{\bf \Gamma}|/|2{\bf E}|$ is less than 1. Most remarkably, CUQs exhibit two atypical behaviours: (i) they display coherence-decoherence oscillations in a co-decaying frame of the system described by a unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$, and (ii) the unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$ describing a pure CUQ sweeps out unequal areas during equal intervals of time, while rotating about the vector ${\bf E}$. The latter anharmonic phenomenon emerges beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference of the two-level quantum system, which governs an ordinary qubit. By making use of a Fourier series decomposition, we define anharmonicity observables that quantify the degree of non-sinusoidal oscillation of a CUQ. We apply the results of our formalism to the $B^0\bar{B}^0$-meson system and derive, for the first time, generic upper limits on these new observables.</description>

Abstract: We reformulate in Hamiltonian language the recent proposal by Hohm and Zwiebach of an action yielding the most general $O(d,d)$-symmetric string cosmology equations, at tree-level in the string-loop expansion, but to all orders in the $\alpha'$ expansion. This allows us to give a simple characterization of a large class of non-singular, non-perturbative, pre-big bang scenarios smoothly interpolating between a low-energy initial accelerated (string frame) expansion and a phase of final (string and Einstein frame) decelerated expansion. Interestingly, these solutions must necessarily include, just around the bounce, a very short phase of (string-frame) contraction.</description>

      <title>From the string vacuum to FLRW or de Sitter via $\alpha'$ corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first make more precise a recent "Hamiltonian" reformulation of the Hohm-Zwiebach approach to the tree-level, $O(d,d)$-invariant string cosmology equations at all orders in the $\alpha'$ expansion, and recall how it allows to give a simple characterization of a large class of cosmological scenarios connecting, through a non-singular bounce, two duality-related perturbative solutions at early and late times. We then discuss the effects of adding to the action a non-perturbative, $O(d,d)$-breaking, dilaton potential $V(\phi)$. The resulting cosmological solutions, assumed to approach at early times the perturbative string vacuum (with vanishing curvature and string coupling), can stabilize the dilaton at late times and simultaneously approach either a matter-dominated FLRW cosmology or a de-Sitter-like inflationary phase, depending on initial conditions and on the properties of $V(\phi)$ at moderate-coupling. We also identify a general mechanism for generating isotropic late-time attractors from a large basin of anisotropic initial conditions.</description>

Abstract: We study cosmological solutions of the IKKT model with $k=-1$ FLWR geometry, taking into account one-loop corrections. A previously discussed covariant quantum spacetime is found to be stabilized through one-loop effects at early times, without adding a mass term to the model. At late times, this background is modified and approaches a solution of the classical model where $a(t) \sim const$, but the dilaton decreases in time. This suggests that a more complete treatment of the system is required in the late-time regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Doubly special relativity (DSR) is usually regarded as a low-energy limit of a quantum gravity theory with testable predictions. On the other hand, non-local quantum field theories have been presented as a solution to the inconsistencies arising when quantizing gravity. Here, we present a new formulation of quantum field theories in DSR with non-local behavior. Our construction restricts the models to those showing linear Lorentz invariance. We derive the deformed Klein--Gordon, Dirac, and electromagnetic Lagrangians, as well as the deformed Maxwell equations. We also discuss the electric potential of a point charge. Finally, we analyze the connection between the nonlocality of field theories and DSR.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the quantum theories of the free massive scalar, the massive fermionic, and the electromagnetic fields, in a doubly special relativity scenario. This construction is based on a geometrical interpretation of the kinematics of this kind of theory. In order to describe the modified actions, we find that a higher (indeed infinite) derivative field theory is needed, from which the deformed kinematics can be read. From our construction we are able to restrict the possible models of doubly special relativity to those that preserve linear Lorentz invariance. We quantize the theories and also obtain a deformed version of the Maxwell equations. We analyze the electromagnetic vector potential for both an electric pointlike source and magnetic dipole. We observe that the electric and magnetic fields do not diverge at the origin for some models described with an anti-de Sitter momentum space but do for the de Sitter one in both problems.</description>

      <title>$1/N$ Corrections in $\text{QCD}_2$: Small Mass Limit and Threshold States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate $1/N$ corrections to mesonic spectrum in $1+1$-dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics ($\text{QCD}_2$) with fundamental quarks using effective Hamiltonian method. We express the corrections in terms of 't Hooft equation solutions. First, we consider 2-flavor model with a heavy and a light quark. We show that, in contrast to some claims in earlier literature, the $1/N$ correction to the mass of the heavy-light meson remains finite when the light quark mass is taken to zero. Nevertheless, the corrections become significantly larger in this limit; we attribute this to the presence of massless modes in the spectrum. We also study the corrections to the lightest meson mass in 1-flavor model and show that they are consistent with recent numerical data, but not with the prediction coming from bosonization. Then we study low energy effective theory for 2 flavors. We show that the 3-meson interaction vertex correctly reproduces Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) coupling when both quarks become massless. This coupling does not change even if one of the quarks is massive. We employ Discretized Light Cone Quatization (DLCQ) to check the continuum results and show that the improved version can be used for small quark mass. Finally, we study the states associated with $1\to 2$ meson thresholds. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we show that when the decay is allowed by parity, the infinite $N$ theory has near-threshold bound states that mix one- and two-meson parts. They are $1/3$ two-meson and $2/3$ one-meson and the corrections to their masses have unusual scaling $\sim 1/N^{2/3}$.</description>

Abstract: Infra-Red scaling property of inflationary universe is in the same universality class of random walk. The two point correlators of the curvature perturbations are enhanced by the e-folding number N. The distribution function of the curvature perturbation $\rho_t (\zeta)$ satisfies the Fokker Planck equation. The de Sitter universes are dual to the random walk: They belong to the Universality class of dimension two fractal. These boundary and bulk duality are at the heart of holography of quantum gravity. Historically the correspondence of thermodynamics and Einstein's equation are recognized as the first evidence for de Sitter duality .Our de Sitter duality relates the stochastic and geometric point of view. We study two types of the solutions of FP equation in quasi de Sitter space: (1) UV complete spacetime and (2) inflationary spacetime with concave potentials. The maximum entropy principle favors the following scenario: The universe is (a) born with small epsilon and (b) grows by inflation in the concave potential. We predict n_s &lt;0.975(0.97) and r &lt; 0.04(0.03) for N=50(60) at the pivot angle 0.002Mpc^{-1}. We have lowered the upper bound of $r$ by taking account of random walk effect at the boundary. Our predictions are highly consistent with recent observations.</description>

Abstract: We study the half-indices of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theories of orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups. We find precise matching pairs of the half-indices as strong evidence of dualities of the half-BPS boundary conditions and interfaces. The half-indices encode the spectra of excitations on the holographically dual orbifold ETW brane and giant gravitons. The exact form of the index for the orbifold ETW giant gravitons is obtained from the giant graviton expansion of the half-index.</description>

Abstract: Using polarization spinor methods in conjunction with the superspace formalism, we construct 3-point superconformal invariants that are used to determine the form of 3-point correlators of spinning superfield operators in $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs) in 4-dimensions. We enumerate the structural form of various spinning 3-point correlators using these invariants and find additional constraints on their form when the operators are conserved supercurrents. For these purposes, we first construct the invariants and 3-point correlators in non-supersymmetric $4d$ CFTs which are then extended using superspace methods to $4d$ SCFTs.</description>

      <title>The CEGM NLSM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying quantum field theories through geometric principles has revealed deep connections between physics and mathematics, including the discovery by Cachazo, Early, Guevara and Mizera (CEGM) of a generalization of biadjoint scalar amplitudes. However, extending this to generalizations of other quantum field theories remains a central challenge. Recently it has been discovered that the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) emerges after a certain zero-preserving deformation from $\text{tr}(\phi^3)$. In this work, we find a much richer story of zero-preserving deformations in the CEGM context, yielding generalized NLSM amplitudes. We prove an explicit formula for the residual embedding of an $n$-point NLSM amplitude in a mixed $n+2$ point generalized NLSM amplitude, which provides a strong consistency check on our generalization. We show that the dimension of the space of pure kinematic deformations is $\gcd(k,n)-1$, we introduce a deformation-compatible modification of the Global Schwinger Parameterization, and we include a new proof, using methods from matroidal blade arrangements, of the linear independence for the set of planar kinematic invariants for CEGM amplitudes. Our framework is compatible with string theory through recent generalizations of the Koba-Nielsen string integral to any positive configuration space $X^+(k,n)$, where the usual Koba-Nielsen string integral corresponds to $X(2,n) = \mathcal{M}_{0,n}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consistent dynamics which couples classical and quantum degrees of freedom exists. This dynamics is linear in the hybrid state, completely positive and trace preserving. Starting from completely positive classical-quantum master equations, we derive a general path integral representation for such dynamics in terms of a classical-quantum action, which includes the necessary and sufficient conditions for complete positivity and trace preservation. The path integral we study is a generalization of the Feynman path integral for quantum systems, and the stochastic path integral used to study classical stochastic processes, allowing for interaction between the classical and quantum systems. When the classical-quantum Hamiltonian is at most quadratic in the momenta we are able to derive a configuration space path integral, providing a map between master equations and covariant classical-quantum path integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on a modified-gravity model with an exponential function of the curvature using the expansion history, the RSD, and the Pantheon+SH0ES data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering a well-motivated $f(R)$ modified-gravity model, in which an exponential function of the curvature is included, in this paper we implement a statistical data analysis to set constraints on the parameters of the model, taking into account an analytic approximate solution for the expansion rate, $H(z)$. In the analysis based on the Markov chain Markov based on the expansion rate evolution, the standardized SN distance modulus and the redshift space distortion observational data, we find that the preferred value for the perturbative parameter, $b$, quantifying the deviation of the $f(R)$ model from $\Lambda$CDM, lives in a region that excludes $b = 0$ at $\gtrsim 3.5 \sigma$ C.L., and that the predicted current value of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$, locates in between the two observational results currently under scrutiny from Planck and SH0ES collaborations. Under the implemented approximate solution, and with the constraints obtained for the parameters, the proposed $f(R)$ model successfully reproduces the observational data and the predicted evolution of interesting cosmological parameters resemble the results of $\Lambda$CDM, as expected, while an oscillatory behavior of the dark energy equation of state is observed, pointing to deviation from the concordance cosmological model. The results presented here reinforce the conclusion that the $f(R)$ modified-gravity model represents a viable alternative to describe the evolution of the Universe, evading the challenges faced by $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observed Standard Model is consistent with the existence of vector-like species with electric charge a multiple of $e/6$. The discovery of a fractionally charged particle would provide nonperturbative information about Standard Model physics, and furthermore rule out some or all of the minimal theories of unification. We discuss the phenomenology of such particles and focus particularly on current LHC constraints, for which we reinterpret various searches to bound a variety of fractionally charged representations. We emphasize that in some circumstances the collider bounds are surprisingly low or nonexistent, which highlights the discovery potential for these species which have distinctive signatures and important implications. We additionally offer pedagogical discussions of the representation theory of gauge groups with different global structures, and separately of the modern framework of Generalized Global Symmetries, either of which serves to underscore the bottom-up importance of these searches.</description>

      <title>Perfect Wave Transfer in Continuous Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transfer of information from one part of a quantum system to another is fundamental to the understanding and design of quantum information processing devices. In the realm of discrete systems, such as spin chains, inhomogeneous networks have been engineered that allow for the perfect transfer of qubits from one end to the other. Here, by contrast, we investigate perfect transfer of information in continuous systems, phrased in terms of wave propagation. A remarkable difference is found between systems that possess conformal invariance and those that do not. Systems in the first class enjoy perfect wave transfer (PWT), explicitly shown for one-particle excitations and expected in general. In the second class, those that exhibit PWT are characterized as solutions to an inverse spectral problem. As a concrete example, we demonstrate how to formulate and solve this problem for a prototypical class of bosonic theories, showing the importance of conformal invariance for these theories to enjoy PWT. Using bosonization, our continuum results extend to theories with interactions, broadening the scope of perfect information transfer to more general quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with gravitational thermodynamics on the dynamical apparent horizon of an FLRW universe with dissipation. The dissipation is assumed to arise due to adiabatic gravitational particle creation. For the thermodynamic study, we consider the Bekenstein-Hawking formalism and also assume a nonzero curvature $\kappa$ for a general study. In particular, we study the unified first law, the generalized second law, and thermodynamic stability in our model. The specific heat capacities are taken into account for the study of thermodynamic stability. Our study reveals a nice result! The ratio of the specific heat capacity at constant pressure and that at constant volume in a flat FLRW universe with dissipation is nothing but the negative of the deceleration parameter. In classical thermodynamics, this ratio is known as the isentropic expansion factor or (for ideal gases) the adiabatic index. A more interesting fact that has come to light is that this relation is independent of the cosmological model used. So, this is actually a generic result in Big Bang Cosmology. We discuss the implications of this result on the evolution of the Universe. Finally, we determine the constraints on the effective equation of state and the particle creation rate which guarantees thermodynamic stability in our model.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the (axial) quasinormal modes of black holes embedded in generic matter profiles. Our results reveal that the axial QNMs experience a redshift when the black hole is surrounded by various matter environments, proportional to the compactness of the matter halo. Our calculations demonstrate that for static black holes embedded in galactic matter distributions, there exists a universal relation between the matter environment and the redshifted vacuum quasinormal modes. In particular, for dilute environments the leading order effect is a redshift $1+U$ of frequencies and damping times, with $U \sim -{\cal C}$ the Newtonian potential of the environment at its center, which scales with its compactness ${\cal C}$.</description>

      <title>Turbulence: A Nonequilibrium Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19367</link>

Abstract: Tools of quantum and statistical field theories have been successfully ported to turbulence. Here, we review the key results of turbulence field theory. \textit{Equilibrium field theory} describes thermalized spectrally-truncated Euler equation, where the equipartitioned Fourier modes generate zero energy flux. In contrast, \textit{nonequilibrium field theory} is employed for modelling of hydrodynamic turbulence (HDT), which has small viscosity. In HDT, viscosity renormalization yields wavenumber-dependent viscosity and energy spectrum. Field theory calculations also yields nonzero energy flux for HDT. These field theory computations have been generalized to other systems, e.g., passive scalar and magnetohydrodynamics. In this review, I cover these aspects, along with a brief coverage of weak turbulence and intermittency.</description>

      <title>Topological Sum Rules and Spectral Flows of Chiral and Gravitational Axion-like Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the structure of off-shell effective actions arising from chiral and gravitational anomalies, focusing on the $JJJ_A$ (axial-vector/vector/vector) and $J_A TT $ (axial-vector/stress-energy tensors) correlators, relevant in the analysis of anomaly-driven interactions in perturbation theory. Our approach relies on conformal field theory in momentum space, extended to chiral anomalies. The analysis centers on the presence of both particle poles and anomaly poles within these interactions, characterizing their behavior both in the conformal and non conformal limits. Through explicit computations, we show that universal sum rules in the longitudinal sector regulate these interactions for all kinematic conditions, extending previous analysis, and we discuss the resulting spectral flow, an area law of the absorptive part of the anomaly form factors as one moves away from or returns to the conformal point. These features are absent in the local effective action of anomaly interactions, commonly used in the description of axion-like particles. The spectral densities in both cases are shown to be self-similar. Our results further show that anomaly poles correspond to true particle poles only in the conformal limit, when the interaction describes a massless S-matrix process supported on a null-surface. Under these conditions, they can be effectively described by two kinetically mixed pseudoscalar fields propagating on the light-cone. These studies find application in polarized deeply inelastic scattering, axion-like dark matter and analogue systems such as topological materials.</description>

      <title>Dual view of the Z$_2$-Gauged XY Model in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $Z_2$ gauged neutral XY model is of long-standing interest both in the context of nematic order, and the study of fractionalization and superconductivity. This paper presents heuristic arguments that no deconfinement of the XY field occurs in this model and presents results of a large-scale Monte Carlo simulations on a cubic lattice which are consistent with this conclusion. The correlation radius determining the confinement is found to be growing rapidly as a function of the parameters in the phase featuring the nematic order. Thus, mesoscopic properties of the system can mimic deconfinement with high accuracy in some part of the phase diagram.</description>
