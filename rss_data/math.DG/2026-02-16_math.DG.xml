      <title>On pluricanonical locally conformally almost K\"ahler metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On an almost complex manifold $(M,J)$, a pluricanonical locally conformally almost K\"ahler (LCAK) metric $g$ is induced by a locally conformally symplectic structure $(F,\theta)$ of the first kind and characterized by the fact that $D\theta$ is $J$-anti-invariant and that the image of the Nijenhuis tensor is $g$-orthogonal to the distribution spanned by $\{\theta^\sharp,J\theta^\sharp\}$, where $\theta$ is the Lee form and $D$ is the Levi-Civita connection. On a compact complex manifold, pluricanonical locally conformally K\"ahler (LCK) metrics have parallel Lee form. The same conclusion holds for LCK Chern--Ricci flat Gauduchon metrics. We generalize both results to pluricanonical LCAK metrics. We also observe that on a compact pluricanonical LCAK manifold with a non-trivial Lee form, there is no symplectic form compatible with the same almost complex structure. Moreover, we give a simple characterization of the pluricanonical LCAK condition on Lie algebras. Finally, we study LCAK metrics with $\theta^\sharp$ being real holomorphic, proving in that case $D\theta=0$ when the metric is Gauduchon.</description>

      <title>Maximum capacity of Bartnik data and a generalization of static metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by R. Bartnik's mass minimization problem in general relativity, we investigate a dual problem of maximizing the capacity among asymptotically flat extensions (with nonnegative scalar curvature) of some fixed two-dimensional boundary data. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers on the constraint space of scalar-flat extensions, we derive the variational condition satisfied by a maximal capacity extension. The resulting equation is an inhomogeneous generalization of the well-known static equation, now coupled with the Baird--Eells stress-energy tensor for a harmonic function. We analyze these ``harmonic-static'' metrics in a local sense, proving they have constant scalar curvature and serve as critical points for a metric-dependent Dirichlet energy functional. We conclude with a number of open questions.</description>

      <title>Neural and numerical methods for $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures on contact Calabi-Yau 7-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical framework for approximating $\mathrm{G}_2$-structure 3-forms on contact Calabi-Yau manifolds is presented. The approach proceeds in three stages: first, existing neural network models are employed to compute an approximate Ricci-flat metric on a Calabi-Yau threefold. Second, using this metric and the explicit construction of a $\mathrm{G}_2$-structure on the associated 7-dimensional Calabi-Yau link in the 9-sphere, numerical approximations of the 3-form are generated on a large set of sampled points. Finally, a dedicated neural architecture is trained to learn the 3-form and its induced Riemannian metric directly from data, validating the learned structure and its torsion via a numerical implementation of the exterior derivative, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Wilson Dirac operator in lattice gauge theory with a domain-wall mass term, we construct a discretization of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index for domains with compact boundary in a flat torus. We prove that, for sufficiently small lattice spacings, this discretization correctly captures the continuum Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index.</description>

      <title>Line congruences associated to Appell's hypergeometric functions of rank-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line congruences - two-parameter families of lines in projective 3-space - are the genesis of many beautiful examples of transformations of surfaces, such as the Laplace transform. This subject is less well-known today than in previous generations. We survey and review results related to projective differential geometry of surfaces, line congruences, and close connections to linear systems of PDEs of finite type whose solutions define the data of an immersion of a surface into projective 3-space. We then derive formulae for the Laplace transform of the entire rank-4 linear system associated to such an immersed surface, obtaining explicit formulae for the rank-4 systems that define the Laplace transformed surfaces. We apply our results to study the geometry of surfaces defined by Appell's hypergeometric functions of rank-4, namely the functions $F_2$ and $F_4$. We show that the sequence of Laplace invariants for each is determined respectively by the Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation in the case of $F_2$, and Darboux's Harmonic equation in the case of $F_4$. Further, we show that for all parameter values of the hypergeometric functions, the natural line congruences generated by the Laplace transforms of the surfaces determined by either $F_2$ or $F_4$ constitute a $W$-congruence, an important example of line congruence.</description>

      <title>Classification of K-contact forms and spectral invariants of their sub-Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A contact form is called K-contact if its Reeb vector field is Killing with respect to some Riemannian metric. In this paper we classify K-contact forms whose Reeb vector field admits at least one non-periodic orbit, on three-dimensional manifolds. We prove that if a compact three-manifold carries such a contact form, then it is diffeomorphic to a lens space and admits exactly two periodic Reeb orbits, whose periods have irrational ratio. We further classify, up to (global) diffeomorphism, these contact forms in terms of the periods of their closed Reeb orbits. We conclude by relating these periods to spectral invariants of the sub-Laplacian, confirming a conjecture of Y. Colin de Verdi\`ere in the irregular K-contact case.</description>

      <title>The fundamental group of a spherical space form is not audible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of isospectral spherical space forms with non-cyclic fundamental groups after the works by Ikeda, Gilkey and Wolf. We find the first pair of spherical space forms with non-isomorphic fundamental groups and the same Laplace spectrum. This shows that the isomorphism class of the fundamental group is not audible among spherical space forms. We also found several instances where one can hear the fundamental group of a spherical space form (among spherical space forms).</description>

      <title>Submanifolds of class $C^{1,\alpha}$ and sets with positive $\mu$-reach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known since the seminal work of Herbert Federer [Trans. of the AMS, 1959] that submanifolds of class $C^{1,1}$ have positive reach. In this paper, we extend this property to less regular submanifolds by using the notion of $\mu$-reach that was introduced in the 2000's. We first show that every compact $C^1$ submanifold of the Euclidean space $\E^n$ has positive $\mu$-reach for all $\mu&lt;1$. We then show that intermediate regularities $C^{1,\alpha}$ induce more quantitative results on the norm $\|\nabla \d_M\|$ of the generalized gradient of the distance function~$\d_M$ to the submanifold. More precisely, if $M\subset \E^n$ is a submanifold of class $C^{1,\alpha}$, with $\alpha&lt;1$, then there exists a constant $C&gt;0$ such that
  $$\forall p\in\E^n\setminus M,\quad 1 - \| \nabla \d_M(p) \|^2 \leq C ~ \d_M(p)^{\frac{2 \alpha}{1- \alpha}}.$$ We finally show that the exponent $2\alpha/(1-\alpha)$ in this estimate is sharp.</description>

      <title>Extensions of spacetime Bartnik data and estimates for the Bartnik mass outside of time-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bartnik's quasi-local mass is a functional on Bartnik data $(\mathbb S^2,\gamma,H,P,\omega^\perp)$, consisting of a metric $\gamma$, scalar functions $H$ and $P$, and a 1-form $\omega^\perp$ on the $2$-sphere $\mathbb S^2$. We construct initial data $(M,g,K)$ for the Einstein equations with boundary $\Sigma\cong\mathbb S^2$, and boundary conditions for $g$ and $K$ determined by Bartnik data with $H,P$ constant and $\omega^\perp\equiv0$. Furthermore this initial data agrees with spherically symmetric initial data for a Schwarzschild spacetime outside of a compact set with controlled mass. As an application, we obtain estimates for the Bartnik mass for such Bartnik data, outside of the time-symmetric setting.
  We also construct initial data on the cylinder $\mathbb S^2\times[0,1]$ connecting this same class of Bartnik data to time-symmetric data so that estimates for the Bartnik mass outside of time-symmetry can be obtained from prior estimates for time-symmetric data.</description>

      <title>Heat Flow in Semi-Flat Elliptic Fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the SYZ picture for the collapsing of elliptic K3 surfaces, we study heat kernels under semi-flat collapse of Ricci-flat K\"ahler manifolds (X_t, g(t)) fibered by flat 2-tori over a surface B with a finite discriminant set D. On the regular locus B_reg = B \ D we assume an exponentially accurate semi-flat product approximation together with a uniform vertical spectral gap at the collapse scale. Using normalized lift and fiber-average maps, we show that for each fixed time tau &gt; 0 the fiber-compressed heat operators converge strongly on L^2 to the heat semigroup of the base Laplacian. Equivalently, bilinear pairings of the total-space heat kernel against fiber-constant lifts of test functions converge on any precompact subset of B_reg.
  The main additional issue occurs at the discriminant: although X_t is smooth, the limiting base geometry becomes conic near D, so test functions meeting D cannot be treated by purely interior arguments. In wedge charts around D we introduce a canonical conic-renormalized bilinear functional obtained by patching the base heat-kernel pairing away from D with the model heat kernel of the corresponding flat cone. A conic parametrix shows that this functional is well-defined and independent of auxiliary cutoffs, and that the total-space bilinear pairings converge to it for arbitrary smooth compactly supported test functions and every fixed tau &gt; 0. When the supports avoid D, the renormalization is trivial and the limit reduces to the usual base heat-kernel pairing. Under exponentially small geometric errors we obtain an explicit exponential convergence rate, uniform for tau in compact subintervals of (0, infinity). The results extend to Neumann and nonnegatively weighted Robin boundary conditions and globalize by exhaustion of the regular locus.</description>

      <title>Relative uniform Yau--Tian--Donaldson correspondence for projective bundles over a curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a relative uniform Yau--Tian--Donaldson correspondence, in terms of test configurations, for the projectivization \( \mathbb{P}(E) \) of a holomorphic vector bundle \( E \) over a smooth curve. For any K\"ahler class \( [\omega] \) on \( \mathbb{P}(E) \), we construct K\"ahler test configurations, which we call \emph{compatible test configurations}. They are obtained by gluing horospherical test configurations from the fibers, arising from convex functions on a suitable moment polytope \( \Delta \) following the construction of Delcroix, to the principal bundle associated with \( \mathbb{P}(E) \). Using the generalized Calabi ansatz of Apostolov--Calderbank--Gauduchon--T{\o}nnesen-Friedman on these test configurations, we show that the relative uniform stability of \( (\mathbb{P}(E),[\omega]) \) for compatible test configurations implies the existence of an extremal metric in this class, thereby establishing the equivalence. Along the way, we prove that these two conditions are equivalent to the weighted uniform stability of \( \Delta \) for suitable explicit weight functions defined from the topological data of \( \mathbb{P}(E) \).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a preliminary version of a book on infinite-dimensional Lie groups. It covers the basics of calculus and manifolds in the context of locally convex spaces, based on Bastiani's notion of a smooth map. Starting from this concept, we develop the basics of smooth manifolds and define Lie groups as manifolds with smooth group operations. We discuss in particular several classes of Lie groups, such as regular ones, or those with an exponential function that is a local diffeomorphism. The local theory, subgroups and quotients are explored in some detail. Classes of Lie groups that are discussed in detail include: unit groups of continuous inverse algebras, groups of smooth maps, direct limit groups and groups of diffeomorphism. We also included chapters on the topology of infinite-dimensional Lie group and on various selected topics.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach to the Nirenberg Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the Nirenberg Neural Network: a numerical approach to the Nirenberg problem of prescribing Gaussian curvature on $S^2$ for metrics that are pointwise conformal to the round metric. Our mesh-free physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach directly parametrises the conformal factor globally and is trained with a geometry-aware loss enforcing the curvature equation. Additional consistency checks were performed via the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and spherical-harmonic expansions were fit to the learnt models to provide interpretability.
  For prescribed curvatures with known realisability, the neural network achieves very low losses ($10^{-7} - 10^{-10}$), while unrealisable curvatures yield significantly higher losses. This distinction enables the assessment of unknown cases, separating likely realisable functions from non-realisable ones. The current capabilities of the Nirenberg Neural Network demonstrate that neural solvers can serve as exploratory tools in geometric analysis, offering a quantitative computational perspective on longstanding existence questions.</description>

      <title>Hyperk\"ahler ambient metrics associated with twistor CR manifolds</title>

Abstract: Twistor CR manifolds, introduced by LeBrun, are Lorentzian (neutral) CR 5-manifolds defined as $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundles over 3-dimensional conformal manifolds. In this paper, we embed a real analytic twistor CR manifold into the twistor space of the anti self-dual Poincar\'e-Einstein metric whose conformal infinity is the base conformal 3-manifold, and construct the associated Fefferman ambient metric as a neutral hyperk\"ahler metric on the spinor bundle with the zero section removed. We also describe the structure of the Cheng--Yau type K\"ahler-Einstein metric which has the twistor CR manifold as the boundary at infinity.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the notion of equations describing pseudospherical surfaces, starting from the works by Sasaki, whose roots were influenced by the AKNS system, the works by Chern and Tenenblat, until current research topics in the field relating to Cauchy problems involving these equations and their geometric consequences.</description>

      <title>Lines in the space of K\"ahler metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a Ross-Witt Nystr\"om correspondence for weak geodesic lines in the (completed) space of K\"ahler metrics. We construct a wide range of weak geodesic lines on arbitrary projective K\"ahler manifolds that are not generated by holomorphic vector fields, in the process disproving a folklore conjecture popularized by Berndtsson. Remarkably, some of these weak geodesic lines turn out to be smooth. In the case of Riemann surfaces, our results can be significantly sharpened. Finally, we investigate the validity of Euclid's fifth postulate for the space of K\"ahler metrics.</description>

      <title>The versal deformation of small resolutions of conic bundles over $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$ with two sections blown down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twistor spaces are certain compact complex threefolds with an additional real fibre bundle structure. We focus here on twistor spaces over $3\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^2$. Such spaces are either small resolutions of double solids or they can be described as modifications of conic bundles. The last type is the more special one: they deform into double solids. We give an explicit description of this deformation, in a more general context.</description>

      <title>Exotic embedded surfaces and involutions from Real Seiberg-Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Real Seiberg--Witten theory, Miyazawa introduced an invariant of certain 4-manifolds with involution and used this invariant to construct infinitely many exotic involutions on $\mathbb{CP}^2$ and infinitely many exotic smooth embeddings of $\mathbb{RP}^2$ in $S^4$. In this paper we extend Miyazawa's construction to a large class of 4-manifolds, giving many infinite families of involutions on 4-manifolds which are conjugate by homeomorphisms but not by diffeomorphisms and many infinite families of exotic embeddings of non-orientable surfaces in 4-manifolds, where exotic means continuously isotopic but not smoothly isotopic. Exoticness of our construction is detected using Real Seiberg--Witten theory. We study Miyazawa's invariant, relate it to the Real Seiberg--Witten invariants of Tian--Wang and prove various fundamental results concerning the Real Seiberg--Witten invariants such as: relation to positive scalar curvature, wall-crossing, a mod 2 formula for spin structures, a localisation formula relating ordinary and Real Seiberg--Witten invariants, a connected sum formula and a fibre sum formula.</description>

      <title>First variation of flat traces on negatively curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a closed negatively curved surface $(X,g)$ the flat trace of the geodesic Koopman operators $V_g^\tau f=f\circ G_g^\tau$ is the periodic orbit distribution \[ \mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g}(\tau)=\sum_{\gamma}\frac{L_\gamma^{\#}}{\lvert\det(I-P_\gamma)\rvert}\,\delta(\tau-L_\gamma), \qquad \tau&gt;0, \] supported on the length spectrum and weighted by the linearized Poincar\'e maps $P_\gamma$. For a smooth family of negatively curved metrics $g_t$ we compute the first variation $\partial_t\vert_{0}\,\mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g_t}$ as a distribution. At an isolated length $\ell$ the leading singularity is a multiple of $\delta'(\tau-\ell)$, and its coefficient is an explicit linear functional of the length variations $\dot L_{\gamma^m}$ of the closed geodesics with $L_{\gamma^m}=\ell$. This transport coefficient forces the marked lengths to be locally constant along any deformation with constant flat trace. As an application, if $\mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g_t}=\mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g_0}$ for all $t$ then $g_t$ is isometric to $g_0$ for all $t$. Together with Sunada-type constructions of non isometric pairs with equal flat traces, this shows that the flat trace is globally non-unique yet locally complete along smooth families.</description>
