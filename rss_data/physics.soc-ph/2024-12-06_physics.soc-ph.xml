      <title>Counter-Geoengineering: Feasibility and Policy Implications for a Geoengineered World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing urgency of climate change's impacts and limited success in reducing emissions, "geoengineering," or the artificial manipulation of the climate to reduce warming rates, has been proposed as an alternative short-term solution. Options range from taking carbon out of the atmosphere through carbon sinks and brightening clouds to increasing the planet's albedo through the release of reflective particles into the atmosphere. While still controversial, geoengineering has been proposed by some as a promising and low-cost way of combating climate change. In particular, so-called 'moderate' geoengineering is claimed to be achievable with few potential side effects or other ramifications. However, this paper argues that the effect of moderate geoengineering can easily be nullified by 'counter-geoengineering,' and any impactful geoengineering would require a global governance framework to prevent countries which benefit from warming temperatures from deploying counter-geoengineering. In this paper, we take Russia as an example due to its potential interest in counteracting geoengineering and its significant ability to release a great amount of methane, a viable counter-geoengineering pathway in the short term.</description>

      <title>Social Media Informatics for Sustainable Cities and Societies: An Overview of the Applications, associated Challenges, and Potential Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the modern world, our cities and societies face several technological and societal challenges, such as rapid urbanization, global warming &amp; climate change, the digital divide, and social inequalities, increasing the need for more sustainable cities and societies. Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach involving all the stakeholders, sustainable planning, efficient resource management, innovative solutions, and modern technologies. Like other modern technologies, social media informatics also plays its part in developing more sustainable and resilient cities and societies. Despite its limitations, social media informatics has proven very effective in various sustainable cities and society applications. In this paper, we review and analyze the role of social media informatics in sustainable cities and society by providing a detailed overview of its applications, associated challenges, and potential solutions. This work is expected to provide a baseline for future research in the domain.</description>

      <title>Core-periphery detection in multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayer networks provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems that capture different types of interactions between the same set of entities across multiple layers. Core-periphery detection involves partitioning the nodes of a network into core nodes, which are highly connected across the network, and peripheral nodes, which are densely connected to the core but sparsely connected among themselves. In this paper, we propose a new model of core-periphery in multilayer network and a nonlinear spectral method that simultaneously detects the corresponding core and periphery structures of both nodes and layers in weighted and directed multilayer networks. Our method reveals novel structural insights in three empirical multilayer networks from distinct application areas: the citation network of complex network scientists, the European airlines transport network, and the world trade network.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Node Embeddings for Graph Modeling and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lying at the interface between Network Science and Machine Learning, node embedding algorithms take a graph as input and encode its structure onto output vectors that represent nodes in an abstract geometric space, enabling various vector-based downstream tasks such as network modelling, data compression, link prediction, and community detection. Two apparently unrelated limitations affect these algorithms. On one hand, it is not clear what the basic operation defining vector spaces, i.e. the vector sum, corresponds to in terms of the original nodes in the network. On the other hand, while the same input network can be represented at multiple levels of resolution by coarse-graining the constituent nodes into arbitrary block-nodes, the relationship between node embeddings obtained at different hierarchical levels is not understood. Here, building on recent results in network renormalization theory, we address these two limitations at once and define a multiscale node embedding method that, upon arbitrary coarse-grainings, ensures statistical consistency of the embedding vector of a block-node with the sum of the embedding vectors of its constituent nodes. We illustrate the power of this approach on two economic networks that can be naturally represented at multiple resolution levels: namely, the international trade between (sets of) countries and the input-output flows among (sets of) industries in the Netherlands. We confirm the statistical consistency between networks retrieved from coarse-grained node vectors and networks retrieved from sums of fine-grained node vectors, a result that cannot be achieved by alternative methods. Several key network properties, including a large number of triangles, are successfully replicated already from embeddings of very low dimensionality, allowing for the generation of faithful replicas of the original networks at arbitrary resolution levels.</description>

      <title>Scaling and universality for percolation in random networks: A unified view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05125v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Percolation processes on random networks have been the subject of intense research activity over the last decades: the overall phenomenology of standard percolation on uncorrelated and unclustered topologies is well known. Still some critical properties of the transition, in particular for heterogeneous substrates, have not been fully elucidated and contradictory results appear in the literature. In this paper we present, by means of a generating functions approach, a thorough and complete investigation of percolation critical properties in random networks. We determine all critical exponents, the associated critical amplitude ratios and the form of the cluster size distribution for networks of any level of heterogeneity. We uncover, in particular for highly heterogeneous networks, subtle crossover phenomena, nontrivial scaling forms and violations of hyperscaling. In this way we clarify the origin of inconsistencies in the previous literature.</description>

      <title>Synthetic graphs for link prediction benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting missing links in complex networks requires algorithms that are able to explore statistical regularities in the existing data. Here we investigate the interplay between algorithm efficiency and network structures through the introduction of suitably-designed synthetic graphs. We propose a family of random graphs that incorporates both micro-scale motifs and meso-scale communities, two ubiquitous structures in complex networks. A key contribution is the derivation of theoretical upper bounds for link prediction performance in our synthetic graphs, allowing us to estimate the predictability of the task and obtain an improved assessment of the performance of any method. Our results on the performance of classical methods (e.g., Stochastic Block Models, Node2Vec,GraphSage) show that the performance of all methods correlate with the theoretical predictability, that no single method is universally superior, and that each of the methods exploit different characteristics known to exist in large classes of networks. Our findings underline the need for careful consideration of graph structure when selecting a link prediction method and emphasize the value of comparing performance against synthetic benchmarks. We provide open-source code for generating these synthetic graphs, enabling further research on link prediction methods.</description>

      <title>Inferring Leader-Follower Behavior from Presence Data in the Marine Environment: A Case Study on Reef Manta Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social interactions are fundamental in animal groups, including humans, and can take various forms, such as competition, cooperation, or kinship. Understanding these interactions in marine environments has been historically challenging due to data collection difficulties. However, advancements in acoustic telemetry now enable remote analysis of such behaviors. This study proposes a method to derive leader-follower networks from presence data collected by a single acoustic receiver at a specific location.
  Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, the method analyzes lag times between consecutive presences of individuals to infer directed relationships. Tested on simulated data, it was then applied to detection data from acoustically tagged reef manta rays (\textit{Mobula~alfredi}) frequenting a known site. Results revealed temporal patterns, including circadian rhythms and burst-like behavior with power-law distributed time gaps between presences.
  The inferred leader-follower network highlighted key behavioral patterns: females followed males more often than expected, males showed stronger but fewer associations with specific females, and smaller individuals followed others less consistently than larger ones. These findings align with ecological insights, revealing structured social interactions and providing a novel framework for studying marine animal behavior through network theory.</description>
