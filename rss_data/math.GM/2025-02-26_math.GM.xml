      <title>Fundamental Functor on Hypergroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a hypergroup $(H,\circ)$ we consider $\gamma^{\ast}$, as the smallest equivalence relation on $H$ such that the quotion $(H/\gamma^{\ast},\tiny{\otimes})$ is an abelian group. We study some more properties of $\gamma^{\ast}$. Initially, it is investigated which subhypergroup the congruence relation modulo is strongly regular on, and its quotient results in an abelian group? This is directly related to the fundamental relation $\gamma^{\ast}$, since such subhypergroups must contain $S_{\gamma}$. Then, we examine the functor $\gamma^{\ast}$ from a categorical perspective and investigate properties such as continuity and cocontinuity concerning it using the decomposition $\gamma=\delta\tiny{\ast}\beta$. For this purpose, we define the reduced words on strongly regular hypergroups. This has a direct application in studying how the functor $\gamma^{\ast}$ affects on the stalks of the sheaves of hypergroups.</description>

      <title>Functors Associated to Relations on Hypergroups and Hypermodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If H is a strongly regular hypergroup, we show that the set of regular relations on H and the set of subhypergroups containing $0_{H}$ are two lattices that are isomorphic to each other. In the next step, we introduce and study the properties of functors that are constructed by a sequence of strongly regular relations. This helps us to define a specific type of free objects and tensor products on the category of regular hypergroups.</description>

      <title>A Paradox on the Law of Excluded Middle in the framework of category of set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a paradox arising from the acceptance of the Law of Excluded Middle (LEM) within classical mathematics. Specifically, we construct a nonzero analytic function on a connected open subset of the complex plane whose zeros are not isolated. This contradicts a fundamental theorem in complex analysis, thereby revealing an inconsistency tied to LEM. Unlike traditional critiques that reject LEM in favor of intuitionistic or constructive mathematics, we argue that LEM is instrumental in discovering \textbf{relations} between objects and facts rather than the objects themselves. Since we are not always in direct attachment with objects, this relational perspective introduces \textbf{inherent uncertainty} in mathematical reasoning. Consequently, we propose that the logical framework of the world is undecidable, making contradictions possible in more complex contexts. Our findings suggest that LEM, while powerful, may not be universally reliable in all mathematical frameworks. This work has implications for foundational mathematics, particularly in relation to the limits of classical logic and the necessity of alternative logical paradigms.</description>

      <title>Definite integrals involving Bessel functions expressed as a series of special functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Series involving hypergeometric functions are used to derive, extend and evaluate integrals involving the product of two Bessel functions of the first kind $J_{u}(a z)$ $J_{v}(b z)$ with order $u,v$, studied by Landau et al. The method used in this work is contour integration.</description>
