      <title>Gaia search for stellar companions of TESS Objects of Interest V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present the latest results of our ongoing multiplicity survey of (Community) TESS Objects of Interest, using astrometry and photometry from the latest data release of the ESA Gaia mission to detect stellar companions of these stars and to characterize their properties. A total of 92 binary and two hierarchical triple star systems are identified among the 745 target stars whose multiplicity is explored in this study, all at distances of less than 500pc around the Sun. As expected for components of gravitationally bound star systems, the targets and the detected companions are at the same distance and share a common proper motion, as shown by their accurate Gaia astrometry. The companions have masses of about 0.12 to 1.6$M_\odot$. and are most frequently found in the mass range up to 0.6$M_\odot$. The companions have projected separations from the targets between about 110 and 9600au. Their frequency is highest and constant from about 300 to 800au, decreasing at larger projected separations. In addition to main sequence stars, five white dwarf companions are detected in this study, whose true nature is unveiled by their photometric properties.</description>

      <title>Investigating episodic mass loss in evolved massive stars: III. Spectroscopy of dusty massive stars in three northern galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass loss in massive stars is crucial to understanding how these stars evolve and explode. Despite increasing evidence indicating its importance, episodic mass loss remains poorly understood. Here we report the results of an optical spectroscopic survey of evolved massive stars in NGC 6822, IC 10, and IC 1613, conducted by the ASSESS project (Episodic Mass Loss in Evolved Massive Stars: Key to Understanding the Explosive Early Universe), which aimed to investigate the role of episodic mass loss, by targeting stars with infrared excesses indicating a dusty circumstellar environment. We assigned a spectral class to 122 unique sources, the majority of which are dusty. The rate of evolved massive stars was over 60% for the highest-priority targets. We discovered 2 blue supergiants, 1 yellow supergiant, 1 emission-line object, and confirmed 2 supernova remnant candidates, a Wolf-Rayet star, and 2 H II regions. Twenty-eight unique sources were classified as red supergiants, 21 of which are new discoveries. In IC 10, we increased the sample of spectroscopically confirmed RSGs from 1 to 17. We used the MARCS models to obtain their surface properties, most importantly the effective temperature, and spectral energy distribution fitting to obtain the stellar luminosity for 17 of them. The dusty RSGs are cooler, more luminous, more extinguished, and more evolved than the non-dusty ones, in agreement with previous findings. Investigating the optical photometric variability of the RSGs from light curves covering a period over a decade revealed that the dusty RSGs are more variable. We further highlight the very extinguished emission-line object, two RSGs that display a significant change in spectral type between two observed epochs, and four dusty K-type RSGs as candidates for having undergone episodic mass loss.</description>

      <title>The Sun's Dark Core: Helioseismic and neutrino flux constraints on a compact solar center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As dark matter appears to comprise most of the Galactic mass, some of it may accumulate in the cores of stars, thereby making the Sun a laboratory for constraining various dark matter theories. We consider the effects on the solar structure arising from a general class of macroscopic dark matter candidates that include strange quark matter, compact dark objects, and others. We calibrate standard solar evolution models (i.e., models that reproduce the mass, luminosity, radius, and metallicity of the Sun at its present age) with variable compact dark core masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-2}~\rm{M}_\odot$ and assess their properties.
  We find that the weakest constraints come from solar neutrino flux measurements, which only rule out the most massive dark core comprising at least $\sim 1\%$ of the total solar mass. The Sun's acoustic oscillations impose stronger constraints, probing masses down to $\sim 10^{-5}~\rm{M}_\odot$. We find that a model with a $10^{-3}~\rm{M}_\odot$ dark core appears to improve the agreement with helioseismic observations. We nevertheless caution against interpreting this as evidence for dark matter in the solar interior, and suggest plausible effects that the dark core may instead be emulating. Finally, we show that future measurements of solar $g$~modes may constrain dark core masses down to $10^{-7}~\rm{M}_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing post-common envelope white dwarf+main sequence binary histories through inverse population synthesis techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of binary stellar systems involves a wide range of physical processes, many of which are not yet well understood. We aim to build a general-purpose algorithm based on inverse population synthesis techniques, able to reconstruct the past history of binary systems. This algorithm will be applied to a sample of eclipsing binaries, aiming to ascertain their progenitors and past histories. Once validated, it was applied to a sample 30 white dwarf plus main-sequence eclipsing binaries observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility survey. We determined the input space parameters of the progenitors for the 30 eclipsing binary systems to which the algorithm was applied. These parameters included the initial primary and secondary masses, the orbital separation and eccentricity, the common-envelope efficiency ($\alpha_{\rm CE}$), and the age at which the system was formed. Furthermore, the analysis of the global properties revealed some important features: a mild anticorrelation between the common-envelope efficiency parameter and the secondary mass, the absence of a universal value of $\alpha_{\rm CE}$ along with no need for internal energy, although in the low-mass regime, the high values of $\alpha_{\rm CE}$ suggest a possible contribution, and an initial thermalized eccentricity distribution. Although a strong degeneracy among the input parameters exists in the reconstruction of post-common envelope binary systems, the high accuracy obtained for the eclipsing-binary systems analyzed here has allowed our algorithm to make a reasonable determination of the initial parameters without the need to include external constraints. The global properties found here so far, can be substantially improved when analyzing a future volume-complete sample.</description>

      <title>The effect of turbulence on the angular momentum of the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transfer of a star's angular momentum to its atmosphere is a topic of considerable and wide-ranging interest in astrophysics. This letter considers the effect of kinetic and magnetic turbulence on the solar wind's angular momentum. The effects are quantified in a theoretical framework that employs Reynolds-averaged mean field magnetohydrodynamics, allowing for fluctuations of arbitrary amplitude. The model is restricted to the solar equatorial (\(r-\phi\)) plane with axial symmetry, which permits the effect of turbulence to be expressed in analytical form as a modification to the classic Weber &amp; Davis (1967) theory, dependent on the \(r,\phi\) shear component of the Reynolds stress tensor. A solar wind simulation with turbulence transport modeling and Parker Solar Probe observations at the Alfv\'en surface are employed to quantify this turbulent modification to the solar wind's angular momentum, which is found to be ~ 3% - 10% and tends to be negative. Implications for solar and stellar rotational evolution are discussed.</description>

      <title>Very Late-Time JWST and Keck Spectra of the Oxygen-Rich Supernova 1995N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new {\it JWST}/MIRI MRS and Keck spectra of SN 1995N obtained in 2022--2023, more than 10,000 days after the supernova (SN) explosion. These spectra are among the latest direct detections of a core-collapse SN, both through emission lines in the optical and thermal continuum from infrared dust emission. The new infrared data show that dust heating from radiation produced by the ejecta interacting with circumstellar matter is still present, but greatly reduced from when SN 1995N was observed by the {\it Spitzer Space Telescope} and {\it WISE} in 2009/2010 and 2018, when the dust mass was estimated to be 0.4 M(Sun). New radiative-transfer modeling suggests that the dust mass and grain size may have increased between 2010 and 2023. The new data can alternatively be well fit with a dust mass of 0.4 M(Sun) and a much reduced heating source luminosity. The new late-time spectra show unusually strong oxygen forbidden lines, stronger than the H-alpha emission. This indicates that SN 1995N may have exploded as a stripped-envelope SN which then interacted with a massive H-rich circumstellar shell, changing it from intrinsically Type Ib/c to Type IIn. The late-time spectrum results when the reverse shock begins to excite the inner H-poor, O-rich ejecta. This change in the spectrum is rarely seen, but marks the start of the transition from SN to SN remnant.</description>

      <title>Gaia's faintest stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Brief History of Time Stephen Hawking was pessimistic about astronomers detecting primordial black holes (PBHs). He would not be the only distinguished scientist to underestimate the extraordinary power of new technology. In a related area Albert Einstein published the equations for microlensing, but wrote off their practicality. Perhaps they meant "during my lifetime." The amazing properties of PBHs, however, validate heroic efforts to detect them. If they exist, their niches in our current history of time include supplying dark matter to bind galaxies, offering a solution for the Hubble tension, and, as supermassive black holes, giving us quasars as far as the eye can see. This Research Note describes a search for PBHs in the Gaia archive. In spite of the high density of local dark matter, it was unsuccessful. Microlensing with the Rubin telescope is the tool at our disposal to open the asteroid window for PBH.</description>

      <title>Tracking an eruptive intermediate prominence originating from the farside of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we carry out multiwavelength and multiview observations of the eruption of an intermediate prominence originating from the farside of the Sun on 2023 March 12. The southeast footpoint of the prominence is located in active region (AR) 13252. The eruption generates a B7.8 class flare and a partial halo coronal mass ejection (CME). The prominence takes off at 02:00 UT and accelerates for nearly three hours. Rotation of the southeast leg of the prominence in the counterclockwise direction is revealed by spectroscopic and imaging observations. The apex of the prominence changes from a smooth loop to a cusp structure during the rising motion and the northwest leg displays a drift motion after 04:30 UT, implying a writhing motion. Hence, the prominence eruption is most likely triggered by ideal kink instability. For the first time, we apply the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) modeling in three-dimensional reconstruction and tracking of the prominence for nearly two hours. Both the source region (110$\degr$E, 43$\degr$N) and northwest footpoint (162$\degr$E, 44$\degr$N) are located. The edge-on and face-on angular widths of the prominence are $\sim$6$\degr$ and $\sim$86$\degr$, respectively. The axis has a tilt angle of $\sim$70$\degr$ with the meridian. The heliocentric distance of the prominence leading edge increases from $\sim$1.26\,$R_{\sun}$ to $\sim$2.27\,$R_{\sun}$. The true speed of the CME increases from $\sim$610 to $\sim$849 km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Hubble's Variable Nebula I: Ripples on a Big Screen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC2261 is a reflection nebula illuminated by the young star R Monocerotis. Objects moving near the star occasionally cast shadows on the nebula, giving rise to its alternative name: Hubble's Variable Nebula. For 7 years since Spring 2017 robotic telescopes have been used to compile a roughly twice-weekly record of changes in the object. The results, over 1000 images at separate epochs, have been compiled into a movie. This shows that, as well as the large scale but infrequent variability for which it is famous, the nebula is continually traversed by low level `ripples' of light and dark. These record changes in the light output from R Mon and analysis of their progress indicates that the reflecting material takes the form of a thin (&lt;3x10^16cm) screen whose shape resembles a half paraboloid, rooted at the star and bowed towards us. The brightness of the screen in Herschel far-IR maps indicates a density n_H&gt; 1.7x10^5cm^-3 and CO observations show the material is moving towards us at a few km/s relative to the rest cloud, consistent it with being a dense shell of material displaced by R~Mon's outflow. The results demonstrate the value of studying such objects in the time domain, and are a glimpse of what will be achieved by instruments like the Zwicky Transient Facility and Vera Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>The 2023 outburst of the Gaia alerted EXor Gaia23bab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Episodic accretion is a fundamental process in the build-up of the stellar mass. EX Lupi-type eruptive young stars (EXors) represent one of the main types of episodic accretion. We study the recently discovered EXor Gaia23bab during its 2023 outburst. We obtained optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy to probe the variation of the physical properties of Gaia23bab during its recent outburst. We also collected archival photometry to study a previous outburst of the star. We used several accretion tracers, including the Ca II triplet, He I, and various hydrogen lines from the Paschen and Brackett series, to measure the accretion rate during the outburst. The accretion rate is consistent with $\sim 2.0 \times 10^{-7} M_\odot$ $\rm{yr}^{-1}$. Comparing the line fluxes of the hydrogen Brackett series to predictions of Case B theory suggests excitation temperatures of 5000 - 10000 K and electron densities of $10^9$-$10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Comparison to the predictions of a model for T Tauri stars revealed that the fluxes of the Balmer series are consistent with temperatures of 5000 - 12500 K and a hydrogen density of $10^8$ cm$^{-3}$, while the fluxes of the Paschen series are consistent with temperatures in the range between 10000 and 12500 K and a hydrogen density of $10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$. The derived temperatures and densities confirm that Gaia23bab is a prototypical EXor, not only due to its accretion rate, but also based on the best fit temperatures and densities revealed by the detected hydrogen lines.</description>

      <title>An interferometric study of B star multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars are extremely influential objects and multiplicity has the potential to dictate how they evolve over time by causing dynamical interactions, common-envelope evolution, mergers and more. While O-star multiplicity has been studied over a broad separation range, studies of B star multiplicity are lacking despite the fact that they dominate the production of core-collapse supernovae and neutron stars. We analyse interferometric data at high-angular resolution taken with PIONIER/VLTI for a sample of 32 B stars. Using parametric modelling of the closure phases and visibilities, we determine best-fit models to each of the systems and investigate whether each source is best represented by a single star or a higher-order system. Detection limits were calculated for companions to determine if they were significant. We then combined our findings from the interferometric data with results from a literature search to see if other companions were reported at different separation ranges. We find that, within the interferometric range, 72$\pm$8\% of the B stars are resolved as multiple systems. The most common type of system is a triple system, followed by binary systems, presumably single stars and then higher-order systems. The interferometric companion fraction derived for the sample is 1.88$\pm$0.24. When accounting for the spectroscopic companions confirmed in the literature and wide companions inferred from Gaia data in addition to companions we find with interferometry, multiplicity and companion fractions of 0.88$\pm$0.06 and 2.31$\pm$0.27 respectively are obtained for our sample. The number of triple systems in particular increases significantly when accounting for spectroscopic companions, suggesting that binarity and higher-order multiplicity are integral to the evolution of B stars, as they are for O stars.</description>

      <title>Photometric activity cycles in fast-rotating stars: Revisiting the reality of stellar activity cycle branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to detect activity cycles in young main-sequence stars, analogous to the 11-year solar cycle, using combined photometric survey data. This research will enhance our understanding of how cycle periods relate to rotation rates in fast-rotating stars. We measured activity cycles for 138 G-K-type main sequence stars using combined time-series photometry spanning ~14 years. The first set of 70 stars used data from Kepler Full Frame Images (FFIs)-ASAS-SN-ZTF, and the second set of 68 stars used data from Kepler-FFIs-ZTF. Additionally, we measured the activity cycles for 25 RS CVn candidates. For our sample, we analyzed the correlation or anti-correlation between flux variations and photospheric activity, which arises due to the presence of faculae or starspots. We identified fast-rotating K-type stars that are faculae-dominated by tracking spot or faculae evolution in Kepler RMS data. Our findings reveal that fast-rotating G-K-type stars show no strong correlation between cycle length and rotation period. Previous studies have identified active and inactive branches in the cycle-rotation diagram. However, we find that G-K-type stars do not show a clear trend aligning with the active branch, with 34 per cent of stars falling within the intermediate region between the two branches, where our Sun resides. Our results highlight that the proposed distinction between the two branches may not be as definitive as previously thought, particularly regarding the active branch. Furthermore, we also detected 23 per cent of young Sun-like stars in the intermediate region, where our Sun is located, implying that our Sun may not be unique in this regard.</description>

      <title>Linear analysis of shear-flow instabilities in a prominence-corona interface with ambipolar diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations have shown the presence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHi) in solar prominences. Effects due to partial ionization of the prominence plasma may influence the KHi onset. We study the triggering of the KHi in an interface model that consists of a partially ionized prominence region and a fully ionized coronal region, with a uniform magnetic field parallel to the interface. There is a longitudinal flow in the prominence region. The plasma is compressible and the role of ambipolar diffusion, which accounts for collisions between charges and neutrals, is taken into account in the prominence plasma. We derive the dispersion relation of linear perturbations on the interface and analyze some limit cases analytically. Numerical results are obtained for realistic prominence parameters. We find that compressibility and gas pressure are important in determining the unstable flow velocities, specially in the range of sub-Alfv\'enic flows that are consistent with the observations. The ambipolar diffusion has a generally destabilizing influence and reduces the threshold flow velocity for the KHi onset.</description>

      <title>Merging plasmoids and nanojet-like ejections in a coronal current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forced magnetic reconnection is triggered by external perturbations, which are ubiquitous in the solar corona. This process plays a crucial role in the energy release during solar transient events, which are often associated with electric current sheets (CSs). The CSs can often disintegrate through the development of the tearing instability, which may lead to the formation of plasmoids in the non-linear phase of evolution. However, the complexity of the dynamics, and the magnetic and thermodynamic evolution due to the coalescence of the plasmoids are not fully understood. We used a resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a 2.5D current layer embedded in a stratified medium in the solar corona, incorporating field-aligned thermal conduction. Multiple levels of adaptive mesh-refined grids are used to resolve the fine structures that result during the evolution of the system. The instability in the CS is triggered by imposing impulsive velocity perturbations concentrated at three different locations in the upper half along the CS plane; this leads to the formation of plasmoids and their later coalescence. We demonstrate that a transition from purely 2D reconnection to 2D reconnection with guide field takes place at the interface between the plasmoids as the latter evolve from the pre-merger to the merged state. The small-scale, short-lived, and collimated outflows during the merging process share various physical properties with the recently discovered nanojets. The subsequent thermodynamic change within and outside the merged plasmoid region is governed by the combined effect of Ohmic heating, thermal conduction, and expansion/contraction of the plasma. Our results imply that impulsive perturbations in coronal CSs can be the triggering agents for plasmoid coalescence, which leads to the subsequent magnetic, and thermodynamic change in and around the CS.</description>

      <title>Two More Bow Shocks and Off-Center Halpha Nebulae Associated with Nova-like Cataclysmic Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report discoveries of bow-shock nebulae, seen in Halpha and [O III] 5007, around two cataclysmic variables (CVs): LS Pegasi and ASASSN-V J205457.73+515731.9 (hereafter ASASJ2054). Additionally, both stars lie near the edges of faint extended Halpha-emitting nebulae. The orientations of the bow shocks are consistent with the directions of the objects' proper motions. The properties of LS Peg and ASASJ2054, and of their nebulae, are remarkably similar to those of SY Cancri, which we described in a recent paper; SY Cnc is a CV likewise associated with a bow shock and an off-center Halpha nebula. These objects join V341 Arae and BZ Camelopardalis, CVs that are also accompanied by similar nebulae. All five stars belong to the nova-like variable (NLV) subclass of CVs, characterized by luminous optically thick accretion disks that launch fast winds into the surrounding space. We suggest that the bow shocks and nebulae result from chance encounters of the NLVs with interstellar gas clouds, with the stars leaving in their wakes Stromgren zones that are recombining after being photoionized by the CVs' ultraviolet and X-ray radiation. Our discoveries illustrate the power of small telescopes equipped with modern instrumentation, and used to accumulate extremely long exposure times, for the detection of very low-surface-brightness nebulae.</description>

      <title>High-resolution radio observations of massive protostars in the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-resolution observations made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 5.5 GHz and 9.0 GHz of a sample of twenty-eight massive protostars. These protostars were initially detected at radio wavelengths in the MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey at 1.3 GHz, where they were unresolved with an angular resolution of approximately 8 arcseconds. The resolution of the ATCA observations at 5.5 GHz and 9.0 GHz are significantly higher at, 2.0 and 1.2 arc seconds, respectively. The highest angular resolution corresponds to a linear resolution of 1920 AU for our nearest object. This improvement in resolution enabled us to resolve the components of extended emission and to more accurately determine the nature of the objects. Approximately 80% of the detections were classified as jets with 68% of the jets found to be associated with non-thermal emission.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal Radio Emission from Massive Protostars in the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an investigation of the L-band emission from known massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) in the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey to search for non-thermal radio emitters in the sample. A total of 398 massive protostars, identified from the Red MSX Source (RMS) survey, are located within the survey region. Among these, 162 fields that host the protostars are isolated from nearby bright HII regions, allowing for the study of any ionized jets present. Seventy-one of these fields have jets with five-sigma detections or higher, corresponding to a detection rate of 44%. The MeerKAT fluxes of the detections, together with the upper limits of the non-detections and any other fluxes from previous observations, were used to estimate the spectral indices of the jets, and to search for the presence of non-thermal radiation. In cases where a source manifests as single in a given observation but is resolved into multiple components in observations of higher resolutions, the sum of the fluxes of the resolved components was used in estimating the indices. Any e!ects from missing flux in higher-resolution observations were incorporated into the index uncertainties. The spectral indices of the sample show that at least 50% of the jets emit non-thermal radiation. Additionally, the spectral energy distribution (SED) of some of the sources, as well as their radio luminosities exhibit evidence of non-thermal emission, especially in extended sources.</description>

      <title>The impact of rates of reactions with cosmic ray induced photons on chemical composition of protoplanetary discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays and cosmic ray induced photons are vital components of chemical evolution in areas of interstellar medium that are impenetrable by external ultraviolet radiation. However, rates of reactions with cosmic ray induced photons used in astrochemical models were calculated for molecular clouds and can be different in protoplanetary discs, where dust grows up to larger sizes. Using ANDES astrochemical model, we study how an increase in both upper dust size and rates of reactions with cosmic ray induced photons can influence species abundances in protoplanetary discs. We show that the increase in these reactions' rates has a significant impact on the ice mass fraction in area between 2 and 20 au but has little impact on ionisation degree in disc.</description>

      <title>Revisited parameters for the twin bulge globular clusters NGC 6528 and NGC 6553</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NGC 6528 and NGC 6553 are among the most metal-rich globular clusters in the Galactic bulge. They represent the upper end of the chemical enrichment in the Galaxy, and can inform on the processes of cluster formation and enrichment. We aim to refine the fundamental parameters of NGC 6528 and NGC 6553, based on proper motion-corrected Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 and ACS photometries. Methods. In order to derive the fundamental parameters age, distance, reddening, and the total-to-selective absorption coefficient, we employed a Bayesian isochrone fitting. Age and metallicity are mainly constrained by the turn-off morphology, thanks to the unprecedented quality of the proper-motion cleaned photometry. The two clusters show remarkably similar Colour-Magnitude Diagrams. We derived an age of 11+-0.5 Gyr with a solar metallicity for both clusters. The reddening for NGC 6528 and NGC 6553 is E(B-V) = 0.63 and 0.76 and the distances from the Sun are d = 7.85 and 5.1 kpc, respectively, recalling that distances strictly depend on the adopted total-to-selective absorption parameter. The age of these metal-rich clusters is about 2 Gyr younger than the moderately metal-poor bulge clusters. The ages and metallicities are remarkably identical to that of the bulk of bulge field stars.</description>

      <title>Toward A General Theory of Grain Alignment and Disruption by Radiative Torques and Magnetic Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment theory for general astrophysical environments described by a dimensionless parameter $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$ with $U$ local radiation strength, $n_{1}=n_{\rm H}/(10{\rm cm}^{-3})$ the hydrogen density, and $T_{2}=T_{\rm gas}/100{\rm K}$ the gas temperature. We first derive the critical magnetic relaxation $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ required to produce high-J attractors for different RAT models and local conditions and find that $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ must be larger for stronger radiation fields. We then numerically study the grain alignment and rotational disruption by the MRAT mechanism taking into account gas collisions and magnetic fluctuations. We find that, for the collision-dominated (CD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})\leq 1$), collisional and magnetic excitations can slowly transport large grains from low-J rotation to high-J attractors, leading to the perfect {\it slow alignment} within $\sim 10-100$ damping times due to MRATs. However, for the radiation-dominated (RD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;1$), only a fraction of grains can be fast aligned at high-J attractors by MRATs, and the majority of grains are trapped at low-J rotation due to strong radiative torques, a new effect we term {\it radiative torque (RAT) trapping}. For extreme radiation fields of $U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;10^{4}$, the efficiency of magnetic relaxation on grain alignment is suppressed, and grains only have fast alignment and disruption purely determined by RATs. We quantified the fraction of grains with fast alignment at high-J attractors, $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$, for different RAT models, magnetic relaxation, and $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$, and found that the maximum $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$ can reach $45\%$ by MRATs and $22\%$ by RATs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One in every two atoms in the Earth, Mars, and the Moon is oxygen; it is the third most abundant element in the solar system. The oxygen isotopic compositions of the terrestrial planets are different from those of the Sun and demonstrate that these planets are not direct compositional analogs of the solar photosphere. Likewise, the Suns O/Fe, Fe/Mg and Mg/Si values are distinct from those of inner solar system chondrites and terrestrial planets. These four elements (O, Fe, Mg, Si) make up about 94% by mass of the rocky planets and their abundances are determined uniquely using geophysical, geochemical and cosmochemical constraints. The rocky planets grew rapidly from planetesimals, most of which were differentiated, having a core and a mantle, before being accreted. Planetary growth in the early stages of protoplanetary disk evolution was rapid and was only partially recorded by the meteoritic record. The noncarbonaceous meteorites (NC) provide insights into the early history of the inner solar system and are used to construct a framework for how the rocky planets were assembled. NC chondrites have chondrule ages that are two to three million years younger than t_zero (the age of calcium-aluminum inclusions, CAI), documenting that chondrites are middle- to late-stage products of solar system evolution. The composition of the Earth, its current form of mantle convection, and the amount of radiogenic power that drives its engine remain controversial topics. Earths dynamics are driven by primordial and radiogenic heat sources. Measurement of the Earths geoneutrino flux defines its radiogenic power and restricts its bulk composition. Using the latest data from the KamLAND and Borexino geoneutrino experiments affirms that the Earth has 20 TW of radiogenic power and sets the proportions of refractory lithophile elements in the bulk silicate Earth at 2.5 to 2.7 times that in CI chondrites.</description>

      <title>The circumstellar environment around the extreme Galactic red supergiant NML Cygni: Dense, dusty, and asymmetric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova observations imply the presence of a dense and asymmetric circumstellar environment around SN Type II progenitors, whereas the mass loss from these progenitors, namely, red supergiants, is still poorly constrained. We aim to characterise the dust and gas in the circumstellar environment of the extreme Galactic red supergiant \nmlcyg in terms of mass, morphology, and kinematics. Based on interferometric observations with NOEMA at 230 GHz we estimated dust masses and temperatures, and measured the extent and morphological complexity of the circumstellar environment. We detected two strong continuum components, amounting to an estimated total dust mass of $\sim2\times10^{-3}M_{\odot}$ located out to ~2000 AU from the star, largely beyond the dust detected at optical/infrared wavelengths. The extent of the detected CO emission supports the notion that the outflow is formed by a mass-loss rate of several $10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$/year and that it is not primarily shaped by extreme irradiation from the Cyg OB2 cluster it has been associated with. We have detected, but not resolved, previously unseen high-velocity components close to the star. The observations reveal a very complex circumstellar morphology and we propose that some of the detected components could be the imprint of a hitherto unknown binary companion.</description>

      <title>Freely propagating flanks of wide coronal-mass-ejection-driven shocks: Modelling and observational insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Widespread solar energetic particle (SEP) events remain poorly understood phenomena in space weather. These events are often linked to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their shocks, but the mechanisms governing their global particle distribution remain debated. The 13 March 2023 event is particularly notable as a widespread SEP event associated with an exceptionally fast interplanetary shock. With speeds of up to 3000 km/s, it is one of the most extreme shocks observed in recent years.
  We aim to investigate whether the flanks of a wide CME-driven shock can decouple from the CME and continue propagating as freely propagating shock waves. If shocks are the primary SEP source, such a mechanism could help explain some of the widest SEP events.
  Using EUHFORIA, a 3D magnetohydrodynamic heliospheric model, we simulated the evolution of wide CME-driven shocks. We modified the model to allow direct shock injection at the inner boundary, upstream of the CME ejecta. Applying this to the 13 March 2023 event, we modelled two simultaneous CMEs whose shocks form a single, wide shock envelope that spans 280{\deg} in longitude. We then compared our results to in situ observations.
  Our simulations show that the flanks of wide CME shocks can persist as freely propagating waves beyond 2 au. For the 13 March 2023 event, the modelled shock arrival times and amplitudes of associated plasma parameters (e.g. speed and density) show good agreement with observations from various spacecraft distributed across different radial distances and longitudes. Furthermore, the combined shock structure expands into a quasi-circumsolar wave as it propagates outwards.
  These findings indicate that the shock flanks of fast CMEs can persist for a long time, supporting the idea that such freely propagating shock flanks play a key role in the global distribution of SEPs in widespread events.</description>

      <title>Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES). IV. Synergy between astrometry and direct imaging missions of the Habitable World Observatory for detecting Earth-like planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection and characterization of habitable planets around nearby stars persist as one of the foremost objectives in contemporary astrophysics. This work investigates the synergistic integration of astrometric and direct imaging techniques by capitalizing on the complementary capabilities of the Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) and Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Planetary brightness and position vary over time due to phase effects and orbital architectures, information that can be precisely provided by CHES's astrometric measurements. By combining the precise orbital constraints from CHES with the imaging capabilities of HWO, we evaluate the improvements in detection efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio and overall planet yield. Completeness is quantified as the fraction of injected planets that are successfully detected, while yields are estimated for various scenarios using terrestrial planet occurrence rates derived from the Kepler dataset. Our results indicate that prior astrometric data significantly enhance detection efficiency. Under the adopted detection limit, our analysis indicates that prior CHES observations can increase completeness by approximately 10% and improve detection efficiency by factors ranging from two to thirty. The findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in the search for and characterization of habitable worlds.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in magnetars: Exploring type-I and type-II states in toroidal magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first two-dimensional general-relativistic analysis of superconducting regions in axially symmetric highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar) models with toroidal magnetic fields. We investigate the topology and distribution of type-II and type-I superconducting regions for varying toroidal magnetic field strengths and stellar masses by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations using the XNS code. Our results reveal that the outer cores of low- to intermediate-mass magnetars sustain superconductivity over larger regions compared to higher-mass stars with non-trivial distribution of type-II and type-I regions. Consistent with previous one-dimensional (1D) models, we find that regardless of the gravitational mass, the inner cores of magnetars with toroidal magnetic fields are devoid of $S$-wave proton superconductivity. Furthermore, these models contain non-superconducting, torus-shaped regions - a novel feature absent in previous 1D studies. Finally, we speculate on the potential indirect effects of superconductivity on continuous gravitational wave emissions from millisecond pulsars, such as PSR J1843-1113, highlighting their relevance for future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

Abstract: Binary stars are dynamical systems formed by two stars that are physically bound by the gravitational force. Binary stars are privileged laboratories, allowing one to measure the fundamental properties of stars but also potentially changing the way stars live and die. Because of this, binary stars have continuously played a central role in astrophysics. In this chapter, we focus on the observational properties of binary stars. What are the fundamental quantities that describe binaries? How do we detect and classify them? Which parameters can we constrain for different type of objects?</description>

      <title>Seismic constraints on the spin evolution of slowly rotating young intermediate-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\delta$ Scuti stars are hot, rapid rotators and are a poorly understood class of pulsators. Asteroseismology provides the only means with which to probe their interior dynamics. However, their complex and unexplained oscillation patterns restrict analyses to only a small fraction with interpretable pulsations. Here, we identify 5381 $\delta$ Scuti stars from 63 sectors of TESS observations, of which 300 had interpretable oscillations, with 24 showing rotational splittings. We inferred compositions and ages ($\tau$) for the 300 stars finding them in near-ZAMS states (Bedding et al. 2020), and measured the mean envelope rotation rates ($&lt; f_{rot} &gt;$) for 24 of them. Analyzing their age-dependent rotation, we found these stars essentially exhibit weak-to-no spindown, while evolving past the ZAMS across a narrow time-span during which they show regular pulsations. A quantitative fit to their spin-evolution results in a trend $f_{rot} (d^{-1}) \propto (\tau/{Gyr})^{-0.048 \pm 0.016}$, much slower than the spindown of cooler late-type stars due to magnetic braking (Skumanich's law: $f_{rot} (d^{-1}) \propto (\tau/{Gyr})^{-0.5}$). Based on stellar evolution calculations, we show this weak spindown is consistent with the gradual increase in their moment-of-inertia.</description>

      <title>Hidden Population III Descendants in Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elusive properties of the first (Pop III) stars can be indirectly unveiled by uncovering their true descendants. To this aim, we exploit our data-calibrated model for the best-studied ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy, Bo\"otes I, which tracks the chemical evolution (from carbon to zinc) of individual stars from their formation to the present day. We explore the chemical imprint of Pop III supernovae (SNe), with different explosion energies and masses, showing that they leave distinct chemical signatures in their descendants. We find that UFDs are strongly affected by SNe-driven feedback resulting in a very low fraction of metals retained by their gravitational potential well ($&lt;2.5\%$). Furthermore, the higher the Pop III SN explosion energy, the lower the fraction of metals retained. Thus, the probability to find descendants of energetic Pair Instability SNe is extremely low in these systems. Conversely, UFDs are ideal cosmic laboratories to identify the fingerprints of less massive and energetic Pop III SNe through their [X/Fe] abundance ratios. Digging into the literature data of Bo\"otes I, we uncover three hidden candidates for Pop III descendants: one mono-enriched and two multi-enriched. These stars show the chemical signature of Pop III SNe in the mass range $[20-65] \rm M_{\odot}$, spanning a wide range in explosion energies $[0.3- 10]10^{51}$ erg. In conclusion, candidates for Pop III descendants are hidden in ancient UFDs but those mono-enriched by a single Pop III SN are extremely rare. Thus, self-consistent models such as the one presented here are required to uncover these precious fossils and probe the properties of the first Pop III supernovae.</description>

      <title>X-ray Thomson scattering studies on spin-singlet stabilization of highly compressed H-like Be ions heated to two million degrees Kelvin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experiments at the US National Ignition Facility (NIF) [D\"{o}ppner et al., Nature {\bf 618}, 270-275 (2023)] have created highly compressed hot hydrogen-like Be plasmas. Published analyses of the the NIF experiment have used finite-$T$ multi-atom density-functional theory (DFT) with Molecular dynamics (MD), and Path-Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations. These methods are very expensive to implement and often lack physical transparency. Here we (i) relate their results to simpler first-principles average-atom results, (ii) establish the feasibility of rapid data analysis, with good accuracy and gain in physical transparency, and (iii) show that the NIF experiment reveals high-$T$ spin-singlet pairing of hydrogen-like Be ions with near neighbours. Our analysis predicts such stabilization over a wide range of compressed densities for temperatures close to two million Kelvin. Calculations of structure factors $S(k)$ for electrons or ions, the Raleigh weight and other quantities of interest to X-ray Thomson scattering are presented. We find that the NIF data at the scattering wavevector $k_{sc}$ of 7.89 \AA$^{-1}$ are more consistent with a density of $20\pm2$ g/cm$^3$, mean ionization $\bar{Z}=$3.25, at a temperature of $\simeq$ 1,800,000 K than the 34 g/cm$^3, \bar{Z}=3.4$ proposed by the NIF team. The relevance of ion-electron coupled-modes in studying small $k_{sc}$ data is indicated.</description>

      <title>Radial Oscillations of the HESS J1731-347 Compact Object via the Karmarkar Condition in Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model the light HESS J1731-347 compact object (of known stellar mass and radius) within Einstein's General Relativity imposing the Karmarkar condition in gravity for anisotropic stars. The three free parameters of the analytic solution are determined imposing the matching conditions at the surface of the star for objects of known stellar mass and radius. Finally, using well established criteria it is shown that the solution is compatible with all requirements for well behaved and realistic solutions. Furthermore, we study the radial oscillation modes, and we compare to the ones corresponding to an isotropic star modeled by the Tolman IV exact analytic solution obtained long time ago. A comparison between the large frequency separations is made as well.</description>
