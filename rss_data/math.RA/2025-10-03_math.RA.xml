      <title>Wronskians as $N$-ary brackets in finite-dimensional analogues of $sl(2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wronskian determinants (for coefficients of higher-order differential operators on the affine real line or circle) satisfy the table of Jacobi-type quadratic identities for strong homotopy Lie algebras -- i.e. for a particular case of $L_\infty$-deformations -- for the Lie algebra of vector fields on that one-dimensional affine manifold. We show that the standard realisation of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ by quadratic-coefficient vector fields is the bottom structure in a sequence of finite-dimensional polynomial algebras $\Bbbk_N[x]$ with the Wronskians as $N$-ary brackets; the structure constants are calculated explicitly.
  Key words: Wronskian determinant, $N$-ary bracket, $L_\infty$-\/algebra, strong homotopy Lie algebra, $sl(2)$, Witt algebra, Vandermonde determinant.</description>

      <title>Multilinear nilalgebras and the Jacobian theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a symmetric multilinear algebra is weakly nil, then it is Engel. This result may be regarded as an infinite-dimensional analogue of the well-known Jacobian theorem, which states that if a polynomial mapping has a polynomial inverse, then its Jacobian matrix is invertible. This refines a theorem of Gerstenhaber and partially answers a question posed by Dotsenko.</description>

      <title>On the Orthogonal Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any ${\rm E}$-rigid presentation $e$, we construct an orthogonal projection functor to ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$ left adjoint to the natural embedding. We establish a bijection between presentations in ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$ and presentations compatible with $e$. For quivers with potentials, we show that ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$ forms a module category of another quiver with potential. We derive mutation formulas for the $\delta$-vectors of positive and negative complements and the dimension vectors of simple modules in ${\rm rep}(e^\perp)$, enabling an algorithm to find the projected quiver with potential. Additionally, we introduce a modified projection for quivers with potentials that preserves general presentations. For applications to cluster algebras, we establish a connection to the stabilization functors.</description>

      <title>On Algebraic Approaches for DNA Codes with Multiple Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA strings and their properties are widely studied since last 20 years due to its applications in DNA computing. In this area, one designs a set of DNA strings (called DNA code) which satisfies certain thermodynamic and combinatorial constraints such as reverse constraint, reverse-complement constraint, $GC$-content constraint and Hamming constraint. However recent applications of DNA codes in DNA data storage resulted in many new constraints on DNA codes such as avoiding tandem repeats constraint (a generalization of non-homopolymer constraint) and avoiding secondary structures constraint. Therefore, in this chapter, we introduce DNA codes with recently developed constraints. In particular, we discuss reverse, reverse-complement, $GC$-content, Hamming, uncorrelated-correlated, thermodynamic, avoiding tandem repeats and avoiding secondary structures constraints. DNA codes are constructed using various approaches such as algebraic, computational, and combinatorial. In particular, in algebraic approaches, one uses a finite ring and a map to construct a DNA code. Most of such approaches does not yield DNA codes with high Hamming distance. In this chapter, we focus on algebraic constructions using maps (usually an isometry on some finite ring) which yields DNA codes with high Hamming distance. We focus on non-cyclic DNA codes. We briefly discuss various metrics such as Gau distance, Non-Homopolymer distance etc. We discuss about algebraic constructions of families of DNA codes that satisfy multiple constraints and/or properties. Further, we also discuss about algebraic bounds on DNA codes with multiple constraints. Finally, we present some open research directions in this area.</description>

      <title>Algebraic singular functions are not always dense in the ideal of $C^*$-singular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give the first examples of \'etale (non-Hausdorff) groupoids $\mathcal G$ whose $C^*$-algebras contain singular elements that cannot be approximated by singular elements in $\mathcal C_c(\mathcal G)$. We provide two examples: one is a bundle of groups, and the other a minimal and effective groupoid constructed from a self-similar action on an infinite alphabet. Moreover, we also prove that the Baum--Connes assembly map for the first example is not surjective, not even on the level of its essential $C^*$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Centers of Endomorphism Rings and Reflexivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a local ring and let $M$ be a finitely generated $R$-module. Appealing to the natural left module structure of $M$ over its endomorphism ring and corresponding center $Z(\operatorname{End}_R(M))$, we study when various homological properties of $M$ are sufficient to force $M$ to have a nonzero free summand. Consequences of our work include a partial converse to a well-known result of Lindo describing $Z(\operatorname{End}_R(M))$ when $M$ is faithful and reflexive, as well as some applications to the famous Huneke-Wiegand conjecture.</description>

      <title>Simple solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study simple set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation that are finite and non-degenerate. Such retractable solutions are fully described and to investigate the irretracble solutions we give a new algebraic method. Our approach includes and extends the work of Joyce for quandles and Castelli for involutive solutions, demonstrating that the simplicity of a solution can be understood through its associated permutation skew left brace. In particular, we show that this skew left brace must have the smallest non-zero ideal, and the quotient by this ideal gives a trivial skew left brace of cyclic type; clearly all simple skew left braces satisfy these assumptions. As an application of our approach we construct and characterise new infinite families of simple solutions that are neither involutive nor quandles. Additionally, we show that our method can be applied to simple skew left braces to generate further families of simple solutions.</description>

      <title>Contraderived categories of CDG-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07021v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any CDG-ring $B^\bullet=(B^*,d,h)$, we show that the homotopy category of graded-projective (left) CDG-modules over $B^\bullet$ is equivalent to the quotient category of the homotopy category of graded-flat CDG-modules by its full triangulated subcategory of flat CDG-modules. The contraderived category (in the sense of Becker) $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bctr}}(B^\bullet{-}\mathbf{Mod})$ is the common name for these two triangulated categories. We also prove that the classes of cotorsion and graded-cotorsion CDG-modules coincide, and the contraderived category of CDG-modules is equivalent to the homotopy category of graded-flat graded-cotorsion CDG-modules. Assuming the graded ring $B^*$ to be graded right coherent, we show that the contraderived category $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bctr}}(B^\bullet{-}\mathbf{Mod})$ is compactly generated and its full subcategory of compact objects is anti-equivalent to the full subcategory of compact objects in the coderived category of right CDG-modules $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bco}}(\mathbf{Mod}{-}B^\bullet)$. Specifically, the latter triangulated category is the idempotent completion of the absolute derived category of finitely presented right CDG-modules $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{abs}}(\mathbf{mod}{-}B^\bullet)$.</description>

      <title>Determinant, Characteristic Polynomial, and Inverse in Commutative Analogues of Clifford Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commutative analogues of Clifford algebras are algebras defined in the same way as Clifford algebras except that their generators commute with each other, in contrast to Clifford algebras in which the generators anticommute. In this paper, we solve the problem of finding multiplicative inverses in commutative analogues of Clifford algebras by introducing a matrix representation for these algebras and the notion of determinant in them. We give a criteria for checking if an element has a multiplicative inverse or not and, for the first time, explicit formulas for multiplicative inverses in the case of arbitrary dimension. The new theorems involve only operations of conjugation and do not involve matrix operations. We also consider notions of trace and other characteristic polynomial coefficients and give explicit formulas for them without using matrix representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider four types of subvarieties of the variety of associative algebras. We study these subvarieties from the point of view of operads and show their connections with well-known classes of algebras, such as dendriform algebras and noncommutative Novikov algebras. Finally, we define the commutator and anti-commutator operations on these algebras and derive several identities satisfied by these operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hopf braces are the quantum analogues of skew braces and, as such, their cocommutative counterparts provide solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We investigate various properties of categories related to Hopf braces. In particular, we prove that the category of Hopf braces is accessible while the category of cocommutative Hopf braces is even locally presentable. We also show that functors forgetting multiple antipodes and/or multiplications down to coalgebras are monadic. Colimits in the category of cocommutative Hopf braces are described explicitly and a free cocommutative Hopf brace on an arbitrary cocommutative Hopf algebra is constructed.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Technique for the Wedderburn Decomposition of Rational Group Algebras of Nested GVZ $p$-groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a combinatorial formula for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups, where $p$ is an odd prime. Using this formula, we derive an explicit combinatorial expression for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of all two-generator $p$-groups of class $2$. Additionally, we provide explicit combinatorial formulas for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of certain families of nested GVZ $p$-groups with arbitrarily large nilpotency class. We also classify all nested GVZ $p$-groups of order at most $p^5$ and compute the Wedderburn decomposition of their rational group algebras. Finally, we determine a complete set of primitive central idempotents for the rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups.</description>
