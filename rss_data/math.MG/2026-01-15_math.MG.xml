      <title>A general collapsing result for families of stratified Riemannian metrics on orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proves a general collapsing result for families of stratified Riemannian metrics $\widehat{g}^\mu$ on a compact orbifold $E$, subject to suitable limiting conditions on the metrics $\widehat{g}^\mu$ as $\mu \to \infty$. The result is distinct from similar theorems in the literature since it does not require bounds on curvature or injectivity radius of $\left(E,\widehat{g}^\mu\right)$ and thus allows for Gromov-Hausdorff limits of $\left(E,\widehat{g}^\mu\right)$ which have strictly lower dimension than $E$. The paper also introduces and studies a new class of stratified fibrations between orbifolds, termed weak submersions, and new classes of geometric structures on orbifolds, termed stratified Riemannian metrics, stratified Riemannian semi-metrics and stratified quasi-Finslerian structures, all of which play a key role in the proof of the main theorem.</description>

      <title>Unboundedness above of the Hitchin functional on $\mathrm{G}_2$ 3-forms and associated collapsing results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper uses scaling arguments to prove the unboundedness above of the Hitchin functional on closed $\mathrm{G}_2$ 3-forms for two explicit closed 7-manifolds. The first manifold is the product $X \times S^1$ (where $X$ is the Nakamura manifold constructed by de Bartolomeis-Tomassini) equipped with a 4-dimensional family of closed $\mathrm{G}_2$ 3-forms and is inspired by a short paper of Fern\'{a}ndez. The second is the manifold recently constructed by Fern\'{a}ndez-Fino-Kovalev-Mu\~{n}oz. In the latter example, careful resolution of singularities is required, in order to ensure that the rescaled forms are cohomologically constant. By combining suitable geometric estimates with a general collapsing theorem for orbifolds recently obtained by the author, explicit descriptions of the large volume limits of both manifolds are also obtained. The proofs in this paper are notable for not requiring explicit solution of the Laplacian flow evolution PDE for closed $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures, thereby allowing treatment of manifolds which lack the high degree of symmetry generally required for Laplacian flow to be explicitly soluble.</description>

      <title>Sturmian lattices and Aperiodic tile sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit algorithm to construct aperiodic tile sets based on Sturmian words of quadratic slopes. The method works for any quadratic irrational slope, and we can produce infinitely many aperiodic tile sets whose underlying scaling constant is a unit of any real quadratic field. There are two key ingredients in our construction. The first one is ``Sturmian lattices''; an interesting grid structure generated by Sturmian words that emerged in an aperiodic monotile called Smith Turtle. We shall give a classification of Sturmian lattices. The second is the bounded displacement equivalence of Delone sets, which plays a central role in this construction.</description>
