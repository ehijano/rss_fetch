      <title>Markov chains and mappings of distributions on compact spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a compact metric space $S$ and a pair $(j,k)$ with $k \ge 2$ and $1 \le j \le k$. For any probability distribution $\theta \in P(S)$, define a Markov chain on $S$ by: from state $s$, take $k$ i.i.d. ($\theta$) samples, and jump to the $j$'th closest. Such a chain converges in distribution to a unique stationary distribution, say $\pi_{j,k}(\theta)$. So this defines a mapping $\pi_{j,k}: P(S) \to P(S)$. What happens when we iterate this mapping? In particular, what are the fixed points of this mapping? We present a few rigorous results, to complement our extensive simulation study elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Reptile trapezoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A geometric figure is a reptile if it can be dissected into at least two similar copies congruent to each other. We prove that if a trapezoid is a reptile and not a parallelogram, then the length of each base is a linear combination of the lengths of its legs with rational coefficients. We then rule out isosceles trapezoids and right trapezoids which are not reptile. In particular, we prove that, up to similarity, there are at most six reptile right trapezoids, not a parallelogram, whose acute internal angle is a rational multiple of $\pi$. Finally, we present a rep-25 right trapezoid that is not a parallelogram and is not similar to any of the known reptile trapezoids.</description>

      <title>Hurewicz and Dranishnikov-Smith theorems for asymptotic dimension of countable approximate groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish two main results for the asymptotic dimension of countable approximate groups. The first one is a Hurewicz type formula for a global morphism of countable approximate groups $f:(\Xi, \Xi^\infty) \to (\Lambda, \Lambda^\infty)$, stating that $\mathrm{asdim} \Xi \leq \mathrm{asdim} \Lambda +\mathrm{asdim} ([\mathrm{ker} f]_c)$. This is analogous to the Dranishnikov-Smith result for groups, and is relying on another Hurewicz type formula we prove, using a 6-local morphism instead of a global one. The second result is similar to the Dranishnikov-Smith theorem stating that, for a countable group $G$, $\mathrm{asdim} G$ is equal to the supremum of asymptotic dimensions of finitely generated subgroups of $G$. Our version states that, if $(\Lambda, \Lambda^\infty)$ is a countable approximate group, then $\mathrm{asdim} \Lambda$ is equal to the supremum of asymptotic dimensions of approximate subgroups of finitely generated subgroups of $\Lambda^\infty$, with these approximate subgroups contained in $\Lambda^2$.</description>

      <title>Quadruple Inequalities: Between Cauchy-Schwarz and Triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a set of inequalities that interpolate the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the triangle inequality. Every nondecreasing, convex function with a concave derivative induces such an inequality. They hold in any metric space that satisfies a metric version of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, including all CAT(0) spaces and, in particular, all Euclidean spaces. Because these inequalities establish relations between the six distances of four points, we call them quadruple inequalities. In this context, we introduce the quadruple constant - a real number that quantifies the distortion of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by a given function. Additionally, for inner product spaces, we prove an alternative, more symmetric version of the quadruple inequalities, which generalizes the parallelogram law.</description>

      <title>Roe algebras of coarse spaces via coarse geometric modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a construction of Roe (C*-)algebras of general coarse spaces in terms of coarse geometric modules. This extends the classical theory of Roe algebras of metric spaces and gives a unified framework to deal with either uniform or non-uniform Roe algebras, algebras of operators of controlled propagation, and algebras of quasi-local operators; both in the metric and general coarse geometric setting. The key new definitions are that of coarse geometric module and coarse support of operators between coarse geometric modules. These let us construct natural bridges between coarse geometry and operator algebras.
  We then study the general structure of Roe-like algebras, and investigate several structural properties, such as admitting Cartan subalgebras or computing their intersection with the compact operators. Lastly, we prove that assigning to a coarse space the K-theory groups of its Roe algebra(s) is a natural functorial operation.</description>
