      <title>A hyperplane Ham Sandwich theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a direct proof of a result due to Karasev (2008), Karasev-Matschke (2014) and Schnider-Sober\'on (2023). Given $m+1$ Borel probability measures on the space of affine hyperplanes in a real vector space $V$ of dimension $m+1$, there exist a line $L$ through the origin in $V$ and a point $v\in L$ such that at least half of the hyperplanes, as counted by any of the measures, meet or are parallel to each of the two closed rays in $L$ meeting at $v$.</description>

      <title>Eighth problem of the Arnold trivium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a full and detailed solution of eighth Arnold's trivium problem. We find critical points of a smooth function on a given one-parametric two-dimensional surface with Lagrange multipliers method. Basic Morse theory and Poincare-Hopf theorem makes it possible to determine a genus of this surface and gives a beautiful training example of Morse surgery on a two-dimensional surface of genus $g = 6$.</description>

      <title>Solutions of tetrahedron equation from quantum cluster algebra associated with symmetric butterfly quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>

      <title>Generating the Goeritz group of $S^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.10613v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1980 J. Powell \cite{Po} proposed that five specific elements sufficed to generate the Goeritz group for any genus Heegaard splitting of the 3-sphere. Here we prove that a natural expansion of Powell's proposed generators, to include all eyeglass twists and all topological conjugates of Powell's generators does suffice.</description>

      <title>Protocorks and monopole Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13319v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a class of compact 4-manifolds with boundary that we call protocorks. Any exotic pair of simply connected closed 4-manifolds is related by a protocork twist, moreover, any cork is supported by a protocork. We prove a theorem on the relative Seiberg-Witten invariants of a protocork before and after twisting and a splitting theorem on the Floer homology of protocork boundaries. As a corollary we improve a theorem by Morgan and Szab\'{o} regarding the variation of Seiberg-Witten invariants with an upper bound which depends only on the topology of the data. Moreover, we generalize the result that only the reduced Floer homology of a cork boundary contributes to the variation of the Seiberg-Witten invariants under a cork twist to more general cut and paste operations where the pieces involved are $1$-connected and homeomorphic relative to the boundary.</description>

      <title>Action of the Mazur pattern up to topological concordance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the '80s, Freedman showed that the Whitehead doubling operator acts trivally up to topological concordance. On the other hand, Akbulut showed that the Whitehead doubling operator acts nontrivially up to smooth concordance. The Mazur pattern is a natural candidate for a satellite operator which acts by the identity up to topological but not smooth concordance. Recently there has been a resurgence of study of the action of the Mazur pattern up to concordance in the smooth and topological categories. Examples showing that the Mazur pattern does not act by the identity up to smooth concordance have been given by Cochran-Franklin-Hedden-Horn and Collins. In this paper, we give evidence that the Mazur pattern acts by the identity up to topological concordance.
  In particular, we show that two satellite operators $P_{K_0,\eta_0}$ and $P_{K_1,\eta_1}$ with $\eta_0$ and $\eta_1$ freely homotopic have the same action on the topological concordance group modulo the subgroup of $(1)$-solvable knots, which gives evidence that they act in the same way up to topological concordance. In particular, the Mazur pattern and the identity operator are related in this way, and so this is evidence for the topological side of the analogy to the Whitehead doubling operator. We give additional evidence that they have the same action on the full topological concordance group by showing that up to topological concordance they cannot be distinguished by Casson-Gordon signatures or metabelian $\rho$-invariants.</description>

      <title>Homological representations of low genus mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite group $G$ acting on a surface $S$, the centralizer of G in the mapping class group $\textrm{Mod}(S)$ has a natural representation given by its action on the homology $H_1(S; \mathbb{Q})$. We consider the question of whether this representation has arithmetic image. Several authors have given positive and negative answers to this question. We give a complete answer when S has genus at most 3.</description>

      <title>Simple Braids Tend toward Positive Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple braid is a positive braid that can be drawn so that any two strands cross at most once. We prove that as $n \to \infty$, the proportion of simple braids on $n$ strands that have positive topological entropy tends toward $100\%$. Notably, such braids are either pseudo-Anosov or reducible with a pseudo-Anosov component. Our proof involves a method of reduction from simple braids to non-simple $3$-strand braids that may be of independent interest.</description>
