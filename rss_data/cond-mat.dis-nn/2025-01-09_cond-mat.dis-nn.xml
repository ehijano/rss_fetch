      <title>The unbearable lightness of Restricted Boltzmann Machines: Theoretical Insights and Biological Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machines are simple yet powerful neural networks. They can be used for learning structure in data, and are used as a building block of more complex neural architectures. At the same time, their simplicity makes them easy to use, amenable to theoretical analysis, yielding interpretable models in applications. Here, we focus on reviewing the role that the activation functions, describing the input-output relationship of single neurons in RBM, play in the functionality of these models. We discuss recent theoretical results on the benefits and limitations of different activation functions. We also review applications to biological data analysis, namely neural data analysis, where RBM units are mostly taken to have sigmoid activation functions and binary units, to protein data analysis and immunology where non-binary units and non-sigmoid activation functions have recently been shown to yield important insights into the data. Finally, we discuss open problems addressing which can shed light on broader issues in neural network research.</description>

      <title>Interaction-enhanced many-body localization in a 1D quasiperiodic model with long-range hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the many-body localization (MBL) transition in an 1D exactly solvable system with long-range hopping and quasiperiodic on-site potential introduced in Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 186303 (2023). Unlike other disorder or quasiperiodic model, an interaction-enhanced MBL happens in the moderate interaction regime, which is dubbed as the interaction-enhanced MBL. This counterintuitive phenomenon can be understood by noticing the fragility of the critical band lying at the bottom of the spectrum. The fragile band is localized by other localized states once the interaction is turned on. This mechanism can be verified by introducing a mean-field theory description which can derive highly excited states with high accuracy. The effectiveness of this mean-field theory is captured by the quasihole physics, validated by the particle entanglement spectra.</description>

      <title>Controlled probing of Anderson localization and non-Hermitian skin effect via topolectrical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Anderson localization (AL) and the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) are two distinct wavefunction-localization phenomena arising out of disorder and non-reciprocity, respectively. An integration of both in a single framework will provide a platform to study the interplay between the two. In this connection, we consider the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'e (AA) model, which has garnered significant attention among the disordered models due to its self-dual properties. Hence, we investigate a non-reciprocal AA model with complex phase modulation and implement it in suitably designed topolectrical circuits featuring an interface, segregating two non-equivalent circuit networks. In the circuit, the voltage profile localizes at the interface due to the NHSE, while the AL limits localization phenomena within the vicinity of the excitation node. This competing phenomenon leads to a controllable, node-dependent localization or even partial delocalization of the output voltage. Our results not only provide a practical platform for experimentally studying and controlling the wave localization phenomenon but also highlight the potential of circuit architectures in designing highly sensitive sensors and information transfer in communication devices.</description>

      <title>Global network control from local information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the classical control of network systems, the control actions on a node are determined as a function of the states of all nodes in the network. Motivated by applications where the global state cannot be reconstructed in real time due to limitations in the collection, communication, and processing of data, here we introduce a control approach in which the control actions can be computed as a function of the states of the nodes within a limited state information neighborhood. The trade-off between the control performance and the size of this neighborhood is primarily determined by the condition number of the controllability Gramian. Our theoretical results are supported by simulations on regular and random networks and are further illustrated by an application to the control of power-grid synchronization. We demonstrate that for well-conditioned Gramians, there is no significant loss of control performance as the size of the state information neighborhood is reduced, allowing efficient control of large networks using only local information.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired Embeddings Projection and Similarity Metrics for Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, representation learning, which embeds complex information extracted from large amounts of data into dense vector spaces, has emerged as a key technique in machine learning. Among other applications, it has been a key building block for large language models and advanced computer vision systems based on contrastive learning. A core component of representation learning systems is the projection head, which maps the original embeddings into different, often compressed spaces, while preserving the similarity relationship between vectors.
  In this paper, we propose a quantum-inspired projection head that includes a corresponding quantum-inspired similarity metric. Specifically, we map classical embeddings onto quantum states in Hilbert space and introduce a quantum circuit-based projection head to reduce embedding dimensionality. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we extended the BERT language model by integrating our projection head for embedding compression. We compared the performance of embeddings, which were compressed using our quantum-inspired projection head, with those compressed using a classical projection head on information retrieval tasks using the TREC 2019 and TREC 2020 Deep Learning benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our quantum-inspired method achieves competitive performance relative to the classical method while utilizing 32 times fewer parameters. Furthermore, when trained from scratch, it notably excels, particularly on smaller datasets. This work not only highlights the effectiveness of the quantum-inspired approach but also emphasizes the utility of efficient, ad hoc low-entanglement circuit simulations within neural networks as a powerful quantum-inspired technique.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Discovery of Vanadium Oxide Compositions: A WGAN-VAE Framework for Materials Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of novel materials with tailored electronic properties is crucial for advancing modern device technologies, yet traditional approaches rely on time-consuming empirical methods. We present an inverse design framework combining enhanced Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with specialized Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to accelerate stable vanadium oxide (V-O) discovery for electronic applications. Our framework introduces a WGAN architecture with integrated stability constraints and formation energy predictions, plus a refined VAE utilizing voxel-based representation that captures atomic positions and lattice parameters while maintaining chemical validity. Applying this framework, we generated 451 unique V-O compositions, with 91 structures identified as stable and 44 as metastable under rigorous thermodynamic criteria, including novel V2O3 configurations below the Materials Project convex hull. Electronic structure analysis using spin-polarized DFT+U calculations revealed distinct electronic behaviors, including promising half-metallic characteristics for spintronics and quantum computing applications. Our approach achieves approximately 20% stability rate under strict criteria compared to previous benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness for accelerated materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Learning by Confusion: The Phase Diagram of the Holstein Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.</description>

      <title>Structure of activity in multiregion recurrent neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural circuits comprise multiple interconnected regions, each with complex dynamics. The interplay between local and global activity is thought to underlie computational flexibility, yet the structure of multiregion neural activity and its origins in synaptic connectivity remain poorly understood. We investigate recurrent neural networks with multiple regions, each containing neurons with random and structured connections. Inspired by experimental evidence of communication subspaces, we use low-rank connectivity between regions to enable selective activity routing. These networks exhibit high-dimensional fluctuations within regions and low-dimensional signal transmission between them. Using dynamical mean-field theory, with cross-region currents as order parameters, we show that regions act as both generators and transmitters of activity -- roles that are often in tension. Taming within-region activity can be crucial for effective signal routing. Unlike previous models that suppressed neural activity to control signal flow, our model achieves routing by exciting different high-dimensional activity patterns through connectivity structure and nonlinear dynamics. Our analysis offers insights into multiregion neural data and trained neural networks.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Meta-learning Representation in the Teacher-student Scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based meta-learning algorithms have gained popularity for their ability to train models on new tasks using limited data. Empirical observations indicate that such algorithms are able to learn a shared representation across tasks, which is regarded as a key factor in their success. However, the in-depth theoretical understanding of the learning dynamics and the origin of the shared representation remains underdeveloped. In this work, we investigate the meta-learning dynamics of nonlinear two-layer neural networks trained on streaming tasks in the teacher-student scenario. Through the lens of statistical physics analysis, we characterize the macroscopic behavior of the meta-training processes, the formation of the shared representation, and the generalization ability of the model on new tasks. The analysis also points to the importance of the choice of certain hyperparameters of the learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optical resonators constitute a universal spin simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NP-hard computational problems can be efficiently recast as finding the ground state of an effective spin model. However, to date no convenient setup exists that can universally simulate all of them, even for a fixed problem size. Here we present such a setup, the universal homogeneous spin simularor (UHSS) using a series of optical (or polaritonic) resonators arranged in a chain using the geometry based on the one introduced in [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 024057 (2024), arXiv:2306.0574(3) ]. We demonstrate by example how the simulator solves Hamiltonian Cycle and traveling salesman problems, and show that it generalises to any NP-hard problem of arbitrary size. This approach works because it allows arbitrary long-range interactions in the spin model to be mapped on an optical system with only nearest-neighbor physical interactions.</description>

      <title>Localization Phenomena in Large-Scale Networked Systems: Robustness and Fragility of Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study phenomena where some eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian are largely confined in small subsets of the graph. These localization phenomena are similar to those generally termed Anderson Localization in the Physics literature, and are related to the complexity of the structure of large graphs in still unexplored ways. Using spectral perturbation theory and pseudo-spectrum analysis, we explain how the presence of localized eigenvectors gives rise to fragilities (low robustness margins) to unmodeled node or link dynamics. Our analysis is demonstrated by examples of networks with relatively low complexity, but with features that appear to induce eigenvector localization. The implications of this newly-discovered fragility phenomenon are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Vision transformer based Deep Learning of Topological indicators in Majorana Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 1D superconductor-semiconductor nanowires are leading candidates for topological quantum computation due to their ability to host Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, standard methods for identifying MZMs are often inadequate, particularly in the presence of disorder, where many properties considered to be heralds of MZMs are often generated by trivial disorder induced Andreev bound states. Recent works clearly indicate the need for developing new techniques for identifying and diagnosing MZMs. In this study, we utilize a Vision Transformer-based neural network to predict using tunnel conductance measurements, both whether a device manifests a topological MZMs phase, and also to map out the entire topological phase diagram. We show the ability of our method up to arbitrary confidence ($P&gt;0.9998$) classify a device as possessing a non-trivial MZM-carrying topological phase for a wide variety of disorder parameters. Further, within these regimes we demonstrate an ability to predict from conductance measurements alternative (to the extensively used scattering-matrix-invariant topological indicator) Majorana indicators based on local density of states (LDOS). This work serves as a significant advance offering a step towards the practical realization of Majorana-based quantum devices, enabling a deep-learning understanding of the topological properties in disordered nanowire systems. We validate our method using extensive simulated Majorana results in the presence of disorder, and suggest using this technique for the analysis of experimental data in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Majorana platforms.</description>
