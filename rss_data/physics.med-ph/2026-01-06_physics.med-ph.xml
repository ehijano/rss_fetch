      <title>Optimization of Magnetic Milli-Spinner for Robotic Endovascular Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and aneurysms can lead to life-threatening medical events. Conventional catheter- or guidewire-based endovascular diagnostic and therapeutic devices often struggle to navigate through highly tortuous vascular pathways. The recently developed multifunctional magnetic milli-spinner offers a promising wireless solution by integrating a central through-hole and side slits into a cylindrical body with helical fins, enabling rapid and stable navigation in complex vascular environments for clot debulking, targeted drug delivery, and aneurysm treatment. Here, we combine computational fluid dynamics simulations with experimental validation to optimize the milli-spinner's structural design for high-speed untethered navigation and high-efficiency clot debulking in tubular flow environments. By systematically examining the effects of through-hole radius, fin number, fin helical angle, and slit dimension on propulsion performance, the optimized magnetic milli-spinner achieves a swimming speed of 55 cm/s (~175 body lengths per second), far exceeding existing untethered magnetic robots in tubular environments (&lt; 80 body lengths per second). This exceptional speed enables stable upstream operation against strong physiological flows representative of major arteries and veins, establishing the magnetic milli-spinner as a robust untethered navigation platform for operation in high-flow, tortuous vasculature, with potential applications in robotic mechanical thrombectomy, embolectomy, and targeted drug delivery.</description>

      <title>Biomechanics of Tori body motion during competition Sutemi, Makikomi, Tai Atari</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background Objectives:The biomechanics of Tori s body motion during Sutemi,sacrifice techniques,Makikomi wrapping techniques,and Tai Atari,Body Strike techniques in judo is crucial for understanding these techniques' effectiveness and safety. This study examined the biomechanics by analysing the entire body of the tori during execution. Methods:We analysed Tori s body motion using original biomechanical models, considering the balance of sacrificing to throw Uke and body mass to strike the opponent. General equations for Sutemi, Makikomi, and Tai atari were established, and their utilisation in high level male competition was statistically analysed. Results:The results show that effective Sutemi and Makikomi execution depends on the correct use of Tori's body mass.The biomechanical model revealed the relationships between angular falling speed, body angle, and athlete height.The model allowed us to evaluate the falling velocity, showing that the angular velocity and acceleration were proportional to the gravitational acceleration and body-Tatami angle and inversely proportional to the athlete height.The stopping and sliding forces are directly proportional to the sum of the Tori and Uke masses and the body Tatami angle but are independent of the athletes eight. Tai Atari s force was quantified to evaluate its situational applicability in competition. Conclusion:This study advanced the biomechanical understanding of Sutemi, Makikomi, and Tai Atari using two original theoretical models, highlighting the importance of Tori s body mass motion. The findings obtained can influence training and competition strategies, enhance technique effectiveness, and reduce injury risks.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Hyperspectral Interferometry and Single-Cell Dispersion Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometry techniques are essential for extracting phase information from optical systems, enabling precise measurements of dispersion and highly sensitive detection of perturbations. While phase sensing offers enhanced sensitivity compared to conventional spectroscopy methods, this sensitivity often makes systems more vulnerable to external factors such as vibrations, introducing instability and noise. In this work, we demonstrate a broadband and AI-enhanced interferometry method, denoted general polarization common-path interferometry (GPCPI), that relaxes the polarization constraints of traditional common-path interferometry. The polarization decoupling feature enables simultaneous amplitude and phase measurements supplemented with deep neural autoencoders to detect phase anomalies in the spectrum through the analysis of second order derivative mapping of the phase profile, enhancing the accuracy of broadband phase measurements. The approach enables an order of magnitude improvement in phase stability compared to state-of-the-art interferometry techniques, leading to higher accuracy in phase sensing. Plasmonic metasurface phase sensing and hyperspectral single-cell dispersion imaging demonstrate the capability and sensitivity of the method over conventional spectroscopy. Our own adopted version of deep learning model, ConvNeXt V2, enables single-shot and real-time tracking of phase variation with minimized noise. Interference fringes over the cell cultured samples reveal the fingerprints of the normal (CCD-32Sk) vs cancerous (COLO-829) skin cells, enabling robust cell classification and disease diagnosis at single-cell level. The proposed interferometry technique offers a reliable, compact, and stable solution for broadband phase measurements and single-cell dispersion imaging for applications in metrology, molecular diagnostics, drug discovery, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>An Ingestible Light Source for Deep Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoacoustic tomography leverages ultrasound's deep tissue penetration to retrieve optical absorption contrast well beyond the optical diffusion limit. Conventional photoacoustic systems rely on externally delivered light and are therefore constrained by optical attenuation, limiting imaging depths to several centimeters. Here, we overcome this constraint using a compact, acoustically powered device that provides optical excitation directly from within the target medium. By exploiting the weak attenuation of low-MHz ultrasound, acoustic energy is transmitted through tissue to wirelessly power a pulsed laser diode. The emitted light pulses generate photoacoustic signals that encode local optical absorption at clinically relevant depths, which could enable imaging in regions such as the gastrointestinal tract that are inaccessible to surface-based illumination. We demonstrate this approach by imaging through a 12 cm thick phantom, establishing a pathway toward deep-tissue photoacoustic imaging.</description>

      <title>Investigating the impact of copper-PEDOT:PSS matrix towards non-enzymatic electrochemical creatinine detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrochemical creatinine sensors offer great promise towards rapid, reagent-free and point-of-care (POC) kidney-function monitoring. However, challenges related to analyte binding, data reproducibility, sensitivity, fouling and device degradation deter its widespread implementation. Here, we show how a carbon electrode modified with a combination of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) can rapidly and accurately detect creatinine (CT) in artificial urine media employing electrochemical techniques. Applying redox potential sweeps (vs Ag/AgCl) using copper sulfate (CuSO4) solution on such sensor facilitates the CuNP embedding process inside the conjugated polymer matrix which has been further validated by supporting techniques. We predicted and validated the formation and contribution of two Cu-CT coordination complexes corresponding to Cu(I) and Cu(II) states, which are responsible for CT detection. The fabricated CT sensor exhibits high selectivity against major artificial urine interferents and is stable for a month showing minimal degradation (0.53%) in peak current value. Such sensors can be utilized to detect and monitor different stages of renal failure in real-time patient samples.</description>

      <title>A nonconservative kinetic model under the action of an external force field for modeling the medical treatment of autoimmune response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a nonconservative kinetic framework to be applied to the study of immune system dysregulation. From the modeling viewpoint, the model regards a system composed of stochastically interacting agents, under the action of an eternal force field. According to the application perspectives of this paper, the external force field has a specific analytical shape. In this case, some analytical results are proved, i.e. existence, uniqueness, positivity, and boundedness of solution of the related Cauchy problem, at least locally in time. Then, the model is refined to be implemented for the study of treatment strategies in case of autoimmune response. Specifically, we distinguish the autonomous case from the nonautonomous one, representing the absence or delivery of drugs, respectively. The former allows us to gain some stability results. Whereas, the latter is qualitatively studied. Numerical simulations are provided for both schemes.</description>

      <title>Material Decomposition in Photon-Counting Computed Tomography with Diffusion Models: Comparative Study and Hybridization with Variational Regularizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15383v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) has emerged as a promising imaging technique, enabling spectral imaging and material decomposition (MD). However, images typically suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to constraints such as low photon counts and sparse-view settings which provoke artifacts. To prevent this, variational methods minimize a data-fit function coupled with handcrafted regularizers that mimic a prior by enforcing image properties such as gradient sparsity. In the last few years, diffusion models (DMs) have become predominant in the field of generative models and have been used as a learned prior for image reconstruction. This work investigates the use of DMs as regularizers for MD tasks in PCCT, specifically using diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) guidance. Three DPS-based approaches-image-domain two-step DPS (im-TDPS), projection-domain two-step DPS (proj-TDPS), and one-step DPS (ODPS)-are evaluated. The first two methods achieve MD in two steps by performing reconstruction and MD separately. The last method, ODPS, samples the material images directly from the measurement data. The results indicate that ODPS achieves superior performance compared to im-TDPS and proj-TDPS, providing sharper, noise-free and crosstalk-free images. Furthermore, we introduce a novel hybrid method for scenarios involving materials absent from the training dataset. This method combines DM priors with standard variational handcrafted regularizers for the materials unknown to the DM. This hybrid method demonstrates improved MD quality compared to a standard variational method and does not require additional training of the DM neural network (NN).</description>

      <title>A 240 Elements Matrix Probe with Aberration Mask for 4D Carotid Artery Computational Ultrasound Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound provides enhanced visualization of the carotid artery (CA) anatomy and volumetric flow, offering improved accuracy for cardiovascular diagnosis and monitoring. However, fully populated matrix transducers with large apertures are complex and costly to implement. Computational ultrasound imaging (cUSi) offers a promising alternative by enabling simplified hardware design through model-based reconstruction and spatial field encoding. In this work, we present a 3D cUSi system tailored for CA imaging, consisting of a 240-element matrix probe with a 40 x 24 mm$^2$ large aperture and a spatial encoding mask. We describe the system's design, characterization, and image reconstruction. Phantom experiments show that computational reconstruction using matched filtering (MF) significantly improves volumetric image quality over delay-and-sum (DAS), with spatial encoding enhancing lateral resolution at the cost of reduced contrast ratio. LSQR-based reconstruction was demonstrated to further improve resolution and suppress artifacts. Using both Hadamard and 16-angle plane wave transmission schemes, the system achieved high-resolution images with reasonable contrast, supporting the feasibility of 4D CA imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Dipolar order mapping based on spin-lock magnetic resonance imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02847v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) effect reflects dipolar order with a dipolar relaxation time ($T_{1D}$), specific to motion-restricted macromolecules. We aim to quantify $T_{1D}$ using spin-lock MRI technique. Methods: In the proposed method, we introduce a $T_{1D}$-specific ratio, denoted as $RATIO_{dosl}$. This ratio is derived from the distinct relaxation rate $R_{dosl}$, calculated as the difference between dual-frequency relaxation $R_{1\rho}^{dual}$ and single-frequency $R_{1\rho}^{single}$ relaxation measurements. A novel rotary-echo spin-lock sequence was developed to enable dual-frequency spin-lock acquisition. We established a framework to estimate $T_{1D}$, as well as the macromolecular pool fraction (MPF) map. The proposed approach was validated via numerical simulations, phantom studies, and demonstrated in vivo in human white matter. Results: Simulations revealed the high sensitivity of $RATIO_{dosl}$ to $T_{1D}$, and substantiated the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methods. Phantom experiments demonstrated robust ihMT contrast and confirmed the capability of $T_{1D}$ quantification via $RATIO_{dosl}$. In vivo studies supported the clinical viability of this approcah, achieving simultaneous $T_{1D}$ and MPF mapping using only three spin-lock prepared images. Across ten healthy volunteers, the mean white matter $T_{1D}$ ranged from approximately 3.70 to 4.80 ms. Conclustion: We propose a novel method for $T_{1D}$ quantification based on spin-lock MRI. By requiring only three contrast-prepared images, this technique provides a promising pathway for robust, rapid, and simultaneous $T_{1D}$ and MPF quantification with fewer confounds</description>

      <title>Optimized Single-Core PCF-Based SPR Biosensor for High-Performance Early-Stage Multi-Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a highly sensitive Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)-based biosensor integrated with a circular-lattice Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) for early-stage cancer detection. The proposed sensor leverages the synergy between SPR and PCF technologies to overcome the bulkiness and limited sensitivity of traditional SPR systems. A thin gold (Au) layer, responsible for plasmon excitation, is deposited on the fiber structure, while a nanolayer of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is introduced to enhance adhesion between the gold and the silica background, improving structural stability and field confinement. The sensor is designed to detect refractive index (RI) variations in biological analytes, specifically targeting cancerous cells from skin, blood, and adrenal gland tissues. The optical characteristics and performance of the sensor were thoroughly analyzed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) in COMSOL Multiphysics 6.1, allowing for precise simulation and optimization. The sensor demonstrates high sensitivity within the RI range of 1.360-1.395, corresponding to the RI values of the target cancer cells. Remarkable wavelength sensitivities of 21,250 nm/RIU, 53,571 nm/RIU, and 103,571 nm/RIU were achieved for skin, blood, and adrenal gland cancers, respectively. In addition, a maximum figure of merit (FOM) of 306.424 RIU^-1 and a spectral resolution (SR) of 9.57x10^-7 RIU further affirm the sensor's exceptional detection capabilities. These findings indicate the proposed SPR-PCF sensor's strong potential for real-time, label-free biosensing applications, particularly in precise and early cancer diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Quantitative ultrasound imaging of bone: anatomical images, tissue structural quality, and pulsatile blood flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an ultrasound approach which provides, with one single examination and one single device, access to three bone biomarkers: anatomy, tissue quality and blood flow. It unlocks ultrasound imaging inside bone by accounting for ultrasound wave speed heterogeneity and anisotropic wave refraction. This study reports the first \emph{in vivo} evaluation with a comparison to peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT) and modulations of blood flow. Anatomical multi-layer bone-corrected reconstruction was validated at the tibia of healthy volunteers against pQCT and showed agreement on bone cortex interfaces. Estimation of axial and radial ultrasound wave speeds in cortical bone tissue (i.e. along the tissue symmetry axis and normal to it) demonstrated good reproducibility and positive correlation with bone mineral density measured by pQCT. Pulsatile blood flow was mapped and quantified in cortical and medullary regions. A directional ray selection method was developed to enhance blood signal extraction by reducing strong specular reflections originating from the outer and inner surfaces of the bone cortex. Physiological and non-physiological modulations of blood flow, namely head-up/head-down tilt table maneuvers and arterial occlusions, demonstrated the method sensitivity to blood flow variations. For the first time, reactive hyperemia was observed inside bone cortex. These results demonstrate the feasibility of a portable, non-ionizing, and quantitative ultrasound approach for structural, anatomical, and vascular characterization of bone tissue. This approach may offer new diagnostic capabilities for bone disorders, for instance osteoporosis, delayed fracture healing or osteonecrosis.</description>

      <title>CRYSP: a Total-Body PET based on cryogenic cesium iodide crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Total Body PET (TBPET) scanners have the potential to substantially reduce both acquisition time and administered radiation dose, owing to their high sensitivity. However, their widespread clinical adoption is hindered by the high cost of currently available systems. This work explores the use of pure cesium iodide (CsI) monolithic crystals operated at cryogenic temperatures as a cost-effective alternative to rare-earth scintillators for TBPET. We investigate the performance of pure CsI crystals operated at cryogenic temperatures ($\sim$100 K), where they achieve a light yield of approximately $10^5$ photons/MeV. The implications for energy resolution, spatial resolution (including depth-of-interaction capability), and timing performance are assessed, with a view toward their integration into a TBPET system. Cryogenic CsI crystals demonstrated energy resolution below 7% and coincidence time resolution at the nanosecond level, despite their relatively slow scintillation decay time. A Monte Carlo simulation of monolithic CsI crystals shows that a millimeter-scale spatial resolution in all three dimensions can be obtained. These characteristics indicate that high-performance PET imaging is achievable with this technology. A TBPET scanner based on cryogenic CsI monolithic crystals could combine excellent imaging performance with significantly reduced detector costs, enabling broader accessibility and accelerating the adoption of TBPET in both clinical and research settings.</description>
