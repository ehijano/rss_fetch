      <title>Divergences in the hadronic light-by-light amplitude of the holographic soft-wall model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the WKB approximation to uncover divergences and instances of non-commuting limits in a large class of holographic soft-wall models. We show that the infinite sum over single resonance contributions for a variety of observables involving the Chern-Simons term, such as the VVA correlator or the hadronic light-by-light tensor, does not converge. These divergences can in some cases (such as the VVA correlator) be traced back to non-commuting limits and avoided by working directly in the 5-dimensional setup with bulk-to-boundary propagators. However, the hadronic light-by-light scattering tensor also diverges in the 5-dimensional formulation with corresponding Green functions, preventing a correct implementation of the Melnikov-Vainshtein short-distance constraint and even leading to an infinite contribution to the muon $g-2$. We also discuss modifications of the standard soft-wall model that are able to resolve this issue.</description>

      <title>The one-jettiness distribution contains super-super-leading logarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that one-jettiness ($\tau_1$) in colour-singlet plus jet production suffers from super-leading logarithms starting at order $\alpha_{\mathrm s}^4 \ln(1/\tau_1)^6$ relative to the Born level. This is one logarithm more dominant than any previously identified super-leading logarithms. The extra logarithm is not associated with additional poles, and is therefore consistent with the factorization of universal parton distribution functions at scale $\tau_1 Q$, where $Q$ is the hard scale.</description>

      <title>First bounds on effective muon interactions using the NA64$\mu$ experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze how NA64$\mu$ can contribute to the global SMEFT program demonstrating that it can probe two effective four lepton operators completely unbounded so far and break one of the current flat directions. Furthermore, we also study an extension of SMEFT that includes fermion singlets of the SM gauge group in the low energy field content. This effective field theory, usually dubbed $\nu$SMEFT, is well motivated by the observation of light neutrino masses and leptonic mixing. We find that NA64$\mu$ can constrain three unbounded four fermion operators of the $\nu$SMEFT. We derive the current leading bounds on these operators and compute the future sensitivity. Our results fill the gap between the current experimental program and a possible future muon collider able to probe this type of New Physics.</description>

      <title>Photon-induced jet production at future lepton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of hadronic final states in electron-positron or electron-hadron collisions is induced predominantly by quasi-real photons that were emitted off incoming leptons. In these processes, the photon either enters directly or through its resolved parton content, which is at present only loosely constrained by experimental data. We perform a detailed phenomenological study of photon-induced jet production processes in high-energy $e^+e^-$ collisions, investigating in particular their potential to assess contributions from the resolved photon structure.</description>

      <title>The weak decay constant of positronium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The positronium, as the lightest purely leptonic bound state, provides an ideal testing ground for a quantum field--theoretical (QFT) description of composite systems. While its electromagnetic annihilation is well understood as the dominant decay channel, the weak interaction sector of positronium is strongly suppressed. In this work, we extend the composite QFT framework previously developed for the two--photon decay and introduce the concept of a weak decay constant for para--positronium. This constant, defined in analogy with those of pseudoscalar mesons, quantifies the coupling of the positronium field to the weak axial current and serves as a measure of its internal structure in the electroweak domain. Its numerical value $ f_{P} \simeq \frac{m_{e}}{2\sqrt{\pi}} \alpha^{3/2} = 89.8593~\mathrm{eV} $ is, as expected, small. Nevertheless, the resulting expression and a related comparison to quarkonium systems allow us to determine the vertex function linking the positronium to its own constituents.</description>

      <title>Improving Neutrino Oscillation Measurements through Event Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise neutrino energy reconstruction is essential for next-generation long-baseline oscillation experiments, yet current methods remain limited by large uncertainties in neutrino-nucleus interaction modeling. Even so, it is well established that different interaction channels produce systematically varying amounts of missing energy and therefore yield different reconstruction performance--information that standard calorimetric approaches do not exploit. We introduce a strategy that incorporates this structure by classifying events according to their underlying interaction type prior to energy reconstruction. Using supervised machine-learning techniques trained on labeled generator events, we leverage intrinsic kinematic differences among quasi-elastic scattering, meson-exchange current, resonance production, and deep-inelastic scattering processes. A cross-generator testing framework demonstrates that this classification approach is robust to microphysics mismodeling and, when applied to a simulated DUNE $\nu_\mu$ disappearance analysis, yields improved accuracy and sensitivity. These results highlight a practical path toward reducing reconstruction-driven systematics in future oscillation measurements.</description>

      <title>Upper Bound on the Cosmic Baryon Chemical Potential from Lepton-Flavor Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the early Universe trajectory around the QCD transition in lepton-flavor-asymmetric cases with small total lepton asymmetry ($|\ell|\lesssim 10^{-2}$), while allowing large individual lepton asymmetries. For each temperature, we find an upper bound on the baryon chemical potential $\mu_{\mathrm B}(T)$: $\tau$--$\mu$ asymmetric cases exhibit a local maximum, whereas $\mu$--$e$ cases approach a limiting curve. Thus, even extreme lepton-flavor asymmetry alone cannot reach a first-order region, unless the critical point is moved to a substantially lower $\mu_\mathrm{B}/T$ because of the nonzero $\mu_\mathrm{Q}$. Therefore, we constrain the QCD-era relic to the standard scenario of a chiral crossover transition.</description>

      <title>Tensor form factors of the $\Delta^+$ baryon induced by isovector and isoscalar currents in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tensor form factors of the $\Delta^+$ baryon are defined through the matrix element of the tensor current and describe its internal structure and spin distribution. We present the full Lorentz decomposition for the $\Delta^+ \rightarrow \Delta^+$ tensor current matrix element, including all independent structures consistent with Lorentz covariance, the Rarita-Schwinger constraints, and time-reversal symmetry. By investigating the tensor form factors corresponding to both the isovector and isoscalar tensor currents, we observed differences that reflect the distinct contributions of up and down quark components in the $\Delta^+$ baryon.</description>

      <title>Normalization of partial wave CP asymmetries in three-body decays of heavy hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CP violation in hadronic multi-body decays has been extensively studied, and the experimental breakthrough in the heayy baryon sector was made recently. Partial-Wave CP Asymmetries (PWCPAs) in multi-body decays of heavy hadrons, which although provide us with more interference information, suffer from the normalization problem, as is pointed out in this paper. We propose a novel solution to this problem. We introduce a set of extra factors to rescale the PWCPAs to the proper sizes. Instead of determining the set of factors according to the normalization requirement, we demand that all the PWCPAs have the same statistical errors. In this way, we obtain a set of quasi-normalized PWCPAs, in the sense that they are close to the ideal normalized ones. As an application, we perform an analysis of PWCPAs in the decay channel $B^\pm\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^\pm$. We focus on the phase space region where the invariant mass of the $\pi^+\pi^-$ pair varies around the vector resonance $\rho^0(1450)$. Based on the data of the LHCb collaboration, the interference patterns among the resonances $\rho^0(1450)$, $f_2(1270)$, and $f_0(1500)$ and their contributions to the quasi-normalized PWCPAs are analyzed. The analysis indicates that the quasi-normalized PWCPAs can avoid potential misleading or distorted results comparing with some other alternatively defined ones.</description>

      <title>Vortex states and entanglement properties in multiphoton pair production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the multiphoton pair production in circularly polarized field via two level model. There appears obvious discrete ring structures in the momentum distribution of the created particles, in which the ring radius is mainly controlled by the number of the photons absorbed in the creation with the energy conservation and could also be modulated by the spin of the created pair. These multiphoton rings become narrower when both of the pair particles' spin are aligned with the direction of the field rotation, and become broader if both spin are antiparallel to that direction. This spin-modulation can be simply understood with the angular momentum conservation, as less orbital angular momentum from the absorbed photons would be transferred to the created particles if their spins are aligned with the field rotation. The orbital angular momentum of the created particles is manifested as the vortex structure in the phase of the momentum distribution, and valued as the topological charge of this phase vortex. We also study the spin entanglement between the created particles, and reveal that the entanglement becomes stronger with the increase of the particles' transverse momentum, and gets sharp peak in the transition between different multiphoton rings, where the topological charge of the phase vortex is changed.</description>

      <title>Tomography of high-twist proton structure through $ep$ elastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first high-twist study of the proton form factors $F_{1,2}(Q^2)$ in $ep$ elastic scattering based on the perturbative QCD $k_T$ factorization, $Q^2$ being momentum transfer squared. It is motivated by unexpectedly large higher-power contributions from subleading-twist light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs), which are attributed to the enhancement in endpoint regions of parton momentum fractions. We highlight that the endpoint enhancement, tamed by the $k_T$ resummation effect, is crucial for accommodating the approximate scaling behavior of the $Q^4F_1(Q^2)$ data at intermediate $Q^2\sim {\cal O}(10)$ GeV$^2$. The proton LCDAs up to twist 6 are then extracted, and verified by the charge-parity asymmetries observed in the heavy baryon decays $\Lambda_b\to p\pi, pK$. Our work provides new insights into the proton three-dimensional structure and manifests the precision requirement for reliable perturbative analyses of baryonic exclusive processes.</description>

      <title>Resurrecting the Standard Model Effective Field Theory interferences at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even if some experimental evidence suggests the existence of physics beyond the SM, no clues of new resonances can be found in the data. In the case their masses are much larger than the energies of current experiments, the SMEFT formalism can be used to introduce new operators that parametrise small deviations from the SM predictions at the LHC, induced by interactions between the known and new states. This thesis focuses on some operators and processes for which the leading correction to the SM, namely its interference with dimension-6 operators, is suppressed, either because it is small all over the phase space as a result of a helicity mismatch in the SM and SMEFT amplitudes, or because a cancellation between large cross-section contributions with opposite sign occurs. Several useful quantities are introduced to distinguish among these two cases, and a phenomenological strategy to revive the interferences is developed. They are applied to the cases of the $O_G$ and $O_W$ operators, respectively in three-jet production and EW processes like VBF $Zjj$, $WZ$ and $W\gamma$. The comparison among them highlights how different procedures can be followed to restore the interference. The quantities introduced in this thesis can be used to find simple kinematic observables that are sensitive to the suppression and can yield competitive bounds on the coefficients of the operators, even outside the SMEFT validity region. In the last chapter, a study of ten four-light quark operators is presented at LO matched to parton shower. Individual and marginalised limits on them are obtained through multijet production and processes where the jets are generated together with EW bosons, like $Z, W, \gamma$+jets. Almost no interference suppression happens for these operators, but they can virtually affect any process at NLO.</description>

      <title>HadroTOPS: A Monte Carlo Event Generator For Hadron Production In Two-Photon Scattering In Electron Positron Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Monte Carlo event generator specifically developed for the study of hadronic two-photon fusion events in two-photon scattering at electron-positron colliders. The code enables the generation of events with exact leading-order QED coupling and a flat phase space decay of the hadronic state into an arbitrary number of final state particles as selected by the user. Thus, this generator is well-suited for the use of partial wave analyses tools to study the two-photon production of higher-multiplicity final states across a wide range of energies and photon virtualities. Furthermore, the code integrates both experimental and theoretical inputs on the two-photon couplings of hadrons to simulate two-photon production processes. Motivated by the investigations of the BESIII collaboration, the final states $\pi^+\pi^-$, $\pi^0\pi^0$, $\pi^0\eta$, $K^+K^-$, $K^0_SK^0_S$, $\eta\eta$, and $f_1(1285)\to \eta\pi^+\pi^-$ via $a_0^\pm(980)\pi^\mp$ and $f_0(500)\eta$ are currently included. The code is sufficiently flexible to easily add additional final states as well as quickly change the already included channels.</description>

      <title>Digit anomalies in the hadronic mass spectrum, Shannon information entropy, and the dynamical QCD scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) has an emergent dynamical energy scale $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ which sets the threshold between perturbative and nonperturbative regimes. This characteristic scale causes hadronic masses to cluster within certain mass ranges, instead of following a uniform distribution. Analyzing the Shannon information entropy underlying the hadronic mass spectrum provides novel insight into this phenomenon, revealing a pronounced deviation from the law of anomalous numbers.
  This deviation quantifies the emergence of the dynamical scale in strongly interacting systems, also encoding the information-entropy cost associated with the breaking of scale invariance in QCD.</description>

      <title>Axial charges and magnetic moments of the decuplet pentaquark family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic calculation of the axial charges and magnetic moments for the decuplet of hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks within the framework of the constituent quark model. Our findings reveal that the axial charges of these states are comparable in magnitude to that of the nucleon. Furthermore, we find that their magnetic moments obey a set of sum rules (denoted the Hao-Song sum rules) which hold for states sharing the same spin-flavor configuration, even in the presence of SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking. These results provide crucial insights into the internal structure and dynamics of multiquark hadrons, offering valuable guidance for future experimental and theoretical investigations.$\mu_{P_{\psi}^{\Delta+}}-

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological constant problem represents a profound conflict between quantum field theory and general relativity. Unimodular gravity offers a compelling starting point by de-gravitating the vacuum energy of the Standard Model, but this framework traditionally trades the problem of vacuum energy for a fine-tuning of initial conditions, which manifest as a ``shadow" cosmological constant. In this paper, we resolve this initial conditions problem by proposing a novel modification to gravity based on nonlinear quantum mechanics. We introduce specific state-dependent terms to the Hamiltonian, constructed from expectation values of the metric such as the average Ricci scalar. These terms alter the dynamical equations of gravity such that the shadow energy density associated with unconstrained initial conditions redshifts away with cosmic expansion, rendering it negligible at late times. The resulting cosmology is naturally dominated by matter and radiation without fine-tuning. We demonstrate that this significant infrared modification of gravity is consistent with local and cosmological tests of gravity. We comment on the possibility of testing this solution in cosmological measurements of Newton's constant.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence signatures in charmless non-leptonic $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence plays a crucial role in the dynamics of neutral meson systems, aiding in the extraction of various Standard Model parameters. However, real physical systems always interact with their surroundings, which causes decoherence. In case of time dependent analysis of non-leptonic neutral $B$ meson decays, this decoherence can be modeled using a single parameter, $\lambda$. Since decoherence can affect the observed dynamics of flavor oscillations and CP violation, it becomes essential to revisit the key SM parameters such as the CKM angles $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ and the mass differences of neutral $B$ mesons ($\Delta m_{d,s}$). In this work, we study the CKM phase $\beta$ as well as the penguin contributions in the $B_d^0 \to J/\psi K_S$ decay mode in the presence of decoherence. We employ the pseudo-experiment (Toy Monte-Carlo) technique and perform an $SU(3)_F$ analysis using the $B_d^0 \to J/\psi \pi^0$ process. Furthermore, we investigate the $B_d^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ decay mode to understand how the decoherence influences the CP violating observables. Our findings reveal that the presence of decoherence can affect crucially the measured values of the observables.</description>

      <title>Radiative Decays of Vector Mesons with Light-Cone Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadronic electromagnetic form factors and radiative decay properties offer a crucial window into the nonperturbative dynamics of Quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this work, we employ the light-cone sum rules (LCSR) method to systematically investigate the M1 radiative decay of vector mesons. Our study covers processes including $K^{*-}\rightarrow K^-\gamma$, $D^*\rightarrow D\gamma$, $B^*\rightarrow B\gamma$, $D^{*+}_s\rightarrow D^+_s\gamma$, and $B_s^*\rightarrow B_s\gamma$, and further extends to the excited charmonium state $\psi(2S)$. Our calculations yield decay widths for $K^*$ and $\psi(2S)$ that are in excellent agreement with experimental data. For the charm and bottom meson decays, where precise measurements are lacking, we provide theoretical predictions and compare them with other theoretical approaches. Most notably, our analysis reveals a universal linear dependence of the decay width on a function A(x) in the logarithmic coordinate system, which originates from the two-body decay dynamics and the ratio of the initial and final state decay constants. This relationship holds for the ground state $V \rightarrow P \gamma $ processes here and suggests a broader applicability to radiative decays of ground-state vector mesons.</description>

      <title>A Study of $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ Nature : Compact v.s. Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central question in exotic-hadron physics is their internal structure whether these states are loosely bound hadronic molecules or compact multiquark configurations. To shed light on this issue, we develop a model that incorporates mixing between hadronic-molecular and compact multiquark components. We then apply this framework to the specific case of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ and analyze the peak structure in the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ invariant-mass spectrum reported by LHCb. We find that a scenario based on a predominantly compact tetraquark provides the best fitted solution which can explain the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$. We also find that the model admits two more solutions of comparable quality, both of which imply that the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is a molecular state: (1) the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is a $D^{*+}D^0$ molecule and there is a $D^{*0}D^+$ molecular state in addition; (2) the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is a $D^{*0}D^+$ molecule and an aditional $D^{*+}D^0$ molecular state is found below $D^0D^0\pi^+$ threshold. These molecular states are not simple $I = 0$ states, but mixtures of $I = 0$ and $I = 1$ states. We show that all three scenarios are also consistent with the experimentally observed near-threshold $D^0D^0$ and $D^0D^+$ invariant-mass distributions.</description>

      <title>Chiral Magnetic Effect induced Spectator Process for Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional Leptogenesis mechanism, which provides compelling explanation to the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU), assumes the absence of hypermagnetic field in the early universe, thereby disregard the implications of hyper gauge field helicity, that have been thoroughly studied in the magnetogenesis mechanism. In this paper, we address impacts of a general U(1) gauge field on Leptogenesis by deriving equation of motions for the helicity and the energy density of a general magnetic field, to which the chiral magnetic effect (CME) is identified as essential, and studying their effects on the evolution chiral asymmetries. Notably, CME in the $U(1)_{\mathbf{L}_i-\mathbf{L}_j}$ framework, where $\mathbf{L}_{i,j}$ means specific lepton flavor, explicitly breaks the total lepton number and provides an efficient spectator process, that can wash out pre-existing lepton asymmetries. This establishes a natural connection to the wash-in Leptogenesis paradigm. We demonstrate that this spectator effect enables the generation of the BAU, eliminating the need for both an initial $\mathbf{B}-\mathbf{L}$ charge and primordial helicity.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we construct the color $\bar{\mathbf{3}}\bar{\mathbf{3}}\bar{\mathbf{3}}$ type local five-quark currents with the light quarks $qss$ in the flavor octet, and study the $qssc\bar{c}$ pentaquark states via the QCD sum rules in a comprehensive way. We obtain the mass spectrum of the hidden-charm-doubly-strange pentaquark states with the isospin-spin-parity $IJ^{P}=\frac{1}{2}{\frac{1}{2}}^-$, $\frac{1}{2}{\frac{3}{2}}^-$ and $\frac{1}{2}{\frac{5}{2}}^-$, which can be confronted to the experimental data in the future, especially the process $\Xi_b^- \to P_{css}^-\phi \to J/\psi \Xi^- \phi $.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine existing perturbative results to show that a precise analytic determination of the charm-quark contribution to the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) part of the muon anomalous magnetic moment is possible. Working in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme, we include the NLO $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ correction, which significantly reduces the residual renormalization-scale dependence and the perturbative uncertainty. Our final result is $a_{\mu}^{\mathrm{HLbLc}}=3.65(25)\times 10^{-11}$, in good agreement with recent lattice determinations.</description>

      <title>Roles of $\Lambda$ resonances in the $K^- p \to \gamma \Sigma$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $K^- p \to \gamma \Sigma$ reaction using an effective Lagrangian approach within an isobar model framework. The model includes contributions from $s$-channel hyperon and hyperon resonance, $t$-channel $K$ and $K^*$, $u$-channel proton and $\Delta(1232)$ exchanges, and a phenomenological contact term. Our analysis focuses on the roles of various $\Lambda$ resonances. The results indicate that the $\Lambda(1600)$ resonance is crucial for describing the experimental data at lower energies. At higher energies, the inclusion of either the $\Lambda(1670)$ or the $\Lambda(1690)$ resonance significantly improves the agreement with data. However, the current data are insufficient to distinguish between these two scenarios. We suggest that future measurements at higher beam energies and the measurement of the $\Sigma$ polarization are needed to identify the roles of the $\Lambda(1670)$ and $\Lambda(1690)$ resonances.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Higgs Couplings as a Window to New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout this thesis, we investigate how effective field theories, combined with unitarization techniques, can be used to explore physics beyond the Standard Model, with particular emphasis on the dynamical origin of electroweak symmetry breaking. Since effective theories often produce amplitudes that violate unitarity at high energies, restoring unitarity is essential before comparing predictions with data.
  The first part of the work focuses on longitudinal $WW$ scattering, a process that, despite being subdominant at the LHC, provides a sensitive probe of Higgs dynamics. We perform a full one-loop computation within the HEFT framework, determine the required counterterms in the on-shell scheme, and analyze for the first time how the inclusion of transverse gauge bosons modifies the masses and widths of the dynamical resonances obtained through unitarization in the vector--isovector and scalar--isoscalar channels. This provides the technical foundation for studying HEFT low-energy couplings subject to unitarity and causality.
  While vector resonances are relatively well characterized through Weinberg sum rules and unitarization, scalar resonances remain more elusive and depend on HEFT parameters that are experimentally difficult to constrain. We show that unitarization, together with causality, imposes nontrivial bounds on Higgs self-interactions. In the scalar channel, the necessity of treating coupled processes becomes a key ingredient, enabling us to extract information about the Higgs sector from elastic $WW \to WW$ scattering without requiring double-Higgs production.
  Finally, we apply the formalism developed throughout the thesis to unitarize the amplitudes of a quantum theory of gravity treated as an effective field theory, illustrating the broader applicability of these methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) provide a distinct environment for high-energy QCD research, focusing on the production of vector mesons. This proceeding details recent advancements in the Sar$t$re Monte Carlo event generator, a dipole model-based tool, to better describe UPC data. We present the incorporation of the full photon flux, accounting for interference effects and photon transverse momentum ($k_T$), and the integration of an $n_0^0n$ afterburner for neutron-tagged event classification. These extensions significantly improve Sar$t$re's ability to reproduce experimental data from STAR and LHCb, particularly at small $p_T^2$ and for various neutron event classes.</description>

      <title>Complex Scalar Singlet Model: Electroweak Phase Transition and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) cannot explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU), thus driving the need for physics beyond the SM, which can generate electroweak baryogenesis through a strong first-order electroweak phase transition (SFOPT). We extend the SM with a complex singlet scalar (cxSM) and examine the phase transition behavior using a fully general renormalizable scalar potential that permits a complex vacuum expectation value for the singlet and coupled dynamics among multiple scalar fields. Employing the one-loop thermal effective potential with daisy resummation and appropriate counter terms, we conduct an extensive scan of the parameter space, enforcing both theoretical and experimental limits on the scalar sector. This analysis reveals viable domains yielding SFOPT. From these regions, we select representative benchmark scenarios demonstrating multi-stage transitions, producing stochastic gravitational wave signals via bubble nucleation dynamics. The resulting spectra lie within the projected sensitivity of next-generation observatories, including LISA, BBO, DECIGO, and U-DECIGO. Thus, the cxSM offers a compelling setting for electroweak baryogenesis, enriched by correlated gravitational-wave and collider phenomenology.</description>

      <title>$D_{(s)}(2S)$ and $D^{*}_{(s)}(2S)$ production in nonleptonic $B_{(s)}$ weak decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, many new excited states of heavy mesons have been discovered in recent experiments, including radially excited states. The production processes of these states from the $B_{(s)}$ meson have drawn significant interest. In this paper, we use the covariant light-front approach to study the nonleptonic $B_{(s)}$ meson decays to the first radially excited states $D_{(s)}(2S)$ and $D^{*}_{(s)}(2S)$. Our results reveal that many channels exhibit large branching ratios in the range $10^{-5}\sim 10^{-4}$, even up to $10^{-3}$ for individual channels, which are detectable by current experiments. Our predictions for the decays $B_{(s)}\to D^{(*)}_{(s)}(2S)(\pi,\rho,K^{(*)})$ are larger than those given by the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation method, but agree well with the relativistic quark mode (RQM) and the relativistic independent quark model (RIQM) calculations. For comparison, we also present the branching ratios of the decays $B_{(s)}\to D^{(*)}_{(s)}(1S)(\pi,\rho,K^{(*)})$, which are comparable with other theoretical results and the data. Although the branching ratios of the decays $B_{(s)} \to D^{*}_{(s)}(1S)(\rho,K^*)$ are much larger than those of the decays $B_{(s)} \to D^{*}_{(s)}(2S)(\rho,K^*)$, the polarization properties between them are similar, that is, the longitudinal polarization fractions are dominant and can amount roughly to $90\%$.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Sector Particles Coupling to Neutrinos with Double Beta Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of non-zero neutrino masses and the potential for discovering physics beyond the Standard Model, numerous experiments are actively searching for neutrinoless double beta $(0\nu\beta\beta)$ decay. In all of these searches, a substantial amount of data on two-neutrino double beta $(2\nu\beta\beta)$ decay has been collected. In this work, we explore the sensitivity of current and future double beta decay experiments to a massive Majoron-like scalar particle coupled to neutrinos and potentially dark sector fermions, and compare their reach to the relevant cosmological constraints. On- and off-shell production of such scalar particles leads to characteristic distortions in the double beta decay electron spectrum. We investigate how these distortions would manifest in current and future double beta decay experiments, deriving the sensitivity to such scenarios. We project the reach of future experiments which can probe scalar-neutrino couplings of $|a_\nu| \approx 2\times 10^{-6}$ for sub-MeV scalar particles and remain sensitive to off-shell production above the Q-value of double beta decay isotopes.</description>

      <title>Identifying Charged Lepton-like Portal Matter at Future Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Kinetic Mixing (KM) portal scenario, the interaction of dark matter (DM) with the particles of the Standard Model (SM) is generated by diagrams connecting the familiar photon with its dark sector analog, the dark photon (DP), via loops of particles carrying both dark and SM quantum numbers, \ie, Portal Matter (PM). For the case of sub-GeV DM and DP, these PM states may lie in the $\sim 1-10$ TeV range and be potentially accessible at the HL-LHC as well as at other future lepton and hadron colliders. In perhaps the simplest scenario of this kind, PM consists of just a pair of electrically charged, iso- and color-singlet, vector-like (VL) fermions having opposite dark charges, with an $O(1)$ mass splitting, yielding a finite value for the strength of the KM, \ie, $\epsilon \sim a~ few \times10^{-4}$. The dark Higgs induced mixing of PM states with their SM analogs allows for their decay but can also lead to significant distortions in the expected production properties for the PM at future lepton colliders due to $t$-channel dark Higgs exchange, potentially confusing PM identification. We show that the large set of clean observables available at lepton colliders is more that sufficient to resolve any of these ambiguities. The possibility of the production of like-sign PM fields via $t/u$-channel exchange of the same dark Higgs is also briefly explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hitherto unexplored neutrino background emerging from the mechanism of quenched superradiance of rotating primordial black holes. The quenching of the phenomenon happens through fermionic production, in our case neutrino production, from the boson cloud formed due to superradiance. The couplings involved in these interactions are bounded from above through several studies. In this work we put lower bounds on such scalar and vector couplings.</description>

Abstract: We investigate how the large-scale heliosphere alters the arrival directions of high-energy cosmic-ray electrons and positrons and ask if and when this "heliospheric lens" can be ignored for anisotropy and source-association studies - an especially timely topic given, for instance, the persistent cosmic-ray positron fraction and its unknown origin. Using a modular back-tracing framework, we explore a set of widely used magnetic-field descriptions - from a Parker spiral baseline to more structured configurations that include latitudinal wind contrasts, Smith-Bieber-type azimuthal strengthening, and tilted or wavy heliospheric current sheets. Across these models the picture is consistent: most bending is accumulated within the inner tens of astronomical units and decreases rapidly with energy. Field choices and solar-cycle geometry set the overall normalization, with stronger spiral winding or a more highly tilted current sheet producing larger deflections at the same energy. Differences between electrons and positrons are most apparent at lower energies, where drift histories and current-sheet encounters diverge, and become increasingly small at multi-TeV energies. We summarize these trends with a practical threshold energy describing when heliospheric bending falls below an instrument's angular resolution, and we verify that our conclusions are robust to numerical settings. For current instruments, heliospheric effects can usually be treated as a small correction at the highest energies, while sub-TeV analyses benefit from a calibrated envelope that accounts for plausible field configurations during the observing epoch.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave standard sirens from GWTC-3 combined with DESI DR2 and DESY5: A late-universe probe of the Hubble constant and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12017</link>

Abstract: Recently, the combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data and the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements has shown a $\sim$3$\sigma$ preference for a dynamical dark energy model with a phantom-crossing behavior. However, such a phantom-crossing dark energy evolution further exacerbates the already severe Hubble tension in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Moreover, there exists a $\sim2\sigma$ tension between the DESI DR2 BAO and CMB datasets. Therefore, it is essential to measure the Hubble constant and dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameters using only late-universe observations. In this work, we investigate a novel late-universe data combination: gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens, BAO, and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). This combination provides a fully distance-ladder- and CMB-independent determination of the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS. Using 47 GW standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, the DESI DR2 BAO data, and DESY5 SNe Ia data, in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we obtain $H_0=74.8^{+6.3}_{-8.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.320^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, $w_0=-0.775^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$, and $w_a=-0.80\pm0.47$, indicating a mild phantom-crossing behavior within the $1\sigma$ credible interval with an $H_0$ value consistent with the distance ladder measurements. Our analysis demonstrates the power of GW standard sirens in breaking parameter degeneracies, and this novel data combination provides joint constraints on the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS parameters.</description>

      <title>Simplification of chiral nuclear forces near the unitarity limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern theory approaches for describing atomic nuclei often make use of on an effective theory that constructs the interaction between nucleons systematically based on Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), exploiting constraints arising from the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD. The tensor nuclear force produced by one-pion exchange is an important feature that arises naturally in this framework. In this work we show that, however, the tensor force is suppressed by the large nucleon-nucleon scattering lengths in combination with the smallness of the pion mass. Based on this observation, we propose a new scheme for a chiral nuclear force that is able to describe $NN$ phase shifts up to the center-of-mass momenta $k \simeq 300$ MeV while treating pion exchange as a perturbation. Our much simplified leading-order force provides a microscopic explanation for the recent success of various short-range nuclear forces from the perspective of chiral effective field theory, and it shares with those approaches an approximate Wigner SU(4) symmetry, as well as the closeness to the unitarity limit (infinite nucleon-nucleon scattering lengths), as guiding principles. Compared to previous approaches to perturbative-pion interactions, our force also adjusts the ordering of short-range contact interactions, by means of which we overcome convergence problems of the expansion that were previously assumed to severely limit its usefulness. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with numerical calculations of $NN$ scattering up to fourth order, in addition to studies of $3N$ and $4N$ bound-state properties.</description>

      <title>Low-energy interactions between doubly charmed baryons and Goldstone bosons from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a lattice QCD calculation of the $S$-wave interactions between the ground-state spin-$1/2$ doubly charmed baryons and Goldstone bosons. The lattice QCD simulations are carried out on four $2+1$ flavor Wilson-Clover ensembles generated by the CLQCD collaboration, with a lattice spacing $a=0.07746$ fm and two different pion masses, $M_\pi \sim 210$ and $\sim 300~\mathrm{MeV}$. Energy levels are extracted for four single channels, $\Omega_{cc}\bar{K}^{(-2,1/2)}$, $\Xi_{cc}K^{(1,1)}$, $\Xi_{cc}K^{(1,0)}$, and $\Xi_{cc}\pi^{(0,3/2)}$, where the superscripts $(S,I)$ denote strangeness $S$ and isospin $I$. Our results indicate that the $\Xi_{cc}K^{(1,0)}$ channel is attractive, exhibiting negative energy shifts relative to the non-interacting two-hadron thresholds, while the other three channels are repulsive. Using L\"uscher's finite-volume formula, we extract the near-threshold phase shifts and determine the $S$-wave scattering lengths. Furthermore, a virtual state pole is found in the $\Xi_{cc}K^{(1,0)}$ scattering amplitude. These results provide ab initio input to enable high-precision studies of the properties and spectroscopy of doubly heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>Thermal Quarkyonic Matter and Its Implications for Neutron Star Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure and basic properties of dense nuclear matter still remain one of the open problems of Physics. In particular, the composition of the matter that composes neutron stars is under theoretical and experimental investigation. Among the theories that have been proposed, apart from the classical one where the composition is dominated by hadrons, the existence or coexistence of deconfined quark matter is a dominant guess. An approach towards this solution is the phenomenological view according to which the existence of quarkyonic matter plays a dominant role in the construction of the equation of state (EOS). According to it the structure of the EOS is based on the existence of the quarkyonic particle which is a hybrid state of a particle that combines properties of hadronic and quark matter with a corresponding representation in momentum space. In this paper we propose a phenomenological model for hot quarkyonic matter, borrowed from corresponding applications in hadronic models, where the interaction in the quarkyonic matter depends not only on the position but also on the momentum of the quarkyonic particles. This consideration, as we demonstrate, can have a remarkable consequence on the shape of the EOS and thus on the properties of neutron stars, especially in those for which the effect of temperature is significant, offering a sufficiently flexible model. Comparison with recent observational data can place constraints on the parameterization of the particular model and help improve its reliability.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity to low-mass WIMPs with an improved liquid argon ionization response model within the DarkSide programme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter detection experiments using liquid argon rely on a precise characterization of the ionization response to nuclear recoils, especially in the keV energy range relevant for light dark matter interactions. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis that combines new measurements from the ReD setup, part of the DarkSide experimental program, with calibration data from DarkSide-50, as well as results from the ARIS and SCENE experiments. These combined datasets enable improved constraints on atomic screening effects in the modeling of the ionization response of liquid argon to nuclear recoils. By including the updated ionization model into the DarkSide-50 analysis framework, we obtain stronger exclusion limits on low-mass WIMP interactions, setting new world-leading constraints in the 1-3 GeV/c$^2$ WIMP mass range. Finally, we recast the sensitivity projections for the upcoming DarkSide-20k detector, demonstrating a significantly enhanced discovery potential for low-mass dark matter candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13642v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend previous metric-based Schwarzschild studies of gravitational--electromagnetic (GEM) coupling to rotating black holes by working directly in a curvature-based Newman--Penrose/Teukolsky framework on Kerr spacetime. Within a minimally coupled Einstein--Maxwell system, we derive explicit quadratic electromagnetic source terms for the spin-$-2$ Teukolsky equation, providing a foundation for future numerical studies of GEM interactions in the framework of black-hole spectroscopy. Moreover, we give order-of-magnitude arguments showing that GEM quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs) can become relevant in a range of charged and magnetized astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we show through a brief dilaton-theory example that the GEM QQNM spectrum is sensitive to how gravity couples to electromagnetism, thereby providing a model-based way to test minimal coupling and to constrain hidden $U(1)$ sectors with gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>A model-independent assessment of the late-time dark energy density evolution</title>

Abstract: Combined measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), have recently challenged the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm, indicating potential evidence for a dynamical dark energy component. These results are usually obtained in the context of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameterizations, generally implying in phantom-crossing at intermediate redshifts. However, a general mapping between these parameterizations that yields approximately the same background observables clouds the inference of the true nature of dark energy in the context of these parametric methods. In this work, we propose a model-independent reconstruction of the dark energy density, which is more directly constrained than its EoS, based on the Gaussian Process (GP) regression method with the use of DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 SN Ia samples. In addition, we perform a statistical comparison between the energy densities of $\Lambda$, a non-phantom thawing quintessence-type dark energy, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization with the reconstructed function. We find that all models agree with the GP reconstruction at 95\% C.L., with the largest discrepancy coming from $\Lambda$CDM with DESY5 at low redshifts. Even in this case, our findings suggest that it may be premature to claim statistically significant evidence for evolving or phantom dark energy with current DESI and SN Ia measurements.</description>

      <title>The Scatter of the Many Outweighs the Scatter of the Few: Systematic Error Asymmetry in Steeply-Falling Mass Functions for High-Redshift JWST Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of massive, high redshift galaxies with JWST has been argued to challenge $\Lambda$CDM: such systems would require extremely rare halos and baryon-to-stellar-mass conversion efficiencies unphysically approaching--or exceeding--100%. If confirmed at galaxy formation forbidden efficiencies, these galaxies could signal new physics beyond standard cosmological structure formation. We develop a galaxy model framework that ties the linear power spectrum to the inferred efficiencies of galaxy growth in order to test the structure formation models. In addition, we incorporate multiple sources of error, including (i) observational sample variance, (ii) asymmetric scatter induced by the steepness of the high-mass halo tail, and (iii) systematic uncertainties in stellar mass estimates. We find that the inferred efficiency of star formation is dominated by systematic uncertainties on the spectral energy distribution inferred stellar mass of the JWST detected galaxies. The systematic uncertainty augments the asymmetry in scatter that largely brings the inferred efficiencies to be in line with that expected from early galaxy formation models. Our framework can be used to test $\Lambda$CDM as errors are reduced and further detections are made.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction Codes for Truncated SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct two quantum error correction codes for pure SU(2) lattice gauge theory in the electric basis truncated at the electric flux $j_{\rm max}=1/2$, which are applicable on quasi-1D plaquette chains, 2D honeycomb and 3D triamond and hyperhoneycomb lattices. The first code converts Gauss's law at each vertex into a stabilizer while the second only uses half vertices and is locally the carbon code. Both codes are able to correct single-qubit errors. The electric and magnetic terms in the SU(2) Hamiltonian are expressed in terms of logical gates in both codes. The logical-gate Hamiltonian in the first code exactly matches the spin Hamiltonian for gauge singlet states found in previous work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At present, there are several measurements of $B$ decays that exhibit discrepancies with the predictions of the Standard Model, and suggest the presence of new physics in $b\to s$ and $b \to c(u)$ quark level transitions. Motivated by the prospects of the ongoing high-luminosity $B$ factories, we study the exclusive $B \to a_1 (1260) \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$ process within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) formalism, to understand the sensitivity of new physics. The new physics parameters are constrained by using the experimental branching fractions of the (semi)leptonic $B \to \ell \bar{\nu}$ and $B \to (\pi, \rho, \omega) \ell \bar{\nu}$ processes (where $\ell = e, \mu, \tau$) which undergo $b \to u \ell \bar{\nu}$ quark level transitions. We then perform a comprehensive angular analysis of the exclusive $B \to a_1 (1260) \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$ process in the Standard Model and in the presence of various new physics operators. We also provide the predictions and comment on various observables, such as branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry, and the test of lepton flavor non universality of the $B \to a_1 (1260) \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$ channel.</description>

      <title>Impact of scalar NSI with off-diagonal parameters at DUNE and P2SO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we studied the impact of the off-diagonal SNSI parameters in the future long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments DUNE and P2SO. In our analysis, we found that the sensitivities of these experiments altered in a very non-trivial way due to the presence of these parameters. Depending on the values of these parameters, they can either completely mimic the standard scenario or can wash out their CP sensitivity. For large values of parameters $\eta_{e\mu}$ and $\eta_{e\tau}$, we obtained larger mass ordering and octant sensitivities as compared to the standard three flavour scenario. For the parameter $\eta_{\mu\tau}$, the mass ordering sensitivity and the precision of $\Delta m^2_{31}$ deteriorated compared to the standard scenario. Our results also showed that the sensitivities were significantly influenced by the phases of the off-diagonal parameters.</description>

      <title>Complementarity between Cosmic String Gravitational Waves and long-lived particle searches in a laboratory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are powerful witnesses to cosmic events including any period of early matter domination. If such a period of matter domination was catalysed by metastable, long-lived particles, then there will be complementary signals to ascertain the nature of dark sector in experiments detecting primordial features in the gravitational wave (GW) power spectrum and laboratory searches for long-lived particles. We give explicit examples of global and local U(1) gauge extended dark sectors to demonstrate such a complementarity as the union of the two experiments reveals more information about the dark sector than either experiment. Demanding that Higgs-portal long-lived scalar be looked for, in various experiments such as DUNE, FASER, FASER-II, MATHUSLA, SHiP, we identify the parameter space which leads to complementary observables for GW detectors such as LISA and ET.</description>

      <title>Tagging ultra-boosted jets at FCC-hh using machine learning techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Future Circular Hadron Collider (FCC-hh) will probe unprecedented energy regimes, enabling direct searches for new elementary particles at a scale of tens of TeV. FCC-hh is currently in the planning stage, and one of its primary physics goals is to search for physics beyond the Standard Model by exploring a previously inaccessible kinematic domain. While venturing into uncharted high-energy territories promises excitement, reconstructing objects with enormous transverse momenta will require overcoming major experimental challenges. This work investigates the identification of boosted $W$ bosons and boosted top quarks in the context of three beyond the Standard Model scenarios: heavy vector-like quark ($B'$), heavy neutral gauge boson ($Z'$), and heavy neutral Higgs boson ($H$). We employ machine learning techniques, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), to identify these ultra-boosted objects in the collider from their SM background counterpart. We evaluate the performance of these techniques in distinguishing $W$ jets and top jets from QCD jets at extremely high transverse momenta ($p_{T}$) values, demonstrating their potential for future FCC-hh analyses.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Solution to the Eta Problem in Spectator Field Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of spectator field models that addresses the eta problem while providing a natural explanation for the observed slight deviation of the spectrum of curvature perturbations from scale-invariance. In particular, we analyze the effects of quantum corrections on the quadratic potential of the spectator field given by its gravitational coupling to the Ricci scalar and the inflaton energy, so-called the Hubble-induced mass term. These quantum corrections create a minimum around which the potential is flatter and to which the spectator field is attracted. We demonstrate that this attractor dynamics can naturally generate the observed slightly red-tilted spectrum of curvature perturbations. Furthermore, focusing on a curvaton model with a quadratic vacuum potential, we compute the primordial non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\text{NL}}$ and derive a predictive relationship between $f_{\text{NL}}$ and the running of the scalar spectral index. This relationship serves as a testable signature of the model. Finally, we extend the idea to a broader class of models where the spectator field is an angular component of a complex scalar field.</description>

      <title>Exploring the BSM parameter space with Neural Network aided Simulation-Based Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some of the issues that make sampling parameter spaces of various beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios computationally expensive are the high dimensionality of the input parameter space, complex likelihoods, and stringent experimental constraints. In this work, we explore likelihood-free approaches, leveraging neural network-aided Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) to alleviate this issue. We focus on three amortized SBI methods: Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), Neural Likelihood Estimation (NLE), and Neural Ratio Estimation (NRE) and perform a comparative analysis through the validation test known as the \textit{ Test of Accuracy with Random Points} (TARP), as well as through posterior sample efficiency and computational time. As an example, we focus on the scalar sector of the phenomenological minimal supersymmetric SM (pMSSM) and observe that the NPE method outperforms the others and generates correct posterior distributions of the parameters with a minimal number of samples. The efficacy of this framework is tested on 5 parameter pMSSM with Higgs and flavor physics data and its performance is compared with the MCMC method. We further add dark matter (DM) observables to make the task more challenging and consider a 9 parameter pMSSM. We observe that even though the efficiency factor drops, the amortized SBI method still produces faithful posterior distributions. SBI predicted points satisfying DM constraints are mostly bino-dominated upto $\sim$ 1.5 TeV, and are mostly wino-dominated within the 1.5 - 2 TeV range.</description>

      <title>Extended IDM theory with low scale seesaw mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed an extension of the inert doublet model in which the CP-phases in the weak sector are generated from one-loop level corrections mediated by dark fields, while the strong-CP phase arises at three-loop. In this framework, the tiny masses of the active neutrinos are produced through a radiative inverse seesaw mechanism at a two-loop level, the masses of the first and second families of SM-charged fermions arise from a one-loop level radiative seesaw mechanism, and the third generation of SM charged fermion masses are generated at tree level. We have demonstrated that the proposed model successfully accounts for SM fermion masses and mixings. The radiative nature of the seesaw mechanisms is attributed to preserved discrete symmetries, which are required for ensuring the stability of fermionic and scalar dark matter candidates. The preserved discrete symmetries also allow for multi-component dark matter, whose annihilation processes permits to successfully reproduce the measured amount of dark matter relic abundance for an appropriate region of parameter space, which has shown to be compatible with current dark matter direct detection limits. Besides that, we explore the model's ability to explain the $95$ GeV diphoton excess observed by the CMS collaboration, showing that it readily accommodates this anomaly. We have shown that charged lepton flavor violating decays acquire rates within the current experimental sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Numerical Calculation of Coulomb Corrections in Forward Elastic $p^\uparrow\!\!\;{p}$ and ${p}^\uparrow\!{A}$ Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of RHIC hydrogen gas jet target polarimeter measurements of transverse analyzing powers $A_\text{N}(t)$ in proton-nucleus scattering requires accurate Coulomb corrections to both spin-flip and non-flip amplitudes. These corrections must cover a wide range of nuclear charges $Z$ and form factor slopes, with flexibility to vary form factors during data fitting. To avoid technically challenging calculations involving a small but finite fictitious photon mass, the Coulomb correction to the non-flip electromagnetic amplitude with an exponential form factor was related to the corresponding correction for the spin-flip amplitude. This approach allows soft photon contributions to all amplitudes, including those with non-exponential form factors, to be calculated in the massless photon limit using only analytical expressions and numerically stable integrals with nonsingular integrands and finite integration limits. In addition, an absorptive correction to the spin-flip electromagnetic amplitude, which plays a critical role in spin effects in forward polarized proton-nucleus scattering, was accurately evaluated.</description>

      <title>Insights on the Cosmic Origin of Matter from Proton Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of a model in which the proton is rendered absolutely stable by an IR mechanism that remains robust against unknown quantum gravity effects. A linear combination of baryon number and lepton flavors is gauged and spontaneously broken to a residual $\mathbb{Z}_9$ discrete gauge symmetry enforcing a strict selection rule: $\Delta B = 0\,(\mathrm{mod}\,3)$. Despite its minimal field content, the model successfully accounts for established empirical evidence of physics beyond the SM. High-scale symmetry breaking simultaneously provides a seesaw mechanism explaining the smallness of neutrino masses, minimal thermal leptogenesis, and a viable phenomenology of the majoron as dark matter. Any cosmic string-wall network remaining after inflation is unstable for numerous charge assignments. Lepton flavor non-universality, central to the construction, leads to predictive neutrino textures testable via oscillation experiments, neutrinoless double beta decay, and cosmology. The model motivates searches in $X$- and $\gamma$-ray lines, neutrino telescopes, and predicts CMB imprints.</description>

Abstract: We show that the $\psi(2\mathrm S)$ subthreshold pole influences the cross section of the electron-positron annihilation into the $\mathrm D^+\mathrm D^-$ and $\mathrm D^0\bar\mathrm D^0$ final states. We perform a fit to the merged BES \cite{bes2008} and BESIII \cite{besiii2024} data, providing the cross section for $e^+e^-$ annihilation into those final states. The statistical significance of the $\psi(2\mathrm S)$ as a subthreshold pole is 8.2$\sigma$. A fit assuming it and seven resonances excels with the fit quality characterized by $\chi^2/\mathrm{NDF}=240.4/284$, which means a $p$-value of 97\%.</description>

      <title>Axion-mediated photon-to-photon transitions in high finesse dielectric resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical particles that could address both the strong charge-parity problem in quantum chromodynamics and the enigmatic nature of dark matter. However, if axions exist, their mass remains unknown, and they are expected to interact very weakly with the electromagnetic field, which explains why they have not been detected yet. This study proposes a way to substantially augment the axion-photon interaction by confining the photons within high-quality-factor dielectric resonators, increasing their intensity and lifetime, and thus the possibility of interacting with axions in the background. In view of this, we study resonant axion-mediated photonic transitions in millimeter-sized spherical dielectric resonators, based on fully analytical calculations to the first order in perturbation theory. Such resonators exhibit high lifetime Mie resonances in the microwave part of the spectrum, with a separation that can be tailored with the radius of the sphere to match the expected axion frequency, allowing axion-mediated photonic transitions when particular selection rules are fulfilled. We predict experimentally accessible axion mass regimes where such triply resonant transitions can be realized with standard dielectric resonators. We propose an experiment for probing such interactions named DARK-ROSE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a minimal, ultraviolet-complete, and renormalizable extension of the Standard Model, in which the three generations of ordinary fermions are distinguished by family-dependent hypercharges, while three right-handed neutrinos are separated by a dark gauge symmetry that is trivial for all Standard Model fields. This setup yields a fully flipped inert doublet model. The model naturally realizes a hybrid scotoseesaw mechanism that accounts for the smallness of neutrino masses and the largeness of lepton mixing. Simultaneously, it explains the stability and relic abundance of dark matter through a residual dark parity and addresses the hierarchies of charged fermion masses and the suppression of quark mixing via higher-dimensional operators involving high-scale scalar singlets and vector-like fermions. We explore the phenomenological implications of the model and derive constraints from electroweak precision tests, collider searches, flavor-changing processes, and observations of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16482v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review recent progress in our understanding of the nucleon excitation spectrum. Thanks to dedicated efforts at facilities such as ELSA, MAMI and Jefferson Lab, several new nucleon resonances have been discovered, and evidence for previously elusive states has been significantly improved. Numerous decay channels have been observed for the first time, and resonance properties are being extracted from these data by several groups through coupled-channel analyses of varying complexity. Electroproduction experiments have provided further insights into the internal structure of light baryon resonances -- for example, the long-debated Roper resonance $N(1440)$ is observed as a three-quark state with a significant meson-cloud component.While the non-relativistic quark model remains a valuable tool for organizing the spectrum of nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances, a variety of theoretical frameworks have emerged to offer deeper understanding, including phenomenological quark models, holographic QCD, functional methods, effective field theories, and lattice QCD. We examine the interplay between these approaches, highlight their respective strengths and explore how they complement each other in shaping our knowledge of light baryon resonances. We address several open questions in baryon spectroscopy, including the nature of the enigmatic $\Lambda(1405)$, ongoing searches for exotic states such as hybrid baryons and pentaquarks, and the dichotomy between microscopic descriptions of baryons in terms of quarks and gluons versus effective hadronic descriptions based on meson-baryon dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Event-by-event QCD kinetic theory simulations are hindered by the large numerical cost of evaluating the high-dimensional collision integral in the Boltzmann equation. In this work, we show that a neural network can be used to obtain an accurate estimate of the collision integral in a fraction of the time required for the ordinary Monte Carlo evaluation of the integral. We demonstrate that for isotropic and anisotropic distribution functions, the network accurately predicts the time evolution of the distribution function, which we verify by performing traditional evaluations of the collision integral and comparing several moments of the distribution function. This work sets the stage for an event-by-event modeling of the pre-equilibrium initial stages in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: The diabatic dynamical diquark model is designed to unify diquark and molecular approaches for exotic hadrons, by including the effects of di-meson thresholds on fundamental diquark-antidiquark states in order to form physical tetraquarks. We generalize this model by implementing the consequences of heavy-quark spin symmetry for each di-meson pair. We include the specific spin factors and mass differences associated with mesons related by this symmetry (such as $D, D^*$), both features being necessary for the systematic incorporation of effects beyond the static, heavy-source limit inherent to the (adiabatic) Born-Oppenheimer treatment. We obtain explicit interaction potentials for all $J = 0, 1, 2$ states, along the way deriving unusual variants of Fierz reordering identities, and discuss the application of the potentials to specific physical states such as $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ and $T_{c\bar c 1}(3900)$.</description>

      <title>Impact of flavour coupling on $SO(10)$-inspired leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the impact of flavour coupling on the predictions of low energy neutrino parameters from $SO(10)$-inspired leptogenesis (SO10INLEP). The right-handed (RH) neutrino mass spectrum is strongly hierarchical and successful leptogenesis relies on generating the asymmetry from next-to-lightest RH neutrino decays ($N_2$-leptogenesis) and circumventing the lightest RH neutrino washout. These two conditions yield distinctive predictions such as a lower bound on the lightest neutrino mass $m_1 \gtrsim 1\,{\rm meV}$. We first review the status of SO10INLEP, noticing how cosmological observations are now testing a particular neutrino mass window, $m_1 \simeq (10$--$30)\,{\rm meV}$, where only the first octant is allowed and a large range of values for the Dirac phase is excluded. Including flavour coupling, we find that the lower bound relaxes to $m_1 \gtrsim 0.65\,{\rm meV}$. Moreover, new muon-dominated solutions appear slightly relaxing the upper bound on the atmospheric mixing angle. We also study the impact on strong thermal SO10INLEP (ST-SO10INLEP) scenario where, in addition to successful leptogenesis, one can washout a large pre-existing asymmetry. Contrarily to naive expectations, for which flavour coupling could jeopardise the scenario, allowing a large pre-existing asymmetry to survive unconditionally, we show, and explain analytically, that ST-SO10INLEP is still viable within almost the same allowed region of parameters. There is even a slight relaxation of the $m_1$ viable window from (9--30)meV to (4--40)meV for a $10^{-3}$ pre-existing asymmetry. The new results from atmospheric neutrinos, mildly favouring normal ordering and first octant, are now in nice agreement with the predictions of ST-SO10INLEP. Intriguingly, the predicted $0\nu\beta\beta$ signal is starting to be within the reach of KamLAND-Zen.</description>

      <title>Production-Dependent Interpretation of the KLOE--MAMI $\eta\!\to\!\pi^{0}\gamma\gamma$ Tension via the Nucleon-Triggered Leptophobic Vector $V_{\!\mathcal B}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent KLOE measurement $\mathrm{BR}^{\eta\rightarrow\pi^{0}\gamma\gamma}_{\text{KLOE}} = (0.98\pm0.11_{\text{stat}}\pm0.14_{\text{syst}})\times10^{-4}$ is less than half the current world average, $(2.55\pm0.22)\times10^{-4}$, dominated by MAMI photoproduction data. We show that this $\approx 5.5\, \sigma$ discrepancy can be resolved by the new leptophobic, nucleon-triggered vector particle $V_{\mathcal B}$ with \(1.5~\text{GeV}\lesssim m_{V_{\!\mathcal B}}\lesssim5~\text{GeV}\), coupled via the effective operator \(\bigl(\bar N N\bigr)\,\widetilde V_{\mathcal{B}}^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}P\). This interaction modifies the \(\eta^{(\prime)}\!\to\!\pi^{0}\left(\eta\right)\gamma\gamma\) decay rates \textit{only} in the processes involving an external nucleon current, \(\gamma p\!\to\!\eta^{(\prime)}p\) and \(\pi^-p\!\to\!\eta^{(\prime)}n\), but leaves purely leptonic production channels, such as \(e^+e^-\to \phi\to\eta^{(\prime)}\gamma\) at KLOE and \(e^+e^-\to J/\psi\to\gamma\eta^{(\prime)}\) at BESIII, Standard-Model-like. The same mechanism predicts a \(\approx 10\%\) nucleon-triggered enhancement of the \(\eta^\prime\!\to\!\pi^{0}\gamma\gamma\) decay rate and a negligible shift for \(\eta^\prime\!\to\!\eta\gamma\gamma\), together with an \(\rm{A}^{2}\)-scaling boost if produced on heavy nuclei instead of protons. $V_{\!\mathcal B}$ can be searched directly in $2\!\to\!3$ photoproduction, for example, $\gamma p\!\to\!V_{\!\mathcal B}\,\pi^{0} p$. An integrated experimental program that compares $\eta^{(\prime)}\!\to\!\pi^{0}(\eta)\gamma\gamma$ in the presence of external nucleon currents with purely leptonic production, and conducts direct photoproduction searches for a GeV-scale vector, can decisively confirm or exclude our nucleon-rescaled, leptophobic-vector interpretation of the KLOE--MAMI discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Spin correlations and Bell nonlocality in $\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ pair production from $e^+e^-$ collisions with a thrust cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of spin correlations in $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ production from $e^+e^-$ annihilation, providing the theoretical predictions for the Belle II experiment. Using soft-collinear effective theory, we perform the first resummation of large logarithms for the longitudinal ($C_{LL}$) and transverse ($C_{TT}$) spin correlations for events with a cut on the thrust variable. Our calculation achieves next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy and incorporates the determination of polarized fragmenting jet functions. This framework provides robust predictions with significantly reduced theoretical uncertainties compared to fixed-order parton model approaches. Furthermore, we establish a direct mapping between the experimentally accessible spin correlation, $C_{TT}$, and a testable CHSH-Bell inequality. This result reframes $C_{TT}$ as a quantitative probe of quantum decoherence, providing a novel tool to measure the degree of parton-level entanglement that survives the fragmentation and hadronization process.</description>

      <title>Correlation function for the $n \bar{D}_{s0}^*(2317)$ interaction and the issue of elastic unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interaction of a neutron with the $\bar D_{s0}^*(2317)$ resonance and look at the amplitude below threshold and close above threshold. The study is done from the perspective that the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ resonance is a molecular state of $DK$ in $I=0$. To study this interaction, we use the Fixed Center Approximation to Faddeev equations that considers the $DK$ molecule as the cluster and the neutron as the external particle. We improve the Fixed Center approach to implement elastic unitarity around threshold, which is needed to obtain scattering parameters and to evaluate the $n \bar D_{s0}^*(2317)$ correlation function that we determine here. One interesting result of the study is the appearance of a resonant state below threshold with a binding of about 130 MeV and a width of about 80 MeV, which we suggest to look at in reactions measuring the invariant mass of $\pi \Sigma \bar D$. The ALICE collaboration has initiated studies of this type, by looking at the $p f_1(1285)$ correlation function, and we can only encourage work in this direction which should provide much valuable information on the nature of many resonant states.</description>

      <title>Constraints on millicharged particles from nuclear gamma-decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider nuclear gamma decays and $\gamma$-emitting reactions that can be an efficient source of hypothetical millicharged particles ($\chi$). In particular, we revisit the production of millicharged particles in nuclear reactor environment, pointing out that $\gamma$ cascades from $^{239}$U is an overlooked yet a powerful source of $\chi\bar\chi$ pairs. This leads to an increased flux compared to previous studies. We then apply new estimates of the flux to derive novel limits on the value of millicharge, $\varepsilon = Q_\chi/e$, from the electron recoil searched for in a variety of experiments placed in proximity to the reactor cores. The derived limits on $\varepsilon$ are the strongest in the interval of masses $\sim 0.7-2 $\,MeV. We also derive the MCP flux from the Sun and point out potential sensitivity of the low-threshold dark matter search experiments.</description>

      <title>Extracting Higgs Self-Coupling Constraints through Triple Higgs Boson Production at Future Hadron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of triple Higgs boson production at future high-energy hadron colliders, using the six-$b$-jet final state as a probe of the Higgs self-interactions. We conduct, under realistic detector smearing assumptions, both a traditional cut-based analysis, and a multivariate one using gradient boosting. The multivariate strategy is found to enhance sensitivity to beyond the Standard Model effects on the Higgs boson's self-couplings, while preserving large signal event yields, thus enabling more robust statistical inference. This allows us to assess the impact of detector effects, systematic uncertainties, background normalisation, as well as different truncation choices in an effective-field-theory description of the new physics effects possibly affecting the Higgs boson's self-interactions. Our results demonstrate that statistically-meaningful and perturbative-unitarity-compatible constraints on the trilinear and quartic Higgs boson self-couplings can be achieved, provided that systematic uncertainties are controlled at the few-percent level. Finally, we extrapolate our results to various collider energies and luminosities, demonstrating in particular that an 85 TeV proton-proton collider performs comparably to a 100 TeV machine. Altogether, our findings therefore establish the six-$b$ channel as a viable probe of the Higgs self-interactions at most future hadron collider options currently being examined by the high-energy physics community.</description>

      <title>Initial-state geometry and multiplicity distributions in pp and pPb collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the possibility of accessing the initial geometric shape of the proton in proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC, in particular the configuration in which the proton is made of three quarks linked by a Y-shape gluon string, called baryon junction. This initial state spatial configuration has been used in the past to describe data on baryon rapidity distributions, diffractive $J/\psi$ production and multiplicity distributions in pp collisions. In spite of its success in explaining the data, the evidence of the baryon junction still needs confirmation. Further studies will be undertaken at the electron-ion collider. In this work we study multiplicity distributions measured in pp and pPb collisions. Different initial state geometries are used as input in a Monte Carlo event generator which implements the $k_T$-factorization formalism of the CGC with KLN unintegrated gluon distributions. The results indicate that the hard-sphere and Gaussian proton configurations are incompatible with the data. In contrast, the baryon junction configuration can describe the data provided that intrinsic fluctuations of the saturation scale are included.</description>

      <title>Unified Resummation of Soft Gluon Radiation in Heavy Meson Pair Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified resummation framework for heavy-meson pair photoproduction that treats soft-gluon radiation in a massive scheme for $|\boldsymbol q| \lesssim m_Q$ and is consistent with the massless limit $m_Q \ll |\boldsymbol q|$, where $\boldsymbol q$ denotes the transverse momentum of the pair and $m_Q$ the quark mass. This framework describes the full correlation regime $|\boldsymbol q| \ll |\boldsymbol P|$, with $\boldsymbol P$ the pair's relative transverse momentum. Next, within the Color Glass Condensate framework, we quantify the impact of soft gluon radiation on two important phenomenological observables, namely, the azimuthal $\Delta\phi$ correlation and the harmonic asymmetries $\langle \cos(2n\phi_{qP})\rangle$. Our results show that the resummation provides an excellent description of the H1 $\Delta\phi$ data. We then find that the angular-asymmetry harmonics are sizable and their ratios in $\gamma A$ to $\gamma p$ collisions are highly sensitive to gluon saturation. We further find a clear mass hierarchy in both observables, indicating that heavy-quark masses suppress soft radiation and thereby enhance genuine small-$x$ saturation signals. Our work demonstrates that heavy-quark pair photoproduction provides a quantitative probe of gluon saturation, directly measurable in forthcoming EIC and UPC measurements. Finally, the unified resummation is readily extendable to other processes involving massive particles and jets in both $eA$ and $pA$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hadronic $\tau$ decays present an opportunity to determine the isovector part of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in a way complementary to $e^+e^-\to\text{hadrons}$ cross sections. However, the required isospin rotation is only exact in the isospin limit, and corrections need to be under control to draw robust conclusions, most notably for $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ decays to determine the two-pion contribution, $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$. In this work, we present a novel analysis of the required radiative corrections using dispersion relations, thereby extending in a model-independent way the previous analysis in chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) beyond the threshold region. In particular, we include the dominant structure-dependent virtual corrections from pion-pole diagrams, leading to sizable changes in the vicinity of the $\rho(770)$ resonance. Moreover, we work out the matching to ChPT and devise a strategy for a stable numerical evaluation of real-emission contributions near the two-pion threshold, which proves important to capture isospin-breaking corrections enhanced by the threshold singularity. For the numerical analysis, we use a dispersive representation of the pion form factor including the $\rho'$, $\rho''$ resonances, perform fits to the available data sets for the $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ spectral function, and calculate the corresponding radiative correction factor $G_\text{EM}(s)$ in a self-consistent manner. Based on these results, we evaluate the $\tau$-specific isospin-breaking corrections to $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of a top-quark pair, the heaviest known elementary particle, in association with a light jet is a key process for studying the properties of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. Due to its significance as a signal process with considerable sensitivity to the top-quark mass and as a background process for new physics searches, it is crucial to predict differential cross sections with high precision. In this article, we present, for the first time, predictions for various kinematical observables at next-to-next-to-leading order in Quantum Chromodynamics. The perturbative behavior is analyzed, and uncertainties arising from missing higher-order contributions are substantially reduced. The necessary two-loop amplitudes have been evaluated in the leading-color approximation, and we provide estimates for the impact of the missing contributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by known facts about effective field theory and non-Abelian gauge theory, we argue that the post-Newtonian approximation might fail even in the limit of weak fields and small velocities for wide-extended rotating bodies, where angular momentum spans significant spacetime curvature. We construct a novel dimensionless quantity that samples this breakdown, and we evaluate it by means of existing analytical solutions of rotating extended bodies and observational data. We give estimates for galaxies and binary systems, as well as our home in the Cosmos, Laniakea. We thus propose that a novel effective field theory of general relativity might be needed to account for the onset of nonlocal angular momentum effects.</description>

Abstract: Our present contribution sets out to investigate a scenario based on the effects of the Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) on the electromagnetic sector of the Standard Model of Fundamental Interactions and Particle Physics (SM). Starting then from a post-Maxwellian version of Electromagnetism that includes LQG effects, we work out and discuss the influence of LQG parameters on classical quantities, such as the components of the stress-tensor. Furthermore, we inspect the propagation of electromagnetic waves and study optical properties of the QED vacuum in this scenario. Among these, we contemplate the combined effect between the LQG parameters and a homogeneous background magnetic field on the propagation of electromagnetic waves, considering in detail issues like group velocities and refractive indices of the QED vacuum. Finally, with the help of the LQG-extended photonic dispersion relations previously analyzed, we re-discuss the kinematics of the Compton effect and conclude that there emerges an interesting nonlinear profile in the wavelengths of both the incoming and the deflected photons.</description>

      <title>Complementary signatures of $\alpha-$attractor inflation in CMB and cosmic string Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When cosmic strings are formed during inflation, they regrow to reach a scaling regime, leaving distinct imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Such signatures, associated with specific primordial features, can be detected by upcoming gravitational wave observatories, such as the LISA and Einstein Telescope (ET). Our analysis explores scenarios in which cosmic strings form either before or during inflation. We examine how the number of e-folds experienced by cosmic strings during inflation correlates with the predictions of inflationary models observable in cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. This correlation provides a testable link between inflationary physics and the associated gravitational wave signals in a complementary manner. Focusing on $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation, with the Polynomial $\alpha$-attractor serving as an illustrative example, we find constraints, for instance, on the spectral index $n_s$ to $0.962 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.972$ for polynomial exponent $n=1$, $0.956 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.968$ for $n=2$, $0.954 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.965$ for $n=3$, and $0.963 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.964$ for $n=4$, which along with the GW signals from LISA, are capable of detecting local cosmic strings that have experienced $\sim 34 - 47$ e-folds of inflation consistent with current Planck data and are also testable in upcoming CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD and CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>The $\eta^\prime N$ interaction from the $\eta^\prime p$ correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate for the first time the $\eta^\prime p$ femtoscopic correlation function to study the $\eta^\prime N$ interaction. We find it extremely sensitive to the value of the $\eta^\prime p$ scattering length, for which at present there exists only very limited information, not even knowing its sign. The measurement of this correlation function would provide much valuable information on the $\eta^\prime N$ interaction, which could then also be used to settle the issue of possible $\eta^\prime$ nucleus bound states, an issue attracting much attention in the nuclear physics community.</description>

      <title>Quintessential Inflation in Palatini $F(R,X)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Palatini $F(R,X)$ gravity, with $X$ the inflaton kinetic term, proved to be a powerful framework for generating asymptotically flat inflaton potentials. Here we show that a quadratic Palatini $F(R,X)$ restores compatibility with the observational data of the Peebles-Vilenkin quintessential inflation model. Moreover, the same can be achieved with an exponential version of the Peebles-Vilenkin potential if embedded in a Palatini $F(R,X)$ of order higher than two.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative renormalization group for pseudo-hermitian scalar fields in 4D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a model of 2 coupled SU(2) doublets of scalar fields in $4$ spacetime dimensions which have a rich structure of renormalization group (RG) flows to 1-loop when the SU(2) is broken to U(1). The model is pseudo-hermitian, $H^\dagger = {\cal K} H {\cal K}^\dagger$ with ${\cal K}^\dagger {\cal K} = {\cal K}^2 =1$, which makes it non-unitary, however in a very specific manner with some desirable properties. In this article we mainly leave the non-unitarity issue aside and focus on the RG flows to higher orders in perturbation theory, which is sufficient for applications of non-unitary quantum field theory to statistical mechanics. We compute the beta functions to 3 loops from the operator product expansion and show that the 1-loop structure of flows persists to higher orders. For SU(2) broken to U(1), we conjecture a beta function to all orders. The flows can be extended to large coupling using a strong-weak coupling duality $g \to 1/g$ One finds a line of fixed points which are non-unitary conformal field theories in 4 spacetime dimensions that were previously unknown. We also find massless flows between 2 non-trivial fixed points, and a regime with a cyclic RG flow, which is allowed since the model is non-unitary. For the flows between fixed points on the critical line, we compute the anomalous dimensions of the perturbations in the UV and IR, and identify some special points where anomalous dimensions are rational numbers.</description>

      <title>On canonical differential equations for Calabi-Yau multi-scale Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalise a method recently introduced in the literature, that derives canonical differential equations, to multi-scale Feynman integrals with an underlying Calabi-Yau geometry. We start by recomputing a canonical form for the sunrise integral with all unequal masses. Additionally, we compute for the first time a canonical form for the three-loop banana integral with two unequal masses and for a four-loop banana integral with two unequal masses. For the integrals we compute, we find an $\epsilon$-form whose connection has at most simple poles. We motivate our construction by studying the Picard-Fuchs operators acting on the integrals considered. In the appendices, we give a constructive explanation for why our generalisation works.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Benchmark of Proton Helicity and Flavor-Dependent Unpolarized Transverse Momentum-Dependent Parton Distribution Functions at Physical Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD calculations of the isovector helicity transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) and the flavor-dependent unpolarized TMDPDFs for up and down quarks in the proton. Our computations utilize domain-wall fermion discretization with physical quark masses. Employing Coulomb-gauge-fixed quark correlation functions within the large-momentum effective theory framework, we access nonperturbative transverse quark separations $b_T$ up to approximately 1 fm, corresponding to transverse momenta as low as 200 MeV. Based on the quasi-TMD factorization theorem, we construct renormalization-group-invariant ratios that are equal to the corresponding light-cone TMDPDF ratios. At moderate $x$, our results reveal that the isovector helicity and unpolarized TMDPDFs exhibit nearly identical transverse structure up to a normalization factor, and the unpolarized distributions display only mild flavor dependence. These findings not only support key trends observed in recent global analyses but also provide robust, nonperturbative constraints that can distinguish between different parameterizations. This work establishes a first-principles benchmark for TMDPDFs, offering valuable input for ongoing and future experimental efforts to map the proton's three-dimensional structure.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark-Matter Spikes and the Final-Parsec Problem: Bayesian constraints from the NANOGrav 15-Year Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) density spike around merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be able to supply the dynamical friction needed to shrink binaries from $\sim 1\, \mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-2} \,\mathrm{pc}$, thereby resolving the long-standing ''final-parsec problem''. Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15-year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing dark energy with model independent methods after DESI DR2 BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ two model-independent approaches, including redshift binning method and polynomial interpolation method, to reconstruct dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) $w(z)$ and DE density function $f(z)$. Our analysis incorporates data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release 2, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors from Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope data release 6, and three Type Ia supernovae (SN) compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5). To ensure model independence, we adopt three redshift binning schemes (n=3, 4, 5) and three polynomial interpolation schemes with the same number of nodes (n=3, 4, 5). Our main conclusions are as follows: 1) After taking into account DESI data, there is a trend that DE should evolve with redshift (with deviations from the cosmological constant reaching at least a $2.13\sigma$ confidence level), indicating that current observations favor a dynamical DE. 2) In the redshift range $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$, the DE EoS w(z) exhibits a decreasing trend and crosses the phantom divide $w=-1$, suggesting quintom-like behavior. 3) The DE density f(z) first increases at low redshift, reaching a hump around $z\approx 0.5$, and then decreases at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$, with a rapid decrease at $z&gt;1.0$. 4) For $z &gt; 1.5$, current data are insufficient to place strong constraints on the evolution of DE, resulting in large uncertainties in the DE reconstruction. It must be emphasized that, these four main conclusions are independent of specific reconstruction models, and are insensitive to the choice of SN compilations.</description>

      <title>The Preheating Stage on The Starobinsky Inflation after ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we reinvestigate the Starobinsky inflation model and its reheating features in light of the recent ACT results. To make the Starobinsky model consistent with the ACT data at the $68\%$ confidence level, the number of e-folds must increase while the reheating temperature decreases. We find that the Starobinsky model requires a spectator field to achieve efficient preheating. The preheating stage and the reheating temperature must be significantly adjusted to accommodate the lower temperature. In this paper, the favored non-minimal coupling of the produced particles is approximately $10$ or slightly lower. We also present viable parameter sets that fit the preferred reheating mechanism in this model. For certain parameter choices, the daughter fields could potentially be detected in future collider experiments such as the LHC or the ILC. Furthermore, our proposed mechanism can reproduce the lower reheating temperature, but it fails when the temperature falls below $1$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Two-loop vacuum polarization in a Coulomb field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The leading-order two-loop vacuum-polarization potential, linear in the Coulomb field of a nucleus, was first derived in the seminal 1955 work of K\"all\'en-Sabry. The higher-order two-loop vacuum-polarization corrections, however, have remained unknown until now. In this work, we compute Coulomb corrections to the K\"all\'en-Sabry potential, specifically those involving three, five, and seven Coulomb interactions inside the vacuum-polarization loop. The potentials are evaluated in momentum space and subsequently used to calculate one-electron energy shifts. Our results drastically reduce the theoretical uncertainty of the two-loop vacuum-polarization contribution to transition energies, which is required for next-generation tests of bound-state QED in heavy one and few-electron ions as well as for the determination of nuclear charge radii.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous collapse effects on relativistic fermionic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study expands the spontaneous collapse assumptions into the relativistic quantum field theory framework for Dirac fields. By solving Lindblad's master equation using the Keldysh formalism, the effective action is derived, which captures the dynamics of fermions with spontaneous collapse represented as an imaginary self-interaction term. Utilizing the corresponding Dyson-Schwinger equations at 1-loop approximation, the effective mass induced by the nonlinearity is computed. The findings indicate the presence of a new mechanism that introduces a qualitative change in the mass spectrum, where the particle's mass becomes complex. This mechanism, which generates a Lorentz invariance violation in the infrared regime, recovers the Lorentz invariance in the ultraviolet regime. The corresponding hydrodynamics of the system is analyzed through the Keldysh component of the propagator, and a conserved charge is found. In contrast, the energy-momentum tensor is shown to be non-conserving. This phenomenon represents a new contribution to the understanding of the spontaneous collapse and the transition from quantum to the classical realm.</description>

      <title>New Evidence for Extragalactic Einstein Probe Transients associated with Long Gamma-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of extragalactic fast X-ray transients (EFXTs) remains a fundamental open question in high-energy astrophysics. The Einstein Probe (EP) mission provides a transformative opportunity to investigate their nature. While mounting observations of EP-discovered EFXTs (EP-EFXTs) suggest a possible connection to long gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs), an in-depth comparative analysis between them remains lacking. Here, we present a comparative analysis of their cosmic formation histories, revealing that EP-EFXTs and lGRBs share a similar evolutionary trend-showing a marked decline at $z&lt;1.0$ and a plateau beyond $1.0&lt;z&lt;5$-which clearly distinguishes them from short GRBs. This result is derived from a rigorously selected sample of EP-EFXTs, using Lynden-Bell's $c^{-}$ method to reconstruct, for the first time, the luminosity function and formation rate of EP-EFXTs without any assumptions. Our findings provide independent evidence that EP-EFXTs and lGRBs may originate from a common progenitor channel.</description>

      <title>Importance of being nonminimally coupled: Scalar Hawking radiation from regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In curved space-time, a scalar field $\phi$ is generically expected to couple to curvature, via a coupling of the form $\xi\phi^2R$. Yet in the study of Hawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often introduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is generically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored. We revisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four representative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case $\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation. We compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter can be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A crucial role is played by the sign of the term $\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g_{tt}$ in Schwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal coupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier. For the D'Ambrosio-Rovelli case with large negative $\xi$, the low-energy emission spectrum is enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude, since $\xi fR&lt;0$ throughout the space-time, leading to a deep potential well which broadens the transmissive window. The deviations we find can be particularly relevant in the case where primordial RBHs are dark matter candidates, given the impact of the non-minimal coupling on their evaporation history.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in Asymptotic Safety: A Review of Solutions and Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic Safety offers a conservative and predictive framework for quantum gravity, based on the existence of a renormalization group fixed point that ensures ultraviolet completeness without introducing new degrees of freedom. Black holes provide a natural arena in which to explore the implications of this scenario, as they probe the strongest gravitational fields and highlight the shortcomings of classical general relativity. In recent years, a variety of quantum-corrected black-hole solutions have been constructed within the Asymptotic Safety approach, either by renormalization-group improvement of classical metrics or through effective actions inspired by the flow of couplings. This review summarizes the current status of these developments. We discuss the structure and properties of the proposed solutions, their thermodynamics and evaporation, and their dynamical aspects such as quasinormal modes and shadows.</description>

Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions provide a unique environment for synthesizing both nuclei and antinuclei (such as $\bar{d}$ and $\overline{^4\text{He}}$) at temperatures ($k_BT\sim100$ MeV) nearly two orders of magnitude above their binding energies of a few MeV. The underlying production mechanism, whether through statistical hadronization, nucleon coalescence, or dynamical regeneration and disintegration, remains unsettled. Here we address this question using a novel tool of pion-nucleus femtoscopy. By solving relativistic kinetic equations for pion-catalyzed reactions ($\pi NN \leftrightarrow \pi d$) for deuteron production and including a $70~\mathrm{MeV}/c^2$ downward shift of the in-medium $\Delta(1232)$ mass, we successfully reproduce the resonance peaks observed by the ALICE Collaboration in both $\pi^+-p$ and $\pi^+-d$ femtoscopic correlation functions in high-multiplicity $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13~\mathrm{TeV}$. We further find that the nucleon coalescence model reproduces only about half of the observed peak strength, while the statistical hadronization model predicts no resonance feature. These results provide compelling evidence that pion-catalyzed reactions play a dominant role in the production of light (anti-)nuclei in high-energy nuclear collisions and cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>A new multiprobe analysis of modified gravity and evolving dark energy</title>

Abstract: We study the $(w_0, \, w_a)$ parametrization of the dark energy (DE) equation of state, with and without the effective field theory of dark energy (EFTofDE) framework to describe the DE perturbations, parametrized here by the braiding parameter $\alpha_B$ and the running of the Planck mass $\alpha_M$. We combine the EFTofLSS full-shape analysis of the power spectrum and bispectrum of BOSS data with the tomographic angular power spectra $C_\ell^{gg}$, $C_\ell^{\kappa g}$, $C_\ell^{Tg}$ and $C_\ell^{T\kappa}$, where $g$, $\kappa$ and $T$ stand for the DESI luminous red galaxy map, Planck PR4 lensing map and Planck PR4 temperature map, respectively. To analyze these angular power spectra, we go beyond the Limber approximation, allowing us to include large-scales data in $C_\ell^{gg}$. The combination of all these probes with Planck PR4, DESI DR2 BAO and DES Y5 improves the constraint on the 2D posterior distribution of $\{w_0, \, w_a\}$ by $\sim 50 \%$ and increases the preference for evolving dark energy over $\Lambda$ from $3.8 \sigma$ to $4.6 \sigma$. When we remove BAO and supernovae data, we obtain a hint for evolving dark energy at $2.3 \sigma$. Regarding the EFTofDE parameters, we improve the constraints on $\alpha_B$ and $\alpha_M$ by $\sim 40 \%$ and $50 \%$ respectively, finding results compatible with general relativity at $\sim 2 \sigma$. We show that these constraints do not depend on the choice of the BAO and supernovae likelihoods.</description>
