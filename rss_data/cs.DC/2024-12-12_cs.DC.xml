      <title>Demystifying Workload Imbalances in Large Transformer Model Training over Variable-length Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To optimize large Transformer model training, efficient parallel computing and advanced data management are essential. However, current methods often assume a stable and uniform training workload, neglecting imbalances in data sampling and packing that can impede performance. Specifically, data sampling imbalance arises from uneven sequence length distribution of the training data, while data packing imbalance stems from the discrepancy between the linear memory complexity and quadratic time complexity of the attention mechanism. To address these imbalance issues, we develop Hydraulis, which jointly optimizes the parallel strategies and data assignment. For one thing, we introduce large model training with dynamic heterogeneous parallel strategies in response to the sequence length variations within and across training iterations. For another, we devise a two-stage data assignment approach, which strikes a good balance in terms of the training workloads both within and across model replicas. Empirical results demonstrate that Hydraulis outperforms existing systems by 1.32-2.66 times.</description>

      <title>Parsl+CWL: Towards Combining the Python and CWL Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is a widely adopted language for defining and sharing computational workflows. It is designed to be independent of the execution engine on which workflows are executed. In this paper, we describe our experiences integrating CWL with Parsl, a Python-based parallel programming library designed to manage execution of workflows across diverse computing environments. We propose a new method that converts CWL CommandLineTool definitions into Parsl apps, enabling Parsl scripts to easily import and use tools represented in CWL. We describe a Parsl runner that is capable of executing a CWL CommandLineTool directly. We also describe a proof-of-concept extension to support inline Python in a CWL workflow definition, enabling seamless use in the Python ecosystem of Parsl. We demonstrate the benefits of this integration by presenting example CWL CommandLineTool definitions that show how they can be used in Parsl, and comparing performance of executing an image processing workflow using the Parsl integration and other CWL runners.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Inference for Large Models with Task Offloading and Early Exiting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 5G smart cities, edge computing is employed to provide nearby computing services for end devices, and the large-scale models (e.g., GPT and LLaMA) can be deployed at the network edge to boost the service quality. However, due to the constraints of memory size and computing capacity, it is difficult to run these large-scale models on a single edge node. To meet the resource constraints, a large-scale model can be partitioned into multiple sub-models and deployed across multiple edge nodes. Then tasks are offloaded to the edge nodes for collaborative inference. Additionally, we incorporate the early exit mechanism to further accelerate inference. However, the heterogeneous system and dynamic environment will significantly affect the inference efficiency. To address these challenges, we theoretically analyze the coupled relationship between task offloading strategy and confidence thresholds, and develop a distributed algorithm, termed DTO-EE, based on the coupled relationship and convex optimization. DTO-EE enables each edge node to jointly optimize its offloading strategy and the confidence threshold, so as to achieve a promising trade-off between response delay and inference accuracy. The experimental results show that DTO-EE can reduce the average response delay by 21%-41% and improve the inference accuracy by 1%-4%, compared to the baselines.</description>

      <title>EaCO: Resource Sharing Dynamics and Its Impact on Energy Efficiency for DNN Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning Training (DLT) is a growing workload in shared GPU/CPU clusters due to its high computational cost and increasing number of jobs. This contributes to significant energy consumption in GPU clusters, further exacerbated by GPU under-utilization, as shown in production cluster logs. Addressing this challenge requires workload scheduling and resource allocation policies for efficient GPU sharing to improve resource and energy efficiency while maintaining performance. However, previous works primarily optimize for performance, often overlooking or even sacrificing energy efficiency.
  In this paper, we present EaCO, the first energy-aware scheduling algorithm designed specifically for DLT workloads in GPU clusters. EaCO leverages hardware-supported context switching to enable GPU sharing across multiple DLT jobs, improving resource and energy utilization. GPU sharing can increase Job Completion Time (JCT) and may lead to contention if not employed carefully. To address this, EaCO integrates experiment and historical-based predictions as well as early-stage observations, ensuring performance expectations are met while optimizing energy efficiency.
  We begin by experimentally exploring the dynamics of co-locating DLTs, investigating its impact on energy and resource utilization. Our results show that co-location improves energy efficiency by up to 44% for individual jobs, and increases average GPU utilization to as high as 97%. Additionally, evaluations on large-scale clusters using production traces demonstrate that EaCO reduces total energy by up to 39% compared to existing algorithms, which comes with a minimal increase in job runtime-less than 3.2% in our simulations.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Performance Portability of SYCL across CPUs, GPUs, and Hybrid Systems with Protein Database Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-performance computing (HPC) landscape is undergoing rapid transformation, with an increasing emphasis on energy-efficient and heterogeneous computing environments. This comprehensive study extends our previous research on SYCL's performance portability by evaluating its effectiveness across a broader spectrum of computing architectures, including CPUs, GPUs, and hybrid CPU-GPU configurations from NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD. Our analysis covers single-GPU, multi-GPU, single-CPU, and CPU-GPU hybrid setups, using the SW\# protein database search application as a case study. The results demonstrate SYCL's versatility across different architectures, maintaining comparable performance to CUDA on NVIDIA GPUs while achieving similar architectural efficiency rates on most CPU configurations. Although SYCL showed excellent functional portability in hybrid CPU-GPU configurations, performance varied significantly based on specific hardware combinations. Some performance limitations were identified in multi-GPU and CPU-GPU configurations, primarily attributed to workload distribution strategies rather than SYCL-specific constraints. These findings position SYCL as a promising unified programming model for heterogeneous computing environments, particularly for bioinformatic applications.</description>

      <title>Pioplat: A Scalable, Low-Cost Framework for Latency Reduction in Ethereum Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As decentralized applications on permissionless blockchains are prevalent, more and more latency-sensitive usage scenarios emerged, where the lower the latency of sending and receiving messages, the better the chance of earning revenue. To reduce latency, we present Pioplat, a feasible, customizable, and low-cost latency reduction framework consisting of multiple relay nodes on different continents and at least one instrumented variant of a full node. The node selection strategy of Pioplat and the low-latency communication protocol offer an elastic way to reduce latency effectively. We demonstrate Pioplat's feasibility with an implementation running on five continents and show that Pioplat can significantly reduce the latency of receiving blocks/transactions and sending transactions, thus fulfilling the requirements of most latency-sensitive use cases. Furthermore, we provide the complete implementation of Pioplat to promote further research and allow people to apply the framework to more blockchain systems.</description>

      <title>Protecting Confidentiality, Privacy and Integrity in Collaborative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A collaboration between dataset owners and model owners is needed to facilitate effective machine learning (ML) training. During this collaboration, however, dataset owners and model owners want to protect the confidentiality of their respective assets (i.e., datasets, models and training code), with the dataset owners also caring about the privacy of individual users whose data is in their datasets. Existing solutions either provide limited confidentiality for models and training code, or suffer from privacy issues due to collusion.
  We present Citadel++, a scalable collaborative ML training system designed to simultaneously protect the confidentiality of datasets, models and training code, as well as the privacy of individual users. Citadel++ enhances differential privacy techniques to safeguard the privacy of individual user data while maintaining model utility. By employing Virtual Machine-level Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and improved integrity protection techniques through various OS-level mechanisms, Citadel++ effectively preserves the confidentiality of datasets, models and training code, and enforces our privacy mechanisms even when the models and training code have been maliciously designed. Our experiments show that Citadel++ provides privacy, model utility and performance while adhering to confidentiality and privacy requirements of dataset owners and model owners, outperforming the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving training systems by up to 543x on CPU and 113x on GPU TEEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper offers a tutorial on current middlewares in automated vehicles. Our aim is to provide the reader with an overview of current middlewares and to identify open challenges in this field. We start by explaining the fundamentals of software architecture in distributed systems and the distinguishing requirements of Automated Vehicles. We then distinguish between communication middlewares and architecture platforms and highlight their key principles and differences. Next, we present five state-of-the-art middlewares as well as their capabilities and functions. We explore how these middlewares could be applied in the design of future vehicle software and their role in the automotive domain. Finally, we compare the five middlewares presented and discuss open research challenges.</description>

      <title>Protocol Learning, Decentralized Frontier Risk and the No-Off Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frontier models are currently developed and distributed primarily through two channels: centralized proprietary APIs or open-sourcing of pre-trained weights. We identify a third paradigm - Protocol Learning - where models are trained across decentralized networks of incentivized participants. This approach has the potential to aggregate orders of magnitude more computational resources than any single centralized entity, enabling unprecedented model scales and capabilities. However, it also introduces novel challenges: heterogeneous and unreliable nodes, malicious participants, the need for unextractable models to preserve incentives, and complex governance dynamics. To date, no systematic analysis has been conducted to assess the feasibility of Protocol Learning or the associated risks, particularly the 'No-Off Problem' arising from the inability to unilaterally halt a collectively trained model. We survey recent technical advances that suggest decentralized training may be feasible - covering emerging communication-efficient strategies and fault-tolerant methods - while highlighting critical open problems that remain. Contrary to the notion that decentralization inherently amplifies frontier risks, we argue that Protocol Learning's transparency, distributed governance, and democratized access ultimately reduce these risks compared to today's centralized regimes.</description>

      <title>Distributed Gradient Descent with Many Local Steps in Overparameterized Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In distributed training of machine learning models, gradient descent with local iterative steps is a very popular method, variants of which are commonly known as Local-SGD or the Federated Averaging (FedAvg). In this method, gradient steps based on local datasets are taken independently in distributed compute nodes to update the local models, which are then aggregated intermittently. Although the existing convergence analysis suggests that with heterogeneous data, FedAvg encounters quick performance degradation as the number of local steps increases, it is shown to work quite well in practice, especially in the distributed training of large language models. In this work we try to explain this good performance from a viewpoint of implicit bias in Local Gradient Descent (Local-GD) with a large number of local steps. In overparameterized regime, the gradient descent at each compute node would lead the model to a specific direction locally. We characterize the dynamics of the aggregated global model and compare it to the centralized model trained with all of the data in one place. In particular, we analyze the implicit bias of gradient descent on linear models, for both regression and classification tasks. Our analysis shows that the aggregated global model converges exactly to the centralized model for regression tasks, and converges (in direction) to the same feasible set as centralized model for classification tasks. We further propose a Modified Local-GD with a refined aggregation and theoretically show it converges to the centralized model in direction for linear classification. We empirically verified our theoretical findings in linear models and also conducted experiments on distributed fine-tuning of pretrained neural networks to further apply our theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simultaneous Protocols without Public Coins using Modified Equality Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a quantum version of the multiparty simultaneous message-passing (SMP) model, and we show that in some cases, quantum communication can replace public randomness, even with no entanglement between the parties. This was already known for two players, but not for more than two players, and indeed, so far all that was known was a negative result. Our main technical contribution is a compiler that takes any classical public-coin simultaneous protocol based on "modified equality queries," and converts it into a quantum simultaneous protocol without public coins with roughly the same communication complexity. We then use our compiler to derive protocols for several problems, including frequency moments, neighborhood diversity, enumeration of isolated cliques, and more.</description>

      <title>Learn How to Query from Unlabeled Data Streams in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative learning among decentralized clients while safeguarding the privacy of their local data. Existing studies on FL typically assume offline labeled data available at each client when the training starts. Nevertheless, the training data in practice often arrive at clients in a streaming fashion without ground-truth labels. Given the expensive annotation cost, it is critical to identify a subset of informative samples for labeling on clients. However, selecting samples locally while accommodating the global training objective presents a challenge unique to FL. In this work, we tackle this conundrum by framing the data querying process in FL as a collaborative decentralized decision-making problem and proposing an effective solution named LeaDQ, which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. In particular, under the implicit guidance from global information, LeaDQ effectively learns the local policies for distributed clients and steers them towards selecting samples that can enhance the global model's accuracy. Extensive simulations on image and text tasks show that LeaDQ advances the model performance in various FL scenarios, outperforming the benchmarking algorithms.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning for Traffic Flow Prediction with Synthetic Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep-learning based traffic prediction models require vast amounts of data to learn embedded spatial and temporal dependencies. The inherent privacy and commercial sensitivity of such data has encouraged a shift towards decentralised data-driven methods, such as Federated Learning (FL). Under a traditional Machine Learning paradigm, traffic flow prediction models can capture spatial and temporal relationships within centralised data. In reality, traffic data is likely distributed across separate data silos owned by multiple stakeholders. In this work, a cross-silo FL setting is motivated to facilitate stakeholder collaboration for optimal traffic flow prediction applications. This work introduces an FL framework, referred to as FedTPS, to generate synthetic data to augment each client's local dataset by training a diffusion-based trajectory generation model through FL. The proposed framework is evaluated on a large-scale real world ride-sharing dataset using various FL methods and Traffic Flow Prediction models, including a novel prediction model we introduce, which leverages Temporal and Graph Attention mechanisms to learn the Spatio-Temporal dependencies embedded within regional traffic flow data. Experimental results show that FedTPS outperforms multiple other FL baselines with respect to global model performance.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Evaluation of Automated Analysis Tools for Solidity Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20212v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchain smart contracts have emerged as a transformative force in the digital realm, spawning a diverse range of compelling applications. Since solidity smart contracts across various domains manage trillions of dollars in virtual coins, they become a prime target for attacks. One of the primary challenges is keeping abreast of the latest techniques and tools for developing secure smart contracts and examining those already deployed. In this paper, we seek to address these challenges from four aspects: (1) We begin by examining ten automatic tools, specifically focusing on their methodologies and their ability to identify vulnerabilities in solidity smart contracts. (2) We propose a novel criterion for evaluating these tools, based on the ISO/IEC 25010 standard. (3) To facilitate the evaluation of the selected tools, we construct a benchmark that encompasses two distinct datasets: a collection of 389 labelled smart contracts and a scaled set of 20,000 unique cases from real-world contracts. (4) We provide a comparison of the selected tools, offering insights into their strengths and weaknesses and highlighting areas where further improvements are needed. Through this evaluation, we hope to provide developers and researchers with valuable guidance on selecting and using smart contract analysis tools and contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve the security and reliability of smart contracts.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents Banyan, the first rotating leader state machine replication (SMR) protocol that allows transactions to be confirmed in just a single round-trip time in the Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) setting. Based on minimal alterations to the Internet Computer Consensus (ICC) protocol and with negligible communication overhead, we introduce a novel dual mode mechanism that enables optimal block finalization latency in the fast path. Crucially, the modes of operation are integrated, such that even if the fast path is not effective, no penalties are incurred. Moreover, our algorithm maintains the core attributes of the ICC protocol it is based on, including optimistic responsiveness and rotating leaders without the necessity for a view-change protocol. We prove the correctness of our protocol and provide an open-source implementation of it. Banyan is compared to its predecessor ICC, as well as other well known BFT protocols, in a globally distributed wide-area network. Our evaluation reveals that Banyan reduces latency by up to 30% compared to state-of-the-art protocols, without requiring additional security assumptions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Large Foundation Model Inference: A Perspective From Model and System Co-Design</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become popular, the need for efficient design for ML models on LLMs grows. We are amazed by the excellent output by the LLMs, yet we are still troubled with slow inference speed and large memory consumption of contemporary LLMs. This paper focuses on modern efficient inference technologies on LLMs and illustrates them from two perspectives: model and system design. These methodologies optimize LLM inference from different aspects to save computational resources, making LLMs more efficient, affordable, and more accessible.</description>

      <title>Learnable Sparse Customization in Heterogeneous Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To effectively manage and utilize massive distributed data at the network edge, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising edge computing paradigm across data silos. However, FL still faces two challenges: system heterogeneity (i.e., the diversity of hardware resources across edge devices) and statistical heterogeneity (i.e., non-IID data). Although sparsification can extract diverse submodels for diverse clients, most sparse FL works either simply assign submodels with artificially-given rigid rules or prune partial parameters using heuristic strategies, resulting in inflexible sparsification and poor performance. In this work, we propose Learnable Personalized Sparsification for heterogeneous Federated learning (FedLPS), which achieves the learnable customization of heterogeneous sparse models with importance-associated patterns and adaptive ratios to simultaneously tackle system and statistical heterogeneity. Specifically, FedLPS learns the importance of model units on local data representation and further derives an importance-based sparse pattern with minimal heuristics to accurately extract personalized data features in non-IID settings. Furthermore, Prompt Upper Confidence Bound Variance (P-UCBV) is designed to adaptively determine sparse ratios by learning the superimposed effect of diverse device capabilities and non-IID data, aiming at resource self-adaptation with promising accuracy. Extensive experiments show that FedLPS outperforms status quo approaches in accuracy and training costs, which improves accuracy by 1.28%-59.34% while reducing running time by more than 68.80%.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Temporal Federated Learning for Lifelong Person Re-identification on Distributed Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data drift is a thorny challenge when deploying person re-identification (ReID) models into real-world devices, where the data distribution is significantly different from that of the training environment and keeps changing. To tackle this issue, we propose a federated spatial-temporal incremental learning approach, named FedSTIL, which leverages both lifelong learning and federated learning to continuously optimize models deployed on many distributed edge clients. Unlike previous efforts, FedSTIL aims to mine spatial-temporal correlations among the knowledge learnt from different edge clients. Specifically, the edge clients first periodically extract general representations of drifted data to optimize their local models. Then, the learnt knowledge from edge clients will be aggregated by centralized parameter server, where the knowledge will be selectively and attentively distilled from spatial- and temporal-dimension with carefully designed mechanisms. Finally, the distilled informative spatial-temporal knowledge will be sent back to correlated edge clients to further improve the recognition accuracy of each edge client with a lifelong learning method. Extensive experiments on a mixture of five real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms others by nearly 4% in Rank-1 accuracy, while reducing communication cost by 62%.

      <title>Direct Low-Dose CT Image Reconstruction on GPU using Out-Of-Core: Precision and Quality Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algebraic methods applied to the reconstruction of Sparse-view Computed Tomography (CT) can provide both a high image quality and a decrease in the dose received by patients, although with an increased reconstruction time since their computational costs are higher. In our work, we present a new algebraic implementation that obtains an exact solution to the system of linear equations that models the problem and based on single-precision floating-point arithmetic. By applying Out-Of-Core (OOC) techniques, the dimensions of the system can be increased regardless of the main memory size and as long as there is enough secondary storage (disk). These techniques have allowed to process images of 768 x 768 pixels. A comparative study of our method on a GPU using both single-precision and double-precision arithmetic has been carried out. The goal is to assess the single-precision arithmetic implementation both in terms of time improvement and quality of the reconstructed images to determine if it is sufficient to consider it a viable option. Results using single-precision arithmetic approximately halves the reconstruction time of the double-precision implementation, whereas the obtained images retain all internal structures despite having higher noise levels.</description>
