      <title>Revisiting Acoustic Features for Robust ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems must be robust to the myriad types of noises present in real-world environments including environmental noise, room impulse response, special effects as well as attacks by malicious actors (adversarial attacks). Recent works seek to improve accuracy and robustness by developing novel Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and curating diverse training datasets for them, while using relatively simple acoustic features. While this approach improves robustness to the types of noise present in the training data, it confers limited robustness against unseen noises and negligible robustness to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we revisit the approach of earlier works that developed acoustic features inspired by biological auditory perception that could be used to perform accurate and robust ASR. In contrast, Specifically, we evaluate the ASR accuracy and robustness of several biologically inspired acoustic features. In addition to several features from prior works, such as gammatone filterbank features (GammSpec), we also propose two new acoustic features called frequency masked spectrogram (FreqMask) and difference of gammatones spectrogram (DoGSpec) to simulate the neuro-psychological phenomena of frequency masking and lateral suppression. Experiments on diverse models and datasets show that (1) DoGSpec achieves significantly better robustness than the highly popular log mel spectrogram (LogMelSpec) with minimal accuracy degradation, and (2) GammSpec achieves better accuracy and robustness to non-adversarial noises from the Speech Robust Bench benchmark, but it is outperformed by DoGSpec against adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Perceptual Metrics on Music Representation Learning for Genre Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subjective quality of natural signals can be approximated with objective perceptual metrics. Designed to approximate the perceptual behaviour of human observers, perceptual metrics often reflect structures found in natural signals and neurological pathways. Models trained with perceptual metrics as loss functions can capture perceptually meaningful features from the structures held within these metrics. We demonstrate that using features extracted from autoencoders trained with perceptual losses can improve performance on music understanding tasks, i.e. genre classification, over using these metrics directly as distances when learning a classifier. This result suggests improved generalisation to novel signals when using perceptual metrics as loss functions for representation learning.</description>

      <title>Erie: A Declarative Grammar for Data Sonification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00156v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data sonification-mapping data variables to auditory variables, such as pitch or volume-is used for data accessibility, scientific exploration, and data-driven art (e.g., museum exhibitions) among others. While a substantial amount of research has been made on effective and intuitive sonification design, software support is not commensurate, limiting researchers from fully exploring its capabilities. We contribute Erie, a declarative grammar for data sonification, that enables abstractly expressing auditory mappings. Erie supports specifying extensible tone designs (e.g., periodic wave, sampling, frequency/amplitude modulation synthesizers), various encoding channels, auditory legends, and composition options like sequencing and overlaying. Using standard Web Audio and Web Speech APIs, we provide an Erie compiler for web environments. We demonstrate the expressiveness and feasibility of Erie by replicating research prototypes presented by prior work and provide a sonification design gallery. We discuss future steps to extend Erie toward other audio computing environments and support interactive data sonification.</description>

      <title>Efficient Training of Self-Supervised Speech Foundation Models on a Compute Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their impressive success, training foundation models remains computationally costly. This paper investigates how to efficiently train speech foundation models with self-supervised learning (SSL) under a limited compute budget. We examine critical factors in SSL that impact the budget, including model architecture, model size, and data size. Our goal is to make analytical steps toward understanding the training dynamics of speech foundation models. We benchmark SSL objectives in an entirely comparable setting and find that other factors contribute more significantly to the success of SSL. Our results show that slimmer model architectures outperform common small architectures under the same compute and parameter budget. We demonstrate that the size of the pre-training data remains crucial, even with data augmentation during SSL training, as performance suffers when iterating over limited data. Finally, we identify a trade-off between model size and data size, highlighting an optimal model size for a given compute budget.</description>

      <title>How Redundant Is the Transformer Stack in Speech Representation Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised speech representation models, particularly those leveraging transformer architectures, have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks such as speech recognition, speaker identification, and emotion detection. Recent studies on transformer models revealed a high redundancy between layers and the potential for significant pruning, which we will investigate here for transformer-based speech representation models. We perform a detailed analysis of layer similarity in speech representation models using three similarity metrics: cosine similarity, centered kernel alignment, and mutual nearest-neighbor alignment. Our findings reveal a block-like structure of high similarity, suggesting two main processing steps and significant redundancy of layers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of pruning transformer-based speech representation models without the need for post-training, achieving up to 40% reduction in transformer layers while maintaining over 95% of the model's predictive capacity. Furthermore, we employ a knowledge distillation method to substitute the entire transformer stack with mimicking layers, reducing the network size 95-98% and the inference time by up to 94%. This substantial decrease in computational load occurs without considerable performance loss, suggesting that the transformer stack is almost completely redundant for downstream applications of speech representation models.</description>

      <title>A Literature Review of Keyword Spotting Technologies for Urdu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This literature review surveys the advancements of keyword spotting (KWS) technologies, specifically focusing on Urdu, Pakistan's low-resource language (LRL), which has complex phonetics. Despite the global strides in speech technology, Urdu presents unique challenges requiring more tailored solutions. The review traces the evolution from foundational Gaussian Mixture Models to sophisticated neural architectures like deep neural networks and transformers, highlighting significant milestones such as integrating multi-task learning and self-supervised approaches that leverage unlabeled data. It examines emerging technologies' role in enhancing KWS systems' performance within multilingual and resource-constrained settings, emphasizing the need for innovations that cater to languages like Urdu. Thus, this review underscores the need for context-specific research addressing the inherent complexities of Urdu and similar URLs and the means of regions communicating through such languages for a more inclusive approach to speech technology.</description>

      <title>Towards Within-Class Variation in Alzheimer's Disease Detection from Spontaneous Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection has emerged as a promising research area that employs machine learning classification models to distinguish between individuals with AD and those without. Unlike conventional classification tasks, we identify within-class variation as a critical challenge in AD detection: individuals with AD exhibit a spectrum of cognitive impairments. Given that many AD detection tasks lack fine-grained labels, simplistic binary classification may overlook two crucial aspects: within-class differences and instance-level imbalance. The former compels the model to map AD samples with varying degrees of impairment to a single diagnostic label, disregarding certain changes in cognitive function. While the latter biases the model towards overrepresented severity levels. This work presents early efforts to address these challenges. We propose two novel methods: Soft Target Distillation (SoTD) and Instance-level Re-balancing (InRe), targeting two problems respectively. Experiments on the ADReSS and ADReSSo datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve detection accuracy. Further analysis reveals that SoTD effectively harnesses the strengths of multiple component models, while InRe substantially alleviates model over-fitting. These findings provide insights for developing more robust and reliable AD detection models.</description>

      <title>FastTalker: Jointly Generating Speech and Conversational Gestures from Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating 3D human gestures and speech from a text script is critical for creating realistic talking avatars. One solution is to leverage separate pipelines for text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-gesture (STG), but this approach suffers from poor alignment of speech and gestures and slow inference times. In this paper, we introduce FastTalker, an efficient and effective framework that simultaneously generates high-quality speech audio and 3D human gestures at high inference speeds. Our key insight is reusing the intermediate features from speech synthesis for gesture generation, as these features contain more precise rhythmic information than features re-extracted from generated speech. Specifically, 1) we propose an end-to-end framework that concurrently generates speech waveforms and full-body gestures, using intermediate speech features such as pitch, onset, energy, and duration directly for gesture decoding; 2) we redesign the causal network architecture to eliminate dependencies on future inputs for real applications; 3) we employ Reinforcement Learning-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to enhance both performance and inference speed by optimizing our network architecture. Experimental results on the BEAT2 dataset demonstrate that FastTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in both speech synthesis and gesture generation, processing speech and gestures in 0.17 seconds per second on an NVIDIA 3090.</description>

      <title>Spelling Correction through Rewriting of Non-Autoregressive ASR Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models, recognizing personal or rare phrases can be hard. A promising way to improve accuracy is through spelling correction (or rewriting) of the ASR lattice, where potentially misrecognized phrases are replaced with acoustically similar and contextually relevant alternatives. However, rewriting is challenging for ASR models trained with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) due to noisy hypotheses produced by a non-autoregressive, context-independent beam search.
  We present a finite-state transducer (FST) technique for rewriting wordpiece lattices generated by Transformer-based CTC models. Our algorithm performs grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion directly from wordpieces into phonemes, avoiding explicit word representations and exploiting the richness of the CTC lattice. Our approach requires no retraining or modification of the ASR model. We achieved up to a 15.2% relative reduction in sentence error rate (SER) on a test set with contextually relevant entities.</description>

      <title>Enabling Auditory Large Language Models for Automatic Speech Quality Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech quality assessment typically requires evaluating audio from multiple aspects, such as mean opinion score (MOS) and speaker similarity (SIM) etc., which can be challenging to cover using one small model designed for a single task. In this paper, we propose leveraging recently introduced auditory large language models (LLMs) for automatic speech quality assessment. By employing task-specific prompts, auditory LLMs are finetuned to predict MOS, SIM and A/B testing results, which are commonly used for evaluating text-to-speech systems. Additionally, the finetuned auditory LLM is able to generate natural language descriptions assessing aspects like noisiness, distortion, discontinuity, and overall quality, providing more interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments have been performed on the NISQA, BVCC, SOMOS and VoxSim speech quality datasets, using open-source auditory LLMs such as SALMONN, Qwen-Audio, and Qwen2-Audio. For the natural language descriptions task, a commercial model Google Gemini 1.5 Pro is also evaluated. The results demonstrate that auditory LLMs achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art task-specific small models in predicting MOS and SIM, while also delivering promising results in A/B testing and natural language descriptions. Our data processing scripts and finetuned model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Speech Recognition Rescoring with Large Speech-Text Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have demonstrated the ability to understand human language by leveraging large amount of text data. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are often limited by available transcribed speech data and benefit from a second pass rescoring using LLM. Recently multi-modal large language models, particularly speech and text foundational models have demonstrated strong spoken language understanding. Speech-Text foundational models leverage large amounts of unlabelled and labelled data both in speech and text modalities to model human language. In this work, we propose novel techniques to use multi-modal LLM for ASR rescoring. We also explore discriminative training to further improve the foundational model rescoring performance. We demonstrate cross-modal knowledge transfer in speech-text LLM can benefit rescoring. Our experiments demonstrate up-to 20% relative improvements over Whisper large ASR and up-to 15% relative improvements over text-only LLM.</description>

      <title>Emotional Dimension Control in Language Model-Based Text-to-Speech: Spanning a Broad Spectrum of Human Emotions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current emotional text-to-speech (TTS) systems face challenges in mimicking a broad spectrum of human emotions due to the inherent complexity of emotions and limitations in emotional speech datasets and models. This paper proposes a TTS framework that facilitates control over pleasure, arousal, and dominance, and can synthesize a diversity of emotional styles without requiring any emotional speech data during TTS training. We train an emotional attribute predictor using only categorical labels from speech data, aligning with psychological research and incorporating anchored dimensionality reduction on self-supervised learning (SSL) features. The TTS framework converts text inputs into phonetic tokens via an autoregressive language model and uses pseudo-emotional dimensions to guide the parallel prediction of fine-grained acoustic details. Experiments conducted on the LibriTTS dataset demonstrate that our framework can synthesize speech with enhanced naturalness and a variety of emotional styles by effectively controlling emotional dimensions, even without the inclusion of any emotional speech during TTS training.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Spatial Cues in Modular Speaker Diarization for Multi-channel Multi-party Meetings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although fully end-to-end speaker diarization systems have made significant progress in recent years, modular systems often achieve superior results in real-world scenarios due to their greater adaptability and robustness. Historically, modular speaker diarization methods have seldom discussed how to leverage spatial cues from multi-channel speech. This paper proposes a three-stage modular system to enhance single-channel neural speaker diarization systems and recognition performance by utilizing spatial cues from multi-channel speech to provide more accurate initialization for each stage of neural speaker diarization (NSD) decoding: (1) Overlap detection and continuous speech separation (CSS) on multi-channel speech are used to obtain cleaner single speaker speech segments for clustering, followed by the first NSD decoding pass. (2) The results from the first pass initialize a complex Angular Central Gaussian Mixture Model (cACGMM) to estimate speaker-wise masks on multi-channel speech, and through Overlap-add and Mask-to-VAD, achieve initialization with lower speaker error (SpkErr), followed by the second NSD decoding pass. (3) The second decoding results are used for guided source separation (GSS), recognizing and filtering short segments containing less one word to obtain cleaner speech segments, followed by re-clustering and the final NSD decoding pass. We presented the progressively explored evaluation results from the CHiME-8 NOTSOFAR-1 (Natural Office Talkers in Settings Of Far-field Audio Recordings) challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of our system and its contribution to improving recognition performance. Our final system achieved the first place in the challenge.</description>

      <title>Cross-lingual Speech Emotion Recognition: Humans vs. Self-Supervised Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has proven effective, yet limited research has explored cross-lingual scenarios. This study presents a comparative analysis between human performance and SSL models, beginning with a layer-wise analysis and an exploration of parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies in monolingual, cross-lingual, and transfer learning contexts. We further compare the SER ability of models and humans at both utterance- and segment-levels. Additionally, we investigate the impact of dialect on cross-lingual SER through human evaluation. Our findings reveal that models, with appropriate knowledge transfer, can adapt to the target language and achieve performance comparable to native speakers. We also demonstrate the significant effect of dialect on SER for individuals without prior linguistic and paralinguistic background. Moreover, both humans and models exhibit distinct behaviors across different emotions. These results offer new insights into the cross-lingual SER capabilities of SSL models, underscoring both their similarities to and differences from human emotion perception.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Cognitive State Classification from Speech with Multi-View Pseudo-Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of labeled data is a common challenge in speech classification tasks, particularly those requiring extensive subjective assessment, such as cognitive state classification. In this work, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) framework, introducing a novel multi-view pseudo-labeling method that leverages both acoustic and linguistic characteristics to select the most confident data for training the classification model. Acoustically, unlabeled data are compared to labeled data using the Frechet audio distance, calculated from embeddings generated by multiple audio encoders. Linguistically, large language models are prompted to revise automatic speech recognition transcriptions and predict labels based on our proposed task-specific knowledge. High-confidence data are identified when pseudo-labels from both sources align, while mismatches are treated as low-confidence data. A bimodal classifier is then trained to iteratively label the low-confidence data until a predefined criterion is met. We evaluate our SSL framework on emotion recognition and dementia detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised learning using only 30% of the labeled data and significantly outperforms two selected baselines.</description>

      <title>Weighted Cross-entropy for Low-Resource Languages in Multilingual Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of integrating low-resource languages into multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. We introduce a novel application of weighted cross-entropy, typically used for unbalanced datasets, to facilitate the integration of low-resource languages into pre-trained multilingual ASR models within the context of continual multilingual learning. We fine-tune the Whisper multilingual ASR model on five high-resource languages and one low-resource language, employing language-weighted dynamic cross-entropy and data augmentation. The results show a remarkable 6.69% word error rate (WER) reduction for the low-resource language compared to the fine-tuned model without applying our approach, and a 48.86% WER reduction compared to the original Whisper model. In addition, our approach yields an average WER reduction of 3.29% across the six languages, showing no degradation for the high-resource languages.</description>

      <title>MT2KD: Towards A General-Purpose Encoder for Speech, Speaker, and Audio Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advances in deep learning, the performance of end-to-end (E2E) single-task models for speech and audio processing has been constantly improving.
  However, it is still challenging to build a general-purpose model with high performance on multiple tasks, since different speech and audio processing tasks usually require different training data, input features, or model architectures to achieve optimal performance.
  In this work, MT2KD, a novel two-stage multi-task learning framework is proposed to build a general-purpose speech and audio encoder that jointly performs three fundamental tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), audio tagging (AT) and speaker verification (SV). In the first stage, multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD) is applied to align the feature spaces of three single-task high-performance teacher encoders into a single student encoder using the same unlabelled data. In the second stage, multi-task supervised fine-tuning is carried out by initialising the model from the first stage and training on the separate labelled data of each single task.
  Experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-task training pipeline significantly outperforms a baseline model trained with multi-task learning from scratch. The final system achieves good performance on ASR, AT and SV: with less than 4% relative word-error-rate increase on ASR, only 1.9 lower mean averaged precision on AT and 0.23% absolute higher equal error rate on SV compared to the best-performing single-task encoders, using only a 66M total model parameters.</description>

      <title>Using LLM for Real-Time Transcription and Summarization of Doctor-Patient Interactions into ePuskesmas in Indonesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key issues contributing to inefficiency in Puskesmas is the time-consuming nature of doctor-patient interactions. Doctors need to conduct thorough consultations, which include diagnosing the patient's condition, providing treatment advice, and transcribing detailed notes into medical records. In regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds, doctors often have to ask clarifying questions, further prolonging the process. While diagnosing is essential, transcription and summarization can often be automated using AI to improve time efficiency and help doctors enhance care quality and enable early diagnosis and intervention. This paper proposes a solution using a localized large language model (LLM) to transcribe, translate, and summarize doctor-patient conversations. We utilize the Whisper model for transcription and GPT-3 to summarize them into the ePuskemas medical records format. This system is implemented as an add-on to an existing web browser extension, allowing doctors to fill out patient forms while talking. By leveraging this solution for real-time transcription, translation, and summarization, doctors can improve the turnaround time for patient care while enhancing the quality of records, which become more detailed and insightful for future visits. This innovation addresses challenges like overcrowded facilities and the administrative burden on healthcare providers in Indonesia. We believe this solution will help doctors save time, provide better care, and produce more accurate medical records, representing a significant step toward modernizing healthcare and ensuring patients receive timely, high-quality care, even in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Music Generation with Non-Differentiable Rule Guided Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14285v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of symbolic music generation (e.g., generating piano rolls), with a technical focus on non-differentiable rule guidance. Musical rules are often expressed in symbolic form on note characteristics, such as note density or chord progression, many of which are non-differentiable which pose a challenge when using them for guided diffusion. We propose Stochastic Control Guidance (SCG), a novel guidance method that only requires forward evaluation of rule functions that can work with pre-trained diffusion models in a plug-and-play way, thus achieving training-free guidance for non-differentiable rules for the first time. Additionally, we introduce a latent diffusion architecture for symbolic music generation with high time resolution, which can be composed with SCG in a plug-and-play fashion. Compared to standard strong baselines in symbolic music generation, this framework demonstrates marked advancements in music quality and rule-based controllability, outperforming current state-of-the-art generators in a variety of settings.

      <title>HybridVC: Efficient Voice Style Conversion with Text and Audio Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce HybridVC, a voice conversion (VC) framework built upon a pre-trained conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) that combines the strengths of a latent model with contrastive learning. HybridVC supports text and audio prompts, enabling more flexible voice style conversion. HybridVC models a latent distribution conditioned on speaker embeddings acquired by a pretrained speaker encoder and optimises style text embeddings to align with the speaker style information through contrastive learning in parallel. Therefore, HybridVC can be efficiently trained under limited computational resources. Our experiments demonstrate HybridVC's superior training efficiency and its capability for advanced multi-modal voice style conversion. This underscores its potential for widespread applications such as user-defined personalised voice in various social media platforms. A comprehensive ablation study further validates the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Emotion-Driven Melody Harmonization via Melodic Variation and Functional Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emotion-driven melody harmonization aims to generate diverse harmonies for a single melody to convey desired emotions. Previous research found it hard to alter the perceived emotional valence of lead sheets only by harmonizing the same melody with different chords, which may be attributed to the constraints imposed by the melody itself and the limitation of existing music representation. In this paper, we propose a novel functional representation for symbolic music. This new method takes musical keys into account, recognizing their significant role in shaping music's emotional character through major-minor tonality. It also allows for melodic variation with respect to keys and addresses the problem of data scarcity for better emotion modeling. A Transformer is employed to harmonize key-adaptable melodies, allowing for keys determined in rule-based or model-based manner. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our new representation in generating key-aware harmonies, with objective and subjective evaluations affirming the potential of our approach to convey specific valence for versatile melody.</description>

      <title>Domain-Invariant Representation Learning of Bird Sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08589v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is crucial for bioacoustic research, enabling non-invasive species tracking and biodiversity monitoring. Citizen science platforms like Xeno-Canto provide large annotated datasets from focal recordings, where the target species is intentionally recorded. However, PAM requires monitoring in passive soundscapes, creating a domain shift between focal and passive recordings, which challenges deep learning models trained on focal recordings. To address this, we leverage supervised contrastive learning to improve domain generalization in bird sound classification, enforcing domain invariance across same-class examples from different domains. We also propose ProtoCLR (Prototypical Contrastive Learning of Representations), which reduces the computational complexity of the SupCon loss by comparing examples to class prototypes instead of pairwise comparisons. Additionally, we present a new few-shot classification evaluation based on BIRB, a large-scale bird sound benchmark to evaluate bioacoustic pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>GALD-SE: Guided Anisotropic Lightweight Diffusion for Efficient Speech Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech enhancement is designed to enhance the intelligibility and quality of speech across diverse noise conditions. Recently, diffusion model has gained lots of attention in speech enhancement area, achieving competitive results. Current diffusion-based methods blur the initial signal with isotropic Gaussian noise and recover clean speech from the prior. However, these methods often suffer from a substantial computational burden. We argue that the inefficiency stems from the oversight that speech enhancement is not purely a generative task; it primarily involves noise reduction and completion of missing information, while the clean clues in the original mixture do not need to be regenerated. In this paper, we propose a method that introduces noise with anisotropic guidance during the diffusion process, allowing the neural network to focus on clean clues within noisy recordings. This approach is robust against various types of noise interference and speech distortion, and significantly reduces the computational load. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results with only approximately 4.5 million parameters, significantly fewer than those required by other diffusion methods. This effectively narrows the gap in model size between diffusion-based and predictive speech enhancement approaches. Additionally, the proposed method performs well in very noisy scenarios, demonstrating its potential for applications in highly challenging environments.</description>

      <title>The FruitShell French synthesis system at the Blizzard 2023 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a French text-to-speech synthesis system for the Blizzard Challenge 2023. The challenge consists of two tasks: generating high-quality speech from female speakers and generating speech that closely resembles specific individuals. Regarding the competition data, we conducted a screening process to remove missing or erroneous text data. We organized all symbols except for phonemes and eliminated symbols that had no pronunciation or zero duration. Additionally, we added word boundary and start/end symbols to the text, which we have found to improve speech quality based on our previous experience. For the Spoke task, we performed data augmentation according to the competition rules. We used an open-source G2P model to transcribe the French texts into phonemes. As the G2P model uses the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), we applied the same transcription process to the provided competition data for standardization. However, due to compiler limitations in recognizing special symbols from the IPA chart, we followed the rules to convert all phonemes into the phonetic scheme used in the competition data. Finally, we resampled all competition audio to a uniform sampling rate of 16 kHz. We employed a VITS-based acoustic model with the hifigan vocoder. For the Spoke task, we trained a multi-speaker model and incorporated speaker information into the duration predictor, vocoder, and flow layers of the model. The evaluation results of our system showed a quality MOS score of 3.6 for the Hub task and 3.4 for the Spoke task, placing our system at an average level among all participating teams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models become ever more pervasive, it is important to ensure that they make reliable predictions under corruptions present in the physical and digital world. We propose Speech Robust Bench (SRB), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the robustness of ASR models to diverse corruptions. SRB is composed of 114 input perturbations which simulate an heterogeneous range of corruptions that ASR models may encounter when deployed in the wild. We use SRB to evaluate the robustness of several state-of-the-art ASR models and observe that model size and certain modeling choices such as the use of discrete representations, or self-training appear to be conducive to robustness. We extend this analysis to measure the robustness of ASR models on data from various demographic subgroups, namely English and Spanish speakers, and males and females. Our results revealed noticeable disparities in the model's robustness across subgroups. We believe that SRB will significantly facilitate future research towards robust ASR models, by making it easier to conduct comprehensive and comparable robustness evaluations.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Room Acoustic Modeling Via Differentiable Feedback Delay Networks With Learnable Delay Lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, extensive research has been devoted to the design of artificial reverberation algorithms aimed at emulating the room acoustics of physical environments. Despite significant advancements, automatic parameter tuning of delay-network models remains an open challenge. We introduce a novel method for finding the parameters of a Feedback Delay Network (FDN) such that its output renders target attributes of a measured room impulse response. The proposed approach involves the implementation of a differentiable FDN with trainable delay lines, which, for the first time, allows us to simultaneously learn each and every delay-network parameter via backpropagation. The iterative optimization process seeks to minimize a perceptually-motivated time-domain loss function incorporating differentiable terms accounting for energy decay and echo density. Through experimental validation, we show that the proposed method yields time-invariant frequency-independent FDNs capable of closely matching the desired acoustical characteristics, and outperforms existing methods based on genetic algorithms and analytical FDN design.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an accurate phoneme alignment model that aims for speech analysis and video content creation. We propose a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based alignment model in which a probable path is searched using encoded acoustic and linguistic embeddings in an unsupervised manner. Our proposed model is based on one TTS alignment (OTA) and extended to obtain phoneme boundaries. Specifically, we incorporate a VAE architecture to maintain consistency between the embedding and input, apply gradient annealing to avoid local optimum during training, and introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL)-based acoustic-feature input and state-level linguistic unit to utilize rich and detailed information. Experimental results show that the proposed model generated phoneme boundaries closer to annotated ones compared with the conventional OTA model, the CTC-based segmentation model, and the widely-used tool MFA.</description>

      <title>FakeMusicCaps: a Dataset for Detection and Attribution of Synthetic Music Generated via Text-to-Music Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-To-Music (TTM) models have recently revolutionized the automatic music generation research field. Specifically, by reaching superior performances to all previous state-of-the-art models and by lowering the technical proficiency needed to use them. Due to these reasons, they have readily started to be adopted for commercial uses and music production practices. This widespread diffusion of TTMs poses several concerns regarding copyright violation and rightful attribution, posing the need of serious consideration of them by the audio forensics community. In this paper, we tackle the problem of detection and attribution of TTM-generated data. We propose a dataset, FakeMusicCaps that contains several versions of the music-caption pairs dataset MusicCaps re-generated via several state-of-the-art TTM techniques. We evaluate the proposed dataset by performing initial experiments regarding the detection and attribution of TTM-generated audio.</description>

      <title>Insights into the Incorporation of Signal Information in Binaural Signal Matching with Wearable Microphone Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11731</link>

Abstract: The increasing popularity of spatial audio in applications such as teleconferencing, entertainment, and virtual reality has led to the recent developments of binaural reproduction methods. However, only a few of these methods are well-suited for wearable and mobile arrays, which typically consist of a small number of microphones. One such method is binaural signal matching (BSM), which has been shown to produce high-quality binaural signals for wearable arrays. However, BSM may be suboptimal in cases of high direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR) as it is based on the diffuse sound field assumption. To overcome this limitation, previous studies incorporated sound-field models other than diffuse. However, this approach was not studied comprehensively. This paper extensively investigates two BSM-based methods designed for high DRR scenarios. The methods incorporate a sound field model composed of direct and reverberant components.The methods are investigated both mathematically and using simulations, finally validated by a listening test. The results show that the proposed methods can significantly improve the performance of BSM , in particular in the direction of the source, while presenting only a negligible degradation in other directions. Furthermore, when source direction estimation is inaccurate, performance of these methods degrade to equal that of the BSM, presenting a desired robustness quality.</description>

      <title>Generative Speech Foundation Model Pretraining for High-Quality Speech Extraction and Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a generative pretraining foundation model for high-quality speech restoration tasks. By directly operating on complex-valued short-time Fourier transform coefficients, our model does not rely on any vocoders for time-domain signal reconstruction. As a result, our model simplifies the synthesis process and removes the quality upper-bound introduced by any mel-spectrogram vocoder compared to prior work SpeechFlow. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple speech restoration tasks, including speech denoising, bandwidth extension, codec artifact removal, and target speaker extraction. In all scenarios, finetuning our pretrained model results in superior performance over strong baselines. Notably, in the target speaker extraction task, our model outperforms existing systems, including those leveraging SSL-pretrained encoders like WavLM. The code and the pretrained checkpoints are publicly available in the NVIDIA NeMo framework.</description>
