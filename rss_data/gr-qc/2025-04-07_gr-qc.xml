      <title>Gauge gravitation theory in Riemann-Cartan space-time and gravitational interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The place and physical significance of gauge gravitation theory in the Riemann-Cartan space-time (GTRC) in the framework of gauge approach to gravitation is discussed. Isotropic cosmology built on the base of GTRC with general expression of gravitational Lagrangian with indefinite parameters is considered. The most important physical consequences connected with the change of gravitational interaction, with possible existence of limiting energy density and gravitational repulsion at extreme conditions, and also with the vacuum repulsion effect are discussed. The solution of the problem of cosmological singularity and the dark energy problem as result of the change of gravitational interaction is considered.</description>

      <title>Thin-shell Gravastar Model in a BTZ geometry with minimum length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct two spherically symmetric thin-shell gravastar models within a BTZ geometry with minimum length. Therefore, in the inner region of the gravastar, we consider an anti- de Sitter metric with minimum length. Thus, for the first model, we introduce the minimum length effect using the probability density of the ground state of the hydrogen atom in two dimensions. For the second gravastar model, we adopt a Lorentzian-type distribution. Also in the outer region, we consider the BTZ black hole metric. So, by examining the inner spacetime, the thin shell, and the outer spacetime, we find that there are different physical characteristics regarding their energy densities and pressures that make the gravastar stable. This effect persists even when the cosmological constant is zero. In addition, we determined the entropy of the gravastar thin shell. Besides, we explore the thermodynamic properties of the BTZ black hole with minimum length in Schwarzschild-type form and also check its stability.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in the theory of gravity with nonminimal derivative coupling and realistic equations of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically construct compact stars in the scalar-tensor theory of gravity with non-minimal derivative coupling of a scalar field to the curvature and nonzero cosmological constant. There are two free parameters in this model of gravity: the non-minimal derivative coupling parameter $\ell$ and the cosmological constant parameter $\xi$. We study the relationship between the model parameters and characteristic of the neutron star, what allowed us to limit the permissible range of $\xi$ and $\ell$. In particular, in the case $\xi=-1$ the external geometry of the neutron star coincides with the Schwarzschild anti-de Sitter geometry, while the internal geometry of the star differs from the case of the standard gravity theory. Plenty realistic equations of state of neutron star matter were considered. In general the neutron star model in the theory of gravity with a non-minimal derivative coupling does not contradict astronomical data and is viable.</description>

      <title>Gravitational redshift via quantized linear gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ linearized quantum gravity to show that gravitational redshift occurs as a purely quantum process. To achieve our goal we study the interaction between propagating photonic wave-packets and gravitons. Crucially, the redshift occurs as predicted by general relativity but arises in flat spacetime in the absence of curvature. In particular, redshift as a classical gravitational effect can be understood as a mean-field process where an effective interaction occurs between the photon and gravitons in an effective highly-populated coherent state. These results can help improve our understanding of the quantum nature of gravity in the low energy and low curvature regime.</description>

      <title>Shadows of three black holes in static equilibrium configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ a ray-tracing algorithm to simulate the shadows of three equal-mass black holes in static equilibrium across a wide parameter space. We find that the shadows consist of a larger primary shadow and several distorted, eyebrow-like secondary shadows. The boundaries of these profiles exhibit self-similar fractal structures, which can be attributed to the photon chaotic scattering. In certain parameter spaces, we also observe the ring-like shadows, with the ring diameter associated with the spacing of black holes. Furthermore, when the black holes approach each other sufficiently, their shadows can merge into a standard disk, suggesting a shadow degeneracy between closely arranged triple black holes and a single massive, spherically symmetric black hole. The shadow features of the triple black holes revealed in this study have potential implications for analyzing the shadow formation mechanisms, as well as the gravitational lensing during the black holes merger process.</description>

      <title>Gravitational dark matter production from fermionic spectator fields during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational particle production from vacuum for a minimally coupled fermionic spectator field during a single-field inflationary phase. We observe that metric perturbations arising from the quantum fluctuations of a scalar inflaton field enhance gravitational production, showing that such a perturbative contribution becomes dominant if the field mass is sufficiently smaller than the inflationary Hubble rate. We focus on modes that leave the Hubble horizon during the latest stages of slow-roll and we numerically compute the total number of particles obtained from perturbations, providing a lower bound on the amount of such \enquote{geometric} particles for the case of Starobinsky inflation and a quadratic hilltop scenario. Our outcomes are compatible with the net observational cold dark matter abundance as experimentally measured, whose dark matter candidate exhibits mass in the range $10^5 \lesssim m \lesssim 10^7$ GeV, excluded by previous non-perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>Shedding Light on Gravity: Black Hole Shadows and Lensing Signatures in Lorentz Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances, including gravitational wave detections and imaging of black hole shadows, have strongly validated general relativity. Nevertheless, ongoing cosmological observations suggest potential limitations of general relativity, spurring interest in modified theories of gravity. This study explores Lorentz gauge theory, an alternative gravitational framework offering promising solutions to longstanding conceptual issues in quantum gravity and cosmology. By analyzing black hole shadow structures and gravitational lensing effects-both weak and strong deflection regimes-we highlight unique observational signatures of Lorentz gauge gravity. Our findings provide valuable tools for future observational tests, potentially distinguishing these modified gravity models from general relativity and advancing our understanding of spacetime geometry and fundamental gravitational interactions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Evolution in Generalized Scalar-Torsion Gravity with Extended Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we explore the cosmological behavior of a non-minimally coupled scalar field that is linked to torsion gravity. We demonstrate the Sorkin-Schutz formalism with general power law teleparallel torsion coupling. The autonomous dynamical system has been formulated. The phase space diagrams have been analysed at each critical point. The critical points representing different eras of Universe evolution starting from radiation, dark matter (DM), and dark energy (DE) have been investigated. The scaling attractors with the viable range of model parameters have been obtained using exponential scalar field couplings. This modified version of the formalism describes some novel scaling solutions.</description>

      <title>Extended Black Hole Solutions in Rastall Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the gravitational decoupling via the extended geometric deformation to extend the Schwarzschild vacuum solution to new black holes in Rastall theory. By employing linear transformations that deform both the temporal and radial coefficients of the metric, the field equations with a dual matter source are successfully decoupled into two sets. The first of these sets is described by the metric for the vacuum Schwarzschild spacetime, while the second set corresponds to the added extra source. Three extended solutions are obtained using two restrictions on the metric potentials and extra source, respectively. For selected values of the Rastall and decoupling parameters, we study the impact of the fluctuation of these parameters on the obtained models. We also investigate the asymptotic flatness of the resulting spacetimes by analysis of the metric coefficients. Finally, the nature of the additional source is explored for each model, via analysis of the energy conditions. It is found among other results that none of the obtained models satisfy the energy conditions, while only the model corresponding to the barotropic equation of state mimics an asymptotically flat spacetime.</description>

      <title>Neutrino dynamics in a non-commutative spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of non-commutative geometry on various aspects of neutrino behavior in curved spacetime. Adopting a Schwarzschild-like black hole solution with Lorentzian mass deformation induced by non-commutativity, we analyze three fundamental phenomena: the energy deposition rate from neutrino pair annihilation, the gravitationally induced phase shift in neutrino oscillations, and the associated transition probabilities under lensing conditions. Our outcomes reveal that non-commutativity significantly alters the energy deposition profile and modifies oscillation phases. Furthermore, these corrections impact also the flavor transition probabilities, particularly under gravitational lensing phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Singularities in Brane Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of cosmological singularities within the framework of Covariant Extrinsic Gravity (CEG), addressing both the initial Big Bang singularity and potential finite-time future singularities. Through detailed analysis of the emergent universe scenario, we systematically examine homogeneous and inhomogeneous perturbations (encompassing scalar, vector, and tensor modes) in a 4D FLRW brane geometry. Our work establishes rigorous existence criteria and stability conditions for a nonsingular Einstein static initial state, demonstrating that such a configuration remains stable for well-defined parameter ranges in CEG - thereby providing a compelling resolution to the long-standing initial singularity problem. Extending our analysis to late-time cosmology, we perform a complete classification of future singularity types following Barrow et al.'s formalism, deriving precise conditions that determine whether the universe in CEG evolves toward or avoids these singular states.</description>

      <title>A Power-law Inflation Tail for the Standard $R^2$-Inflation and the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conceptual problems of the standard slow-roll inflationary scenario include the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture issue, which severely restricts the tensor-to-scalar ratio in the standard minimally coupled scalar field inflation. Motivated by the fact that a scalar field in its vacuum configuration can be minimally coupled to gravity, or conformally coupled, and also that the first quantum corrections of the scalar field action include $R^2$ corrections, in this work we assume that $R^2$ gravity in the presence of a scalar field with constant equation of state parameter co-exist and control the early Universe. Constant equation of state parameter scalar field result from exponential scalar potentials. In our approach, the standard slow-roll era is controlled by the $R^2$ gravity and is followed by a power-law inflationary tail governed by a minimally coupled scalar field with an quintessential equation of state parameter, stemming from an exponential scalar potential. The fact that the total equation of state parameter after the end of the slow-roll era is equal to the value determined by the scalar field, has an effect on the duration of the $R^2$ governed slow-roll era, and it actually shortens the duration of the slow-roll era, by an extent which depends on the reheating temperature too, after all the inflationary patches have ended. The power-law inflationary tail to the standard $R^2$ inflation, solves the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture issues, and also the Swampland conjecture can be amended in this context. We also perform a dynamical system study to confirm numerically our findings.</description>

      <title>Consistency relation for the cosmological effects of modified gravity on gravitational waves and large scale structure observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy provides a unified model independent theoretical framework to study the effects of dark energy and modified gravity. We show that the EFT allows to derive a theory independent consistency relation between the effective gravitational constant, the gravitational and electromagnetic luminosity distance and the speed of gravitational waves (GW), which generalizes the results obtained in some luminal modified gravity theories.
  We apply the consistency relation to map the large scale structure observational constraints on the effective gravitational constant to GW-EMW distance ratio constraints. The consistency relation allows to probe the value of the effective gravitational constant with multimessenger observations, independently from large scale structure observations, or at high redshift, where only GW events and their electromagnetic counterpart are observable.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of nonsingular black holes in conformal gravity using megamaser observational data from NGC 4258</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform a Bayesian statistical fit to estimate the free parameters of a nonsingular black hole in conformal gravity by employing megamaser astrophysical data of the supermassive black hole hosted at the center of the active galactic nucleus of NGC 4258. This estimation has been carried out by taking into account a general relativistic approach, which makes use of the positions on the sky of the photon sources and the frequency shift observations from the water megamaser system in circular motion around the black hole. Within the framework of conformal gravity, a way to eliminate the singularity at r=0 from the Schwarzschild spacetime is by introducing a conformal factor characterized by a length scale parameter l and an integer parameter N. Therefore, the spacetime geometry depends on the mass of the black hole, and the conformal gravity parameters l and N. In this work, we estimate the mass-to-distance ratio M/D and the length scale ratio l/D for fixed values of the integer parameter N=1,2. This method leads to posterior Gaussian distribution for all the parameters, thus obtaining a most probable value for the length scale parameter l, in contrast to the information extracted from previous constraints based on X-ray astrophysical data, where an upper bound for the parameter l has been established. Furthermore, we obtain new physical properties regarding the existence of the ISCO radius for this nonsingular spacetime.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short paper, Penrose's famous singularity theorem is applied to the Kerr space-time. In the case of the maximally extended space-time, the assumptions of Penrose's singularity theorem are not satisfied as the space-time is not globally hyperbolic. In the case of the unextended space-time -- defined up to some radius between the inner and outer event horizons -- the assumptions of the theorem hold, but scalar curvature invariants remain finite everywhere. Calculations are done in detail showcasing the validity of the theorem, and misconceptions regarding the characterization of physical singularities by incomplete null geodesics are discussed.</description>

      <title>Black hole destabilization via trapped quasi-normal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of non-minimal gravitational couplings, matter field perturbations on a static black hole spacetime may develop unphysical poles in their linearized equations. Physical solutions confined in the domain between the event horizon and a pole satisfy a boundary value problem, although with boundary conditions which are different from standard quasi-normal modes. We refer to them as "trapped quasi-normal modes". Focusing on a Schwarzschild black hole in Einstein-Proca theory, we find that trapped quasi-normal modes accurately capture the behavior of perturbations under time evolution. In particular, axial-vector modes are unstable, with a growth rate that increases with multipole number. More interestingly, we uncover a new instability that affects monopole perturbations. These results confirm the existence of a novel destabilization mechanism of black holes by non-minimally coupled vector fields, with potential implications to well-studied models of modified gravity and cosmology based on vector particles.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormholes with multiple unstable critical curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number and position of unstable critical curves, as well as the nature of the accretion disk around compact objects, play a fundamental role in their optical appearance. Identifying differences in the optical spectrum of various observed compact objects can help classify them as black holes or black hole mimickers, such as traversable wormholes. Although multiple unstable critical curves have been reported to appear in asymmetric traversable wormholes, in this work we construct symmetric traversable wormholes with multiple unstable critical curves. We propose a general rational redshift function that allows us to trace the number of critical points of the effective potential and determine their nature as maxima or minima. The ray tracing method is used to study the trajectories of massless particles, particularly their behavior near the unstable critical points. Finally, a thin accretion disk model is implemented to analyze the optical appearance of the solution.</description>

      <title>Stellar isotropic model in the symmetric teleparallel equivalent of general relativity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the theory of symmetric teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (STEGR) has gained much interest in the cosmology and astrophysics community. Within this theory, we discuss the method of deriving a stellar isotropic model. In this respect, we implement the equations of motion of STEGR theory to a spacetime that is symmetric in a spherical manner, resulting in a set of nonlinear differential equations with more unknowns than equations. To solve this issue, we assume a special form of $g_{tt}$, and suppose a null value of the anisotropy to obtain the form of $g_{rr}$. We then investigate the possibility of obtaining an isotropic stellar model consistent with observational data. To test the stability of our model, we apply the adiabatic index and the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. Furthermore, we examine our model using different observed values of radii and masses of pulsars, showing that all of them fit in a consistent way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new magnetically charged Kiselev black hole solution is used to study the null geodesics in this spacetime. We derive the equations of motion for the null geodesics and analyze their properties, including the gravitational lensing effect. The 3D and equatorial plane orbits are discussed, with particular attention given to the effect of quintessence. The deviations from the Ernst black hole provide insights into the potential observational consequences of dark energy in strong gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>The universal crossover from thermodynamics and dynamics of supercritical RN-AdS black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of supercritical Reissner-Nordstr\"om Anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black holes in the extended phase space with the pressure defines as the cosmological constant. Supercritical black holes exist in the region where both temperature and pressure exceed the critical point, known as the supercritical region. The conventional view states that black holes in this regime are indistinguishable between large and small phases. However, recent research reveals that the supercritical regime exhibits universal gas-like and liquid-like phase separation, which shed light on the study on the supercritical region of RN-AdS black holes in the extended phase space. In this work, we calculate the thermodynamic potential and quasinormal modes (QNMs) of RN-AdS black holes, and identify transition curves between two different states in supercritical region using thermodynamic and dynamic methods. On one hand, we find the thermodynamic crossover curve (Widom line) by defining the scaled variance $\Omega$ (a higher-order derivative of Gibbs free energy). On the other hand, we identify the dynamic crossover curve (Frenkel line) by analyzing transitions between distinct QNM decay modes.</description>

      <title>Quartet-metric gravity and scalar graviton dark holes: supplements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note includes results of a study of stationary spherically symmetric ``dark holes'', objects merging central black holes and peripheral scalar graviton dark haloes arising in the framework of the modified gravity -- the quartet-metric, or more appropriately, multiscalar-metric gravity with spontaneously broken relativity as a gauge symmetry [1]. An exact solution to be considered as a basic one for the dark holes is presented. This solution may, in principle, be used for a qualitative description of the effect of asymptotically flat rotation curves in galaxies. To convert the basic solution into a more realistic one suitable for astrophysical applications, a family of modified solutions is considered. These solutions are studied numerically for representative set of free parameters.
  These results were reported in the talk [2] but not included into the proceedings [3] due to article length limitations. The note can be considered as a supplement to this reference.</description>

      <title>Review of analytic results on quasinormal modes of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a concise review of known analytic results for quasinormal modes of black holes and related spacetimes. Our emphasis is on those regimes where the perturbation equations admit exact or perturbative solutions, providing insights complementary to numerical or semi-analytic approaches. We discuss solvable cases in lower-dimensional spacetimes, algebraically special modes, and exact results in higher-curvature gravity theories. Particular attention is given to the eikonal regime and its correspondence with null geodesics, as well as to beyond-eikonal approximations based on inverse multipole expansions in parametrized metrics. We review analytic solutions obtained in the near-extremal limit of Schwarzschild - de Sitter black holes, in the regime of large field mass, and in pure de Sitter and anti - de Sitter spacetimes, where boundary conditions play a crucial role. While not exhaustive, this overview highlights the diversity of techniques and physical insights made possible by analytic treatments of quasinormal spectra.</description>

      <title>Displacement Memory Effect from Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain the recent results regarding the displacement memory effect (DME) of plane gravitational waves using supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This novel approach stems from the fact that both geodesic and Schr\"odinger equations are Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems. Supersymmetry provides a unified framework for P\"oschl-Teller and Scarf profiles and restores the critical values of wave amplitudes for DME in a natural way. Within our framework, we obtain a compact formula for DME in terms of the asymptotic values of the superpotential and the geodesics. In addition, this new technique enables us to build plane and gravitational waves with 2-transverse directions using superpartner potentials. Lastly, we study DME within a singular wave profile inspired by supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which shows the broader applicability of our method.</description>

      <title>Topology of circular orbits of charged particles in black holes with multiple horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the topological properties of circular orbits is opening up new perspectives for exploring the spacetime structure around black holes. In this work, we investigate how the charged properties of particles affect the topological characteristics of circular orbits for charged test particles in asymptotically flat, AdS, and dS black holes. Our findings demonstrate that the charged properties not only influence the topological properties of timelike circular orbits but also impact those of null circular orbits. Additionally, we explore scenarios involving multiple horizons and find that for a multi-horizon black hole, if a circular orbit can exist between two neighboring horizons, there will always be both a null circular orbit and a timelike circular orbit. Whether these orbits are stable or unstable depends on the potential function.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and absorption cross-section of a Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study quasinormal modes and absorption cross sections for the $(1+3)$-dimensional Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter. Studies of the massless scalar field is already done in \cite{Sun:2023slzl}. Hence, in this paper we will focus on the massive scalar field perturbations and massless Dirac field perturbations. To compute the quasinormal modes we use the semi-analytical 3rd-order WKB method, which has been shown to be one of the best approaches when the effective potential is adequate and when $n &lt; \ell$ and $n &lt; \lambda$. We have also utilized the P\"oschl-Teller method to compare the valus obtained using the WKB approach. We have computed quasinormal frequencies by varying various parameters of the theory such as the mass of the scalar field $\mu$, dark matter parameter $\alpha$ and the magnetic charge $g$. We have summarized our solutions in tables and figures for clarity. As for the absorption cross section, we used third order WKB approach to compute reflection, transmission coefficients and partial absorption cross sections. Graphs are presented to demonstrate the behavior of the above quantities when the dark matter parameter and mass of the massive scalar field are varied.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waveforms from periodic orbits around a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the periodic orbits, characterized by zoom-whirl behavior, around a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) embedded within a Dehnen-type dark matter (DM) halo. We demonstrate how the DM halo modifies the gravitational dynamics of the black hole, influencing the energy and angular momentum of timelike particle geodesics and enhancing their interaction with the BH. We determine the radii of the marginally bound orbits (MBOs) and innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs), showing that the DM halo increases both. This provides a deeper understanding of how the DM alters the behavior, energy, and angular momentum of timelike particle geodesics. Furthermore, we explore the gravitational waveforms emitted by a timelike particle in periodic orbits around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) within this BH-DM system. Using a semi-analytical approach, we calculate particle trajectories and derive the corresponding waveforms, demonstrating that the DM halo modifies the zoom-whirl orbital behavior, leading to distinct changes in the waveform structure. Our findings suggest that future gravitational wave (GW) observations could constrain the properties of DM halos surrounding BHs, providing new insights into the gravitational wave signatures arising from the interaction between BH gravity and DM.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the tetrad formalism to derive the general covariant Dirac equation in the Newman-Unti-Tamburino spacetime. After separating the variables, we get the system of two differential equations for angular functions and the system of four differential equations for radial functions. Solutions of the angular equations give the NUT charge-dependent quantization rule for the angular separation constant. As a result of studying the radial equations, the effects of NUT charge are described analytically in the particle-antiparticle production on the outer horizon. Also the scattering resonances with imaginary energies are found for the massless fermion. The particular case of extremal NUT black hole with a single horizon, when the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy vanishes identically, is considered.</description>

      <title>The ISW-Lensing Bispectrum &amp; Trispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations are correlated with the gravitational lensing potential. Famously, this induces a CMB three-point function, whose shape can be used to constrain dark energy and modifications to gravity. An analogous effect occurs at higher-order, producing an ISW-lensing trispectrum whose amplitude is hitherto unconstrained. We present a detailed discussion of this effect, and define minimum-variance estimators for the ISW-lensing three- and four-point functions. These are implemented within the PolySpec code, and bear strong similarities to the quadratic estimators used in lensing analyses. Applying these tools to Planck, we obtain strong detections of the bispectrum amplitude (consistent with previous works), but find only weak constraints on the trispectrum, due to a strong cancellation between the various ISW-induced contributions. We additionally forecast the constraints from future datasets, finding that (a) simple estimators for the ISW-lensing bispectrum will be severely limited by non-Gaussian modifications to the covariance, and (b) the ISW-lensing trispectrum will be very challenging to detect even with high-resolution future experiments. We finally consider the induced bias on primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes (and lensing itself), which we show to be large for the bispectrum (as expected) but negligible for the trispectrum.</description>

      <title>The firewall paradox is Wigner's friend paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The firewall paradox, a puzzle in black hole physics, depends on an implicit assumption: a rule that allows the infalling and the outside observer to combine their perspectives. However, a recent extension of the Wigner's friend paradox shows that such a combination rule conflicts with quantum theory $\unicode{x2013}$ without involving gravity. This challenges the usual conclusion of the firewall paradox, that standard quantum gravity assumptions are incompatible. More generally, black hole puzzles and Wigner's friend puzzles are closely related by a correspondence. This suggests that the firewall paradox may be a symptom of the same fundamental issue that leads to the extended Wigner's friend paradox.</description>

      <title>Energy conditions in $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are experiencing a golden age of experimental cosmology, with exact and accurate observations being used to constrain various gravitational theories like never before. Alongside these advancements, energy conditions play a crucial theoretical role in evaluating and refining new proposals in gravitational physics. We investigate the energy conditions (WEC, NEC, DEC, and SEC) for two $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity models using the FLRW metric in a flat geometry. Model 1, $f(Q, L_m) = -\alpha Q + 2L_m + \beta$, features linear parameter dependence, satisfying most energy conditions while selectively violating the SEC to explain cosmic acceleration. The EoS parameter transitions between quintessence, a cosmological constant, and phantom energy, depending on $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Model 2, $f(Q, L_m) = -\alpha Q + \lambda (2L_m)^2 + \beta$, introduces nonlinearities, ensuring stronger SEC violations and capturing complex dynamics like dark energy transitions. While Model 1 excels in simplicity, Model 2's robustness makes it ideal for accelerated expansion scenarios, highlighting the potential of $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity in explaining cosmic phenomena.</description>

      <title>SageNet: Fast Neural Network Emulation of the Stiff-amplified Gravitational Waves from Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of the inflationary gravitational waves (GWs) requires time-consuming, iterative numerical integrations of differential equations to take into account their backreaction on the expansion history. To improve computational efficiency while preserving accuracy, we present SageNet (Stiff-Amplified Gravitational-wave Emulator Network), a deep learning framework designed to replace conventional numerical solvers. SageNet employs a Long Short-Term Memory architecture to emulate the present-day energy density spectrum of the inflationary GWs with possible stiff amplification, $\Omega_\mathrm{GW}(f)$. Trained on a data set of 25,689 numerically generated solutions, SageNet allows accurate reconstructions of $\Omega_\mathrm{GW}(f)$ and generalizes well to a wide range of cosmological parameters; 89.3% of the test emulations with randomly distributed parameters exhibit errors of under 4%. In addition, SageNet demonstrates its ability to learn and reproduce the artificial, adaptive sampling patterns in numerical calculations, which implement denser sampling of frequencies around changes of spectral indices in $\Omega_\mathrm{GW}(f)$. The dual capability of learning both physical and artificial features of the numerical GW spectra establishes SageNet as a robust alternative to exact numerical methods. Finally, our benchmark tests show that SageNet reduces the computation time from tens of seconds to milliseconds, achieving a speed-up of ~$10^4$ times over standard CPU-based numerical solvers with the potential for further acceleration on GPU hardware. These capabilities make SageNet a powerful tool for accelerating Bayesian inference procedures for extended cosmological models. In a broad sense, the SageNet framework offers a fast, accurate, and generalizable solution to modeling cosmological observables whose theoretical predictions demand costly differential equation solvers.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Coma Cluster Structure: From the Core to the Hubble Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Coma cluster, embedded in a cosmic filament, is a complex and dynamically active structure in the local Universe. Applying a density-based member selection (dbscan) to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we identify its virilised core and zero-velocity boundary. Cross-correlating with the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) catalogue enables a velocity-distance analysis, incorporating radial infall models and redshift-independent distance estimators. This reveals, for the first time, the Hubble flow surrounding Coma, a first step to investigate the entanglement between the dark matter in bound objects and the dark energy driving the expansion of their surroundings. The distance to the Coma centre is determined as $69.959 \pm 0.012 \, h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$. From dbscan, we infer a virial radius of $r_{\rm vir} = \left(1.95 \pm 0.12\right)\,h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$ and a turnaround of $r_{\rm ta} \geq 4.87~{h}^{-1}~\mbox{Mpc}$. Combining the SDSS redshifts with the CF4 distances, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = (73.10 \pm 0.92)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}/\mbox{Mpc}$. However, with different calibrations for the distance moduli, $H_0$ varies between $[72, 80]$ km/s/Mpc. Mass estimates via caustics, the virial theorem, and the Hubble-flow method yield $M = [0.77, 2.0] \times 10^{15}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$, consistent with prior studies. Our systematic approach maps the structure of Coma into the local Hubble flow and shows the degeneracies between dynamical parameters such as the Hubble constant, the virial radius, and the total mass.</description>

      <title>Has DESI detected exponential quintessence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The new Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 results have strengthened the possibility that dark energy is dynamical, i.e., it has evolved over the history of the Universe. One simple, but theoretically well motivated and widely studied, physical model of dynamical dark energy is minimally coupled, single-field quintessence $\phi$ with an exponential potential $V(\phi)=V_0\,e^{-\lambda\phi}$. We perform a full Bayesian statistical analysis of the model using the DESI DR2 data, in combination with other cosmological observations, to constrain the model's parameters and compare its goodness of fit to that of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We find that the quintessence model provides a significantly better fit to the data, both when the spatial curvature of the Universe is fixed to zero and when it is allowed to vary. The significance of the preference varies between $\sim3.3\sigma$ and $\sim3.8\sigma$, depending on whether the curvature density parameter $\Omega_K$ is fixed or varied. We obtain the values $0.698^{+0.173}_{-0.202}$ and $0.722^{+0.182}_{-0.208}$ at the $68.3\%$ (i.e., $1\sigma$) confidence level for the parameter $\lambda$ in the absence and the presence of $\Omega_K$, respectively, which imply $\sim3.5\sigma$ preference for a nonzero $\lambda$. We also obtain $\Omega_K=0.003\pm 0.001$, which implies $\sim3\sigma$ preference for a positive $\Omega_K$, i.e., a negative curvature. Finally, we discuss the differences between quintessence and phenomenological parametrizations of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, in particular the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization.</description>

      <title>SILVIA: Ultra-precision formation flying demonstration for space-based interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose SILVIA (Space Interferometer Laboratory Voyaging towards Innovative Applications), a mission concept designed to demonstrate ultra-precision formation flying between three spacecraft separated by 100 m. SILVIA aims to achieve sub-micrometer precision in relative distance control by integrating spacecraft sensors, laser interferometry, low-thrust and low-noise micro-propulsion for real-time measurement and control of distances and relative orientations between spacecraft. A 100-meter-scale mission in a near-circular low Earth orbit has been identified as an ideal, cost-effective setting for demonstrating SILVIA, as this configuration maintains a good balance between small relative perturbations and low risk for collision. This mission will fill the current technology gap towards future missions, including gravitational wave observatories such as DECIGO (DECihertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory), designed to detect the primordial gravitational wave background, and high-contrast nulling infrared interferometers like LIFE (Large Interferometer for Exoplanets), designed for direct imaging of thermal emissions from nearby terrestrial planet candidates. The mission concept and its key technologies are outlined, paving the way for the next generation of high-precision space-based observatories.</description>

      <title>Non-Smooth Multi-objective Controller Synthesis for Test-Mass Actuation in Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a non-smooth controller optimization method and shows the results of ongoing research on the implementation of this method for gravitational wave applications. Typical performance requirements concerning these type of suspensions are defined in terms of both H2- and Hinf-type constraints. A non-smooth optimization approach is investigated, which allows the use of non-convex cost functions that are often a result of mixed H2/Hinf optimization problems. Besides the controller, the distribution of the actuation is integrated with the optimization to investigate the feasibility of simultaneous controller and actuator optimization. The results demonstrate that the proposed non-smooth optimization method is able to find suitable solutions for the control and actuator distribution that satisfy all required performance and design constraints.</description>

      <title>Barrow holographic dark energy with varying exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct Barrow holographic dark energy with varying exponent. Such an energy-scale-dependent behavior is typical in quantum field theory and quantum gravity under renormalization group considerations, however in the present scenario it has an additional justification, since in realistic cases one expects that Barrow entropy quantum-gravitational effects to be stronger at early times and to smooth out and disappear at late times. We impose specific, redshift-dependent ans\"{a}tze for the Barrow running exponent, such as the linear, CPL-like, exponential, and trigonometric ones, and we investigate their cosmological behavior. We show that we can recover the standard thermal history of the universe, with the sequence of matter and dark energy epochs, in which the transition from deceleration to acceleration happens at $z\approx 0.65$, in agreement with observations. In the most realistic case of hyperbolic tangent ansatz, in which we can easily bound Barrow exponent inside its theoretically determined bounds 0 and 1 for all redshifts, we see that the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter can be quintessence like, or experience the phantom-divide crossing, while in the future it can either tend to the cosmological constant value or start increasing again. All these features reveal that Barrow holographic dark energy with varying exponent is not only theoretically more justified than the standard, constant-exponent case, but it leads to richer cosmological behavior too.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Collapse in Higher-Dimensional Rastall Gravity with and without Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a spherically symmetric homogeneous perfect fluid undergoing a gravitational collapse to singularity in the framework of higher-dimensional Rastall gravity in the cases of vanishing and nonvanishing cosmological constants. The possible final states of the collapse in any finite dimension are black hole and naked singularity, but the naked singularity formation becomes less favored when the dimension is increased. We find that there are two physically distinct solutions for the collapse evolution in the case of nonzero cosmological constant: trigonometric and exponential solutions. The effective energy density of the fluid is decreasing (increasing) in the former (latter) when the magnitude of the cosmological constant is increased, which implies that the former undergoes a slower collapse than the latter. Furthermore, we find that a temporary trapped surface is possible to emerge in the case of trigonometric solution in the naked singularity region only. Therefore, distant observers with observational time shorter than the collapse duration may conclude that a black hole is formed, although the collapse will eventually lead to a naked singularity formation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waveforms from periodic orbits around a quantum-corrected black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals are crucial sources for future space-based gravitational wave detections. Gravitational waveforms emitted by extreme mass-ratio inspirals are closely related to the orbital dynamics of small celestial objects, which vary with the underlying spacetime geometry. Despite the tremendous success of general relativity, there are unsolved issues such as singularities in both black holes and cosmology. Loop quantum gravity, a theory addressing these singularity problems, offers a framework for regular black holes. In this paper, we focus on periodic orbits of a small celestial object around a supermassive quantum-corrected black hole in loop quantum gravity and compute the corresponding gravitational waveforms. We view the small celestial object as a massive test particle and obtain its four-velocity and effective potential. We explore the effects of quantum corrections on marginally bound orbits, innermost stable circular orbits, and other periodic orbits. Using the numerical kludge scheme, we further explore the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial object along different periodic orbits. The waveforms exhibit distinct zoom and whirl phases in a complete orbital period, closely tied to the quantum parameter $\hat \alpha$. We also perform a spectral analysis of the gravitational waves from these periodic orbits and assess their detectability. With the steady progress of space-based gravitational wave detection programs, our findings will contribute to utilizing extreme mass-ratio inspirals to test and understand the properties of quantum-corrected black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum cosmology aims at elucidating the beginning of our Universe. Back in early 80's, Vilenkin and Hartle-Hawking put forward the "tunneling from nothing" and "no boundary" proposals. Recently there has been renewed interest in this subject from the viewpoint of defining the oscillating path integral for Lorentzian quantum gravity using the Picard-Lefschetz theory. Aiming at going beyond the mini-superspace and saddle-point approximations, we perform Monte Carlo calculations using the generalized Lefschetz thimble method to overcome the sign problem. In particular, we confirm that either Vilenkin or Hartle-Hawking saddle point becomes relevant if one uses the Robin boundary condition depending on its parameter. We also clarify some fundamental issues in quantum cosmology, such as an issue related to the integration domain of the lapse function and an issue related to reading off the real geometry from the complex geometry obtained at the saddle point.</description>

      <title>$\kappa$-General-Relativity I: a Non-Commutative GR Theory with the $\kappa$-Minkowski Spacetime as its Flat Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a twist deformation on infinitesimal diffeomorphisms to study a modification of General Relativity on a non-commutative spacetime extending the local $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime. This non-commutative spacetime is present in Deformed Special Relativity (DSR) theories, where a fundamental length is relativistically incorporated into Special Relativity as an effective description of Quantum Gravity near Planckian energy scales. To avoid mathematical and physical ambiguities, such as the inability to twist-deform the Poincar\'e symmetry group such that $\kappa$-Minkowski becomes its covariant spacetime, we propose a novel approach to DSR and non-commutative theories, twisting the Dilatation-enlarged IGL(3,1) group and constructing deformed General Relativity accordingly. Physically, we interpret this as minimally modifying classical relativistic physics to accommodate quantum effects solely through spacetime uncertainties in a relativistic manner, a possibility new to DSR theories. These tools open the way to developing the dynamic sector of DSR, which would allow for predictions testable by astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Polarization modes of gravitational waves in scalar-tensor-Rastall theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rastall theory, originally introduced in 1972, suggests a violation of the usual conservation law. We consider two generalizations of Rastall theory: Brans-Dicke-Rastall theory and the newly established scalar-tensor-Rastall theory, the latter being a further generalization of the former. The field equations in these two generalized theories are studied across different parameter spaces, and the polarization modes of gravitational waves, as a key focus, are subsequently investigated. The results show that the polarization modes of gravitational waves in Brans-Dicke-Rastall theory are the same as those in Brans-Dicke theory; specifically, both theories exhibit the plus, cross, and breathing modes. However, in scalar-tensor-Rastall theory, the polarization modes of gravitational waves depend on the parameter space of the theory. Particularly, over a broad range of the parameter space, regardless of some special values of the parameters, it allows only two tensor modes, just as in general relativity, without introducing any additional degrees of freedom. This indicates that Rastall theory offers a novel approach to constructing modified gravity theories that propagate only two tensor degrees of freedom. In the remaining regions of the parameter space, there is also one scalar mode in addition to the two tensor modes. The scalar mode can be either a mixture of the breathing and longitudinal modes or just a pure breathing mode, depending on the parameter space. These results will play a crucial role in constraining the theoretical parameters through future gravitational wave detection projects, such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin.</description>

      <title>Graviton Fluctuations in Gravitational Wave Patterns: Analysis via Iterations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04562v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detections of gravitational waves since GW150914 has gained renewed interest in potential quantum-classical correspondences between GWs and gravitons. While a complete quantum theory of gravity remains elusive, graviton fluctuations have been hypothesized as sources of stochastic noise in gravitational interactions. Utilizing the Einstein-Langevin equation that describes graviton fluctuations, in attempt to form a correlation with GW generation, we treat the coalescing binary heuristically as a rotating, contracting Gaussian volume. This stochatic picture of GW formation implies the treatment of the contained gravitons as a Brownian bath. From the Einstein-Langevin equation, we establish a scaling relation where quanta dissipation depends inversely with the contracting volume (i.e., coalescence). Using an Euler iteration scheme, we simulate the graviton fluctuations from inspiral to merger as a Wiener process, revealing a signal that qualitatively resembles macroscopic GW waveforms. While inherently heuristic, this approach provides a computational framework for exploring graviton-scale perturbations in GW formation, with reproducible implementations in Wolfram Mathematica and equivalent Python code in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Background-dependent and classical correspondences between $f(Q)$ and $f(T)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $f(Q)$ and $f(T)$ gravity are based on fundamentally different geometric frameworks, yet they exhibit many similar properties. This article provides a comprehensive summary and comparative analysis of the various theoretical branches of torsional gravity and non-metric gravity, which arise from different choices of affine connection. We identify two types of background-dependent and classical correspondences between these two theories of gravity. The first correspondence is established through their equivalence within the Minkowski spacetime background. To achieve this, we develop the tetrad-spin formulation of $f(Q)$ gravity and derive the corresponding expression for the spin connection. The second correspondence is based on the equivalence of their equations of motion. Utilizing a metric-affine approach, we derive the general affine connection for static and spherically symmetric spacetime in $f(Q)$ gravity and compare its equations of motion with those of $f(T)$ gravity. Among others, our results reveal that, $f(T)$ solutions are not simply a subset of $f(Q)$ solutions; rather, they encompass a complex solution beyond $f(Q)$ gravity in black hole background.</description>

      <title>Non-Vacuum Solutions in Cotton Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cotton theory (CT) introduces a higher derivative extension of General Relativity (GR) characterized by third-rank field equations. Recently, key distinctions between CT and GR concerning wave and vacuum solutions have been highlighted in [1, 2]. In this study, two particular non-vacuum solutions of CT are investigated within its Codazzi formulation. The motivation is to reveal how this theory might account for or adapt to the effects of non-vacuum sources, and whether it can provide new insights into the behavior of both singular and regular black holes in astrophysical contexts. It is shown that CT generalizes the Kiselev and Dymnikova solutions in GR. Some aspects of the generalized solutions, in particular concerning singularities, thermodynamics, and geodesics, are addressed in comparison to GR.</description>

      <title>Understanding curvature-matter interaction in viable $f(R)$ dark energy models: A dynamical analysis approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a linear stability analysis approach to explore the dynamics of matter and curvature-driven dark energy interactions within the framework of two types of viable $f(R)$ gravity models. The interaction is modeled via a source term in the continuity equations, $\mathcal{Q} = \alpha \tilde{\rho}_{\rm m} \Big{(}\frac{3H^3}{\kappa^2 \rho_{\rm curv}} + \frac{\kappa^2 }{3H}\rho_{\rm curv} \Big{)}$. Our results reveal significant modifications to the fixed points and their stability criteria compared to traditional $f(R)$ gravity analyses without matter-curvature coupling. We identify constraints on model and coupling parameters necessary for critical point stability, illustrating how the interaction influences cosmic dynamics within specific parameter ranges. The findings are consistent with observed cosmic evolution, supporting stable late-time acceleration. Moreover, we highlight the coupling parameter's potential role in addressing the cosmic coincidence problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a semiclassical study of the Mixmaster cosmology minimally coupled to a massive scalar field in the Hamiltonian formalism, with focus on three distinct scenarios: the classical cosmology coupled to the quantized scalar field, and "effective" cosmology, with spacetime discreteness corrections, coupled to the classical scalar field, and to the quantized scalar field. We find several results: (i) the effective cosmology undergoes several small bounces before expanding, with scalar field excitations rising through the bounce; (ii) anisotropies rise and fall as the universe undergoes a bounce, a feature that is enhanced with matter; (iii) Lyapunov exponents reveal that chaos is reduced in the effective systems compared to the classical case.</description>

      <title>Greybody factors, reflectionless scattering modes, and echoes of ultracompact horizonless objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a recently discovered connection between the greybody factors of black holes and the ringdown signal, we investigate the greybody factors of ultracompact horizonless objects, also elucidating their connection to echoes. The greybody factor of ultracompact objects features both low-frequency resonances and high-frequency, quasi-reflectionless scattering modes, which become purely reflectionless in the presence of symmetric cavity potentials, as it might be the case for a wormhole. We show that it is these high-frequency (quasi-)reflectionless scattering modes, rather than low-frequency resonances, to be directly responsible for the echoes in the time-domain response of ultracompact objects or of black holes surrounded by matter fields localized at large distances.</description>

      <title>On a star with static conformally flat geometry inside</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of a star with constant positive energy density inside (as for the Schwarzschild interior geometry) and a negative pressure are investigated, using a static conformally flat spacetime. Because of the negative pressure, the gravitational field inside is repulsive. Ricci and Kretschmann curvature invariants are finite. The energy conditions for the stress tensor of the perfect fluid are satisfied, excepting the strong energy condition which is not obeyed for $r&lt;R/\sqrt{2}$, where $R$ is the radius of the object. The Komar mass is calculated and discussed.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Dynamical Evolution of Scalar Fields in the Einstein-Bumblebee Theory with a Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic behavior of static, spherically symmetric black holes within the Einstein-Bumblebee gravity model with a cosmological constant, focusing on scalar field perturbations. Through separation of the angular components, the scalar field perturbations outside the black hole are reduced to a purely radial main equation. The quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the system are then determined via the WKB approximation in the frequency domain, while the dynamic evolution of the system is examined in the time domain using finite difference methods. The eigenfrequencies of the waveforms from the time-domain evolution are fitted to cross-validate the frequency-domain results. The study finds that the Lorentz violation parameter $ \ell $ and the cosmological constant $ \Lambda $ significantly influence the QNMs. Specifically, as $ \ell $ increases, the real and imaginary components of the lower modes decrease, while in higher modes, the real part changes minimally, and the imaginary part decreases rapidly. An increase in $ \Lambda $ similarly results in a decrease in the overall QNM values. These results are supported by the time-domain analysis, providing a clearer picture of how Lorentz symmetry breaking affects the QNMs of de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes in Lovelock with degenerated AdS ground state and shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is motivated by (i) the recently proposed relationship between gravitational tension (through the Kretschmann scalar) and energy density \cite{Estrada:2024uuu} to construct regular black hole (RBH) solutions in Pure Lovelock (PL) gravity, and (ii) the fact that, for PL, the inclusion of a negative cosmological constant $\Lambda&lt;0$ leads to the appearance of a potential curvature singularity \cite{Cai:2006pq}. Thus, by using a particular choice of coupling constants such that the resulting equations of motion for Lovelock gravity have an $n$-fold degenerate ground state (LnFDGS) AdS, we provide a methodology to construct RBH solutions with $\Lambda&lt;0$ using an energy density model analogous to (but different in the definition of gravitational tension from) the one mentioned earlier. Moreover, because relating the gravitational tension to the Kretschmann scalar of the vacuum LnFDGS solution is complicated, we define an alternative version of the Kretschmann scalar suitable for the LnFDGS AdS theory and, consequently, a redefinition of the gravitational tension. Remarkably, we obtain a model where there exists a value $r_*$ slightly greater than the extremal radius, $r_* &gt; r_{ext}$, which could be on the order of the Planck length, such that the solutions of the vacuum AdS black hole and our AdS RBH become indistinguishable. However, at short length scales such that $r &lt; r_*$, quantum effects would arise, causing both cases to differ in their geometry (suppressing the central singularity) and their thermodynamic properties. Additionally, since it is not possible to find analytical relationships between the event horizon, the photon sphere radius, and the shadow size in LnFDGS, we propose a method to numerically and graphically obtain the aforementioned relationships and analyze their physical behavior.</description>

      <title>Nonstatic Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric in the perturbative $f(R)$ theory: Embedding in the background of the FLRW cosmology, uniqueness of solutions, the TOV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a nonstatic Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric, a metric that does not emit electromagnetic waves but can emit gravitational waves. We first use the GR theory to study a charged spherically symmetric gravitational source (CSSGS), the obtained results are further improved in comparison with the previous studies. In particular, this article considers that the field is not necessarily static. The metric tensors $ g_{\mu\nu} $ are considered both outside and inside the gravitational source (the results show that in the first case $ g_{\mu\nu} $ are time independent, in the latter case they are time dependent). The gravitational acceleration and the event horizon of a charged black hole are investigated. The results prove that the gravitational field is always attractive. We then use the perturbative $ f(R) $ theory to consider CSSGS. The obtained results not only correct the solution of Einstein's equation in magnitude (this will describe astronomical and cosmological quantities more accurately than Einstein's equation), but also reveal new effects. Outside the gravitational source, the metric tensors can depend on time, this makes it possible for a spherically symmetric gravitational source to emit gravitational waves (Einstein's equation cannot give this effect). However, a spherically symmetric field still does not emit electromagnetic waves. Next we present a new method for embedding the spherically symmetric metrics of a star (or a black hole) in the background of the FLRW cosmological. Finally, we discuss the uniqueness of the solutions of the f(R) theory. The perturbative TOV equation is also found.</description>

We searched 0.06 rad disk in the Orion spur, covering gravitational wave frequencies from 100 to 700 Hz and frequency derivatives between -1e-11 to 1e-11 Hz/s. A follow-up was performed, which found no outliers. An atlas of results from the first stage of the search is made publicly available.</description>

Abstract: We present the full release of the atlas of continuous gravitational waves, covering frequencies from 20 Hz to 1700 Hz and spindowns from -5e-10 to 5e-10 Hz/s. Compared to the early atlas release, we have extended the frequency range and have performed follow-up on the outliers. Conducting continuous wave searches is computationally intensive and time-consuming. The atlas facilitates the execution of new searches with relatively minimal computing resources.</description>

      <title>Geometric properties versus particle motion in the Fan-Wang spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore general relativistic effects and geometric properties of the Fan-Wang spacetime, one of the simplest regular solutions that can be obtained in nonlinear electrodynamics. In particular, we investigate the motion of test particles, the capture cross-section of neutral massive and massless particles, such as neutrinos and photons, and the gravitational redshift. Additionally, using a perturbative approach, we derive analytical expressions for the perihelion shift and gravitational deflection of massless particles. By identifying the one-parameter corrections to the Schwarzschild spacetime, induced by the magnetic charge contained in the Fan-Wang metric, we show that this spacetime can be falsified, since it modifies classical general relativity predictions even at the local level. Moreover, we argue that these modifications could be experimentally tested with advanced observational instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Landscapes: black holes with linear equations of state in asymptotically safe gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study black holes with linear equation of state within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. This study extends previous work on gravitational collapse in asymptotically safe gravity (that has been done for a dust fluid) by considering into account the pressure of stellar matter. We derive modified field equations containing the running gravitational coupling and the cosmological constant as functions of energy density. The interior space-time of collapsing star is modeled by the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric, while the exterior is described by a static spherically symmetric space-time. Different equations of state from ordinary matter to exotic phantom energy are considered to investigate their impact on black hole structure and horizon formation. Our results illustrate that asymptotically safe gravity can introduce non-singular black hole solutions under specific conditions. These results provide new insights into black hole physics and the avoidance of singularities within the asymptotically safe gravity framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hermitian non-K\"ahler Einstein 4-manifolds have a quasi-locally conserved charge associated to spin-lowering via Killing spinors, and corresponding to a parameter of the moduli space. This charge is evaluated for all explicitly known examples. Infinitesimal Einstein deformations are shown to admit a closed 2-form that measures the perturbation to this charge. Provided certain boundary conditions hold, a curve of metrics in the moduli space passing through a Hermitian non-K\"ahler Einstein metric is shown to be conformally K\"ahler to second perturbative order. This result is applied to prove that infinitesimal Ricci-flat deformations of ALF Hermitian non-K\"ahler instantons are tangent to the moduli space of Hermitian instantons, and hence as a consequence that infinitesimal rigidity holds. The analog of this statement also holds for the case of compact Hermitian non-K\"ahler Einstein metrics.</description>

      <title>Exponential distance relation (aka Titius-Bode rule) in extra solar planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present phenomenological evidence for the validity of an exponential distance relation (also known as generalized Titius-Bode law) in the 32 planetary systems (31 extra solar, plus our Solar System) containing at least 5 planets each (known up to July 2023). We produce the semi-log fittings of the data, and we check them against the statistical indicators of $R^2$ and $Median$. Then we compare them with the data of 4000 artificial planetary systems created at random. In this way, a possible origin by chance of the Titius-Bode rule (TBR) is reasonably excluded. We also point out that in some systems the fittings can be definitely improved by the insertion of new planets into specific positions. We discuss the Harmonic Resonances method and fittings, and compare them with the Titius-Bode fittings. Moreover, for some specific systems, we compare the Titius-Bode fitting against a polynomial fitting ($r\sim n^2$). Further comparisons with previous relevant works are reported in the last section. It emerges that TBR describes 25 out of the 32 planetary systems ($78\%$) with a $R^2\geq 0.95$. Further, it results to be the most economical (in terms of free parameters) and best fitting law for the description of spacing among planetary orbits. This analysis allows us to conclude that an exponential distance relation can reasonably be considered as ``valid'', or strongly corroborated, also in extra solar planetary systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interface between quantum theory and gravity represents still uncharted territory. Recently, some works suggested promising alternative approaches aimed at witnessing quantum features to test the fundamental nature of gravity in tabletop experiments: Two masses in an initial superposition of spatially localized states are allowed to interact only through gravity and it is measured whether the final state is entangled. Here we show that one can generate the same amount of entanglement in this setup by using classical time evolution given by Newton's laws of motion. We argue that theories of quantum gravity that can be approximated by the Newtonian potential and classical time evolution given by Newton's laws of motion will generate gravity-mediated entanglement.</description>

      <title>A classical Bousso bound for higher derivative corrections to general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Focussing on theories for which the higher derivative terms are considered as small corrections in the Lagrangian to Einstein's two-derivative theory of general relativity (GR), we prove the classical version of the covariant entropy bound (also known as the Bousso bound) in arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant gravitational theories. Even if the higher derivative corrections are treated perturbatively, we provide instances of specific configurations for which they can potentially violate the Bousso bound. To tackle this obstruction, we propose a modification in the Bousso bound that incorporates the offending contributions from the higher derivative corrections. We argue that the modified Bousso bound that we propose holds to all orders in the higher curvature corrections. Our proposed modifications are equivalent to replacing the Bekenstein-Hawking area term by Wald's definition (with dynamical corrections as suggested by Wall) for the black hole entropy. Hence, the modifications are physically well motivated by results from the laws of black hole mechanics in higher derivative theories.</description>

Abstract: We propose mixed boundary conditions for 3d conformal gravity consistent with variational principle in its second-order formalism that admit the chiral $\Lambda$-$\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra as their asymptotic symmetry algebra. This algebra is one of the four chiral $\mathcal W$-algebra extensions of $\mathfrak{so}(2,3)$ and is a generalisation of the chiral $\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra responsible for soft theorems of graviton MHV amplitudes in ${\mathbb R}^{1,3}$ gravity to the case of non-zero negative cosmological constant. The corresponding charges calculated using the modified covariant phase space formalism are shown to be finite and integrable, and realise this non-linear ${\cal W}$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Systematic integral evaluation for spin-resummed binary dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computation of spin-resummed observables in post-Minkowskian dynamics typically involve evaluation of Feynman integrals deformed by an exponential factor, where the exponent is a linear sum of the momenta being integrated. Such integrals can be viewed as tensor integral generating functions, which provide alternative approaches to tensor reduction of Feynman integrals. We develop a systematic method to evaluate tensor integral generating functions using conventional multiloop integration techniques. The spin-resummed aligned-spin eikonal at second post-Minkowskian order is considered as a phenomenologically relevant example where evaluation of tensor integral generating functions is necessary.</description>

      <title>Searching for new physics using high precision absorption spectroscopy; continuum placement uncertainties and the fine structure constant in strong gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searches for variations of fundamental constants require a comprehensive understanding of measurement errors. This paper examines a source of error that is usually overlooked: the impact of continuum placement error. We investigate the problem using a high resolution, high signal to noise spectrum of the white dwarf G191$-$B2B. Narrow photospheric absorption lines allow us to search for new physics in the presence of a gravitational field approximately $10^4$ times that on Earth. Modelling photospheric lines requires knowing the underlying spectral continuum level. We describe the development of a fully automated, objective, and reproducible continuum estimation method. Measurements of the fine structure constant are produced using several continuum models. The results show that continuum placement variations result in small systematic shifts in the centroids of narrow photospheric absorption lines which impact significantly on fine structure constant measurements. This effect should therefore be included in the error budgets of future measurements. Our results suggest that continuum placement variations should be investigated in other contexts, including fine structure constant measurements in stars other than white dwarfs. The analysis presented here is based on NiV absorption lines in the photosphere of G191$-$B2B. Curiously, the inferred measurement of the fine structure constant obtained in this paper using NiV (the least negative of our measurements is $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = -1.462 \pm 1.121 \times 10^{-5}$) is inconsistent with the most recent previous G191$-$B2B photospheric measurement using FeV ($\Delta\alpha/\alpha = 6.36 \pm 0.35_{stat} \pm 1.84_{sys} \times 10^{-5}$). Given both measurements are derived from the same spectrum, we presume (but in this work are unable to check) that this 3.2$\sigma$ difference results from unknown laboratory wavelength systematics.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation on the Lattice I: Backreaction and Nonlinear Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violating the slow-roll regime during the final stages of inflation can significantly enhance curvature perturbations, a scenario often invoked in models producing primordial black holes and small-scale scalar induced gravitational waves. When perturbations are enhanced, one approaches the regime in which tree-level computations are insufficient, and nonlinear corrections may become relevant. In this work, we conduct lattice simulations of ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics to investigate the significance of nonlinear effects, both in terms of backreaction on the background and in the evolution of perturbations. Our systematic study of various USR potentials reveals that nonlinear corrections are significant when the tree-level curvature power spectrum peaks at $\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta} = {\cal O}(10^{-3})-{\cal O}(10^{-2})$, with 5%-20% corrections. Larger enhancements yield even greater differences. We find a simple universal relation between simulation and tree-level quantities $\dot\phi = \dot\phi_{\rm tree}\left(1+\sqrt{\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta,\rm tree}}\right)$ at the end of the USR phase, which is valid in all cases we consider. Additionally, we explore how nonlinear interactions during the USR phase affect the clustering and non-Gaussianity of scalar fluctuations, crucial for understanding the phenomenological consequences of USR, such as scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes. Our findings demonstrate the necessity of going beyond leading order perturbation theory results, through higher-order or non-perturbative computations, to make robust predictions for inflation models exhibiting a USR phase.</description>

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the analytic structure of FRW wavefunction coefficients, facilitated by the development of efficient algorithms to derive the differential equations they satisfy. Moreover, recent findings indicate that the twisted cohomology of the associated hyperplane arrangement defining FRW integrals overestimates the number of integrals required to define differential equations for the wavefunction coefficient. We demonstrate that the associated dual cohomology is automatically organized in a way that is ideal for understanding and exploiting the cut/residue structure of FRW integrals. Utilizing this understanding, we develop a systematic approach to organize compatible sequential residues, which dictates the physical subspace of FRW integrals for any $n$-site, $\ell$-loop graph. In particular, the physical subspace of tree-level FRW wavefunction coefficients is populated by differential forms associated to cuts/residues that factorize the integrand of the wavefunction coefficient into only flat space amplitudes. After demonstrating the validity of our construction using intersection theory, we develop simple graphical rules for cut tubings that enumerate the space of physical cuts and, consequently, differential forms without any calculation.</description>

      <title>Stepping Up Superradiance Constraints on Axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light feebly-coupled bosonic particles can efficiently extract the rotational energy of rapidly spinning black holes on sub-astrophysical timescales via a phenomenon known as black hole superradiance. In the case of light axions, the feeble self-interactions of these particles can lead to a non-linear coupled evolution of many superradiant quasi-bound states, dramatically altering the rate at which the black hole is spun down. In this work, we extend the study of axion superradiance to higher order states, solving for the first time the coupled evolution of all states with $n \leq 5$ in the fully relativistic limit (with $n$ being the principle quantum number). Using a Bayesian framework, we re-derive constraints on axions using the inferred spins of solar mass black holes, demonstrating that previously adopted limit-setting procedures have underestimated current sensitivity to the axion decay constant $f_a$ by around one order of magnitude, and that the inclusion to higher order states allows one to reasonably capture the evolution of typical high-spin black holes across a much wider range of parameter space, thereby allowing constraints to be extended to more massive axions. We conclude with an extensive discussion on the systematics associated with spin inference from x-ray observations.</description>

      <title>New analysis of SNeIa Pantheon Catalog: Variable speed of light as an alternative to dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05262v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003) Blanchard, Douspis, Rowan-Robinson, and Sarkar (BDRS) slightly modified the primordial fluctuation spectrum and produced an excellent fit to WMAP's CMB power spectrum for an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe, bypassing dark energy. Curiously, they obtained a Hubble value of $H_0\approx46$, in sharp conflict with the canonical range $H_0\sim67-73$. However, we will demonstrate that the reduced value of $H_0\approx46$ achieved by BDRS is fully compatible with the use of variable speed of light in analyzing the late-time cosmic acceleration observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). In Phys. Lett. B 862, 139357 (2025) we uncovered a hidden aspect in a generic class of scale-invariant actions: the dynamics of the dilaton can induce a variation in the speed of light as $c\propto\chi^{1/2}$, causing $c$ to vary alongside $\chi$ across spacetime. For an EdS universe with varying $c$, besides the effects of cosmic expansion, light waves emitted from distant SNeIa are further subject to a refraction effect, which alters the Lemaitre redshift relation to $1+z=a^{-3/2}$. Based on this new formula, we achieve a fit to the SNeIa Pantheon Catalog exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Crucially, our approach does not require dark energy and produces $H_0=47.2$ in strong alignment with the BDRS finding of $H_0\approx46$. Hence, BDRS's analysis of the (early-time) CMB power spectrum and our variable-$c$ analysis of the (late-time) Hubble diagram of SNeIa fully agree on two counts: (i) the dark energy hypothesis is avoided, and (ii) $H_0$ is reduced to $\sim47$, which also yields an age $t_0=2/(3H_0)=13.8$ Gy for an EdS universe, without requiring dark energy. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be attributed to the declining speed of light in an expanding EdS universe, rather than to a dark energy component.</description>

      <title>Exploring the anisotropic gravitational wave background from all-sky mock gravitational wave event catalogues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) serves as a potential probe of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. In this work, we explore the anisotropic SGWB from local ($z &lt; \sim 0.085$) merging stellar mass compact binaries, specifically focusing on merging stellar binary black holes, merging neutron-star-black-hole binaries, and merging binary neutron stars. The analysis employs seven all-sky mock lightcone gravitational wave event catalogues, which are derived from the Millennium simulation combined with a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation and a binary population synthesis model. We calculate the angular power spectra $\mathrm{C}_\ell$ at multipole moments $\ell$, expressed as $\text{log}_{10} [\ell(\ell+1)\mathrm{C}_\ell/(2\pi)]$, based on the skymaps of the overdensity $\delta_\mathrm{GW}$ in the anisotropic SGWB. The spectra for all three source types exhibit an approximately linear increase with $\text{log}_{10} \ell$ at higher $\ell$ (e.g., $\ell &gt; \sim 30 - 300$) in seven catalogues, with a characteristic slope of $\sim 2$. The spectra of seven catalogues exhibit considerable variations, arising from fluctuations in spatial distribution, primarily in the radial distribution, of nearby sources (e.g., $&lt; 50$ Mpc/h). After subtracting these nearby sources, the variations become much smaller and the spectra for the three source types become closely aligned (within discrepancies of a factor of $\sim 2$ across $\ell = 1 - 1000$ for all catalogues). We also find that including further sources results in a rapid decrease in the anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a recently identified four-loop Feynman integral that contains a three-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometry and contributes to the scattering of black holes in classical gravity at fifth post-Minkowskian and second self-force order (5PM 2SF) in the conservative sector. In contrast to previously studied Calabi-Yau Feynman integrals, the higher-order differential equation that this integral satisfies in dimensional regularization exhibits $\varepsilon$-dependent apparent singularities. We introduce an appropriate ansatz which allows us to bring such cases into an $\varepsilon$-factorized form. As a proof of principle, we apply it to the integral at hand.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory on curved manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses how particle production from the vacuum can be explained by local analysis when the field theory is defined by differential geometry on curved manifolds. We have performed the local analysis in a mathematically rigorous way, respecting the Markov property. The exact WKB is used as a tool for extracting non-perturbative effect from the local system. After a serious application of the differential geometry and the exact WKB to particle production, we show that entanglement does not appear in the Unruh effect as far as the standard formulation by the differential geometry is valid. This result should not be attributed to a consistency problem between the ``entanglement state'' and the ``standard field theory by differential geometry'', but to the fact that the conventional calculation of the Unruh effect is done by extrapolation which is not consistent with the differential geometry. The situation is similar to that of the Dirac monopole, but topology is not relevant and the basis for building field theories in differential geometry is strongly involved.</description>

      <title>Inequivalence between the Euclidean and Lorentzian versions of the type IIB matrix model from Lefschetz thimble calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is conjectured to describe superstring theory nonperturbatively in terms of ten $N \times N$ bosonic traceless Hermitian matrices $A_\mu$ ($\mu=0, \ldots , 9$), whose eigenvalues correspond to $(9+1)$-dimensional space-time. Quite often, this model has been investigated in its Euclidean version, which is well defined although the ${\rm SO}(9,1)$ Lorentz symmetry of the original model is replaced by the ${\rm SO}(10)$ rotational symmetry. Recently, a well-defined model respecting the Lorentz symmetry has been proposed by gauge-fixing the Lorentz symmetry nonperturbatively using the Faddeev-Popov procedure. Here we investigate the two models by Monte Carlo simulations, overcoming the severe sign problem by the Lefschetz thimble method, in the case of matrix size $N=2$ omitting fermionic contributions. We add a quadratic term $\gamma \, \mathrm{tr} (A_\mu A^\mu)$ in the action and calculate the expectation values of rotationally symmetric (or Lorentz symmetric) observables as a function of the coefficient $\gamma$. Our results exhibit striking differences between the two models around $\gamma=0$ and in the $\gamma&gt;0$ region, associated with the appearance of different saddle points, clearly demonstrating their inequivalence against naive expectations from quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Modeling the shadow of Sgr A* through an eclipsing black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr\,A* resolved the shadow image and emission ring-like structure, which is associated to the photon ring of the supermassive black hole, at the galactic centre, revealing a diameter of $51.8~\mu \text{as}$. The ring-like structure is consistent with that of a Kerr black hole. However, the source of the high bright regions in the image and the time variability remain an open question. Besides the plasma properties and emission models, the spacetime geometry also holds an important role. We present an image depicting the bright hot spots consistent with Sgr\,A* observations at a wavelength $ \lambda = 1.3\, {\rm mm}$. The image is the result of an eclipsing Schwarzschild black hole situated along the line of sight between the galactic centre and Earth. The separation from both, primary (Sgr\,A*) and secondary (eclipsing) black holes is $10233\, {\rm AU}$. The central supermassive black hole located at the centre of the galaxy has an observational mass of $4.14\times10^6\,M_{\odot}$ and the secondary eclipsing black hole has an inferred mass of $1035\,M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapless Theories and Unparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute correlation functions of the primordial density perturbations when they couple to a gapless, strongly coupled sector of spectator fields -- ``unparticles" -- during inflation. We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle. Only the full shapes of bispectra and trispectra can break this degeneracy.</description>

Abstract: Long-baseline atom interferometry is a promising technique for probing various aspects of fundamental physics, astrophysics and cosmology, including searches for ultralight dark matter (ULDM) and for gravitational waves (GWs) in the frequency range around 1~Hz that is not covered by present and planned detectors using laser interferometry. The MAGIS detector is under construction at Fermilab, as is the MIGA detector in France. The PX46 access shaft to the LHC has been identified as a very suitable site for an atom interferometer of height $\sim 100$m, sites at the Boulby mine in the UK and the Canfranc Laboratory are also under investigation, and possible sites for km-class detectors have been suggested. The Terrestrial Very-Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration proposes a coordinated programme of interferometers of increasing baselines.</description>
