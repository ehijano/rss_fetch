      <title>When Recall Fails, Discord Remembers: A Quantum Analogue of Kuhn's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A behavioral quantum strategy is shown to replicate the payoff of a classical mixed strategy in an extensive-form game with imperfect recall, using only local measurements on a separable quantum state with zero entanglement and nonzero discord. Classical behavioral strategies, constrained by imperfect recall, cannot achieve this coordination. The result suggests a quantum analogue to Kuhn's classical equivalence: discord enables behavioral-style strategies to functionally substitute for strategic memory and recover coordination lost in the classical setting. This highlights quantum discord as a minimal and robust resource for extending bounded rationality beyond classical limits.</description>

      <title>Equitable Allocations of Mixtures of Goods and Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equitable allocation of indivisible items involves partitioning the items among agents such that everyone derives (almost) equal utility. We consider the approximate notion of \textit{equitability up to one item} (EQ1) and focus on the settings containing mixtures of items (goods and chores), where an agent may derive positive, negative, or zero utility from an item. We first show that -- in stark contrast to the goods-only and chores-only settings -- an EQ1 allocation may not exist even for additive $\{-1,1\}$ bivalued instances, and its corresponding decision problem is computationally intractable. We focus on a natural domain of normalized valuations where the value of the entire set of items is constant for all agents. On the algorithmic side, we show that an EQ1 allocation can be computed efficiently for (i) $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ normalized valuations, (ii) objective but non-normalized valuations, (iii) two agents with type-normalized valuations. Previously, EQX allocations were known to exist only for 2 agents and objective valuations, while the case of subjective valuations remained computationally intractable even with two agents. We make progress by presenting an efficient algorithm that outputs an EQX allocation for $\{-1,1\}$ normalized subjective valuations for any number of agents. We complement our study by providing a comprehensive picture of achieving EQ1 allocations in conjunction with economic efficiency notions such as Pareto optimality and social welfare.</description>

      <title>The Core of Approval-Based Committee Elections with Few Seats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an approval-based committee election, the goal is to select a committee consisting of $k$ out of $m$ candidates, based on $n$ voters who each approve an arbitrary number of the candidates. The core of such an election consists of all committees that satisfy a certain stability property which implies proportional representation. In particular, committees in the core cannot be "objected to" by a coalition of voters who is underrepresented. The notion of the core was proposed in 2016, but it has remained an open problem whether it is always non-empty. We prove that core committees always exist when $k \le 8$, for any number of candidates $m$ and any number of voters $n$, by showing that the Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) rule due to Thiele [1895] always satisfies the core when $k \le 7$ and always selects at least one committee in the core when $k = 8$. We also develop an artificial rule based on recursive application of PAV, and use it to show that the core is non-empty whenever there are $m \le 15$ candidates, for any committee size $k \le m$ and any number of voters $n$. These results are obtained with the help of computer search using linear programs.</description>
