      <title>Development of a single-parameter spring-dashpot rolling friction model for coarse-grained DEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating granular materials composed of non-spherical particles remains a major challenge in discrete element method (DEM) simulations due to the complexity of contact detection and rotational dynamics, rendering large-scale simulations computationally prohibitive. To address this limitation, rolling friction is commonly introduced as an approximation to account for particle shape effects by applying a resistive torque to spherical particles. Among existing rolling friction formulations, the spring-dashpot (S-D) type model is widely recognized for its numerical stability and realistic representation of rolling resistance. However, conventional S-D models require multiple empirical parameters that must be calibrated in an interdependent manner, leading to increased experimental effort, parameter ambiguity, and uncertainty in practical applications. To overcome these issues, this study proposes a new S-D type rolling friction model that reduces the parameter set to a single physically meaningful quantity: the critical rolling angle. Derived from theoretical considerations, this parameter characterizes the transition from static to rolling motion at particle contacts. The use of a single parameter simplifies implementation and eliminates the need for extensive calibration. Stability analysis demonstrates that the proposed model allows particles to reach a physically consistent equilibrium state without spurious rotational oscillations. For large-scale applications, the model is further integrated into a coarse-grained DEM framework. Validation using DEM-CFD simulations of an incinerator system confirms that the proposed approach successfully reproduces the macroscopic behavior of the original particle system. Overall, this study enhances the applicability of DEM for industrial-scale simulations involving non-spherical particles.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling for Neutron Transport: A Neural Operator Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a neural operator based surrogate modeling framework for neutron transport computation. Two architectures, the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), were trained for fixed source problems to learn the mapping from anisotropic neutron sources, Q(x,{\mu}), to the corresponding angular fluxes, {\psi}(x,{\mu}), in a one-dimensional slab geometry. Three distinct models were trained for each neural operator, corresponding to different scattering ratios (c = 0.1, 0.5, &amp; 1.0), providing insight into their performance across distinct transport regimes (absorption-dominated, moderate, and scattering-dominated). The models were subsequently evaluated on a wide range of previously unseen source configurations, demonstrating that FNO generally achieves higher predictive accuracy, while DeepONet offers greater computational efficiency. Both models offered significant speedups that become increasingly pronounced as the scattering ratio increases, requiring &lt;0.3% of the runtime of a conventional S_N solver. The surrogate models were further incorporated into the S_N k-eigenvalue solver, replacing the computationally intensive transport sweep loop with a single forward pass. Across varying fission cross sections and spatial-angular grids, both neural operator solvers reproduced reference eigenvalues with deviations up to 135 pcm for DeepONet and 112 pcm for FNO, while reducing runtime to &lt;0.1% of that of the S_N solver on relatively fine grids. These results demonstrate the strong potential of neural operator frameworks as accurate, efficient, and generalizable surrogates for neutron transport, paving the way for real-time digital twin applications and repeated evaluations, such as in design optimization.</description>

      <title>The Beauty of Mathematics in Helfrich's Biomembrane Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is with great regret that Prof. Wolfgang Helfrich passed away on 28 September 2025 in Berlin. As the founder of the membrane liquid crystal model, Prof. Helfrich made outstanding contributions to membrane physics and liquid crystal display technology. This review article is written in his memory. Biomembranes, primarily composed of lipid bilayers, are not merely passive barriers but dynamic and complex materials whose shapes are governed by the principles of soft matter physics. This review explores the shape problem in biomembranes through the lens of material science and liquid crystal theory. Beginning with classical analogies to crystals and soap bubbles, it details the application of the Helfrich elastic model to explain the biconcave shape of red blood cells. The discussion extends to multi-layer systems, drawing parallels between the focal conic structures of smectic liquid crystals, the geometries of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, and the reversible transitions in peptide assemblies. Furthermore, it examines icosahedral self-assemblies and shape formation in two-dimensional lipid monolayers at air/water interfaces. At the end of the paper, we find that the shapes such as cylinders, spheres, tori, bicocave discoids and Delaunay surfaces form a group. This result is merely an intrinsic geometric feature of these shapes and is independent of the biomembrane equation. When the pressure on the membrane, surface tension, and bending modules meet certain conditions, the biomembrane will take on these shapes. The review concludes by highlighting the unifying power of continuum elastic theories in describing a vast array of membrane morphologies across biological and synthetic systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Evolutionary Design of Molecules with Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials are essential for many photonic, telecommunication, and laser technologies, yet discovering better NLO molecules is computationally challenging due to the vast chemical space and competing objectives. We compare evolutionary algorithms for molecular design, targeting four objectives: maximizing the ratio of first-to-second hyperpolarizability $(\beta/\gamma)$, optimizing HOMO-LUMO gap and linear polarizability to target ranges, and minimizing energy per atom. We encode molecules as SMILES strings and evaluate their properties using quantum-chemical calculations. We compare NSGA-II, MAP-Elites, MOME, a single-objective $(\mu+\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithm, and simulated annealing. Quality diversity methods maintain archives across a measure space defined by atom and bond count, enabling the discovery of structurally diverse molecules. Our results demonstrate that NSGA-II consistently earns high scores in every objective, leading to high-quality molecules, but MOME does a better job exploring a wide range of possibilities, resulting in higher global hypervolume and MOQD scores. However, each method has strengths and weaknesses, and produced many promising molecules.</description>

      <title>Finding Molecules with Specific Properties: Simulated Annealing vs. Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the ability of a simulated annealing program and an evolutionary algorithm to find molecules with large molecular average hyperpolarizabilities. This property is an important component of nonlinear optical materials. Both optimization programs represent molecules as SMILES strings, a method that is widely used by chemists to describe molecular structure using short ASCII strings. Our results suggest that both approaches are comparable and can be used to solve a variety of more realistic problems of interest to chemists and material scientists.</description>

      <title>Inverse Engineering of Optical Constants in Photochromic Micron-Scale Hybrid Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photochromic materials enable dynamic optical modulation through reversible transitions between distinct absorption states, with broad potential for smart windows, adaptive optics, and reconfigurable photonic devices. Micron-scale photochromic hybrid films present a particularly attractive platform for these applications, combining straightforward preparation with substantial optical modulation and scalability for high-volume fabrication. However, rational design of such films remains fundamentally constrained by the absence of well-defined optical constants. Unlike homogeneous thin films, micron-scale hybrid photochromic materials comprise active particles dispersed non-uniformly within polymer matrices. Conventional first-principles electromagnetic simulations face substantial computational costs and discrepancies between simulated and experimental particle distributions. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework that extracts effective optical constants directly from minimal experimental transmittance measurements. Our dual-state effective model approximates the complex inhomogeneous photochromic layer as a compressed homogeneous medium characterized by pseudo-refractive indices and pseudo-extinction coefficients for both pristine and UV-irradiated states. Through systematic optimization against experimental data from tungsten oxide-polyvinylpyrrolidone hybrid films, we determine wavelength-dependent pseudo-optical constants and compression ratios that enable accurate prediction of optical modulation within the tested thickness range. Our methodology establishes a framework for engineering hybrid photochromic systems and demonstrates how data-driven modeling can overcome limitations in characterizing complex nanostructured materials.</description>

Abstract: We present a biologically inspired quantum neural network that encodes neuronal populations as fully connected qubits governed by the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) quantum Hamiltonian and stabilized by a synaptic-efficacy feedback implementing activity-dependent homeostatic control. The framework links collective quantum many-body modes and attractor structure to population homeostasis and rhythmogenesis, outlining scalable computational primitives -- stable set points, controllable oscillations, and size-dependent robustness -- that position LMG-based architectures as promising blueprints for bio-inspired quantum brains on future quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Graph neural network for colliding particles with an application to sea ice floe modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to sea ice modeling using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), utilizing the natural graph structure of sea ice, where nodes represent individual ice pieces, and edges model the physical interactions, including collisions. This concept is developed within a one-dimensional framework as a foundational step. Traditional numerical methods, while effective, are computationally intensive and less scalable. By utilizing GNNs, the proposed model, termed the Collision-captured Network (CN), integrates data assimilation (DA) techniques to effectively learn and predict sea ice dynamics under various conditions. The approach was validated using synthetic data, both with and without observed data points, and it was found that the model accelerates the simulation of trajectories without compromising accuracy. This advancement offers a more efficient tool for forecasting in marginal ice zones (MIZ) and highlights the potential of combining machine learning with data assimilation for more effective and efficient modeling.</description>

      <title>Combined dynamic-kinematic validation of droplet-wall impact modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many numerical studies validate droplet wall impact using only maximum spreading diameter, yet this metric alone cannot ensure correct droplet dynamics. We present a combined dynamic contact angle (DCA) model that merges the geometric accuracy of the generalized Hoffman-Voinov-Tanner law with the kinematic consistency of a Hoffman function-based approach, improving predictions of droplet spreading and receding. We simulate water-glycerol droplet impact on sapphire glass at Weber numbers 20 -- 250 and assess both contact angle formulations. Simulated radial velocity fields are processed in Python using SciPy and compared with Particle Image Velocimetry measurements in the longitudinal section of the spreading droplet. The Hoffman function-based model captures the main droplet kinematic trends and provides more consistent receding dynamics. The generalized Hoffman-Voinov-Tanner law matches the maximum spreading diameter within 7%. However, during receding, it shows a median absolute error in radial velocity up to three times higher than that of the Hoffman function-based solution. Average radial velocity and spreading velocity can differ from experimental trends even when maximum spreading is reproduced. These findings support validation combining geometric and kinematic metrics and motivate the combined model for predicting spreading and receding. Using the maximum spreading factor $\beta_{max}$ as the ratio of the maximum spreading diameter over the initial droplet diameter and the characteristic capillary number $Ca_{char}$ defined from the mean internal horizontal velocity at 300 micrometer above the substrate, we introduce a $(\beta_{max},\,Ca_{char})$ diagram to relate spreading characteristics to internal flow dynamics. We hypothesize that, given sufficient data, the contact-line geometry may be used to estimate internal kinematics.</description>

      <title>A fluctuating lattice Boltzmann formulation based on orthogonal central moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal fluctuations play a central role in fluid dynamics at mesoscopic scales and must be incorporated into numerical schemes in a manner consistent with statistical mechanics. In this work, we develop a fluctuating lattice Boltzmann formulation based on an orthogonal central-moments-based representation. Stochastic forcing is introduced directly in the space of central moments (CMs) and consistently paired with mode-dependent relaxation, yielding a discrete kinetic model that satisfies the fluctuation-dissipation theorem exactly at the lattice level. Owing to the orthogonality of the basis, the equilibrium covariance matrix of the central moments is diagonal, and each non-conserved mode can be interpreted as an independent discrete Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with variance fixed by equilibrium thermodynamics. The resulting formulation guarantees exact equipartition of kinetic energy at equilibrium, preserves Galilean invariance, and retains the enhanced numerical stability characteristic of CMs-based collision operators. Explicit fluctuating schemes are constructed for the D2Q9 and D3Q27 lattices. The extension to reduced-velocity discretisation is discussed too. A comprehensive set of numerical tests verifies correct thermalisation, isotropy of equilibrium statistics, and the expected scaling of velocity fluctuations with thermal energy, density, and relaxation time. In contrast to fluctuating BGK formulations, the present method remains stable and well posed in the over-relaxation regime, including in the immediate vicinity of the stability limit. These results demonstrate that CMs-based lattice Boltzmann methods provide a natural and robust framework for fluctuating hydrodynamics, in which dissipation, noise, and kinetic mode structure are consistently aligned at the discrete level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study is concerned with a one-dimensional problem in explosive welding that pertains to the collision of lead and steel plates. The metal plates and the surrounding air are represented as separate immiscible phases governed by independent equations of state. A multifluid Godunov-type (finite-volume) computational algorithm, based on the mechanical-equilibrium Euler equations and incorporating pressure relaxation, is used to numerically describe the evolution of the waves resulting from the collision. The position of the interface (contact discontinuity) between immiscible phases is tracked by means of the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method. The numerical model allows one to account for the existence of tensile stresses in metal and registers them as regions of negative pressure. The computed arrival time of the unloading wave at the interface between the plates agrees with the experimental data and with simulation results obtained via different methods.</description>

      <title>Understanding the influence of yttrium on the dominant twinning mode and local mechanical field evolution in extruded Mg-Y alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twinning is a primary deformation mechanism in Mg alloys. This study focuses on tension twins during uniaxial compression of Mg-Y alloys, with three key aspects: the orientation specificity of twin grains, the relative evolution of CRSS with increasing Y content, and the local stress and strain evolution at twin sites. Experimental characterization and crystal plasticity modeling were performed. In Mg-7wt.%Y, TT2-{112-1} tension twins were observed in addition to the common TT1-{101-2} twins. Increasing Y suppressed TT1 formation while promoting TT2 activity. A previously unreported group of crystallographic orientations with a higher global Schmid factor for &lt;c+a&gt; slip was identified, which exhibited TT1 twinning with increasing compression strain. To elucidate Y effects on twin activity and local mechanical fields, both TT1 and TT2 tension twin modes were incorporated into PRISMS-Plasticity, an open-source, finite element-based crystal plasticity solver. Four binary Mg-Y alloys were modeled under compression, and statistical analysis was conducted to correlate initial orientations, stress-strain distributions, and twin activities as functions of Y concentration. The plasticity analysis revealed that increasing Y decreases the CRSS ratio of prismatic and pyramidal slip relative to TT1 twinning, while the slip-to-twin CRSS ratio for TT2 increases, thereby serving as a potential indicator of differential twin activity with Y addition in Mg alloys. Additionally, despite their small volume fraction, TT2 twin sites were predicted higher local strain accumulation locally, relative to the representative volume element and TT1 twins, suggesting their potential influence on localized phenomena such as recrystallization or twin nucleation. These findings provide insight into local mechanical behavior in Mg alloys and support alloy design for advanced engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Optimizing p-spin models through hypergraph neural networks and deep reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: p-spin glasses, characterized by frustrated many-body interactions beyond the conventional pairwise case (p&gt;2), are prototypical disordered systems whose ground-state search is NP-hard and computationally prohibitive for large instances. Solving this problem is not only fundamental for understanding high-order disorder, structural glasses, and topological phases, but also central to a wide spectrum of hard combinatorial optimization tasks. Despite decades of progress, there still lacks an efficient and scalable solver for generic large-scale p-spin models. Here we introduce PLANCK, a physics-inspired deep reinforcement learning framework built on hypergraph neural networks. PLANCK directly optimizes arbitrary high-order interactions, and systematically exploits gauge symmetry throughout both training and inference. Trained exclusively on small synthetic instances, PLANCK exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to systems orders of magnitude larger, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art thermal annealing methods across all tested structural topologies and coupling distributions. Moreover, without any modification, PLANCK achieves near-optimal solutions for a broad class of NP-hard combinatorial problems, including random k-XORSAT, hypergraph max-cut, and conventional max-cut. The presented framework provides a physics-inspired algorithmic paradigm that bridges statistical mechanics and reinforcement learning. The symmetry-aware design not only advances the tractable frontiers of high-order disordered systems, but also opens a promising avenue for machine-learning-based solvers to tackle previously intractable combinatorial optimization challenges.</description>

Abstract: Accurate and efficient solutions of spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs), such as phase-field models, are fundamental for understanding interfacial dynamics and microstructural evolution in materials science and fluid mechanics. Neural operators (NOs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven alternatives to traditional solvers; however, existing architectures often accumulate temporal errors, struggle to generalize over long temporal horizons, and require large training datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose PENCO (Physics-Energy-Numerics-Consistent Operator), a hybrid operator-learning framework that integrates physical laws with data-driven neural operator methods, using either the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO-4D) or the Multi-Head Neural Operator (MHNO) architecture as the backbone. The formulation introduces an enhanced L^2 Gauss-Lobatto collocation residual around the temporal midpoint that robustly enforces the governing dynamics and significantly improves accuracy, a Fourier-space numerical consistency term that captures the balanced behavior of semi-implicit discretizations, and an energy-dissipation constraint that ensures thermodynamic consistency. Additional low-frequency spectral anchoring and teacher-consistency mechanisms further stabilize learning and suppress long-term error growth. This hybrid design enables PENCO to preserve governing physics while mitigating long-term error growth. Through extensive three-dimensional phase-field benchmarks on periodic cubic domains, covering phase ordering, crystallization, epitaxial growth, and complex pattern formation, PENCO demonstrates superior accuracy, stability, and data efficiency compared to state-of-the-art neural operators, including FNO-4D and MHNO, while maintaining physically consistent evolution.

Abstract: Hybrid light-matter states, known as molecular polaritons, arise from electronic or vibrational strong coupling (ESC and VSC) with confined electromagnetic fields. While these have been widely studied, the influence of electron-nuclear dynamics in driven cavities remains largely unknown. Here, we report a previously unrecognized mechanism of vibrational activation that emerges under collective ESC in driven optical cavities. Using simulations that self-consistently combine Maxwell's equations with quantum molecular dynamics, we show that collective electronic Rabi oscillations coherently drive nuclear motion. This effect is captured using both vibrational wave-packet dynamics in a minimal two-level model and atomistic simulations based on time-dependent density-functional tight-binding combined with Ehrenfest dynamics. Vibrational activation depends non-monotonically on the Rabi frequency and is maximized when the collective polaritonic splitting resonates with a molecular vibrational mode. The mechanism exhibits features consistent with a stimulated Raman-like relaxation mechanism. Our predictions are robust under realistic cavity conditions and provide the conditions in which they could be verified experimentally.</description>

      <title>Magnetizing altermagnets by ultrafast asymmetric spin dynamics</title>

Abstract: Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization: equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescales. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we show that linearly polarized laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization between otherwise identical sublattices in the $d$-wave compensated altermagnet (AM) RuO$_2$, resulting in a \textit{photo-induced ferrimagnetic state} with a strong net magnetization of $\sim$0.2 $\mu_B$ per unit cell. The sign and magnitude of this metastable magnetization are highly controllable by laser polarization. We identify polarization-selective asymmetric optical intersite spin transfer (a-OISTR) as the primary mechanism generating the net moment, followed by asymmetric spin flips (a-SF) that further amplifies it. Both effects originate from the characteristic nodal spin band topology of \textit{d}-wave AMs. Moreover, we demonstrate that this laser-induced magnetization is universal across various $d$-wave AMs, including experimentally confirmed KV$_2$Se$_2$O and RbV$_2$Te$_2$O. We uncover a robust route to light-controlled magnetization in AMs on ultrafast timescales.</description>
