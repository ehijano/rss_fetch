      <title>Parallel-plate chambers as radiation-hard detectors for time-based beam diagnostics in carbon-ion radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate range verification of carbon ion beams is critical for the precision and safety of charged particle radiotherapy. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using a parallel-plate ionization chamber for real-time, time-based diagnostic monitoring of carbon ion beams. The chamber featured a 0.4 mm gas gap defined by metallic electrodes and was filled with carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), a non-polymerizing gas suitable for high-rate applications. Timing precision was assessed via self-correlation analysis, yielding a precision approaching one picosecond for one-second acquisitions under clinically relevant beam conditions. This level of timing accuracy translates to a water-equivalent range uncertainty of approximately 1 mm, which meets the recommended clinical tolerance for carbon ion therapy. Furthermore, the kinetic energy of the beam at the synchrotron extraction point was determined from the measured orbital period, with results consistently within 1 MeV/nucleon of the nominal energy. These findings demonstrate the potential of parallel-plate chambers for precise, real-time energy and range verification in clinical carbon ion beam quality assurance.</description>

      <title>Novel multifunctional plasmonic fiber probe: Enabling plasmonic heating and SERS sensing for biomedical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical fiber-based platforms are increasingly explored as compact, minimally invasive tools for integrated photonic functionalities in biomedical applications. Among these, the combination of plasmonic heating and optical sensing on a single fiber tip offers compelling opportunities for localized photothermal actuation and in situ molecular detection. In this work, we present a multifunctional plasmonic fiber probe (PFP) that enables spectral multiplexing of thermo-plasmonic heating and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). This dual capability is achieved by integrating gold nanoislands (AuNIs) onto the flat facet of a multimode optical fiber using a solid-state dewetting process - a straightforward and scalable fabrication method that avoids the complexity of lithographic techniques. We characterize how the morphology of the AuNIs modulates optical extinction, photothermal response, and electromagnetic field enhancement across the visible and near-infrared spectrum. Specifically, we demonstrate efficient, wavelength-dependent heating under visible light and strong SERS signal enhancement under near-infrared excitation, both supported by electromagnetic and thermal simulations. The ability to decouple photothermal stimulation and Raman sensing in a single, fiber-integrated device addresses a current gap in lab-on-fiber technologies, where multifunctional operation is often constrained to a single wavelength.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Delivered Spill Structure of Medical Proton and Carbon-Ion Beams at MedAustron using a High Frequency Silicon Carbide Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical synchrotrons are often used for testing instrumentation in high-energy physics or non-clinical research in medical physics. In many applications of medical synchrotrons, such as microdosimetry and ion imaging, precise knowledge of the spill structure and instantaneous particle rate is crucial. Conventional ionization chambers, while omnipresent in clinical settings, suffer from limitations in charge resolution and integration time, making single-particle detection at high dose rates unfeasible. To address these limitations, we present a beam detection setup based on a silicon carbide (SiC) sensor and a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC), capable of detecting single particles with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) pulse duration of 500 ps. At the MedAustron ion therapy center, we characterized the spill structure of proton and carbon-ion beams delivered to the irradiation room beyond the timescale of the maximum ion revolution frequency in the synchrotron. The resulting data offer valuable insights into the beam intensity at small time scales and demonstrate the capabilities of SiC-based systems for high-flux beam monitoring.</description>

      <title>Magneto-radiative modelling and artificial neural network optimization of biofluid flow in a stenosed arterial domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of cardiovascular diseases and limitations in traditional healing methods mandate the invention of new drug delivery systems that assure targeted, effective, and regulated treatments, contributing directly to UN SDGs 3 and 9, thereby encouraging the utilization of sustainable medical technologies in healthcare. This study investigates the flow of a Casson-Maxwell nanofluid through a stenosed arterial domain. The quantities, such as skin friction and heat transfer rate, are analysed in detail. The Casson-Maxwell fluid shows a lower velocity profile than the Casson fluids, which indicates the improved residence time for efficient drug delivery. The heat transfer rate shows an increase with higher volume fractions of copper and aluminium oxide nanoparticles and a decrease with higher volume fractions of silver nanoparticles. The skin friction coefficient decreases by 219% with a unit increase in the Maxwell parameter, whereas it increases by 66.1% with a unit rise in the Casson parameter. This work supports SDGs 4 and 17 by fostering interdisciplinary learning and collaboration in fluid dynamics and healthcare innovation. Additionally, the rate of heat flow was forecasted (with an overall R-value of 0.99457) using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation training scheme under the influence of magneto-radiative, linear heat source and Casson-Maxwell parameters along with the tri-metallic nanoparticle volume fractions. It is also observed that the drag coefficient is most sensitive to the changes in the Maxwell parameter.</description>
