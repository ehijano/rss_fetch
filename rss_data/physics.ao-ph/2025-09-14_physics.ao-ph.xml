      <title>SvalMIZ-25 Svalbard Marginal Ice Zone Campaign 2025 -- Cruise Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling of weather, sea-ice, ocean, and wave forecasting systems has been a long-standing research focus to improve Arctic forecasting systems and their realism and is also a priority of international initiatives such as the WMO research project PCAPS. The goal of the Svalbard Marginal Ice Zone 2025 Campaign (SvalMIZ-25) was to observe and better understand the complex interplay between atmosphere, waves, and sea-ice in the winter Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) in order to advance predictive skill of coupled Arctic forecasting systems. The main objective has been to set up a network of observations with a spatial distribution that allows for a representative comparison between in situ observations and gridded model data. The observed variables include air and surface temperature, sea-ice drift, and wave energy spectra. With the support of the Norwegian Coast Guard, we participated in the research cruise with KV Svalbard from 22.April - 11.May 2025. In total 21 buoys were deployed in the Marginal Ice Zone north of the Svalbard Archipelago.</description>

      <title>Wintertime Cross-correlational Structures between Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly and Atmospheric-and-Oceanic Fields in the East/Japan Sea Under Arctic Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The winter Arctic Oscillation (AO) modulates East Asian climate and the East/Japan Sea (EJS), yet local, scale-dependent air-sea couplings linking atmosphere, ocean and sea-surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) remain unclear. Using 30 years of daily fields (1993--2022), we compute detrended fluctuation/cross-correlation metrics over 5--50-day scales at every grid: the Hurst exponent ($H$), the cross-Hurst exponent ($\lambda$), and the DCCA coefficient ($\rho_{DCCA}$). Significance is assessed with iterative-AAFT surrogates and Benjamini--Hochberg false-discovery-rate control. Three robust features emerge. (1) During AO+ winters, the EKB--SPF corridor exhibits high SSTA variance and near-ballistic persistence ($H \approx 1.4$--$1.5$), indicating increased susceptibility to marine heatwaves. (2) SSTA co-fluctuates positively with near-surface air-temperature anomalies, whereas turbulent heat-flux anomalies are largely anti-phased and show negligible cross-persistence, consistent with fast damping. (3) Oceanic fields impart persistent coupling: sea-surface height anomalies display basin-wide positive links with SSTA; meridional geostrophic velocity imprints advective cross-coupling along EKWC/SPF pathways, while zonal flow and vorticity yield patchy signatures. Winter SST variability in the EJS thus reflects a two-tier process in which mesoscale structure and along-front advection organize persistence, while synoptic forcing and turbulent heat exchange supply strong but non-persistent tendencies. The FDR-controlled, grid-point DFA/DCCA framework is transferable to other marginal seas.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Model of Lightning Stroke Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightning plays a crucial role in the Earth's climate system, yet existing parameterizations for use in forecasting and earth system models show room for improvement in capturing spatial and temporal variations in its frequency. This study develops deep learning-based parameterizations of lightning stroke density using meteorological variables from the ERA and IMERG datasets. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with U-Net architectures are trained using World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) data from 2010 to 2021 and evaluated on WWLLN lightning observations from 2022 and 2023. The CNNs reduce the average domain mean bias by an order of magnitude and produce significantly higher Fractions Skill Score (FSS) values across all lightning regimes compared to the multiplicative product of CAPE and precipitation. The CNNs show skill relative to previously published parameterizations over the oceans especially, with r2 values as high as 0.93 achieved between the best performing modeled and observed lightning stroke density climatologies. The CNNs are also able to accurately capture the 12-hourly evolution of lightning spatial patterns on an event-scale with high skill. These results show the potential for deep learning to improve on lightning parameterizations in weather and earth system models.</description>

      <title>Astroclimes -- measuring the abundance of CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ in the Earth's atmosphere using astronomical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring the abundance of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) and methane (CH$_4$) is necessary to quantify their impact on global warming and climate change. Although a number of satellites and ground-based networks measure the total column volume mixing ratio (VMR) of these gases, they rely on sunlight, and column measurements at night are comparatively scarce. We present a new algorithm, Astroclimes, that hopes to complement and extend nighttime CO$_2$ and CH4 column measurements. Astroclimes can measure the abundance of GHGs on Earth by generating a model telluric transmission spectra and fitting it to the spectra of telluric standard stars in the near-infrared taken by ground-based telescopes. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis on an extensive dataset from the CARMENES spectrograph showed that Astroclimes was able to recover the long term trend known to be present in the molecular abundances of both CO$_2$ and CH$_4$, but not their seasonal cycles. Using the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) global greenhouse gas reanalysis model (EGG4) as a benchmark, we identified an overall vertical shift in our data and quantified the long term scatter in our retrievals. The scatter on a 1 hour timescale, however, is much lower, and is on par with the uncertainties on individual measurements. Although currently the precision of the method is not in line with state of the art techniques using dedicated instrumentation, it shows promise for further development.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving High-Order Methods for the Compressible Euler Equations in Potential Temperature Formulation for Atmospheric Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop structure-preserving numerical methods for the compressible Euler equations, employing potential temperature as a prognostic variable.We construct three numerical fluxes designed to ensure the conservation of entropy and total energy within the discontinuous Galerkin framework on general curvilinear meshes.Furthermore, we introduce a generalization for the kinetic energy preservation property and total energy conservation in the presence of a gravitational potential term. To this end, we adopt a flux-differencing approach for the discretization of the source term, treated as non-conservative product. We present well-balanced schemes for different constant background states for both formulations (total energy and potential temperature) on curvilinear meshes. Finally, we validate the methods by comparing the potential temperature formulation with the traditional Euler equations formulation across a range of classical atmospheric scenarios.</description>
