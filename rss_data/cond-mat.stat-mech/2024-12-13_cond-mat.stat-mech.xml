      <title>Maximum power Stirling-like heat engine with a harmonically confined Brownian particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat engines transform thermal energy into useful work, operating in a cyclic manner. For centuries, they have played a key role in industrial and technological development. Historically, only gases and liquids have been used as working substances, but the technical advances achieved over the past decades allow for expanding the experimental possibilities and designing engines operating with a single particle. In this case, the system of interest cannot be addressed at a macroscopic level and their study is framed in the field of stochastic thermodynamics. In the present work, we study mesoscopic heat engines built with a Brownian particle submitted to harmonic confinement and immersed in a fluid acting as a thermal bath. We design a Stirling-like heat engine, composed of two isothermal and two isochoric branches, by controlling both the stiffness of the harmonic trap and the temperature of the bath. Specifically, we focus on the irreversible, non quasi-static, case -- whose finite duration enables the engine to deliver a non-zero output power. This is a crucial aspect, which enables the optimisation of the thermodynamic cycle by maximising the delivered power -- thereby addressing a key goal at the practical level. The optimal driving protocols are obtained by using both variational calculus and optimal control theory tools. Also, we numerically explore the dependence of the maximum output power and the corresponding efficiency on the system parameters.</description>

      <title>Universal finite-size scaling in high-dimensional critical phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new unified theory of critical finite-size scaling for lattice statistical mechanical models with periodic boundary conditions above the upper critical dimension. The universal finite-size scaling is inherited from the scaling of the system unwrapped to the infinite lattice. A Wilsonian renormalisation group analysis determines a universal profile for the susceptibility and two-point function plateau. Our theory is based on recent mathematically rigorous results for linear and branched polymers, multi-component spin systems, and percolation. Both short-range and long-range interactions are included. With free boundary conditions, the universal scaling applies at a pseudocritical point.</description>

      <title>Emergent facilitation by random constraints in a facilitated random walk model of glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of glass has been a significant topic of interest for decades. Dynamical facilitation is widely believed to be an important characteristic of glassy dynamics, but the precise mechanism is still under debate. We propose a lattice model of glass called the facilitated random walk (FRW). Each particle performs continuous time random walk in the presence of its own random local kinetic constraints. The particles do not interact energetically. Instead, they interact kinetically with a hopping rate resampling rule under which motions of a particle can randomly perturb the local kinetic constraints of other particles. This dynamic interaction is reversible, following a rate restoration rule. A step-by-step reversal of the particle motions exactly restore the previous constraints, modeling randomness quenched in the configuration space of glass. The model exhibits stretched exponential relaxation and dynamical heterogeneity typical of glasses. Despite the lack of explicit facilitation rule, the FRW shows facilitation behaviors closely analogous to those of the kinetically constrained models (KCM). The FRW is a coarse-grained version of the distinguishable particle lattice model (DPLM) and this exemplifies that compatible defect and atomistic models can complement each other on the study of glass.</description>

      <title>Cross-feeding percolation phase transitions of inter-cellular metabolic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intercellular exchange networks are essential for the adaptive capabilities of populations of cells. While diffusional exchanges have traditionally been difficult to map, recent advances in nanotechnology enable precise probing of exchange fluxes with the medium at single-cell resolution. Here we introduce a tiling-based method to reconstruct the dynamic unfolding of exchange networks from flux data, subsequently applying it to an experimental mammalian co-culture system where lactate exchanges affect the acidification of the environment. We observe that the network, which initially exhibits a dense matrix of exchanges, progressively breaks up into small disconnected clusters of cells. To explain this behaviour, we develop a two-parameter Maximum-Entropy multicellular metabolic model that incorporates diffusion-driven exchanges through a set of global constraints that couple cellular behaviors. The model predicts a transition from a densely interconnected network to a sparse, motif-dominated state as glucose and oxygen consumption levels shift. We characterize such a crossover both numerically, revealing a power-law decay in the cluster-size distribution at the critical transition, and analytically, by computing the critical line through a mean-field approximation based on percolation theory. By comparing empirical data with theoretical predictions, we find that populations evolve towards the sparse phase by remaining near the crossover point between these two regimes. These findings offer new insights into the collective organization driving the adaptive dynamics of cell populations.</description>

      <title>Exact joint distributions of three global characteristic times for Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider three global chracteristic times for a one-dimensional Brownian motion $x(\tau)$ in the interval $\tau\in [0,t]$: the occupation time $t_{\rm o}$ denoting the cumulative time where $x(\tau)&gt;0$, the time $t_{\rm m}$ at which the process achieves its global maximum in $[0,t]$ and the last-passage time $t_l$ through the origin before $t$. All three random variables have the same marginal distribution given by L\'evy's arcsine law. We compute exactly the pairwise joint distributions of these three times and show that they are quite different from each other. The joint distributions display rather rich and nontrivial correlations between these times. Our analytical results are verified by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A resetting particle embedded in a viscoelastic bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of a colloidal particle immersed in a viscoelastic bath undergoing stochastic resetting at a rate $r$. Microscopic probes suspended in viscoelastic environment do not follow the classical theory of Brownian motion. This is primarily because the memory from successive collisions between the medium particles and the probes does not necessarily decay instantly as opposed to the classical Langevin equation. To treat such a system one needs to incorporate the memory effects to the Langevin equation. The resulting equation formulated by Kubo, known as the Generalized Langevin equation (GLE), has been instrumental to describe the transport of particles in inhomogeneous or viscoelastic environments. The purpose of this work, henceforth, is to study the behavior of such a colloidal particle governed by the GLE under resetting dynamics. To this end, we extend the renewal formalism to compute the general expression for the position variance and the correlation function of the resetting particle driven by the environmental memory. These generic results are then illustrated for the prototypical example of the Jeffreys viscoelastic fluid model. In particular, we identify various timescales and intermittent plateaus in the transient phase before the system relaxes to the steady state; and further discuss the effect of resetting pertaining to these behaviors. Our results are supported by numerical simulations showing an excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Free-Energy Machine for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding optimal solutions to combinatorial optimization problems is pivotal in both scientific and technological domains, within academic research and industrial applications. A considerable amount of effort has been invested in the development of accelerated methods that leverage sophisticated models and harness the power of advanced computational hardware. Despite the advancements, a critical challenge persists, the dual demand for both high efficiency and broad generality in solving problems. In this work, we propose a general method, Free-Energy Machine (FEM), based on the ideas of free-energy minimization in statistical physics, combined with automatic differentiation and gradient-based optimization in machine learning. The algorithm is flexible, solving various combinatorial optimization problems using a unified framework, and is efficient, naturally utilizing massive parallel computational devices such as graph processing units (GPUs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). We benchmark our algorithm on various problems including the maximum cut problems, balanced minimum cut problems, and maximum $k$-satisfiability problems, scaled to millions of variables, across both synthetic, real-world, and competition problem instances. The findings indicate that our algorithm not only exhibits exceptional speed but also surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms tailored for individual problems. This highlights that the interdisciplinary fusion of statistical physics and machine learning opens the door to delivering cutting-edge methodologies that will have broad implications across various scientific and industrial landscapes.</description>

      <title>Splitting of nonequilibrium phase transitions in driven Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in various equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems, where phase transitions are typically marked by a single critical point that separates ordered and disordered regimes. We reveal a novel phenomenon in which the interplay between different temperatures and driving forces splits the order-disorder transition into two distinct transition points depending on which ordered state initially dominates. Crucially, these two emerging phases have distinct scaling behaviors and thermodynamic properties. To study this, we propose a minimal variant of the Ising model where spins are coupled to two thermal baths and subjected to two opposite driving forces associated to them. Our findings, robust both for all-to-all interactions (where exact solutions are possible) and nearest-neighbor couplings on a square lattice, uncover unique nonequilibrium behaviors and scaling laws for crucial thermodynamic quantities, such as efficiency, dissipation, power and its fluctuations, that are different between the two ordered phases. We also highlight that one of these emerging phases enables heat-engine operations that are less dissipative and show reduced fluctuations. In this setup, the system can also operate near maximum power and efficiency over a wide parameter range. Our results offer new insights into the relevance of phase transitions under nonequilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Network dismantling by physical damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the robustness of complex networks against physical damage. We focus on spatially embedded network models and datasets where links are physical objects or physically transfer some quantity, which can be disrupted at any point along its trajectory. To simulate physical damage, we tile the networks with boxes of equal size and sequentially damage them. By introducing an intersection graph to keep track of the links passing through tiles, we systematically analyze the connectivity of the network and explore how the physical layout and the topology of the network jointly affect its percolation threshold. We show that random layouts make networks extremely vulnerable to physical damage, driven by the presence of very elongated links, and that higher-dimensional embeddings further increase their vulnerability. We compare this picture against targeted physical damages, showing that it accelerates network dismantling and yields non-trivial geometric patterns. Finally, we apply our framework to several empirical networks, from airline networks to vascular systems and the brain, showing qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic ordering in mazelike stripe liquid of a dipolar six-state clock model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive numerical study of a six-state clock model with a long-range dipolar type interaction. This model is motivated by the ferroelectric orders in the multiferroic hexagonal manganites. At low temperatures, trimerization of local atomic structures leads to six distinct but energetically degenerate structural distortion, which can be modeled by a six-state clock model. Moreover, the atomic displacements in the trimerized state further produce a local electric polarization whose sign depends on whether the clock variable is even or odd. These induced electric dipoles, which can be modeled by emergent Ising degrees of freedom, interact with each other via long-range dipolar interactions. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to investigate low temperature phases resulting from the competing interactions. Upon lowering temperature, the system undergoes two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions, characteristic of the standard six-state clock model in two dimensions. The dipolar interaction between emergent Ising spins induces a first-order transition into a ground state characterized by a three-fold degenerate stripe order. The intermediate phase between the discontinuous and the second BKT transition corresponds to a maze-like hexagonal liquid with short-range stripe ordering. Moreover, this intermediate phase also exhibits an unusual ferromagnetic order with two adjacent clock variables occupying the two types of stripes of the labyrinthine pattern.</description>

      <title>Heat Transport in Ionic Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat transfer in liquids is a very challenging problem as it combines the competing effect of high frequency oscillations, which dominate liquid heat capacity, and diffusive motion, which enables transport macroscopic flow. This issue is compounded by the relatively junior state of dynamical theories of liquid thermodynamics. Nevertheless, molten salts are playing an increasingly important role in industrial and energy applications and there is a pressing need to understand the mechanisms behind their irreversible transport processes. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the heat transport of three different molten salts: LiCl, KCl, and the eutectic point of their mixture. While all simulations consider the properties of the liquid within the frame of its centre of mass, we calculate different susceptibilities which implicitly include and explicitly exclude the heat carried by partial mass currents within this frame. We find that, while the heat advected by partial mass currents in the mixture increases with increasing temperature, the heat transferred by collective vibrational motion (phonons) decreases with increasing temperature. This causes a maximum in the heat conductance with temperature in the mixtures only - in pure salts each contribution decreases monotonically with temperature. We attribute this anomaly to the extra freedom afforded to ionic motion in mixtures - in pure salts the motion of cations and anions is bound due to conservation of linear momentum. In mixtures, a coherent but diffusive collective motion is enabled by the release of Li ions from this condition by the introduction of a third species. We tentatively ascribe this coherent collective motion to the ``diffusive" phonons that have been used to explain a similar anomaly in the thermal conductivity of solids.</description>

      <title>Topology-driven deconfined quantum criticality in magnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets are believed to host phases of matter whose excitations are more fundamental than those of the ordered phases. When combining two such spin systems in a bilayer, strong interaction between the emergent excitations can produce phases not realized in either of its subsystems. We show that the critical fluctuations of a two-dimensional spin liquid state can induce a deconfined quantum critical point in a proximate antiferromagnet. The most relevant coupling between the associated effective field theories is given by a mixed Chern-Simons, or BF term of the emergent gauge fields in each layer. This describes a topological current-current interaction. In contrast to the local spin-spin interaction, it strongly modifies the renormalization group flow of the theory describing the N\'eel-VBS transition of the antiferromagnet. In particular, the protected coupling constant associated with it implies non-trivial quantum critical scaling characterized by a non-universal power-law divergence of the correlation length in the critical domain and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless divergence approaching it.</description>

      <title>Exact Valence-Bond Solid Scars in the Square-Lattice Heisenberg Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the spin-s square-lattice Heisenberg model has exact many-body scars. These scars are simple valence-bond solids with exactly zero energy, and they exist in even-by-even systems and ladders of width 2. Ladders have additional scars corresponding to injecting one or two magnons on top of a parent valence-bond solid scar. These scars have a remarkably simple physical origin based only the angular momentum algebra and cancellations from spin-antialignment within a valence bond. Our comprehensive exact diagonalization calculations suggest that our valence-bond solids exhaust all exact eigenstates in the Heisenberg model except for few-magnon states near the top of the spectrum. Our scars are interesting because they are not part of a tower, have area-law entanglement, break translation symmetry, and exist for Heisenberg models of all spin.</description>

Abstract: We extend the ``complexity=volume" (CV) conjecture in the wormhole to the quantum states in the framework of information geometry. In particular, we conjecture that Krylov complexity equals the volume of the Fubini-Study metric in the information geometry. In order to test our conjecture, we study the general Hermitian two-mode Hamiltonian according to the Weyl algebra both in the closed and open systems. By employing the displacement operator, we find that the wave function for a closed system corresponds to the well-known two-mode squeezed state. For an open system, we can create a wave function known as the open two-mode squeezed state by using the second kind of Meixner polynomials. Remarkably, in both cases, the resulting volume of the corresponding Fubini-Study metric provides strong evidence for the validity of the generalized CV conjecture.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Construction of Hyperuniform, Nonhyperuniform and Antihyperuniform Random Media via Spectral Density Functions and Their Transport Properties</title>

Abstract: Rigorous theories connecting physical properties of a heterogeneous material to its microstructure offer a promising avenue to guide the computational material design and optimization. We present here an efficient Fourier-space based computational framework and employ a variety of analytical ${\tilde \chi}_{_V}({k})$ functions that satisfy all known necessary conditions to construct 3D disordered stealthy hyperuniform, standard hyperuniform, nonhyperuniform, and antihyperuniform two-phase heterogeneous material systems at varying phase volume fractions. We show that a rich spectrum of distinct structures within each of the above classes of materials can be generated by tuning correlations in the system across length scales. We present the first realization of antihyperuniform two-phase heterogeneous materials in 3D, which are characterized by a power-law autocovariance function $\chi_{_V}(r)$ and contain clusters of dramatically different sizes and morphologies. We also determine the diffusion spreadability ${\cal S}(t)$ and estimate the fluid permeability $k$ associated with all of the constructed materials directly from the corresponding ${\tilde \chi}_{_V}({k})$ functions. We find that varying the length-scale parameter within each class of ${\tilde \chi}_{_V}({k})$ functions can also lead to orders of magnitude variation of ${\cal S}(t)$ at intermediate and long time scales. Moreover, we find that increasing solid volume fraction $\phi_1$ and correlation length $a$ in the constructed media generally leads to a decrease in the dimensionless fluid permeability $k/a^2$. These results indicate the feasibility of employing parameterized ${\tilde \chi}_{_V}({k})$ for designing composites with targeted transport properties.</description>

      <title>Topological data analysis of the deconfinement transition in SU(3) lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the confining and deconfining phases of pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory with topological data analysis. This provides unique insights into long range correlations of field configurations across the confinement-deconfinement transition. Specifically, we analyze non-trivial structures in electric and magnetic field energy densities as well as Polyakov loop traces and a Polyakov loop-based variant of the topological density. The Betti curves for filtrations based on the electric and magnetic field energy densities reveal signals of electromagnetic dualities. These dualities can be associated with an interchange in the roles of local lumps of electric and magnetic energy densities around the phase transition. Moreover, we show that plaquette susceptibilities can manifest in the geometric features captured by the Betti curves. We also confront the results obtained for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ with that for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and elaborate on the significant differences. Our results demonstrate that topological data analysis can discriminate phase transitions of different order for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. Moreover, it provides unprecedented insights into the relevant structures in their vicinity.</description>

      <title>Towards kinetic equations of open systems of active soft matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chapter presents some new approaches to describing the collective behavior of complex systems of mathematical biology based on the evolution equations of observables such as open systems. This representation of kinetic evolution has looked to be the most direct and mathematically fully consistent formulation modeling the collective behavior of biological systems since the traditionally used concept of the state in kinetic theory is more subtle and is an implicit characteristic of the populations of living creatures. One of the advantages of the developed approach is the opportunity to construct kinetic equations for open complex systems in scaling approximations, involving initial correlations, in particular, that can characterize the condensed states of active soft matter. An approach is also related to the challenge of a rigorous derivation of the non-Markovian kinetic equations from underlying many-entity dynamics, which makes it possible to describe the memory effects of the collective behavior of living creatures.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Quantization and Minkowskian Statistical Mechanics: simulations on a 1+1 lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce symplectic quantization, a novel functional approach to quantum field theory which allows to sample quantum fields fluctuations directly in Minkowski space-time, at variance with the traditional importance sampling protocols, well defined only for Euclidean Field Theory. This importance sampling procedure is realized by means of a deterministic dynamics generated by Hamilton-like equations evolving with respect to an auxiliary time parameter $\tau$. In this framework, expectation values over quantum fluctuations are computed as dynamical averages along the trajectories parameterized by $\tau$. Assuming ergodicity, this is equivalent to sample a microcanonical partition function. Then, by means of a large-M calculation, where M is the number of degrees of freedom on the lattice, we show that the microcanonical correlation functions are equivalent to those generated by a Minkowskian canonical theory where quantum fields fluctuations are weighted by the factor $\exp(S/\hbar )$, with $S$ being the original relativistic action of the system.</description>

      <title>Testing the RG-flow $M(3,10)+\phi_{1,7}\to M(3,8)$ with Hamiltonian Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) methods provide a powerful numerical approach for investigating strongly coupled QFTs. In this work, we develop HT techniques to analyse a specific Renormalization Group (RG) flow recently proposed in Refs. [1, 3]. These studies put forward Ginzburg-Landau descriptions for the conformal minimal models $M(3,10)$ and $M(3,8)$, as well as the RG flow connecting them. Specifically, the RG-flow is defined by deforming the $M(3,10)$ with the relevant primary operator $\phi_{1,7}$ (whose indices denote its position in the Kac table), yielding $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$. From the perspective of HT, realising such an RG-flow presents significant challenges, as the $\phi_{1,7}$ deformation requires renormalizing the UV theory up to third order in the coupling constant of the deformation. In this study, we carry out the necessary calculations to formulate HT for this theory and numerically investigate the spectrum of $M(3,10)+ \phi_{1,7}$ in the large coupling regime, finding strong evidence in favour of the proposed flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the study of the interplay between scaling symmetries and statistics to one-dimensional fluids by studying the Calogero model in a harmonic trap modulated through time. The latter harbors an interpretation in terms of free particles imbued with exclusion statistics and is an example of a scale invariant fluid in 1D displaying $SO(2,1)$ hidden symmetry preserved by harmonic traps. Taking advantage of the dynamical symmetry, two experimentally-relevant drive protocols spanning both quasi-static and non-adiabatic regimes are investigated and universal signatures of the interactions and exclusion statistics are uncovered in the ground state echo amplitude and closely related ground state fidelity. In particular, under both periodic modulation and slow drive through the gapless point of the trap frequency, enhanced interactions and exclusion are shown to favor the proliferation of defects and to hinder their annihilation, which leads to a universal decrease of ground state fidelities and echo amplitudes. We also show that increasing exclusion sparks a sharp suppression of the likelihood of intermediate echoes beyond those imposed by the commensurability of a periodic drive and the natural frequency of the trap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for Floquet prethermalization under strong resonant driving, emphasizing the pivotal role of dynamical space-time symmetries. Our approach demonstrates how dynamical space-time symmetries map onto the projective static symmetry group of the prethermal Hamiltonian governing the prethermal regime. We introduce techniques for detecting dynamical symmetries through the time evolution of local observables, facilitating a detailed analysis of micromotion within each period and surpassing the limitations of conventional stroboscopic Floquet prethermal dynamics. To implement this framework, we present a prethermal protocol that preserves order-two dynamical symmetry in a spin-ladder model, confirming the predicted relationships between the expectation values of local observables at distinct temporal points in the Floquet cycle, linked by this symmetry.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Dynamical Phase Transition as a Complex Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum dynamical phase transition induced by the competition between local unitary evolution and dissipation in a qubit chain with a strong, on-site $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. While the steady-state of this evolution is always maximally-mixed, we show that the dynamical behavior of certain non-local observables on the approach to this steady-state is dictated by a quantum Ising model with a $\textit{complex}$ transverse-field (cTFIM). We investigate these observables analytically, uncovering a dynamical phase transition as the relative rate of unitary evolution and dissipation is tuned. We show that the weak-dissipation limit corresponds to a cTFIM with a large magnitude of the imaginary transverse-field, for which the many-body "ground-state" (with smallest real eigenvalue) is gapless, exhibiting quasi-long-range correlations of the local magnetization with a continuously-varying exponent. Correspondingly, the dynamics of the non-local observables show oscillatory behavior with an amplitude decaying exponentially in time. The strong-dissipation limit corresponds to a gapped ferromagnetic phase of the cTFIM, and non-local observables show exponential decay on the approach to equilibrium. This transition in (1+1)-dimensions has a peculiar, "two-sided" nature appearing as either first- or second-order depending on the phase from which the transition is approached, an analytic result which is corroborated by numerical studies. In higher dimensions, we present a field-theoretic understanding of the first-order nature of this transition, when approaching from the ferromagnetic phase of the cTFIM, though the nature of the phase with large imaginary transverse-field remains to be understood.</description>

      <title>Bottlenecks in quantum channels and finite temperature phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an analogue of the "bottleneck theorem", well-known for classical Markov chains, for Markovian quantum channels. In particular, we show that if two regions (subspaces) of Hilbert space are separated by a region that has very low weight in the channel's steady state, then states initialized on one side of this barrier will take a long time to relax, putting a lower bound on the mixing time in terms of an appropriately defined "quantum bottleneck ratio". Importantly, this bottleneck ratio involves not only the probabilities of the relevant subspaces, but also the size of off-diagonal matrix elements between them. For low-temperature quantum many-body systems, we use the bottleneck theorem to bound the performance of any quasi-local Gibbs sampler. This leads to a new perspective on thermally stable quantum phases in terms of a decomposition of the Gibbs state into multiple components separated by bottlenecks. As a concrete application, we show rigorously that weakly perturbed commuting projector models with extensive energy barriers (including certain classical and quantum expander codes) have exponentially large mixing times.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric simple exclusion process on the percolation cluster: Waiting time distribution in side-branches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the simplest model of transport of interacting particles in a disordered medium, we consider the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) in which particles with hard-core interactions perform biased random walks, on the supercritical percolation cluster. In this process, the long time trajectory of a marked particle consists of steps on the backbone, punctuated by time spent in side-branches. We study the probability distribution in the steady state of the waiting time $T_w$ of a randomly chosen particle, in a side-branch since its last step along the backbone. Exact numerical evaluation of this on a single side-branch of length $L=$ $1$ to $9$ shows that for large fields, the probability distribution of $\log T_w $ has multiple well separated peaks. We extend this result to a regular comb, and to the ASEP on the percolation cluster. We show that in the steady state, the fractional number of particles that have been in the same side-branch for a time interval greater than $T_w$ varies as $exp( - c \sqrt{\log T_w})$ for large $T_w$, where $c$ depends only on the bias field. However, these long timescales are not reflected in the eigenvalue spectrum of the Markov evolution matrix. The system shows dynamical heterogeneity, with particles segregating into pockets of high and low mobilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear growth of entanglement after a quench from a state with short-range correlations is a universal feature of many body dynamics. It has been shown to occur in integrable and chaotic systems undergoing either Hamiltonian, Floquet or circuit dynamics and has also been observed in experiments. The entanglement dynamics emerging from long-range correlated states is far less studied, although no less viable using modern quantum simulation experiments. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the bipartite entanglement entropy and mutual information from initial states which have long-range entanglement with correlation between antipodal points of a finite and periodic system. Starting from these crosscap states, we study both brickwork quantum circuits and Hamiltonian dynamics and find distinct patterns of behaviour depending on the type of dynamics and whether the system is integrable or chaotic. Specifically, we study both dual unitary and random unitary quantum circuits as well as free and interacting fermion Hamiltonians. For integrable systems, we find that after a time delay the entanglement experiences a linear in time decrease followed by a series of revivals, while, in contrast, chaotic systems exhibit constant entanglement entropy. On the other hand, both types of systems experience an immediate linear decrease of the mutual information in time. In chaotic systems this then vanishes, whereas integrable systems instead experience a series of revivals. We show how the quasiparticle and membrane pictures of entanglement dynamics can be modified to describe this behaviour, and derive explicitly the quasiparticle picture in the case of free fermion models which we then extend to all integrable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Path integral approaches have been used for boson and fermion systems. The path integral approach has been successful in the many-boson system. However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem. In this letter, I introduce additive particle (AP) theory in order to generate an approximation method that avoids the sign problem. The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1606.00525v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study last passage percolation in a half-quadrant, which we analyze within the framework of Pfaffian Schur processes. For the model with exponential weights, we prove that the fluctuations of the last passage time to a point on the diagonal are either GSE Tracy-Widom distributed, GOE Tracy-Widom distributed, or Gaussian, depending on the size of weights along the diagonal. Away from the diagonal, the fluctuations of passage times follow the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution. We also obtain a two-dimensional crossover between the GUE, GOE and GSE distribution by studying the multipoint distribution of last passage times close to the diagonal when the size of the diagonal weights is simultaneously scaled close to the critical point. We expect that this crossover arises universally in KPZ growth models in half-space. Along the way, we introduce a method to deal with diverging correlation kernels of point processes where points collide in the scaling limit.</description>

Abstract: We study the Facilitated TASEP, an interacting particle system on the one dimensional integer lattice. We prove that starting from step initial condition, the position of the rightmost particle has Tracy Widom GSE statistics on a cube root time scale, while the statistics in the bulk of the rarefaction fan are GUE. This uses a mapping with last-passage percolation in a half-quadrant which is exactly solvable through Pfaffian Schur processes.
  Our results further probe the question of how first particles fluctuate for exclusion processes with downward jump discontinuities in their limiting density profiles. Through the Facilitated TASEP and a previously studied MADM exclusion process we deduce that cube-root time fluctuations seem to be a common feature of such systems. However, the statistics which arise are shown to be model dependent (here they are GSE, whereas for the MADM exclusion process they are GUE).
  We also discuss a two-dimensional crossover between GUE, GOE and GSE distribution by studying the multipoint distribution of the first particles when the rate of the first one varies. In terms of half-space last passage percolation, this corresponds to last passage times close to the boundary when the size of the boundary weights is simultaneously scaled close to the critical point.</description>

Abstract: The onset and growth of rigid clusters in a two-dimensional (2D) suspension in shear flow are studied by numerical simulations. The suspension exhibits the lubricated-to-frictional rheology transition, but the key results here are for stresses above the levels that cause extreme shear-thickening. At large solid fraction, $\phi$, but below the stress-dependent jamming fraction, we find a critical $\phi_{c}\left(\sigma,\mu\right)$ where $\sigma$ is a dimensionless shear stress and $\mu$ is the interparticle friction coefficient. For $\phi&gt;\phi_c$, the proportion of particles in rigid clusters grows sharply, as $f_{\rm rig} \sim \left\vert\phi-\phi_{c}\right\vert^{\beta}$ with $\beta=1/8$, as do the fluctuations in the fraction of rigid particles, with a susceptibility measure $\chi_{\rm rig} \sim \left\vert\phi-\phi_{c}\right\vert^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma = 7/4$. The system is thus found to exhibit criticality. The results are shown to depend on an effective field $h\left(\mu\right)$, which provides data collapse near $\phi_c$ for both $f_{\rm rig}$ and $\chi_{\rm rig}$. This behavior occurs over a range of stresses, with $\phi_c\left(\sigma,\mu\right)$ increasing as the stress decreases.</description>

      <title>Slow measurement-only dynamics of entanglement in Pauli subsystem codes</title>

Abstract: We study the non-unitary dynamics of a class of quantum circuits based on stochastically measuring check operators of subsystem quantum error-correcting codes, such as the Bacon-Shor code and its various generalizations. Our focus is on how properties of the underlying code are imprinted onto the measurement-only dynamics. We find that in a large class of codes with nonlocal stabilizer generators, at late times there is generically a nonlocal contribution to the subsystem entanglement entropy which scales with the subsystem size. The nonlocal stabilizer generators can also induce slow dynamics, since depending on the rate of competing measurements the associated degrees of freedom can take exponentially long (in system size) to purify (disentangle from the environment when starting from a mixed state) and to scramble (become entangled with the rest of the system when starting from a product state). Concretely, we consider circuits for which the nonlocal stabilizer generators of the underlying subsystem code take the form of subsystem symmetries. We present a systematic study of the phase diagrams and relevant time scales in two and three spatial dimensions for both Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) and non-CSS codes, focusing in particular on the link between slow measurement-only dynamics and the geometry of the subsystem symmetry. A key finding of our work is that slowly purifying or scrambling degrees of freedom appear to emerge only in codes whose subsystem symmetries are nonlocally {\it generated}, a strict subset of those whose symmetries are simply nonlocal. We comment on the link between our results on subsystem codes and the phenomenon of Hilbert-space fragmentation in light of their shared algebraic structure.</description>

      <title>Data-driven theory reveals protrusion and polarity interactions governing collision behavior of distinct motile cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The migration behavior of colliding cells is critically determined by transient contact-interactions. During these interactions, the motility machinery, including the front-rear polarization of the cell, dynamically responds to surface protein-mediated transmission of forces and biochemical signals between cells. While biomolecular details of such contact-interactions are increasingly well understood, it remains unclear what biophysical interaction mechanisms govern the cell-level dynamics of colliding cells and how these mechanisms vary across cell types. Here, we develop a phenomenological theory based on 14 candidate contact-interaction mechanisms coupling cell position, protrusion, and polarity. Using high-throughput micropattern experiments, we detect which of these phenomenological contact-interactions captures the interaction behaviors of cells. We find that various cell types - ranging from mesenchymal to epithelial cells - are accurately captured by a single model with only two interaction mechanisms: polarity-protrusion coupling and polarity-polarity coupling. The qualitatively different interaction behaviors of distinct cells, as well as cells subject to molecular perturbations of surface protein-mediated signaling, can all be quantitatively captured by varying the strength and sign of the polarity-polarity coupling mechanism. Altogether, our data-driven phenomenological theory of cell-cell interactions reveals polarity-polarity coupling as a versatile and general contact-interaction mechanism, which may underlie diverse collective migration behavior of motile cells.</description>
