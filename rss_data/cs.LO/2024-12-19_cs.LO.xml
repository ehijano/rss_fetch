      <title>Localized RETE for Incremental Graph Queries with Nested Graph Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing size of graph-based modeling artifacts in model-driven engineering calls for techniques that enable efficient execution of graph queries. Incremental approaches based on the RETE algorithm provide an adequate solution in many scenarios, but are generally designed to search for query results over the entire graph. However, in certain situations, a user may only be interested in query results for a subgraph, for instance when a developer is working on a large model of which only a part is loaded into their workspace. In this case, the global execution semantics can result in significant computational overhead.
  To mitigate the outlined shortcoming, in this article we propose an extension of the RETE approach that enables local, yet fully incremental execution of graph queries, while still guaranteeing completeness of results with respect to the relevant subgraph.
  We empirically evaluate the presented approach via experiments inspired by a scenario from software development and with queries and data from an independent social network benchmark. The experimental results indicate that the proposed technique can significantly improve performance regarding memory consumption and execution time in favorable cases, but may incur a noticeable overhead in unfavorable cases.</description>

      <title>Implicit Rankings for Verifying Liveness Properties in First-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liveness properties are traditionally proven using a ranking function that maps system states to some well-founded set. Carrying out such proofs in first-order logic enables automation by SMT solvers. However, reasoning about many natural ranking functions is beyond reach of existing solvers. To address this, we introduce the notion of implicit rankings - first-order formulas that soundly approximate the reduction of some ranking function without defining it explicitly. We provide recursive constructors of implicit rankings that can be instantiated and composed to induce a rich family of implicit rankings. Our constructors use quantifiers to approximate reasoning about useful primitives such as cardinalities of sets and unbounded sums that are not directly expressible in first-order logic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our implicit rankings by verifying liveness properties of several intricate examples, including Dijkstra's k-state, 4-state and 3-state self-stabilizing protocols.</description>

      <title>A Type-Theoretic Definition of Lax $(\infty,\infty)$-Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a purely syntactic notion of lax cones and $(\infty,\infty)$-limits on finite computads in \texttt{CaTT}, a type theory for $(\infty,\infty)$-categories due to Finster and Mimram. Conveniently, finite computads are precisely the contexts in \texttt{CaTT}. We define a cone over a context to be a context, which is obtained by induction over the list of variables of the underlying context. In the case where the underlying context is globular we give an explicit description of the cone and conjecture that an analogous description continues to hold also for general contexts. We use the cone to control the types of the term constructors for the universal cone. The implementation of the universal property follows a similar line of ideas. Starting with a cone as a context, a set of context extension rules produce a context with the shape of a transfor between cones, i.e.~a higher morphism between cones. As in the case of cones, we use this context as a template to control the types of the term constructor required for universal property.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Notion of Conditional Independence, and Its Application to Knowledge Representation (full version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional independence is a crucial concept supporting adequate modelling and efficient reasoning in probabilistics. In knowledge representation, the idea of conditional independence has also been introduced for specific formalisms, such as propositional logic and belief revision. In this paper, the notion of conditional independence is studied in the algebraic framework of approximation fixpoint theory. This gives a language-independent account of conditional independence that can be straightforwardly applied to any logic with fixpoint semantics. It is shown how this notion allows to reduce global reasoning to parallel instances of local reasoning, leading to fixed-parameter tractability results. Furthermore, relations to existing notions of conditional independence are discussed and the framework is applied to normal logic programming.</description>

      <title>DODGE: Ontology-Aware Risk Assessment via Object-Oriented Disruption Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When considering risky events or actions, we must not downplay the role of involved objects: a charged battery in our phone averts the risk of being stranded in the desert after a flat tyre, and a functional firewall mitigates the risk of a hacker intruding the network. The Common Ontology of Value and Risk (COVER) highlights how the role of objects and their relationships remains pivotal to performing transparent, complete and accountable risk assessment. In this paper, we operationalize some of the notions proposed by COVER -- such as parthood between objects and participation of objects in events/actions -- by presenting a new framework for risk assessment: DODGE. DODGE enriches the expressivity of vetted formal models for risk -- i.e., fault trees and attack trees -- by bridging the disciplines of ontology and formal methods into an ontology-aware formal framework composed by a more expressive modelling formalism, Object-Oriented Disruption Graphs (ODGs), logic (ODGLog) and an intermediate query language (ODGLang). With these, DODGE allows risk assessors to pose questions about disruption propagation, disruption likelihood and risk levels, keeping the fundamental role of objects at risk always in sight.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of finite non-deterministic logical matrices is undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of a non-deterministic logical matrix (where connectives are interpreted as multi-functions) extends the traditional semantics for propositional logics based on logical matrices (where connectives are interpreted as functions). This extension allows for finitely characterizing a much wider class of logics, and has proven decisive in a myriad of recent compositionality results. In this paper we show that the added expressivity brought by non-determinism also has its drawbacks, and in particular that the problem of determining whether two given finite non-deterministic matrices are equivalent, in the sense that they induce the same logic, becomes undecidable. We also discuss some workable sufficient conditions and particular cases, namely regarding rexpansion homomorphisms and bridges to calculi.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a reframing of Godel's first and second incompleteness theorems that applies even to some undefinable theories of arithmetic. The usual Hilbert-Bernays provability conditions and the diagonal lemma are replaced by a more direct diagonalization argument, from first principles, based in category theory and in a sense analogous to Cantor's original argument. To this end, we categorify the theory G\"odel encodings, which might be of independent interest. In our setup, the G\"odel sentence is computable explicitly by construction even for $\Sigma ^{0} _{2}$ theories (likely extending to $\Sigma ^{0} _{n}$). In an appendix, we study the relationship of our reframed second incompleteness theorem with arguments of Penrose.</description>

      <title>Double Glueing over Free Exponential: with Measure Theoretic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.07726v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a compact method to lift the free exponential construction of Mellies-Tabareau-Tasson over the Hyland-Schalk double glueing for orthogonality categories. A condition ``reciprocity of orthogonality'' is presented simply enough to lift the free exponential over the double glueing in terms of the orthogonality. Our general method applies to the monoidal category TsK of the s-finite transition kernels with countable biproducts. We show (i) TsK^op has the free exponential, which is shown to be describable in terms of measure theory. (ii) The s-finite transition kernels have an orthogonality between measures and measurable functions in terms of Lebesgue integrals. The orthogonality is reciprocal, hence the free exponential of (i) lifts to the orthogonality category O_I(TsK^op), which subsumes Ehrhard et al's probabilistic coherent spaces as a full subcategory of countable measurable spaces. To lift the free exponential, the measure-theoretic uniform convergence theorem commuting Lebesgue integral and limit plays a crucial role as well as Fubini-Tonelli theorem for double integral in s-finiteness. Our measure-theoretic orthogonality is considered as a continuous version of the orthogonality of the probabilistic coherent spaces for linear logic, and in particular provides a two layered decomposition of Crubille et al's direct free exponential for these spaces.</description>

      <title>A Monoidal View on Fixpoint Checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fixpoints are ubiquitous in computer science as they play a central role in providing a meaning to recursive and cyclic definitions. Bisimilarity, behavioural metrics, termination probabilities for Markov chains and stochastic games are defined in terms of least or greatest fixpoints. Here we show that our recent work which proposes a technique for checking whether the fixpoint of a function is the least (or the largest) admits a natural categorical interpretation in terms of gs-monoidal categories. The technique is based on a construction that maps a function to a suitable approximation. We study the compositionality properties of this mapping and show that under some restrictions it can naturally be interpreted as a (lax) gs-monoidal functor. This guides the development of a tool, called UDEfix that allows us to build functions (and their approximations) like a circuit out of basic building blocks and subsequently perform the fixpoints checks. We also show that a slight generalisation of the theory allows one to treat a new relevant case study: coalgebraic behavioural metrics based on Wasserstein liftings.</description>

      <title>An automata-based approach for synchronizable mailbox communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06968v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit finite-state communicating systems with round-based communication under mailbox semantics. Mailboxes correspond to one FIFO buffer per process (instead of one buffer per pair of processes in peer-to-peer systems). Round-based communication corresponds to sequences of rounds in which processes can first send messages, then only receive (and receives must be in the same round as their sends). A system is called synchronizable if every execution can be re-scheduled into an equivalent execution that is a sequence of rounds. Previous work mostly considered the setting where rounds have fixed size. Our main contribution shows that the problem whether a mailbox communication system complies with the round-based policy, with no size limitation on rounds, is Pspace-complete. For this we use a novel automata-based approach, that also allows to determine the precise complexity (Pspace) of several questions considered in previous literature.</description>

      <title>Incompleteness for stably computable formal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove, for stably computably enumerable formal systems, direct analogues of the first and second incompleteness theorems of G\"odel. A typical stably computably enumerable set is the set of Diophantine equations with no integer solutions, and in particular such sets are generally not computably enumerable. And so this gives the first extension of the second incompleteness theorem to non classically computable formal systems. Let's motivate this with a somewhat physical application. Let $\mathcal{H} $ be the suitable infinite time limit (stabilization in the sense of the paper) of the mathematical output of humanity, specializing to first order sentences in the language of arithmetic (for simplicity), and understood as a formal system. Suppose that all the relevant physical processes in the formation of $\mathcal{H} $ are Turing computable. Then as defined $\mathcal{H} $ may \emph{not} be computably enumerable, but it is stably computably enumerable. Thus, the classical G\"odel disjunction applied to $\mathcal{H} $ is meaningless, but applying our incompleteness theorems to $\mathcal{H} $ we then get a sharper version of G\"odel's disjunction: assume $\mathcal{H} \vdash PA$ then either $\mathcal{H} $ is not stably computably enumerable or $\mathcal{H} $ is not 1-consistent (in particular is not sound) or $\mathcal{H} $ cannot prove a certain true statement of arithmetic (and cannot disprove it if in addition $\mathcal{H} $ is 2-consistent).</description>

Abstract: We extend the typical forcing of M. M\"uller and derive conditions on the forcing frame for which generic expansions preserve injective/bijective pigeonhole principle for polynomial-time computable graphs of functions. Applying this machinery, we show that the bounded arithmetic theory $\forall \textsf{T}^1_2(\textsf{PV}(\alpha))$ augmented by the polynomial-time injective pigeonhole principle does not prove the linear ordering, tournament, and dual weak pigeonhole principles.</description>
