      <title>Kinetic structure of strong-field QED showers in crossed electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete, kinetic description of electron-seeded strong-field QED showers in crossed electromagnetic fields is derived. The kinetic structure of the shower and its temporal evolution are shown to be a function of two parameters: the initial shower quantum parameter and radiation time. The latter determines the short and long time evolution of the shower. Explicit solutions for the shower multiplicity (number of pairs per seed electron) and the emitted photon spectrum are obtained for both timescales. Our approach is first derived considering showers in a constant, homogeneous magnetic field. We find that our results are valid for any crossed fields and we apply them to laboratory settings for which we obtain fully analytical, predictive scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Inverse See-Saw Mechanism with $\mathbf{S}_{3}$ flavor symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current neutrino experiments provide an opportunity for testing the inverse see-saw mechanism through charged lepton flavor violating processes and neutrinoless double beta decay. Motivated by this, in this paper we study the $\mathbf{S}_{3}\otimes \mathbf{Z}_{2}$ discrete symmetry in the $B-L$ gauge model where the active light neutrino mass matrix comes from the aforementioned mechanism. In this framework, the effect of complex vacuum expectation values of the Higgs doublets on the fermion masses is explored and, under certain assumptions on the Yukawa couplings, we find that the neutrino mixing is controlled by the Cobimaximal pattern, but a sizeable deviation from the charged lepton sector breaks the well known predictions on the atmospheric angle ($45^{\circ}$) and the Dirac CP-violating phase ($-90^{\circ}$). In addition, due to the presence of heavy neutrinos at the $TeV$ scale, charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) and neutrinoless double beta decay get notable contributions. Analytical formulae for these observables are obtained, and then a numerical calculation allows to fit quite well the lepton mixing for the normal and inverted hierarchies, however, the branching ratios decay values for CLFV disfavors the latter one. Along with this, the region of parameter space for the $m_{ee}$ effective neutrino mass lies below the GERDA bounds for both the normal and inverted hierarchies. On the other hand, with a particular benchmark, the quark mass matrices are found to have textures that allow to fit with great accuracy the CKM mixing matrix.</description>

      <title>Daily modulation of low-energy nuclear recoils from sub-GeV dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At sufficiently low nuclear recoil energy, the scattering of dark matter (DM) in crystals gives rise to single phonon and multiphonon excitations. In anisotropic crystals, the scattering rate into phonons modulates over each sidereal day as the crystal rotates with respect to the DM wind. This gives a potential avenue for directional detection of DM. The daily modulation for single phonons has previously been calculated. Here we calculate the daily modulation for multiphonon excitations from DM in the mass range 1 MeV-1 GeV. We generalize previous multiphonon calculations, which made an isotropic approximation, and implement results in the DarkELF package. We find daily modulation rates up to 1-10 percent for an Al$_2$O$_3$ target and DM mass below 30 MeV, depending on the recoil energies probed. We obtain similar results for SiC, while modulation in Si, GaAs and SiO$_2$ is negligible.</description>

      <title>A Cosmological Solution to the Doublet-Triplet Splitting Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model that provides a simultaneous solution to the doublet-triplet splitting problem of grand unified theories, the electroweak hierarchy problem and the strong CP problem. The mechanism is based on the dynamics of two axion-like particles that would crunch the universe at the time of the QCD phase transition if triplets were light or had a VEV or if doublets were heavy or did not have a VEV. The only trace left at low energies are these two axion-like particles. They are weakly coupled to the Standard Model and could be detected at upcoming axion experiments or by a combination of neutron EDM measurements and the astrophysical detection of fuzzy dark matter.</description>

      <title>Hunting New Animalcula with Rare K and B Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize the recent strategy for an efficient hunting of new animalcula with the help of rare K and B decays that avoids the use of the $V_{cb}$ and $V_{ub}$ parameters that are subject to tensions between their determinations from inclusive and exclusive decays. In particular we update the values of the $V_{cb}$-independent ratios of various K and B decay branching ratios predicted by the Standard Model. We also stress the usefulness of the $V_{cb}-\gamma$ plots in the search for new physics. We select the magnificant seven among rare K and B decays that should play a leading role in the search for new physics due to their theoretical cleanness: $B^+\to K^+(K^*)\nu\bar\nu$ and $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ measured recently by Belle II and NA62, respectively, $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$ investigated by KOTO and also $B_{s,d}\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and $K_S\to\mu^+\mu^-$ measured by the LHCb, CMS and ATLAS experiments at CERN. %</description>

      <title>Dark Matter in the High-Scale Seesaw Leptogenesis Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The seesaw mechanism with three heavy Majorana right-handed neutrinos provides an elegant explanation for neutrino masses and, combined with leptogenesis, can generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). Naturally embedded in a Grand Unified Theory, this framework stands as one of the best-motivated extensions beyond the Standard Model. However, it does not account for dark matter (DM). In this paper, we propose a minimal extension that introduces a dark sector with a singlet Majorana fermion (as the DM candidate) and a complex scalar singlet. The heavy right-handed neutrinos serve multiple roles: i) explaining the small masses of active neutrinos via the seesaw mechanism, ii) generating the BAU through leptogenesis, and iii) producing the cold DM density through their decays. Interestingly, the model also predicts a subdominant DM component from late scalar decays, which in some cases may be hot or warm at the onset of structure formation, as well as an equal number of non-thermal neutrinos. These components leave distinct signatures in various cosmological observables. Furthermore, electromagnetic energy injection from scalar decays alter predictions from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and induce spectral distortions in the Cosmic Microwave Background black-body spectrum. Upcoming experiments, such as the Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE), could probe a significant portion of the parameter space of this extended high-scale seesaw scenario.</description>

      <title>Boxed in from all sides: a global fit to loopy dark matter and neutrino masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a dark matter model that couples to the standard model through a one-loop interaction with neutrinos, where the mediator particles also generate neutrino masses. We perform a global fit that incorporates dark matter relic abundance, primordial nucleosynthesis, neutrino mass, collider and indirect detection constraints. Thanks to the loop suppression, large couplings are allowed, and we find that the model parameters are constrained on all sides. Dark matter masses from 10 MeV to a few TeV are allowed, but sub-GeV masses are preferred for the model to also account for the heaviest neutrino mass. Though our results are valid for a single neutrino mass eigenstate at a time, the model and methods are generalizable to the full 3-flavor case.</description>

      <title>Remarkable Scale Relation, Approximate SU(5), Fluctuating Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a series of 8 energy scales, some of which just speculated by ourselves, and fit the logarithms of these energies as a straight line versus a quantity related to the dimensionalities of action terms in a way to be defined in the article. These terms in the action are related to the energy scales in question. So e.g. the dimensionality of Einstein Hilbert action coefficient is one related to the Planck scale. In fact we suppose in the cases described with quantum field theory, that there is for each of our energy scales a pair of associated terms in the Lagrangian density, one "kinetic" and one "mass- or current" term. We use for our plotting of the energy scales the ratio of the dimensionality of say the "non-kinetic" to the dimensionality of the "kinetic" one The explanation for our phenomenological finding that the logarithm of the energies depend as a straight line on the dimensionality defined integer $q$, we give as an ontological - i.e. it really exists in nature in our model -"fluctuating lattice" with a very broad distribution of say the link size $a$.We take it Gaussian in the logarithm, $\ln(a)$. A fluctuating lattice is very natural in a theory with general relativity, since it corresponds to fluctuations in the gauge d.o.f. of general relativity. Intriguing are the lowest ones of our energy scales, being by us not described by quantum field theory as the other ones, but by actions for single particle or single string respectivily, because the string scale fits well with hadronic strings, and the particle scale is presumably the mass scale of Standard Model group monopoles, a bound state of a couple of which might be the dimuon resonance (or statistical fluctuation) found in LHC with mass 28 GeV.</description>

      <title>Tri-meson state $\boldsymbol{\bar{B}\bar{B}^*\bar{B}^*}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically explore the tri-meson states $\bar{B}\bar{B}^*\bar{B}^*$ with various isospin-spin configurations in the quark model by solving exactly the six-body Schr\"{o}dinger equations with the Gaussian expansion method. The isospin-spin configuration $\left[[\bar{B} \bar{B}^*]^1_0\bar{B}^*\right]^0_{\frac{1}{2}}$ is not only approximately 10.2 MeV lower than the threshold of its constituent particles but also about 0.2 MeV below that of the compact tetraquark state $[\bar{B}\bar{B}^*]^1_0$ and $\bar{B}^* $. This configuration manifests a loose two-body bound state composed of $[\bar{B}\bar{B}^*]^1_0$ and $\bar{B}^* $, with a size of around 4.75 fm. In contrast, the isospin-spin configurations $\left[[\bar{B}\bar{B}^*]^1_1\bar{B}^*\right]^0_{\frac{1}{2}}$, $\left[\bar{B} [\bar{B}^*\bar{B}^*]^0_1\right]^0_{\frac{1}{2}}$, and $\left[[\bar{B}\bar{B}^*]^1_1\bar{B}^*\right]^1_{\frac{1}{2}}$ exhibit binding energies of less than 1 MeV relative to their constituent particles, establishing a loose three-body bound state consisting of three completely separated mesons. Among the four bound configurations, the $\sigma$-meson exchange plays a decisive role. The meson pair $[\bar{B}\bar{B}^*]^1_0$, resembling the short-range strong correlated $p$-$n$ pair in nuclear physics, prevails over other types of meson pairs. This strongly correlated meson pair not only contributes to the binding mechanisms but also influences the spatial structures of those stable tri-meson configurations.</description>

      <title>Next-to-Next-to-Leading-Order QCD Prediction for the Pion Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We accomplish for the first time the two-loop computation of the leading-twist contribution to the pion electromagnetic form factor by employing the effective field theory formalism rigorously. The next-to-next-to-leading-order short-distance matching coefficient is determined by evaluating the appropriate $5$-point QCD amplitude with the modern multi-loop technique and subsequently by implementing the ultraviolet renormalization and infrared subtractions with the inclusion of evanescent operators. The renormalization/factorization scale independence of the obtained form factor is then validated explicitly at ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^3)$. The yielding two-loop QCD correction to this fundamental quantity turns out to be numerically significant at experimentally accessible momentum transfers. We further demonstrate that the newly computed two-loop radiative correction is highly beneficial for an improved determination of the leading-twist pion distribution amplitude.</description>

      <title>TMD-like functions through the twisted quark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a new class of transverse momentum dependent functions (TMDs) as known as align-spin (AS) functions, employing the framework of twisted quark states. We reveal that these twisted (vortex) quark states serve as effective tools for the study of TMDs, thereby facilitating a comprehensive analysis of AS-functions. The proposed method is quite general and can be used for the standard TMDs. In contrast to the previous studies, the presented approach focuses on the leading order of interactions, providing a simplified and robust alternative to the methods based on the traditional $\mathbb{S}$-matrix expansion. We highlight that the critical dependence of transverse momentum arises not only from interactions but also from significant contributions linked to orbital angular momentum (OAM), influenced by the transverse momentum characteristics of correlators. Using a cylindrical formulation for twisted states, we can combine the properties of plane-wave particles with a description stemmed from spherical harmonics, resulting in well-defined propagation directions accompanied by essential OAM projections. In particular, this innovative framework opens a new window for the direct investigations of AS-functions, generating the unique angular $\phi$-dependence of differential cross sections. It also points towards promising applications in experimental particle physics.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound and trace anomaly in a unified treatment of the two-color diquark superfluid, the pion-condensed high-isospin matter, and the 2SC quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a unified perturbative treatment from the high-density side, we compute the speed of sound and the trace anomaly as functions of the chemical potential $\mu$ for the two-color diquark superfluid, the pion-condensed high-isospin matter, and the 2SC quark matter. We find that the corrections induced by the gap energy $\Delta$ involve nontrivial interplay between the dimensionless magnitude $|\Delta/\mu|$ and the derivative $|\partial\Delta/\partial\mu|$. Even though the gap equation has a common structure for these phases of our interest, different numerical constants cause drastic changes in the speed of sound corrections. As long as $|\Delta/\mu|$ is dominant over the derivative, the gap effects increase the speed of sound, which is consistent with the expected behavior of exhibiting a peak at intermediate density. We then discuss the trace anomaly which is pushed down generally by the gap effects and turns out to be negative widely in the high density regime. For demonstration of non-perturbative enhancement, we take account of the instanton-induced interaction. We confirm a further increase in the speed of sound for the two-color diquark superfluid and the pion-condensed high-isospin matter, while the speed of sound for the 2SC quark matter deviates far below the conformal limit due to the derivative contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BESIII Collaboration recently reported the observation of two new resonances, $X(1910)$ and $X(2300)$, which have sparked our interest in studying the light hadron family with $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$ . In this work, we investigate the mass spectra and OZI-allowed two-body strong decays of $b_1$, $h_1$, and $h_1^\prime$ using the MGI model and QPC model with newly fitted parameters. We also explore the possibility of identifying $X(1910)$ and $X(2300)$ as $h_1$ or $h_1^\prime$ states. Our numerical results suggest that $X(1910)$ could be a promising candidate for the $h_1^\prime(2^1P_1)$ state with quark content $s\bar{s}$, while the structure of $X(2300)$ remains uncertain.</description>

Abstract: We compute the invariant mass of dijets produced in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation processes up to four-loops in perturbation theory for both anti-$k_t$ and $k_t$ jet algorithms. The calculations, performed within the eikonal approximation and employing strong-energy ordering, capture the full analytic structure of the leading Abelian and non-Abelian non-global logarithms, including full colour and jet-radius dependence. We evaluate the significance of these logarithms and the convergence of the four-loop perturbative expansion by comparing with all-orders numerical results.</description>

Abstract: Different from the previous treatment in a two-body framework, we introduce the dimeson distribution amplitudes (DAs) to describe the strong dynamics between the S-wave resonances $a_0(980, 1450)$ and the $K\bar K (\pi\eta)$ pair, where the Gegenbauer coefficient required is determined from the experimental data on the time-like form factors involved. The branching ratios and direct CP asymmetries of the decays $B \to a^{(\prime)}_0 h \to K\bar K(\pi\eta) h$, with $a_0=a_0(980)$, $a^{\prime}_0=a_0(1450)$ and $h$ referring to a pion or a kaon, are then calculated in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach. We find that the branching ratios of the corresponding quasi-two-body decays $B\to a^{(\prime)}_0 K$ obtained with the narrow width approximation are closer to those predicted in the QCD factorization (QCDF) approach compared to the previous PQCD calculations, no matter a three-body or a two-body framework is assumed. Furthermore, all our predictions for these $B\to a^{(\prime)}_0 K$ decays are below the current experimental upper limits except for those of decays $B^0\to a^{(\prime)-}_0K^+$, which are (slightly) larger than the upper limits. Under the narrow width approximation, the branching ratios of the decays $B^+\to a^{(\prime)+}_0\pi^0$, $B^0\to a^{(\prime)+}_0\pi^-$ and $B^0\to a^{(\prime)0}_0\pi^0$ are comparable to or agree well with the previous PQCD and the QCDF calculations. While for the decays $B^+\to a^{(\prime)0}_0\pi^+$ and $B^0\to a^{(\prime)-}_0\pi^+$, their branching ratios are predicted to be unexpectedly large, for example, the obtained branching ratio of decay $B^+\to a^0_0\pi^+$ is even higher than the current experimental upper limit.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical constraints on color-superconducting phases in compact stars within the RG-consistent NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine parameters of the renormalization group-consistent (RG-consistent) three-flavor color-superconducting Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model that are suited to investigate possible compact-star configurations. Our goal is to provide viable quark-matter equation of state (EoS) that can generally be used for hybrid-star constructions. To that end, we mainly focus on quark-star properties in this work. By varying the vector and diquark coupling constants, we analyze their impact on the EoS, speed of sound (SoS), the maximum diquark gap, and the mass-radius relation. In almost all configurations, a stable color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase appears in the core of the maximum-mass configurations, typically spanning several kms in radius. In other cases, the star's two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) branch of the EoS becomes unstable before reaching the CFL transition density. At neutron-star densities, the SoS squared reaches up to 0.6 and the CFL diquark gap up to 250 MeV. We argue that adding a hadronic EoS at lower densities by performing a Maxwell construction, does not increase the maximum mass substantially, thus we use the 2 solar mass constraint to constrain the NJL model parameters that are suited for the construction of hybrid-star EoS. We construct three examples of the hybrid star model, demonstrating that there is room for different CSC compositions. The hybrid EoS obtained in this way can have no 2SC matter or different ratios of 2SC and CFL quark matter in the core. We show that early hadron-quark transitions are possible that can modify the tidal deformability at 1.4 solar mass. We will provide tabulated EoS of the RG-consistent NJL model for these three parameter sets. We find that these EoS are consistent with the imposed constraints from astrophysics and perturbative QCD. They allow for different hybrid-star scenarios with a hadronic EoS that is soft at low densities.</description>

      <title>Double Parton Scattering Effect on the Measurement of $W$-Boson Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of double parton scattering (DPS) on the $W$-boson mass measurements. Especially, our analysis reveals that the DPS effect has the potential to result in an increase $\Delta M_W$ in the measured CDF-II mass, with $\Delta M_W=10-150~\mbox{MeV}$ in the missing transverse momentum fit and $\Delta M_W=5-50~\mbox{MeV}$ in the transverse mass fit. This illustrates the significant sensitivity of the $W$-boson mass measurement to this effect, which helps to understand the deviation of the measured CDF-II mass from other measurements and the predicted value in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Twist-3 contribution to deeply virtual electroproduction of pions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss deeply virtual meson production (DVMP), focusing on the role of higher-twist contributions in the description of deeply virtual pseudoscalar mesons at experimentally accessible energies. The standard collinear approach at the lowest twist does not adequately describe deeply virtual $\pi_0$ production. By incorporating twist-2 transversity generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and a twist-3 meson distribution amplitude, we have determined the twist-3 contribution, which includes both the 2-body ($q\bar{q}$) and 3-body ($q\bar{q}g$) meson Fock components. Two methods to regularize the end-point singularities are introduced - quark transverse momenta and a gluon mass. The resulting cross sections show good agreement with experimental data, paving the way for a more comprehensive confrontation of theory and experiment at leading order and beyond.</description>

      <title>TeV-scale particles and LHC events with dijet pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar particles that couple to two up quarks may be produced at the LHC even if they are ultraheavy, in the $8-10$ TeV mass range. A renormalizable theory that includes a diquark particle of this type ($S_{uu}$), two vectorlike quarks ($\chi_1, \chi_2$), and a gauge-singlet pseudoscalar, predicts LHC signals involving four or more jets of very high $p_T$. Two remarkable events observed by the CMS experiment, each involving four high $p_T$-jets, may be due to an $S_{uu}$ of mass near 8.5 TeV, and a $\chi_2$ mass of 2.1 TeV. A separate excess reported by CMS in the nonresonant dijet pair search is consistent with a $\chi_1$ mass of $0.95$ TeV. This hypothesis may be tested through CMS and ATLAS searches for signals with a pair of dijet resonances of masses clustered around 1 TeV, and separately around 2 TeV, which have $4j$ invariant masses in the $5-8$ TeV range. These additional signals would arise from cascade decays of $S_{uu} \to \chi_2 \chi_2 $, which lead to $5j$ and $6j$ events with invariant masses around 8 TeV. Depending on the couplings of the heavy colored particles, additional signals are possible, involving for example highly-boosted top quarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theory for nonlinear, resonant excitation of dynamical axions by counter-propagating electromagnetic waves in materials that break both $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ symmetries. We show that dynamical axions can mediate an exponential growth in the amplitude of the lower frequency (Stokes) beam. We also discuss spontaneous generation of a counter-propagating Stokes mode, enabled by resonant amplification of quantum and thermal fluctuations in the presence of a single pump laser. Remarkably, the amplification can be orders of magnitude larger than that obtained via stimulated Brillouin and Raman scattering processes, and can be modulated with the application of external magnetic fields, making stimulated axion scattering promising for optoelectronics applications.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Origin of CMB Large-Scale Features Using LiteBIRD and CMB-S4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several missions following Planck are currently under development, which will provide high-precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. Specifically, measurements of the E modes will become nearly limited by cosmic variance, which, especially when considering the sharpness of the E-mode transfer functions, may allow for the ability to detect deviations from the concordance model in the CMB data. We investigate the capability of upcoming missions to scrutinize models that have been proposed to address large-scale anomalies observed in the temperature spectra from WMAP and Planck. To this purpose, we consider four benchmarks that modify the CMB angular power spectra at large scales: models producing suppression, a dip, and amplification in the primordial scalar power spectrum, as well as a beyond-Lambda CDM prescription of dark energy. Our analysis shows that large-scale measurements from LiteBIRD will be able to distinguish between various types of primordial and late-time models that predict modifications to the angular spectra at these scales. Moreover, if these deviations from the standard cosmological model are determined to be systematic and do not reflect the true universe model, future experiments could potentially dismiss these features as statistical fluctuations. We also show that additional measurements from CMB-S4 can impose more stringent constraints by probing correlated signals that these models predict at smaller scales (l&gt;100). A byproduct of our analysis is that a recently proposed "Dark Dimension" scenario, featuring power amplification at large scales, is strongly bound by current data, pushing the deviation from the standard model to unobservable scales. Overall, our results demonstrate that future CMB measurements can provide valuable insights into large-scale anomalies that are present in the current CMB data.</description>

      <title>A pathway to unveiling neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay nuclear matrix elements via $\gamma\gamma$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the experimental feasibility of detecting second-order double-magnetic dipole ($\gamma\gamma$-$M1M1$) decays from double isobaric analog states (DIAS), which have recently been found to be strongly correlated with the nuclear matrix elements of neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay. Using the nuclear shell model, we compute theoretical branching ratios for $\gamma\gamma$-$M1M1$ decays and compare them with other competing processes, such as single-$\gamma$ decay and proton emission, which represent the dominant decay channels. We also estimate the potential competition from internal conversion and internal pair creation, which can influence the decay dynamics. Additionally, we propose an experimental strategy based on using LaBr$_3$ scintillators to identify $\gamma\gamma$-$M1M1$ transitions from the DIAS amidst the background of the competing processes. Our approach emphasizes the challenges of isolating the rare $\gamma\gamma$-$M1M1$ decay and suggests ways to enhance the experimental detection sensitivity. Our simulations suggest that it may be possible to access experimentally $\gamma\gamma$-$M1M1$ decays from DIAS, shedding light on the neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay nuclear matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Phase transition on superfluid vortices in Higgs-Confinement crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to distinguish states of matter by identifying spontaneous symmetry breaking on extended objects, such as vortices, even in the absence of a bulk phase transition. As a specific example, we investigate the phase transition on superfluid vortices in the Higgs-confinement crossover using a $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{gauge} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ model. This model exhibits superfluidity of $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ symmetry and allows for a crossover between the Higgs and confinement regimes by varying the gauge coupling constant from weak to strong. We demonstrate that, on vortices, spontaneous breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flavor symmetry occurs in the weak coupling (Higgs) regime, while it does not in the strong coupling (confinement) regime. We also confirm that those regimes are separated by a second-order phase transition through Monte Carlo simulations, whose universality class corresponds to the two-dimensional Ising model.</description>

      <title>RHIC $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV hadron yields and the isospin dependent equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistical hadronization model has been successful in extracting information at chemical freeze-out in heavy-ion collisions. At RHIC, with a collision energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, many different ion species have been used for $A$+$A$ collisions. This allows for a scan across the charge fraction $Y_Q=Z/A$, where $Z$ is the proton number and $A$ is the baryon number. We first make predictions for $A$+$A$ collisions that do not yet have published experimental data on hadron yield ratios (O+O, Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr). We then use both the experimental and predicted yield ratios to perform thermal fits across $Y_Q$, enabling us to extract $s/n_B$ and other thermodynamic information at chemical freeze-out. Using the relation between $s/n_B$ and $Y_Q$, we can calculate a new constraint on the finite temperature equation of state at finite densities. We discuss implications of this constraint and propose future runs that can help connect to the equation of state relevant for neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quark Jet Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06014</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.06014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the fragmentation of a parton into a jet containing a heavy quark. When heavy quarks are involved in a jet, the quark mass can lead to a numerically significant correction to the jet cross section and its substructure. With this motivation, we calculated the heavy quark mass effects to next-to-leading order in $\alpha_s$ on the fragmentation functions to a jet (FFJs) and the jet fragmentation functions (JFFs), where the former describes fragmentation of parton into a jet and the latter describes fragmenting processes inside a jet. The finite size of the heavy quark mass does not change the ultraviolet behaviors, but it can give significant corrections to the finite contributions. When we take the zero mass limit, we find that the FFJs and the JFFs reproduce established results for massless partons. If we define the heavy quark jet as one that include at least one heavy (anti-)quark, the tagged heavy quark jet production is sensitive to the heavy quark mass and produces large logarithms of the mass. Taking advantage of the FFJs and JFFs, we formulate a factorization theorem for heavy quark jet production in order to resum these large logarithms systematically. As an application, we study inclusive $b$-jet production and show phenomenological implications due to keeping a non-zero quark mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been recognized that the scattering of electroweak particles at very high energies is dominated by vector boson fusion, which probes the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and offers a unique window into the ultraviolet regime of the SM. Previous studies assume SM-like couplings and rely on the effective $W$ approximation (or electroweak parton distribution), whose validity is well-established within the SM but not yet studied in the presence of anomalous Higgs couplings. In this work, we critically examine the electroweak production of two Higgs bosons in the presence of anomalous $VVh$ and $VVhh$ couplings. We compute the corresponding helicity amplitudes and compare the cross section results in the effective $W$ approximation with the full fixed-order calculation. In particular, we identify two distinct classes of anomalous Higgs couplings, whose effects are not captured by vector boson fusion and effective $W$ approximation. Such very high energy electroweak scatterings can be probed at the Muon Shot, a multi-TeV muon collider upon which we base our study, although similar considerations apply to other high energy colliders.</description>

Abstract: Histogramming is often taken for granted, but the power and compactness of partially aggregated, multidimensional summary statistics, and their fundamental connection to differential and integral calculus make them formidable statistical objects, especially when very large data volumes are involved. But expressing these concepts robustly and efficiently in high-dimensional parameter spaces and for large data samples is a highly non-trivial challenge -- doubly so if the resulting library is to remain usable by scientists as opposed to software engineers. In this paper we summarise the core principles required for consistent generalised histogramming, and use them to motivate the design principles and implementation mechanics of the re-engineered YODA histogramming library, a key component of physics data-model comparison and statistical interpretation in collider physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate detailed properties of imaginary rotating matter with gluons and quarks at high temperature. Previously, we showed that imaginary rotation induces perturbative confinement of gluons at the rotation center. We perturbatively calculate the Polyakov loop potential and find inhomogeneous confinement above a certain threshold of imaginary angular velocity. We also evaluate the quark contribution to the Polyakov loop potential and confirm that spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking occurs in the perturbatively confined phase.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a collider probe of a dark sector model in which the dark matter is charged under a new, hidden $U(1)$ gauge group. In particular, we look for the so-called Darkstrahlung process, in which the final states dark matter radiates a new $Z'$ gauge boson and it manifests as dilepton resonances. This work emphasizes the potential of dilepton final states with missing transverse energy in probing the darkstrahlung process. We recast the ATLAS Run 2 search for dilepton resonances in association with missing energy in addition to the ATLAS and CMS searches for sleptons. We find that the recasted searches put strong constraints on the coupling between the dark matter and the $Z'$. Moreover, we evaluate refined search strategies for $Z'$ production and propose an analysis employing constraints on the lepton invariant mass and higher missing energy cut related to the darkstrahlung process. Simulation outcomes indicate substantial enhancements, particularly by a factor of 6 in regions featuring lower $Z'$ masses. Finally, we also discuss the case when the $Z'$ has a long lifetime, resulting in displaced decay of the boson.</description>

      <title>String-based parametrization of nucleon GPDs at any skewness: a comparison to lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a string-based parametrization for nucleon quark and gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) valid at all skewness values. The conformal moments of the GPDs are expressed as sums of the spin-j nucleon A-form factor, and the skewness-dependent spin-j nucleon D-form factor. This representation, which fulfills the polynomiality condition (due to Lorentz invariance) and does not rely on model-specific assumptions, is derived from t-channel string exchanges in AdS spaces. The spin-j nucleon D-form factor is closely related to the the spin-j nucleon A-form factor. We use the Mellin moments from empirical parton distributions to model the spin-j nucleon A-form factors. Using only five Regge slope parameters, fixed from the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors, our string-based parametrization generates accurate singlet, non-singlet, isovector, and flavor-separated nucleon quark GPDs, along with symmetric nucleon gluon GPDs from their Mellin-Barnes integral representations. Our isovector nucleon quark GPD is in agreement with existing lattice data. Our string-based parametrization should facilitate the empirical extraction and global analysis of nucleon GPDs in exclusive processes, bypassing the deconvolution challenge.</description>

      <title>Shedding Light on Hadronization by Quarkonium Energy Correlator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to measure the energy correlator in quarkonium production, which tracks the energy deposited in the calorimeter $\chi$-angular distance away from the identified quarkonium. The observable eliminates the need for jets while sustaining the perturbative predictive power. Analyzing the power correction to the energy correlator, we demonstrate the novel observable supplies a unique gateway to probing the hadronization, especially when $\cos\chi\gtrsim 0$ in the quarkonium rest frame where the perturbative emissions are depleted due to the dead-cone effects. We expect the quarkonium energy correlator to add a new dimension to quarkonium studies.</description>

      <title>Boosting probes of CP violation in the top Yukawa coupling with Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise measurement of the top-Higgs coupling is crucial in particle physics, offering insights into potential new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) carrying CP Violation (CPV) effects. In this paper, we explore the CP properties of a Higgs boson coupling with a top quark pair, focusing on events where the Higgs state decays into a pair of $b$-quarks and the top-antitop system decays leptonically. The novelty of our analysis resides in the exploitation of two conditional Deep Learning (DL) networks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Graph Convolution Network (GCN). These models are trained for selected CPV phase values and then used to interpolate all possible values ranging from $-\frac{\pi}{2} \text{ to } \frac{\pi}{2}$. This enables a comprehensive assessment of sensitivity across all CP phase values, thereby streamlining the process as the models are trained only once. Notably, the conditional GCN exhibits superior performance over the conditional MLP, owing to the nature of graph-based Neural Network (NN) structures. Specifically, for Higgs top coupling modifier set to 1, with $\sqrt{s}= 13.6$ TeV and integrated luminosity of $3$ ab$^{-1}$ GCN excludes the CP phase larger than $|5^\circ|$ at $95.4\%$ Confidence Level (C.L). Our Machine Learning (ML) informed findings indicate that assessment of the CP properties of the Higgs coupling to the $t\bar t$ pair can be within reach of the HL-LHC, quantitatively surpassing the sensitivity of more traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>Anomalous and linear holographic hard wall models for light unflavored mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider anomalous and linear holographic hard wall (HW) models for light unflavored mesons inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence. The anomalous dimensions depend on the logarithm of the spin S of the meson state and come from a semiclassical analysis of gauge/string duality. The anomalous HW model produces very good masses and good Regge trajectories for mesons compared with PDG data. Inspired by this anomalous HW model we also propose a phenomenological modification of the dimension of the boundary operators such that the model produces asymptotic linear Regge trajectories. Both anomalous HW models considered here present mass percentage deviations of less than 3%, when compared with PDG data.</description>

      <title>Off-shell pion properties: electromagnetic form factors and light-front wave functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The off-shell pion electromagnetic form factors are explored with corresponding off-shell light-front wave functions modeled by constituent quark and anti-quark. We apply the Mandelstam approach for the microscopic computation of the form factors relating the model parameters with the pion decay constant and charge radius. Analyzing the existing data on the cross-sections for the Sullivan process, H(e,e',pi)n, we extract the off-shell pion form factor using the relation derived from the generalized Ward-Takahashi identity for the pion electromagnetic current. They are compared with our previous results from exactly solvable manifestly covariant model of a (3+1)-dimensional fermion field theory. We find that the adopted constituent quark model reproduces the extracted off-shell form factor $F_1(Q^2,t)$ from the experimental data within a few percent difference and matches well with our previous theoretical simulation which exhibits a variation of about 10\% for the extracted off-shell pion form factor $g(Q^2,t)$. We also identify the pion valence parton distribution function (PDF) and transverse momentum distribution (TMD) in terms of the light-front wave function and discuss their off-shell properties.</description>

Abstract: We investigate collective excitations in magnetic topological insulators (TIs) and their impact on particle axion detection. In the three-dimensional TI model with the Hubbard term, the effective action of magnons and amplitude modes is formulated by dynamical susceptibility under the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states. One of the amplitude modes is identified as ``axionic'' quasi-particle and its effective coupling to the electromagnetic fields turns out to be enhanced by about four orders of magnitude larger than the previous estimate, which may drastically change the sensitivity of the particle axion search using ``axion'' in magnetic TIs.</description>

Abstract: Energy levels of hydrogen are calculated as one-loop matrix elements of the QED energy-momentum tensor trace in the external field approximation. An explicit connection established between the one-loop trace diagrams and the standard Lamb shift one-loop diagrams. Our calculations provide an argument against inclusion of the anomalous trace contribution as a separate term in the decomposition of the QED quantum field Hamiltonian and serve as an illustration how the trace anomaly is realized in the bound state QED.</description>

      <title>Dark matter limits from the tip of the red giant branch of globular clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Capture and annihilation of WIMP-like dark matter in red giant stars can lead to faster-than-expected ignition of the helium core, and thus a lower tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) luminosity. We use Gaia data to place constraints on the dark matter-nucleon cross section using 22 globular clusters with measured TRGB luminosities, and place projections on the sensitivity resulting from 161 clusters with full phase space distributions observed by Gaia. Although limits remain weaker than those from Earth-based direct detection experiments, they represent a constraint that is fully independent of dark matter properties in the Solar neighbourhood, probing its properties across the entire Milky Way galaxy. Based on our findings, it is likely that the use of the TRGB as a standard candle in $H_0$ measurements is very robust against the effects of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to explain the mass hierarchy and mixing pattern in the leptonic sector, we explore an extension of the Standard Model whose scalar sector includes one active and two inert doublets as well as some scalar singlets. The model includes a $S_3$ family symmetry supplemented by extra cyclic symmetries. As a consequence of our construction, a Dark Matter (DM) candidate is predicted and its properties are consistent with the observed cosmic abundances and the constraints imposed by direct and indirect detection experiments. The model allows Charged Lepton Flavor Violation (CLFV) processes like $\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$ and $\mu \rightarrow 3e$, but the predicted branching ratios align with experimental limits. Additionally, our analysis elucidates the generation of the active neutrino masses through a one-loop radiative seesaw mechanism matching the observed neutrino oscillation data. The model agrees with experimental data on Higgs Diphoton decay rates and on oblique parameters.</description>

Abstract: We study the semileptonic decay of the doubly heavy baryon $ \Xi^{++}_{cc} $ into the singly heavy baryon $ \Xi^+_{c}$ within the three point QCD sum rule approach in two possible lepton channels. Our analysis includes perturbative as well as nonperturbative condensation contributions up to dimension five. We evaluate the form factors of this semileptonic decay entering the amplitude described by the vector and axial vector transition currents. The fit functions of the form factors with respect to the transferred momentum squared are utilized to predict the decay widths and branching ratios of the $ \Xi^{++}_{cc}\rightarrow \Xi^+_{c} \bar{\ell}\nu_{\ell}$ channels. We compare our findings with other predictions in the literature. Our outcomes can be useful for experimental groups in their search for the weak decays of doubly heavy baryons and may be checked via future experiments such as LHCb.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding out if neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles is known to be extremely difficult. This is generally believed to be due to the smallness of the neutrino mass compared to typical neutrino energies, and to the fact that in the limit of vanishing mass all distinctions between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos disappear. This, however, does not necessarily mean that for non-relativistic neutrinos distinguishing between them is an easy task. We consider this problem in detail. The issues discussed include the possibilities of studying neutrino nature with non-relativistic neutrinos produced in $\beta$ decay in direct neutrino mass measurement experiments, with relic neutrinos, as well as with slow neutrinos in pair production processes and in scattering, both elastic and inelastic. We also discuss processes allowed for only one of the two neutrino types as a means of uncovering neutrino nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At high-energy collider experiments, generative models can be used for a wide range of tasks, including fast detector simulations, unfolding, searches of physics beyond the Standard Model, and inference tasks. In particular, it has been demonstrated that score-based diffusion models can generate high-fidelity and accurate samples of jets or collider events. This work expands on previous generative models in three distinct ways. First, our model is trained to generate entire collider events, including all particle species with complete kinematic information. We quantify how well the model learns event-wide constraints such as the conservation of momentum and discrete quantum numbers. We focus on the events at the future Electron-Ion Collider, but we expect that our results can be extended to proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions. Second, previous generative models often relied on image-based techniques. The sparsity of the data can negatively affect the fidelity and sampling time of the model. We address these issues using point clouds and a novel architecture combining edge creation with transformer modules called Point Edge Transformers. Third, we adapt the foundation model OmniLearn, to generate full collider events. This approach may indicate a transition toward adapting and fine-tuning foundation models for downstream tasks instead of training new models from scratch.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extensive phenomenological study of a scotogenic framework including a scalar singlet, a scalar doublet, a fermionic doublet, and two generations of a fermionic triplet, allowing to provide three non-zero neutrino masses and three viable dark matter candidates. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical technique, we probe the parameter space of the model in view of numerous constraints stemming from dark matter, the neutrino sector, and lepton-flavour violating transitions. The dark matter mass distribution of phenomenologically viable scenarios exhibits three very predictive peaks at 550 GeV, 1080 GeV, and 2300 GeV. In all viable parameter regions, the observed relic density is achieved through dominant co-annihilations. Future experiments will be able to probe a large number of the currently viable parameter space, while certain parameter configurations promise interesting collider signatures. For related studies, five typical parameter configurations are given in SLHA format.</description>

      <title>Mixing angle of $K_1(1270/1400)$ and the $K\bar K_1(1400)$ molecular interpretation of $\eta_1(1855)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the SU(3) symmetry breaking effect, the axial-vector kaons $K_1(1270)$ and $K_1(1400)$ are established to be mixtures of two P-wave $K_{1A}\left( {^3{P_1}} \right)$ and $K_{1B}\left( {^1{P_1}} \right)$ states. In QCD sum rules, we propose a new construction of the $K_1$ current operators and calculate the two-point correlation functions by including the next-to-leading order four-quark condensates. The mixing angle is determined as $\theta = \left( {46.95_{ - 0.23}^{ + 0.25}} \right)^\circ$ by reproducing the masses of $K_1(1270)$ and $K_1(1400)$. We further compose the $K\bar K_1\left( {1270} \right)$ and $K\bar K_1\left( {1400} \right)$ interpolating currents with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ to investigate the possible molecular interpretation of the recently observed ${\eta _1}(1855)$ state. We calculate the correlation functions and perform the QCD sum rule analyses for these two molecular systems. However, the spectral functions are found to be negative in physical regions so that they are not able to provide reliable investigations of the $K\bar K_1$ molecular states.</description>

      <title>On gravity unification in SL(2N,C) gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local $SL(2N,C)$ symmetry is shown to provide, when appropriately constrained, a viable framework for a consistent unification of the known elementary forces, including gravity. Such a covariant constraint implies that an actual gauge field multiplet in the $SL(2N,C)$ theory is ultimately determined by the associated tetrad fields which not only specify the geometric features of spacetime but also govern which local internal symmetries are permissible within it. As a consequence, upon the covariant removal of all "redundant" gauge field components, the entire theory only exhibits the effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(N)$ symmetry, comprising $SL(2,C)$ gauge gravity on one hand and $SU(N)$ grand unified theory on the other. Given that all states involved in the $SL(2N,C)$ theories are additionally classified according to their spin values, many potential $SU(N)$ GUTs, including the conventional $SU(5)$ theory, appear to be irrelevant for standard spin $1/2$ quarks and leptons. Meanwhile, applying the $SL(2N,C)$ symmetry to the model of composite quarks and leptons with constituent chiral preons in its fundamental representations reveals, under certain natural conditions, that among all accompanying $SU(N)_{L}\times SU(N)_{R}$ chiral symmetries of preons and their composites only the $SU(8)_{L}\times SU(8)_{R}$ meets the anomaly matching condition ensuring masslessness of these composites at large distances. This, in turn, identifies $SL(16,C)$ with the effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(8)$ symmetry, accommodating all three families of composite quarks and leptons, as the most likely candidate for hyperunification of the existing elementary forces.</description>

      <title>On the structure of the large-$N$ expansion in SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, we have computed the short-distance asymptotics of the generating functional of Euclidean correlators of single-trace twist-$2$ operators in the large-$N$ expansion of SU($N$) Yang-Mills (YM) theory to the leading-nonplanar order. Remarkably, it has the structure of the logarithm of a functional determinant, but with the sign opposite to the one that would follow from the spin-statistics theorem for the glueballs. In order to solve this sign puzzle, we have reconsidered the proof in the literature that in the 't Hooft topological expansion of large-$N$ YM theory the leading-nonplanar contribution to the generating functional consists of the sum over punctures of $n$-punctured tori. We have discovered that for twist-$2$ operators it contains -- in addition to the $n$-punctured tori -- the normalization of tori with $1 \leq p \leq n$ pinches and $n-p$ punctures. Once the existence of the new sector is taken into account, the violation of the spin-statistics theorem disappears. Moreover, the new sector contributes trivially to the nonperturbative $S$ matrix because -- for example -- the $n$-pinched torus represents nonperturbatively a loop of $n$ glueball propagators with no external leg. This opens the way for an exact solution limited to the new sector that may be solvable thanks to the vanishing $S$ matrix.</description>

      <title>Towards multi-messenger observations of core-collapse supernovae harbouring choked jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Choked jets (CJ) have attracted particular attention as potential sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos. Testing this hypothesis is challenging because of the missing gamma-ray counterpart, hence the identification of other electromagnetic (EM) signatures is crucial. A CJ source is expected harbouring in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with extended H envelopes, releasing ultraviolet (UV) and optical emission for a few days. The UV band will be visible with an unprecedentedly large field of view by the future satellite ULTRASAT, for which we investigate the detection prospects in relation to the CJ visibility in the optical band with the currently operating telescope ZTF. ULTRASAT will be able to double the volume of sky currently visible by ZTF for the same emitting sources (sample of observed Type II SNe enlarged by 60%). As these sources can produce neutrinos via hadronic/photohadronic interactions in CJ, we investigate how neutrino observations by existing Cherenkov high-energy neutrino telescopes (IceCube and KM3NeT) can be used in association with EM signals coming from shock breakout (SBO) events. For optimized multimessenger detections, the delay between neutrino produced at SBO (during the jet propagation inside the stellar envelope) and ULTRASAT observations should be of around 4(5) days, with a follow-up by instruments like ZTF about one week after. Fewer than 1% of the CCSNe from red supergiant stars detectable with ULTRASAT might host a CJ and release TeV neutrinos. EM and neutrino detections, if accompanied by photometric and spectroscopic follow-up with evidence for a relativistic jet launched by the central engine, would suggest CCSNe harbouring choked jets as main contributors to the cosmic diffuse neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>The Quenched $g_A$ in Nuclei and Infrared Fixed-Point in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07339v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possible consequence of an IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f=2, 3$ in nuclear matter is discussed. It is shown in terms of d(ilaton)-$\chi$ effective field theory (d$\chi$EFT) incorporated in a generalized effective field theory (G$n$EFT) implemented with hidden local symmetry and hidden scale symmetry that the recently measured superallowed Gamow-Teller transition in the doubly-magic-shell nucleus $^{100}$Sn indicates a surprisingly large anomaly-induced quenching (AIQ) of $g_A$ from the free-space value of 1.276 to $\approx 0.8 $. Combined with the quenching expected from strong nuclear correlations, the effective coupling in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}$ would come to $\sim 1/2$. If this result were reconfirmed, it would impact not only nuclear structure and dense compact-star matter -- where $g_A$ figures in $\pi$-N coupling via the Goldberger-Treiman relation -- but also in search for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), e.g. $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, where 4th power of $g_A$ figures.</description>

      <title>String loops and gravitational positivity bounds: imprint of light particles at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study loop corrections to positivity bounds on effective field theories in the context of $2\to 2$ scattering in gravitational theories, in the presence of light particles. It has been observed that certain negative contributions at low energies are enhanced by inverse powers of a small mass $m$ and are nontrivial to cancel against other low-energy contributions. These originate from near the forward limit of diagrams involving graviton exchange. We observe that scattering in this kinematics domain remains infrared-sensitive even at high center-of-mass energy. By considering a string-inspired model in which high-energy loops can be calculated using unitarity and Regge behavior of tree amplitudes, we uncover a natural mechanism through which $1/m$-enhanced terms perfectly cancel between low and high energy contributions. This concretely explains possible positivity violations in the presence of gravity from the high-energy viewpoint.</description>

      <title>$\gamma$-Cascade V4: A Semi-Analytical Code for Modeling Cosmological Gamma-Ray Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the universe is not transparent to gamma rays with energies above around one hundred GeV, it is necessary to account for the interaction of high-energy photons with intergalactic radiation fields in order to model gamma-ray propagation. Here, we present a public numerical software for the modeling of gamma-ray observables. This code computes the effects on gamma-ray spectra from the development of electromagnetic cascades and cosmological redshifting. The code introduced here is based on the original $\gamma$-Cascade, and builds on it by improving its performance at high redshifts, introducing new propagation modules, and adding many more extragalactic radiation field models, which enables the ability to estimate the uncertainties inherent to EBL modeling. We compare the results of this new code to existing Monte Carlo electromagnetic transport models, finding good agreement within EBL uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Five-Point Two-Mass Planar Integrals and Double Lagrangian Insertions in a Wilson Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the complete set of planar two-loop five-point Feynman integrals with two off-shell external legs. These integrals are relevant, for instance, for the calculation of the second-order QCD corrections to the production of two heavy vector bosons in association with a jet or a photon at a hadron collider. We construct pure bases for these integrals and reconstruct their analytic differential equations in canonical form through numerical sampling over finite fields. The newly identified symbol alphabet, one of the most complex to date, provides valuable data for bootstrap methods. We then apply our results to initiate the study of double Lagrangian insertions in a four-cusp Wilson loop in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, computing it through two loops. We observe that it is finite, conformally invariant in four dimensions, and of uniform transcendentality. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence for its positivity within the amplituhedron region through two loops.</description>

      <title>Spinor-Vector Duality and Mirror Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mirror symmetry was first observed in worldsheet string constructions and shown to have profound implications in the Effective Field Theory (EFT) limit of string compactifications, and for the properties of Calabi-Yau manifolds. It opened up a new field in pure mathematics and was utilised in the area of enumerative geometry. Spinor-Vector Duality (SVD) is an extension of mirror symmetry. This can be readily understood in terms of the moduli of toroidal compactification of the heterotic string, which include the metric the antisymmetric tensor field and the Wilson line moduli. In terms of toroidal moduli, mirror symmetry corresponds to mappings of the internal space moduli, whereas spinor-vector duality corresponds to maps of the Wilson line moduli. In the past few of years, we demonstrated the existence of spinor-vector duality in the effective field theory compactifications of the string theories. This was achieved by starting with a worldsheet orbifold construction that exhibited spinor-vector duality and resolving the orbifold singularities, hence generating a smooth effective field theory limit with an imprint of the spinor-vector duality. Just like mirror symmetry, the spinor-vector duality can be used to study the properties of complex manifolds with vector bundles. Spinor--vector duality offers a top-down approach to the ``Swampland''-program, by exploring the imprint of the symmetries of the ultra-violet complete worldsheet string constructions in the effective field theory limit. The SVD suggests a demarcation line between (2,0) EFTs that possess an ultra-violet complete embedding versus those that do not.</description>

      <title>Graded transcendental functions: an application to four-point amplitudes with one off-shell leg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a general method for constructing a minimal basis of transcendental functions tailored to a scattering amplitude. Starting with formal solutions for all master integral topologies, we grade the appearing functions by properties such as their symbol alphabet or letter adjacency. We rotate the basis such that functions with spurious features appear in the least possible number of basis elements. Since their coefficients must vanish for physical quantities, this approach avoids complex cancellations. As a first application, we evaluate all integral topologies relevant to the three-loop $Hggg$ and $Hgq\bar{q}$ amplitudes in the leading-colour approximation and heavy-top limit. We describe the derivation of canonical differential equation systems and present a method for fixing boundary conditions without the need for a full functional representation. Using multiple numerical reductions, we test the maximal transcendentality conjecture for $Hggg$ and identify a new letter which appears in functions of weight 4 and 5. In addition, we provide the first direct analytic computation of a three-point form factor of the operator $\mathrm{Tr}(\phi^2)$ in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ sYM and find agreement with numerical and bootstrapped results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mass spectra are calculated for ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD and SQCD-type theories and for softly broken ${\cal N}=2$ SQCD in vacua with unbroken $Z_{(2N_c-N_F)\geq 2}$ symmetry. It is shown that the Seiberg ${\cal N}=1$ duality works, at best, for massless quarks within the conformal window only.
  Besides: a) the gauge invariant order parameter for scalar quarks is introduced which distinguishes confinement and higgs phases, b) the phase transition are described in ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD-type and broken ${\cal N}=2$ SQCD theories between confinement and higgs phases, c) the confinement mechanism is proposed for the ordinary QCD and ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD theories.</description>
