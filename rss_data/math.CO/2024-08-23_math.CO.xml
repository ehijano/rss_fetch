      <title>Connected (3,2)-bipartite graphs are antimagic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An antimagic labelling of a graph is a bijection from the set of edges to $\{1, 2, \ldots , m\}$, such that all vertex-sums are pairwise distinct, where the vertex-sum of a vertex is the sum of labels on the edges incident to it. We say a graph is antimagic if it has an antimagic labelling. In 2023, it has been proven that connected $(k, l)$-bipartite graphs are antimagic if $k \geq l + 2$ and one of k or l is odd. In this paper, we extend those results to connected (3, 2)-bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Vertex-primitive s-arc-transitive digraphs of symplectic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A digraph is $s$-arc-transitive if its automorphism group is transitive on directed paths with $s$ edges, that is, on $s$-arcs. Although infinite families of finite $s$-arc transitive digraphs of arbitrary valency were constructed by the third author in 1989, existence of a vertex-primitive $2$-arc-transitive digraph was not known until an infinite family was constructed by the second author with Li and Xia in 2017. This led to a conjecture by the second author and Xia in 2018 that, for a finite vertex-primitive $s$-arc-transitive digraph, $s$ is at most $2$, together with their proof that it is sufficient to prove the conjecture for digraphs with an almost simple group of automorphisms. This paper confirms the conjecture for finite symplectic groups.</description>

      <title>Extremal number of cliques of given orders in graphs with a forbidden clique minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alon and Shikhelman initiated the systematic study of a generalization of the extremal function. Motivated by algorithmic applications, the study of the extremal function $\text{ex}(n, K_k, K_t\text{-minor})$, i.e., the number of cliques of order $k$ in $K_t$-minor free graphs on $n$ vertices, has received much attention. In this paper, we determine essentially sharp bounds on the maximum possible number of cliques of order $k$ in a $K_t$-minor free graph on $n$ vertices. More precisely, we determine a function $C(k,t)$ such that for each $k &lt; t$ with $t-k\gg \log_2 t$, every $K_t$-minor free graph on $n$ vertices has at most $ n C(k, t)^{1+o_t(1)}$ cliques of order $k$. We also show this bound is sharp by constructing a $K_t$-minor-free graph on $n$ vertices with $C(k, t) n$ cliques of order $k$. This bound answers a question of Wood and Fox-Wei asymptotically up to $o_t(1)$ in the exponent except the extreme values when $k$ is very close to $t$.</description>

      <title>Binary codes from subset inclusion matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the minimum distances of binary linear codes with parity check matrices formed from subset inclusion matrices $W_{t,n,k}$, representing $t$-element subsets versus $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element set. We provide both lower and upper bounds on the minimum distances of these codes and determine the exact values for any $t\leq 3$ and sufficiently large $n$. Our study combines design and integer linear programming techniques. The codes we consider are connected to locally recoverable codes, LDPC codes and combinatorial designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the $(m+2)$-angulations on a Riemann surface, characterized with its boundary components, punctures, and gender. We count the number of arcs in such a surface, and associate a graded quiver with superpotential associated with an $(m2)$-angulation. We show the compatibility between the flip of an $(m+2)$-angulation and the flip in the unpunctured case.</description>

      <title>Partition subcubic planar graphs into independent sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A packing $(1^{\ell}, 2^k)$-coloring of a graph $G$ is a partition of $V(G)$ into $\ell$ independent sets and $k$ $2$-independent sets (whose pairwise vertex distance is at least $3$). The famous Four Color Theorem, proved by Appel and Haken as well as Robertson et al., shows that every planar graph is $4$-colorable, i.e., every planar graph is packing $(1^4)$-colorable. The square coloring of planar graphs was first studied by Wegner in 1977. Thomassen, and independently Hartke et al. proved one can always square color a cubic planar graph with $7$ colors, i.e., every subcubic planar graph is packing $(2^7)$-colorable. We focus on packing $(1^{\ell}, 2^k)$-colorings, which lie between proper coloring and square coloring. Gastineau and Togni proved every subcubic graph is packing $(1,2^6)$-colorable. Furthermore, they asked whether every subcubic graph except the Petersen graph is packing $(1,2^5)$-colorable.
  In this paper, we prove that every subcubic planar graph is packing $(1,2^5)$-colorable, extending the result of Thomassen and Hartke et al.. This also answers the question of Gastineau and Togni affirmatively for subcubic planar graphs. Moreover, we prove that there exists an infinite family of subcubic planar graphs that are not packing $(1,2^4)$-colorable, which shows that our result is the best possible. Besides, our result is also sharp in the sense that the disjoint union of Petersen graphs is subcubic and non-planar, but not packing $(1,2^5)$-colorable.</description>

      <title>Fixed Points and Cycles of the Kaprekar Transformation: 2. Even bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a classification of the fixed points and cycles of the Kaprekar transformation in even bases. The most numerous fixed points and cycles are those we denote symmetric and almost-symmetric; the structure of the cycles of these classes in base $b$ is determined by subgroups and cosets in the multiplicative group modulo $b-1$. We provide methods and formulae for enumerating the fixed points and cycles of these and other classes. A detailed survey of the fixed points and cycles is provided for bases 4, 6 and 8, including a rigorous proof that the classification is complete in base 4.</description>

      <title>Preservation of inequalities under Hadamard products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wagner (1992) proved that the Hadamard product of two P\'olya frequency sequences that are interpolated by polynomials is again a P\'olya frequency sequence. We study the preservation under Hadamard products of related properties of significance in combinatorics. In particular, we show that ultra log-concavity, $\gamma$-positivity, and interlacing symmetric decompositions are preserved. Furthermore, we disprove a conjecture by Fischer and Kubitzke (2014) concerning the real-rootedness of Hadamard powers.</description>

      <title>More Heffter Spaces via finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $(v,k;r)$ Heffter space is a resolvable $(v_r,b_k)$ configuration whose points form a half-set of an abelian group $G$ and whose blocks are all zero-sum in $G$. It was recently proved that there are infinitely many orders $v$ for which, given any pair $(k,r)$ with $k\geq3$ odd, a $(v,k;r)$ Heffter space exists. This was obtained by imposing a point-regular automorphism group. Here we relax this request by asking for a point-semiregular automorphism group. In this way the above result is extended also to the case $k$ even.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion (asymptotics with an arbitrary number of error terms) of k-regular graphs by applying the Laplace method on a recent exact formula from Caizergues and de Panafieu (2023). Previously, only the main asymptotics was known for general k and the asymptotic expansions were known only up to k=7 (Chyzak, Mishna (2024)). We also deduce the asymptotic expansion of connected k-regular graphs using standard techniques for divergent series developed by Wright (1970) and Bender (1975), and quantify its closeness to the asymptotic expansion of k-regular graphs.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial skewing formula for the Rise Delta Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the symmetric function $\Delta'_{e_{k-1}}e_n$ appearing in the Delta Conjecture can be obtained from the symmetric function in the Rational Shuffle Theorem by applying a Schur skewing operator. This generalizes a formula by the first and third authors for the Delta Conjecture at $t=0$, and follows from work of Blasiak, Haiman, Morse, Pun, and Seelinger.
  Our main result is that we also provide a purely combinatorial proof of this skewing identity, giving a new proof of the Rise Delta Theorem from the Rational Shuffle Theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we solve some differential equations in the $D_h$ derivative in Ward's sense. We use a special metric in the formal power series ring $\K[[x]]$. The solutions of that equations are giving in terms of fixed points for certain contractive maps in our metric framework. Our main tools are Banach's Fixed Point Theorem, Fundamental Calculus Theorem and Barrow's rule for Ward's calculus. Later, we return to the usual differential calculus via Sheffer's expansion of some kind of operators. Finally, we give some examples related, in some sense, to combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The web trace theorem of Douglas, Kenyon, Shi expands the twisted Kasteleyn determinant in terms of traces of webs. We generalize this theorem to higher genus surfaces and expand the twisted Kasteleyn matrices corresponding to spin structures on the surface, analogously to the rank-1 case of Cimasoni, Reshetikhin. In the process of the proof, we give an alternate geometric derivation of the planar web trace theorem, relying on the spin geometry of embedded loops and a `racetrack construction' used to immerse loops in the blowup graph on the surface.</description>

      <title>A strange five vertex model and multispecies ASEP on a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of constructing the stationary states of the multispecies asymmetric simple exclusion process on a one-dimensional periodic lattice. Central to our approach is a quantum oscillator weighted five vertex model which features a strange weight conservation distinct from the conventional one. Our results clarify the interrelations among several known results and refine their derivations. For instance, the stationary probability derived from the multiline queue construction by Martin (2020) and Corteel--Mandelshtam--Williams (2022) is identified with the partition function of a three-dimensional system. The matrix product operators by Prolhac--Evans--Mallick (2009) acquire a natural diagrammatic interpretation as corner transfer matrices (CTM). The origin of their recursive tensor structure, as questioned by Aggarwal--Nicoletti--Petrov (2023), is revealed through the CTM diagrams. Finally, the derivation of the Zamolodchikov--Faddeev algebra by Cantini--de Gier--Wheeler (2015) is made intrinsic by elucidating its precise connection to a solution to the Yang--Baxter equation originating from quantum group representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study certain orientation-preserving involutions on three-dimensional small covers. We prove that the quotient space of an orientable three-dimensional small cover by such an involution belonging to the 2-torus is homeomorphic to a connected sum of copies of $S^2 \times S^1$. If this quotient space is a 3-sphere, then the corresponding small cover is a two-fold branched covering of the 3-sphere along a link. We provide a description of this link in terms of the polytope and the characteristic function.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with a spanning subgraph $F$, let $m$ be a positive integer, and let $f$ be a positive integer-valued function on $V(G)$. In this paper, we show that if for all $S\subseteq V(G)$, $$\Omega_m(G\setminus S)\le \sum_{v\in S}\big(f(v)-2m\big)+m+\Omega_m(G[S]),$$ then $G$ has a spanning $m$-tree-connected subgraph $H$ containing $F$ such that for each vertex $ v$, $d_H(v)\le f(v)+\max\{0,d_F(v)-m\}$, where $G[S]$ denotes the induced subgraph of $G$ with the vertex set $S$ and $\Omega_m(G_0)$ is a parameter to measure $m$-tree-connectivity of a given graph $G_0$.
  By applying this result, we show that every $k$-edge-connected graph $G$ with $k\ge 2m$ has a spanning $m$-tree-connected subgraph $H$ such that $d_H(v)\le \big\lceil \frac{m}{k}(d_G(v)-2m)\big\rceil+2m$ for each $v\in V(H)$; moreover, if $G$ is $k$-tree-connected and $k\ge m$, then $G$ has a spanning $m$-tree-connected subgraph $H$ such that $d_H(v)\le \big\lceil \frac{m}{k}(d_G(v)-m)\big\rceil+m$ for each $v\in V(H)$. As a consequence, we conclude that every $(r-2m)$-edge-connected graph with $r\ge 4m$ admits a spanning $m$-tree-connected subgraph with maximum degree at most $3m$.
  Next, we prove that a graph $G$ admits a spanning $m$-tree-connected subgraph $H$ satisfying $\Delta(H) \le 2m+1$, if for all $S\subseteq V(G)$, $$ \omega(G\setminus S)+\small {\frac{m+1}{2}}\, iso(G\setminus S) \le \frac{1}{m}|S|+1,$$ where $\omega(G\setminus S)$ and $iso(G\setminus S)$ denote the number of components and the number of isolated vertices of $G\setminus S$, respectively. As a consequence, we conclude that every $m(n-1)$-connected $K_{1, n}$-free simple graph with a sufficiently large minimum degree and $n\ge 3$ admits a spanning $m$-tree-connected subgraph with maximum degree at most $2m+1$.</description>

      <title>Modulo factors with bounded degrees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a bipartite graph with bipartition $(X,Y)$, let $k$ be a positive integer, and let $f:V(G)\rightarrow \{-1,\ldots, k-2\}$ be a mapping with $\sum_{v\in X}f(v) \stackrel{k}{\equiv}\sum_{v\in Y}f(v)$. In this paper, we show that if $G$ is essentially $(3k-3)$-edge-connected and for each vertex $v$, $d_G(v)\ge 2k-1+f(v)$, then it admits a factor $H$ such that for each vertex $v$, $d_H(v)\stackrel{k}{\equiv} f(v)$, and $$\lfloor\frac{d_G(v)}{2}\rfloor-(k-1)\le d_{H}(v)\le \lceil\frac{d_G(v)}{2}\rceil+k-1.$$ Next, we generalize this result to general graphs and derive sufficient conditions for a highly edge-connected general graph $G$ to have a factor $H$ such that for each vertex $v$, $d_H(v)\in \{f(v),f(v)+k\}$. Finally, we show that every $(4k-1)$-edge-connected essentially $(6k-7)$-edge-connected graph admits a bipartite factor whose degrees are positive and divisible by $k$.</description>

      <title>Generalized recursive atom ordering and equivalence to CL-shellability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bj\"orner and Wachs introduced CL-shellability as a technique for studying the topological structure of order complexes of partially ordered sets (posets). They also introduced the notion of recursive atom ordering, and they proved that a finite bounded poset is CL-shellable if and only if it admits a recursive atom ordering.
  In this paper, a generalization of the notion of recursive atom ordering is introduced. A finite bounded poset is proven to admit such a generalized recursive atom ordering if and only if it admits a traditional recursive atom ordering. This is also proven equivalent to admitting a CC-shelling (a type of shelling introduced by Kozlov) with a further property called self-consistency. Thus, CL-shellability is proven equivalent to self-consistent CC-shellability. As an application, the uncrossing posets, namely the face posets for stratified spaces of planar electrical networks, are proven to be dual CL-shellable.</description>

      <title>Examples and counterexamples in Ehrhart theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10852v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article provides a comprehensive exposition about inequalities that the coefficients of Ehrhart polynomials and $h^*$-polynomials satisfy under various assumptions. We pay particular attention to the properties of Ehrhart positivity as well as unimodality, log-concavity and real-rootedness for $h^*$-polynomials.
  We survey inequalities that arise when the polytope has different normality properties. We include statements previously unknown in the Ehrhart theory setting, as well as some original contributions in this topic. We address numerous variations of the conjecture asserting that IDP polytopes have a unimodal $h^*$-polynomial, and construct concrete examples that show that these variations of the conjecture are false. Explicit emphasis is put on polytopes arising within algebraic combinatorics.
  Furthermore, we describe and construct polytopes having pathological properties on their Ehrhart coefficients and roots, and we indicate for the first time a connection between the notions of Ehrhart positivity and $h^*$-real-rootedness. We investigate the log-concavity of the sequence of evaluations of an Ehrhart polynomial at the non-negative integers. We conjecture that IDP polytopes have a log-concave Ehrhart series. Many additional problems and challenges are proposed.</description>

      <title>Novel Tour Construction Heuristic for Pick-Up and Delivery Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In logistic applications that require the pickup and delivery of items, route optimization problems can be modeled as precedence constrained traveling salesperson problems. The combinatorial nature of this problem restricts the application of exact algorithms to small instances, and heuristics are largely preferred for tractability. However, due to precedence constraints that restrict the order in which locations can be visited, heuristics outside of the nearest neighbor algorithm have been neglected in literature. While the convex hull cheapest insertion heuristic is known to produce good solutions in the absence of precedence constraints, i.e., when locations can be visited in any order, it has not been adapted for pick-up and delivery considerations. This paper presents an adapted convex hull cheapest insertion heuristic that accounts for precedence constraints and compares its solutions with the nearest neighbor heuristic using the TSPLIB benchmark data set. The proposed algorithm is particularly suited to cases where pickups are located in the periphery and deliveries are centrally located, outperforming the Nearest Neighbor algorithm in every examined instance.</description>

      <title>Partition regularity of system of nonlinear equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $1979$, using the theory of ultrafilters, N. Hindman proved that for every finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, there exists a color that contains both additive and multiplicative $IP$ sets. Later, in $1993$, V. Bergelson and N. Hindman found an elementary proof. In this article, we prove that the partial product of these two $IP$ sets also lies in the same color. As an immediate consequence, we have the equation $a+b=c\cdot d$ partition regular. This was a conjecture of P. Csikv\'{a}ri, K. Gyarmati, and A. S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy, which was solved by V. Bergelson and N. Hindman independently. In this article, we separately give a very short proof of this conjecture. Then we extend our techniques to deduce systems of nonlinear equations that are partition regular. We prove that a relatively weak version of the nonlinear Rado systems is partition regular.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe new, simple, recursive methods of construction for orientable sequences over an arbitrary finite alphabet, i.e. periodic sequences in which any sub-sequence of n consecutive elements occurs at most once in a period in either direction. In particular we establish how two variants of a generalised Lempel homomorphism can be used to recursively construct such sequences, generalising previous work on the binary case. We also derive an upper bound on the period of an orientable sequence.</description>

      <title>Dimer face polynomials in knot theory and cluster algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The set of perfect matchings of a connected bipartite plane graph $G$ has the structure of a distributive lattice, as shown by Propp, where the partial order is induced by the height of a matching. In this article, our focus is the dimer face polynomial of $G$, which is the height generating function of all perfect matchings of $G$. We connect the dimer face polynomial on the one hand to knot theory, and on the other to cluster algebras. We show that certain dimer face polynomials are multivariate generalizations of Alexander polynomials of links, highlighting another combinatorial view of the Alexander polynomial. We also show that an arbitrary dimer face polynomial is an $F$-polynomial in the cluster algebra whose initial quiver is dual to the graph $G$. As a result, we recover a recent representation theoretic result of Bazier-Matte and Schiffler that connects $F$-polynomials and Alexander polynomials, albeit from a very different, dimer-based perspective. As another application of our results, we also show that all nonvanishing Pl\"ucker coordinates on open positroid varieties are cluster monomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.06572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the local structure of the semi-invariant picture of a tame hereditary algebra near the null root. Using a construction that we call co-amalgamation, we show that this local structure is completely described by the semi-invariant pictures of a collection of self-injective Nakayama algebras. We then describe the cones of this local structure using cluster-like structures that we call support regular clusters. Finally, we show that the local structure is (piecewise linearly) invariant under cluster tilting.</description>

      <title>Stake-governed tug-of-war and the biased infinity Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In tug-of-war, two players compete by moving a counter along edges of a graph, each winning the right to move at a given turn according to the flip of a possibly biased coin. The game ends when the counter reaches the boundary, a fixed subset of the vertices, at which point one player pays the other an amount determined by the boundary vertex. Economists and mathematicians have independently studied tug-of-war for many years, focussing respectively on resource-allocation forms of the game, in which players iteratively spend precious budgets in an effort to influence the bias of the coins that determine the turn victors; and on PDE arising in fine mesh limits of the constant-bias game in a Euclidean setting.
  In this article, we offer a mathematical treatment of a class of tug-of-war games with allocated budgets: each player is initially given a fixed budget which she draws on throughout the game to offer a stake at the start of each turn, and her probability of winning the turn is the ratio of her stake and the sum of the two stakes. We consider the game played on a tree, with boundary being the set of leaves, and the payment function being the indicator of a single distinguished leaf. We find the game value and the essentially unique Nash equilibrium of a leisurely version of the game, in which the move at any given turn is cancelled with constant probability after stakes have been placed. We show that the ratio of the players' remaining budgets is maintained at its initial value $\lambda$; game value is a biased infinity harmonic function; and the proportion of remaining budget that players stake at a given turn is given in terms of the spatial gradient and the $\lambda$-derivative of game value. We also indicate examples in which the solution takes a different form in the non-leisurely game.</description>

      <title>Pointed Quandle Coloring Quivers of Linkoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We enhance the pointed quandle counting invariant of linkoids through the use of quivers analogously to quandle coloring quivers. This allows us to generalize the in-degree polynomial invariant of links to linkoids. Additionally, we introduce a new linkoid invariant, which we call the in-degree quiver polynomial matrix. Lastly, we study the pointed quandle coloring quivers of linkoids of $(p,2)$-torus type with respect to pointed dihedral quandles.</description>
