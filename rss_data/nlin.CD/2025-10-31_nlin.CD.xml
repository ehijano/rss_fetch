      <title>Controlling eddies in the non-autonomous Lorenz-84 Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme weather events emerge from the chaotic dynamics of the atmosphere. Adaptive chaos control has been applied to Lorenz models in this context. Weather Jiu-Jitsu is a control paradigm that seeks to steer trajectories away from dangerous weather regimes using small, well-timed perturbations. The seasonally forced, non-autonomous Lorenz model has a much more complex attractor than similar atmospheric toy models used to demonstrate the potential of control in the existing literature. Noise or stochastic terms can also significantly increase the complexity of control via small perturbations. We present the first example of finite time adaptive chaos control for a seasonally forced and noise perturbed Lorenz84 model. We demonstrate two strategies for triggering control: (1) local Lyapunov exponents (LLE), and (2) transition probabilities for the latent states of a non-homogeneous Hidden Markov Model (NHMM). The second approach is new. It is motivated by thinking of future applications to a latent embedding space of planetary atmospheric circulation that would get us closer to real world analyses. The NHMM triggers are found to coincide with strongly positive LLE regimes, confirming their dynamical interpretability. Thus, latent-state triggers complement instability diagnostics and provide a conceptual bridge to weather foundation models where hidden states are already identified and could be used for triggering control.</description>

      <title>KGMM: A K-means Clustering Approach to Gaussian Mixture Modeling for Score Function Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid method for accurately estimating the score function, i.e., the gradient of the log steady-state density, using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) in conjunction with a bisecting K-means clustering step. Our approach, which we call KGMM, offers a systematic way to combine statistical density estimation with a neural-network-based interpolation of the score, leveraging the strengths of both. We demonstrate its ability to accurately reconstruct the long-time statistical properties of several paradigmatic systems, including potential systems, chaotic Lorenz-type models, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. Numerical experiments show that KGMM yields robust estimates of the score function, even for small values of the covariance amplitude in the GMM, where standard GMM methods tend to fail because of noise amplification. We compare the performance of KGMM against the conventional Denoising Score Matching (DSM) approach, demonstrating that KGMM achieves more faithful reconstruction of the steady-state distribution for low-dimensional systems at a fraction of the computational cost. These accurate estimates allow us to build effective stochastic reduced-order models that reproduce the invariant measures of the target dynamics.</description>
