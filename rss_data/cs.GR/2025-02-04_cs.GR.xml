      <title>Lifting the Winding Number: Precise Representation of Complex Cuts in Subspace Physics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cutting thin-walled deformable structures is common in daily life, but poses significant challenges for simulation due to the introduced spatial discontinuities. Traditional methods rely on mesh-based domain representations, which require frequent remeshing and refinement to accurately capture evolving discontinuities. These challenges are further compounded in reduced-space simulations, where the basis functions are inherently geometry- and mesh-dependent, making it difficult or even impossible for the basis to represent the diverse family of discontinuities introduced by cuts.
  Recent advances in representing basis functions with neural fields offer a promising alternative, leveraging their discretization-agnostic nature to represent deformations across varying geometries. However, the inherent continuity of neural fields is an obstruction to generalization, particularly if discontinuities are encoded in neural network weights.
  We present Wind Lifter, a novel neural representation designed to accurately model complex cuts in thin-walled deformable structures. Our approach constructs neural fields that reproduce discontinuities precisely at specified locations, without baking in the position of the cut line. Crucially, our approach does not embed the discontinuity in the neural network's weights, opening avenues to generalization of cut placement.
  Our method achieves real-time simulation speeds and supports dynamic updates to cut line geometry during the simulation. Moreover, the explicit representation of discontinuities makes our neural field intuitive to control and edit, offering a significant advantage over traditional neural fields, where discontinuities are embedded within the network's weights, and enabling new applications that rely on general cut placement.</description>

      <title>Regularized interpolation in 4D neural fields enables optimization of 3D printed geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to accurately produce geometries with specified properties is perhaps the most important characteristic of a manufacturing process. 3D printing is marked by exceptional design freedom and complexity but is also prone to geometric and other defects that must be resolved for it to reach its full potential. Ultimately, this will require both astute design decisions and timely parameter adjustments to maintain stability that is challenging even with expert human operators. While machine learning is widely investigated in 3D printing, existing methods typically overlook spatial features that vary across prints and thus find it difficult to produce desired geometries. Here, we encode volumetric representations of printed parts into neural fields and apply a new regularization strategy, based on minimizing the partial derivative of the field's output with respect to a single, non-learnable parameter. By thus encouraging small input changes to yield only small output variations, we encourage smooth interpolation between observed volumes and hence realistic geometry predictions. This framework therefore allows the extraction of 'imagined' 3D shapes, revealing how a part would look if manufactured under previously unseen parameters. The resulting continuous field is used for data-driven optimization to maximize geometric fidelity between expected and produced geometries, reducing post-processing, material waste, and production costs. By optimizing process parameters dynamically, our approach enables advanced planning strategies, potentially allowing manufacturers to better realize complex and feature-rich designs.</description>

      <title>STRIELAD -- A Scalable Toolkit for Real-time Interactive Exploration of Large Atmospheric Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Technological advances in high performance computing and maturing physical models allow scientists to simulate weather and climate evolutions with an increasing accuracy. While this improved accuracy allows us to explore complex dynamical interactions within such physical systems, inconceivable a few years ago, it also results in grand challenges regarding the data visualization and analytics process. We present STRIELAD, a scalable weather analytics toolkit, which allows for interactive exploration and real-time visualization of such large scale datasets. It combines parallel and distributed feature extraction using high-performance computing resources with smart level-of-detail rendering methods to assure interactivity during the complete analysis process.</description>

      <title>Shape from Semantics: 3D Shape Generation from Multi-View Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose ``Shape from Semantics'', which is able to create 3D models whose geometry and appearance match given semantics when observed from different views. Traditional ``Shape from X'' tasks usually use visual input (e.g., RGB images or depth maps) to reconstruct geometry, imposing strict constraints that limit creative explorations. As applications, works like Shadow Art and Wire Art often struggle to grasp the embedded semantics of their design through direct observation and rely heavily on specific setups for proper display. To address these limitations, our framework uses semantics as input, greatly expanding the design space to create objects that integrate multiple semantic elements and are easily discernible by observers. Considering that this task requires a rich imagination, we adopt various generative models and structure-to-detail pipelines. Specifically, we adopt multi-semantics Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to distill 3D geometry and appearance from 2D diffusion models, ensuring that the initial shape is consistent with the semantic input. We then use image restoration and video generation models to add more details as supervision. Finally, we introduce neural signed distance field (SDF) representation to achieve detailed shape reconstruction. Our framework generates meshes with complex details, well-structured geometry, coherent textures, and smooth transitions, resulting in visually appealing and eye-catching designs.

      <title>WonderHuman: Hallucinating Unseen Parts in Dynamic 3D Human Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present WonderHuman to reconstruct dynamic human avatars from a monocular video for high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Previous dynamic human avatar reconstruction methods typically require the input video to have full coverage of the observed human body. However, in daily practice, one typically has access to limited viewpoints, such as monocular front-view videos, making it a cumbersome task for previous methods to reconstruct the unseen parts of the human avatar. To tackle the issue, we present WonderHuman, which leverages 2D generative diffusion model priors to achieve high-quality, photorealistic reconstructions of dynamic human avatars from monocular videos, including accurate rendering of unseen body parts. Our approach introduces a Dual-Space Optimization technique, applying Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) in both canonical and observation spaces to ensure visual consistency and enhance realism in dynamic human reconstruction. Additionally, we present a View Selection strategy and Pose Feature Injection to enforce the consistency between SDS predictions and observed data, ensuring pose-dependent effects and higher fidelity in the reconstructed avatar. In the experiments, our method achieves SOTA performance in producing photorealistic renderings from the given monocular video, particularly for those challenging unseen parts.

      <title>SliderSpace: Decomposing the Visual Capabilities of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SliderSpace, a framework for automatically decomposing the visual capabilities of diffusion models into controllable and human-understandable directions. Unlike existing control methods that require a user to specify attributes for each edit direction individually, SliderSpace discovers multiple interpretable and diverse directions simultaneously from a single text prompt. Each direction is trained as a low-rank adaptor, enabling compositional control and the discovery of surprising possibilities in the model's latent space. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art diffusion models, we demonstrate SliderSpace's effectiveness across three applications: concept decomposition, artistic style exploration, and diversity enhancement. Our quantitative evaluation shows that SliderSpace-discovered directions decompose the visual structure of model's knowledge effectively, offering insights into the latent capabilities encoded within diffusion models. User studies further validate that our method produces more diverse and useful variations compared to baselines. Our code, data and trained weights are available at https://sliderspace.baulab.info</description>

      <title>CK-MPM: A Compact-Kernel Material Point Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Material Point Method (MPM) has become a cornerstone of physics-based simulation, widely used in geomechanics and computer graphics for modeling phenomena such as granular flows, viscoelasticity, fracture mechanics, etc. Despite its versatility, the original MPM suffers from cell-crossing instabilities caused by discontinuities in particle-grid transfer kernels. Existing solutions mostly mitigate these issues by adopting smoother shape functions, but at the cost of increased numerical diffusion and computational overhead due to larger kernel support. In this paper, we propose a novel $C^2$-continuous compact kernel for MPM that achieves a unique balance in terms of stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Our method integrates seamlessly with Affine Particle-In-Cell (APIC) and Moving Least Squares (MLS) MPM, while only doubling the number of grid nodes associated with each particle compared to linear kernels. At its core is an innovative dual-grid framework, which associates particles with grid nodes exclusively within the cells they occupy on two staggered grids, ensuring consistent and stable force computations. We demonstrate that our method can be conveniently implemented using a domain-specific language, Taichi, or based on open-source GPU MPM frameworks, achieving faster runtime and less numerical diffusion compared to quadratic B-spline MPM. Comprehensive validation through unit tests, comparative studies, and stress tests demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in conserving both linear and angular momentum, handling stiff materials, and scaling efficiently for large-scale simulations. Our results highlight the transformative potential of compact, high-order kernels in advancing MPM's capabilities for stable, accurate, and high-performance simulations.</description>

      <title>Learning Cross-hand Policies for High-DOF Reaching and Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reaching-and-grasping is a fundamental skill for robotic manipulation, but existing methods usually train models on a specific gripper and cannot be reused on another gripper. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can learn a unified policy model that can be easily transferred to different dexterous grippers. Our method consists of two stages: a gripper-agnostic policy model that predicts the displacements of pre-defined key points on the gripper, and a gripper-specific adaptation model that translates these displacements into adjustments for controlling the grippers' joints. The gripper state and interactions with objects are captured at the finger level using robust geometric representations, integrated with a transformer-based network to address variations in gripper morphology and geometry. In the experiments, we evaluate our method on several dexterous grippers and diverse objects, and the result shows that our method significantly outperforms the baseline methods. Pioneering the transfer of grasp policies across dexterous grippers, our method effectively demonstrates its potential for learning generalizable and transferable manipulation skills for various robotic hands.</description>
