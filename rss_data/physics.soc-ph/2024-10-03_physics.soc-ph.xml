      <title>What we should learn from pandemic publishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Authors of COVID-19 papers produced during the pandemic were overwhelmingly not subject matter experts. Such a massive inflow of scholars from different expertise areas is both an asset and a potential problem. Domain-informed scientific collaboration is the key to preparing for future crises.</description>

      <title>Fragility of Chess positions: measure, universality and tipping points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel metric to quantify the fragility of chess positions using the interaction graph of pieces. This fragility score $F$ captures the tension within a position and serves as a strong indicator of tipping points in a game. In well-known games, maximum fragility often aligns with decisive moments marked by brilliant moves. Analyzing a large dataset of games, we find that fragility typically peaks around move $15$, with pawns ($\approx 60\%$) and knights ($\approx 20\%$) frequently involved in high-tension positions. Remarkably, average fragility curves show a universal pattern across a wide range of players, games, and openings, with a subtle deviation observed in games played by the engine Stockfish. Our analysis reveals a gradual buildup of fragility starting around $8$ moves before the peak, followed by a prolonged fragile state lasting up to $15$ moves. This suggests a gradual intensification of positional tension leading to decisive moments in the game. These insights offer a valuable tool for both players and engines to assess critical moments in chess.</description>

      <title>Estimating the population-level effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions when transmission rates of COVID-19 vary by orders of magnitude from one contact to another</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical physicists have long studied systems where the variable of interest spans many orders of magnitude, the classic example is the relaxation times of glassy materials, which are often found to follow power laws. A power-law dependence has been found for the probability of transmission of COVID-19, as a function of length of time a susceptible person is in contact with an infected person. This is in data from the United Kingdom's COVID-19 app. The amount of virus in infected people spans many orders of magnitude. Inspired by this I assume that the power-law behaviour found in COVID-19 transmission, is due to the effective transmission rate varying over orders of magnitude from one contact to another. I then use a model from statistical physics to estimate that if a population all wear FFP2/N95 masks, this reduces the effective reproduction number for COVID-19 transmission by a factor of approximately nine.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking, Group Decision Making and Beyond 1. Echo Chambers and Random Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a symmetrical multiple choice individual I build a sociophysics model of decision making. Reducing the choices to two and interactions to pairs recover the Ising model from physics at zero temperature. The associated equilibrium state is a spontaneous symmetry breaking with the whole group sharing a unique choice selected at random. However, my focus departs from physics, which aims at identifying the true equilibrium state discarding any possible impact of the initial conditions, the size of the sample and the used update algorithm. Any memory of the past history is erased. In contrast, I claim that dealing with a social system, the history of the system must be taken into account in identifying the relevant social equilibrium state. Using Monte Carlo simulations I explore the spectrum of non universal equilibrium states of the Ising model at zero temperature. I show that different initial conditions with the same value of the order parameter lead to different equilibrium states. The same applies for different sizes and different update algorithms. The results indicate that in the presence of a social network composed of agents sharing different initial opinions, it is their interactions that lead them to share a unique choice and not their mere membership in the network. This finding sheds a new light on the emergence of echo chambers, which appear to be the end of a dynamical process of opinion update and not its beginning with a preferential attachment. Furthermore, polarization is obtained as a side effect of the random selection of the respective unanimous choices of the various echo chambers within a social community. The study points to social media exchange algorithms, which are purely technical levers independent of the issue and opinions at stake, to tackle polarization by either hindering or accelerating the completion of symmetry breaking between agents.</description>

      <title>Correlation networks: Interdisciplinary approaches beyond thresholding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many empirical networks originate from correlational data, arising in domains as diverse as psychology, neuroscience, genomics, microbiology, finance, and climate science. Specialized algorithms and theory have been developed in different application domains for working with such networks, as well as in statistics, network science, and computer science, often with limited communication between practitioners in different fields. This leaves significant room for cross-pollination across disciplines. A central challenge is that it is not always clear how to best transform correlation matrix data into networks for the application at hand, and probably the most widespread method, i.e., thresholding on the correlation value to create either unweighted or weighted networks, suffers from multiple problems. In this article, we review various methods of constructing and analyzing correlation networks, ranging from thresholding and its improvements to weighted networks, regularization, dynamic correlation networks, threshold-free approaches, comparison with null models, and more. Finally, we propose and discuss recommended practices and a variety of key open questions currently confronting this field.</description>

      <title>Explaining Indian Stock Market through Geometry of Scale free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we model the Indian stock market as heterogenous scale free network, which is then embedded in a two dimensional hyperbolic space through a machine learning based technique called as coalescent embedding. This allows us to apply the hyperbolic kmeans algorithm on the Poincare disc and the clusters so obtained resemble the original network communities more closely than the clusters obtained via Euclidean kmeans on the basis of well-known measures normalised mutual information and adjusted mutual information. Through this, we are able to clearly distinguish between periods of market stability and volatility by applying non-parametric statistical tests with a significance level of 0.05 to geometric measures namely hyperbolic distance and hyperbolic shortest path distance. After that, we are able to spot significant market change early by leveraging the Bollinger Band analysis on the time series of modularity in the embedded networks of each window. Finally, the radial distance and the Equidistance Angular coordinates help in visualizing the embedded network in the Poincare disc and it is seen that specific market sectors cluster together.</description>

      <title>Opinion response functions are key to understanding tipping of social conventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extent to which committed minorities can overturn social conventions is an active area of research in the mathematical modelling of opinion dynamics. Researchers generally use simulations of agent-based models (ABMs) to compute approximate values for the minimum committed minority size needed to overturn a social convention. In this manuscript, we expand on previous work by studying an ABM's mean-field behaviour using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models and a new tool, opinion response functions. Using these methods allows for formal analysis of the deterministic model which can provide a theoretical explanation for observed behaviours, e.g., coexistence or overturning of opinions. In particular, opinion response functions are a method of characterizing the equilibria in our social model. Our analysis confirms earlier numerical results and supplements them with a precise formula for computing the minimum committed minority size required to overturn a social convention.</description>

      <title>Exploring language relations through syntactic distances and geographic proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Languages are grouped into families that share common linguistic traits. While this approach has been successful in understanding genetic relations between diverse languages, more analyses are needed to accurately quantify their relatedness, especially in less studied linguistic levels such as syntax. Here, we explore linguistic distances using series of parts of speech (POS) extracted from the Universal Dependencies dataset. Within an information-theoretic framework, we show that employing POS trigrams maximizes the possibility of capturing syntactic variations while being at the same time compatible with the amount of available data. Linguistic connections are then established by assessing pairwise distances based on the POS distributions. Intriguingly, our analysis reveals definite clusters that correspond to well known language families and groups, with exceptions explained by distinct morphological typologies. Furthermore, we obtain a significant correlation between language similarity and geographic distance, which underscores the influence of spatial proximity on language kinships.</description>

      <title>Strategic Interactions between Large Language Models-based Agents in Beauty Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) presents potential for deeper understanding of human behaviours within game theory frameworks. Addressing research gap on multi-player competitive games, this paper examines the strategic interactions among multiple types of LLM-based agents in a classical beauty contest game. LLM-based agents demonstrate varying depth of reasoning that fall within a range of level-0 to 1, which are lower than experimental results conducted with human subjects, but they do display similar convergence pattern towards Nash Equilibrium (NE) choice in repeated setting. Further, through variation in group composition of agent types, I found environment with lower strategic uncertainty enhances convergence for LLM-based agents, and having a mixed environment comprises of LLM-based agents of differing strategic levels accelerates convergence for all. Higher average payoffs for the more intelligent agents are usually observed, albeit at the expense of less intelligent agents. The results from game play with simulated agents not only convey insights on potential human behaviours under specified experimental set-ups, they also offer valuable understanding of strategic interactions among algorithms.</description>
