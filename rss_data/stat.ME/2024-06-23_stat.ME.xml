      <title>MSmix: An R Package for clustering partial rankings via mixtures of Mallows Models with Spearman distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MSmix is a recently developed R package implementing maximum likelihood estimation of finite mixtures of Mallows models with Spearman distance for full and partial rankings. The package is designed to implement computationally tractable estimation routines of the model parameters, with the ability to handle arbitrary forms of partial rankings and sequences of a large number of items. The frequentist estimation task is accomplished via EM algorithms, integrating data augmentation strategies to recover the unobserved heterogeneity and the missing ranks. The package also provides functionalities for uncertainty quantification of the estimated parameters, via diverse bootstrap methods and asymptotic confidence intervals. Generic methods for S3 class objects are constructed for more effectively managing the output of the main routines. The usefulness of the package and its computational performance compared with competing software is illustrated via applications to both simulated and original real ranking datasets.</description>

      <title>Conditional correlation estimation and serial dependence identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently shown in Jaworski, P., Jelito, D. and Pitera, M. (2024), 'A note on the equivalence between the conditional uncorrelation and the independence of random variables', Electronic Journal of Statistics 18(1), that one can characterise the independence of random variables via the family of conditional correlations on quantile-induced sets. This effectively shows that the localized linear measure of dependence is able to detect any form of nonlinear dependence for appropriately chosen conditioning sets. In this paper, we expand this concept, focusing on the statistical properties of conditional correlation estimators and their potential usage in serial dependence identification. In particular, we show how to estimate conditional correlations in generic and serial dependence setups, discuss key properties of the related estimators, define the conditional equivalent of the autocorrelation function, and provide a series of examples which prove that the proposed framework could be efficiently used in many practical econometric applications.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Linked Files: A Missing Data Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many applications, researchers seek to identify overlapping entities across multiple data files. Record linkage algorithms facilitate this task, in the absence of unique identifiers. As these algorithms rely on semi-identifying information, they may miss records that represent the same entity, or incorrectly link records that do not represent the same entity. Analysis of linked files commonly ignores such linkage errors, resulting in biased, or overly precise estimates of the associations of interest. We view record linkage as a missing data problem, and delineate the linkage mechanisms that underpin analysis methods with linked files. Following the missing data literature, we group these methods under three categories: likelihood and Bayesian methods, imputation methods, and weighting methods. We summarize the assumptions and limitations of the methods, and evaluate their performance in a wide range of simulation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Robust parameter estimation for partially observed second-order diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating parameters of a diffusion process given continuous-time observations of the process via maximum likelihood approaches or, online, via stochastic gradient descent or Kalman filter formulations constitutes a well-established research area. It has also been established previously that these techniques are, in general, not robust to perturbations in the data in the form of temporal correlations. While the subject is relatively well understood and appropriate modifications have been suggested in the context of multi-scale diffusion processes and their reduced model equations, we consider here an alternative setting where a second-order diffusion process in positions and velocities is only observed via its positions. In this note, we propose a simple modification to standard stochastic gradient descent and Kalman filter formulations, which eliminates the arising systematic estimation biases. The modification can be extended to standard maximum likelihood approaches and avoids computation of previously proposed correction terms.</description>

      <title>Consistent community detection in multi-layer networks with heterogeneous differential privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As network data has become increasingly prevalent, a substantial amount of attention has been paid to the privacy issue in publishing network data. One of the critical challenges for data publishers is to preserve the topological structures of the original network while protecting sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a personalized edge flipping mechanism that allows data publishers to protect edge information based on each node's privacy preference. It can achieve differential privacy while preserving the community structure under the multi-layer degree-corrected stochastic block model after appropriately debiasing, and thus consistent community detection in the privatized multi-layer networks is achievable. Theoretically, we establish the consistency of community detection in the privatized multi-layer network and show that better privacy protection of edges can be obtained for a proportion of nodes while allowing other nodes to give up their privacy. Furthermore, the advantage of the proposed personalized edge-flipping mechanism is also supported by its numerical performance on various synthetic networks and a real-life multi-layer network.</description>

      <title>Frank copula is minimum information copula under fixed Kendall's $\tau$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dependence modeling, various copulas have been utilized. Among them, the Frank copula has been one of the most typical choices due to its simplicity. In this work, we demonstrate that the Frank copula is the minimum information copula under fixed Kendall's $\tau$ (MICK), both theoretically and numerically. First, we explain that both MICK and the Frank density follow the hyperbolic Liouville equation. Moreover, we show that the copula density satisfying the Liouville equation is uniquely the Frank copula. Our result asserts that selecting the Frank copula as an appropriate copula model is equivalent to using Kendall's $\tau$ as the sole available information about the true distribution, based on the entropy maximization principle.</description>

      <title>Enhancing reliability in prediction intervals using point forecasters: Heteroscedastic Quantile Regression and Width-Adaptive Conformal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building prediction intervals for time series forecasting problems presents a complex challenge, particularly when relying solely on point predictors, a common scenario for practitioners in the industry. While research has primarily focused on achieving increasingly efficient valid intervals, we argue that, when evaluating a set of intervals, traditional measures alone are insufficient. There are additional crucial characteristics: the intervals must vary in length, with this variation directly linked to the difficulty of the prediction, and the coverage of the interval must remain independent of the difficulty of the prediction for practical utility. We propose the Heteroscedastic Quantile Regression (HQR) model and the Width-Adaptive Conformal Inference (WACI) method, providing theoretical coverage guarantees, to overcome those issues, respectively. The methodologies are evaluated in the context of Electricity Price Forecasting and Wind Power Forecasting, representing complex scenarios in time series forecasting. The results demonstrate that HQR and WACI not only improve or achieve typical measures of validity and efficiency but also successfully fulfil the commonly ignored mentioned characteristics.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Nuisance Parameter Uncertainty on Statistical Inference in Practical Data Science Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For multiple reasons -- such as avoiding overtraining from one data set or because of having received numerical estimates for some parameters in a model from an alternative source -- it is sometimes useful to divide a model's parameters into one group of primary parameters and one group of nuisance parameters. However, uncertainty in the values of nuisance parameters is an inevitable factor that impacts the model's reliability. This paper examines the issue of uncertainty calculation for primary parameters of interest in the presence of nuisance parameters. We illustrate a general procedure on two distinct model forms: 1) the GARCH time series model with univariate nuisance parameter and 2) multiple hidden layer feed-forward neural network models with multivariate nuisance parameters. Leveraging an existing theoretical framework for nuisance parameter uncertainty, we show how to modify the confidence regions for the primary parameters while considering the inherent uncertainty introduced by nuisance parameters. Furthermore, our study validates the practical effectiveness of adjusted confidence regions that properly account for uncertainty in nuisance parameters. Such an adjustment helps data scientists produce results that more honestly reflect the overall uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Inference for Delay Differential Equations Using Manifold-Constrained Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic systems described by differential equations often involve feedback among system components. When there are time delays for components to sense and respond to feedback, delay differential equation (DDE) models are commonly used. This paper considers the problem of inferring unknown system parameters, including the time delays, from noisy and sparse experimental data observed from the system. We propose an extension of manifold-constrained Gaussian processes to conduct parameter inference for DDEs, whereas the time delay parameters have posed a challenge for existing methods that bypass numerical solvers. Our method uses a Bayesian framework to impose a Gaussian process model over the system trajectory, conditioned on the manifold constraint that satisfies the DDEs. For efficient computation, a linear interpolation scheme is developed to approximate the values of the time-delayed system outputs, along with corresponding theoretical error bounds on the approximated derivatives. Two simulation examples, based on Hutchinson's equation and the lac operon system, together with a real-world application using Ontario COVID-19 data, are used to illustrate the efficacy of our method.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Integration in Simple and Complex Simulation Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation studies are used to evaluate and compare the properties of statistical methods in controlled experimental settings. In most cases, performing a simulation study requires knowledge of the true value of the parameter, or estimand, of interest. However, in many simulation designs, the true value of the estimand is difficult to compute analytically. Here, we illustrate the use of Monte Carlo integration to compute true estimand values in simple and complex simulation designs. We provide general pseudocode that can be replicated in any software program of choice to demonstrate key principles in using Monte Carlo integration in two scenarios: a simple three variable simulation where interest lies in the marginally adjusted odds ratio; and a more complex causal mediation analysis where interest lies in the controlled direct effect in the presence of mediator-outcome confounders affected by the exposure. We discuss general strategies that can be used to minimize Monte Carlo error, and to serve as checks on the simulation program to avoid coding errors. R programming code is provided illustrating the application of our pseudocode in these settings.</description>

      <title>On the estimation rate of Bayesian PINN for inverse problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and their inverse problems using Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is a rapidly growing approach in the physics and machine learning community. Although several architectures exist for PINNs that work remarkably in practice, our theoretical understanding of their performances is somewhat limited. In this work, we study the behavior of a Bayesian PINN estimator of the solution of a PDE from $n$ independent noisy measurement of the solution. We focus on a class of equations that are linear in their parameters (with unknown coefficients $\theta_\star$). We show that when the partial differential equation admits a classical solution (say $u_\star$), differentiable to order $\beta$, the mean square error of the Bayesian posterior mean is at least of order $n^{-2\beta/(2\beta + d)}$. Furthermore, we establish a convergence rate of the linear coefficients of $\theta_\star$ depending on the order of the underlying differential operator. Last but not least, our theoretical results are validated through extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Multiscale modelling of animal movement with persistent dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wild animals are commonly fitted with trackers that record their position through time, to learn about their behaviour. Broadly, statistical models for tracking data often fall into two categories: local models focus on describing small-scale movement decisions, and global models capture large-scale spatial distributions. Due to this dichotomy, it is challenging to describe mathematically how animals' distributions arise from their short-term movement patterns, and to combine data sets collected at different scales. We propose a multiscale model of animal movement and space use based on the underdamped Langevin process, widely used in statistical physics. The model is convenient to describe animal movement for three reasons: it is specified in continuous time (such that its parameters are not dependent on an arbitrary time scale), its speed and direction are autocorrelated (similarly to real animal trajectories), and it has a closed form stationary distribution that we can view as a model of long-term space use. We use the common form of a resource selection function for the stationary distribution, to model the environmental drivers behind the animal's movement decisions. We further increase flexibility by allowing movement parameters to be time-varying, e.g., to account for daily cycles in an animal's activity. We formulate the model as a state-space model and present a method of inference based on the Kalman filter. The approach requires discretising the continuous-time process, and we use simulations to investigate performance for various time resolutions of observation. The approach works well at fine resolutions, though the estimated stationary distribution tends to be too flat when time intervals between observations are very long.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Signal Subgraph: An Iterative Screening Approach on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.07683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised learning on graphs is a challenging task due to the high dimensionality and inherent structural dependencies in the data, where each edge depends on a pair of vertices. Existing conventional methods are designed for standard Euclidean data and do not account for the structural information inherent in graphs. In this paper, we propose an iterative vertex screening method to achieve dimension reduction across multiple graph datasets with matched vertex sets and associated graph attributes. Our method aims to identify a signal subgraph to provide a more concise representation of the full graphs, potentially benefiting subsequent vertex classification tasks. The method screens the rows and columns of the adjacency matrix concurrently and stops when the resulting distance correlation is maximized. We establish the theoretical foundation of our method by proving that it estimates the true signal subgraph with high probability. Additionally, we establish the convergence rate of classification error under the Erdos-Renyi random graph model and prove that the subsequent classification can be asymptotically optimal, outperforming the entire graph under high-dimensional conditions. Our method is evaluated on various simulated datasets and real-world human and murine graphs derived from functional and structural magnetic resonance images. The results demonstrate its excellent performance in estimating the ground-truth signal subgraph and achieving superior classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Over-parameterized Models from an Auto-Modeling Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From a model-building perspective, we propose a paradigm shift for fitting over-parameterized models. Philosophically, the mindset is to fit models to future observations rather than to the observed sample. Technically, given an imputation method to generate future observations, we fit over-parameterized models to these future observations by optimizing an approximation of the desired expected loss function based on its sample counterpart and an adaptive $\textit{duality function}$. The required imputation method is also developed using the same estimation technique with an adaptive $m$-out-of-$n$ bootstrap approach. We illustrate its applications with the many-normal-means problem, $n &lt; p$ linear regression, and neural network-based image classification of MNIST digits. The numerical results demonstrate its superior performance across these diverse applications. While primarily expository, the paper conducts an in-depth investigation into the theoretical aspects of the topic. It concludes with remarks on some open problems.</description>

      <title>Small-time approximation of the transition density for diffusions with singularities. Application to the Wright-Fisher model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wright-Fisher (W-F) diffusion model serves as a foundational framework for interpreting population evolution through allele frequency dynamics over time. Despite the known transition probability between consecutive generations, an exact analytical expression for the transition density at arbitrary time intervals remains elusive. Commonly utilized distributions such as Gaussian or Beta inadequately address the fixation issue at extreme allele frequencies (0 or 1), particularly for short periods. In this study, we introduce two alternative parametric functions, namely the Asymptotic Expansion (AE) and the Gaussian approximation (GaussA), derived through probabilistic methodologies, aiming to better approximate this density. The AE function provides a suitable density for allele frequency distributions, encompassing extreme values within the interval [0,1]. Additionally, we outline the range of validity for the GaussA approximation. While our primary focus is on W-F diffusion, we demonstrate how our findings extend to other diffusion models featuring singularities. Through simulations of allele frequencies under a W-F process and employing a recently developed adaptive density estimation method, we conduct a comparative analysis to assess the fit of the proposed densities against the Beta and Gaussian distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the item functioning of multi-item measurement is modeled with three or four-parameter models, parameter estimation may become challenging. Effective algorithms are crucial in such scenarios. This paper explores innovations to parameter estimation in generalized logistic regression models, which may be used in item response modeling to account for guessing/pretending or slipping/dissimulation and for the effect of covariates. We introduce a new implementation of the EM algorithm and propose a new algorithm based on the parametrized link function. The two novel iterative algorithms are compared to existing methods in a simulation study. Additionally, the study examines software implementation, including the specification of initial values for numerical algorithms and asymptotic properties with an estimation of standard errors. Overall, the newly proposed algorithm based on the parametrized link function outperforms other procedures, especially for small sample sizes. Moreover, the newly implemented EM algorithm provides additional information regarding respondents' inclination to guess or pretend and slip or dissimulate when answering the item. The study also discusses applications of the methods in the context of the detection of differential item functioning. Methods are demonstrated using real data from psychological and educational assessments.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modeling of Sparse Longitudinal Data and Functional Snippets With Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse functional/longitudinal data have attracted widespread interest due to the prevalence of such data in social and life sciences. A prominent scenario where such data are routinely encountered are accelerated longitudinal studies, where subjects are enrolled in the study at a random time and are only tracked for a short amount of time relative to the domain of interest. The statistical analysis of such functional snippets is challenging since information for the far-off-diagonal regions of the covariance structure is missing. Our main methodological contribution is to address this challenge by bypassing covariance estimation and instead modeling the underlying process as the solution of a data-adaptive stochastic differential equation. Taking advantage of the interface between Gaussian functional data and stochastic differential equations makes it possible to efficiently reconstruct the target process by estimating its dynamic distribution. The proposed approach allows one to consistently recover forward sample paths from functional snippets at the subject level. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the proposed data-driven stochastic differential equation and derive rates of convergence for the corresponding estimators. The finite-sample performance is demonstrated with simulation studies and functional snippets arising from a growth study and spinal bone mineral density data.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric inference of effective reproduction number dynamics from wastewater pathogen surveillance data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concentrations of pathogen genomes measured in wastewater have recently become available as a new data source to use when modeling the spread of infectious diseases. One promising use for this data source is inference of the effective reproduction number, the average number of individuals a newly infected person will infect. We propose a model where new infections arrive according to a time-varying immigration rate which can be interpreted as an average number of secondary infections produced by one infectious individual per unit time. This model allows us to estimate the effective reproduction number from concentrations of pathogen genomes while avoiding difficult to verify assumptions about the dynamics of the susceptible population. As a byproduct of our primary goal, we also produce a new model for estimating the effective reproduction number from case data using the same framework. We test this modeling framework in an agent-based simulation study with a realistic data generating mechanism which accounts for the time-varying dynamics of pathogen shedding. Finally, we apply our new model to estimating the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in Los Angeles, California, using pathogen RNA concentrations collected from a large wastewater treatment facility.</description>

      <title>Simplifying debiased inference via automatic differentiation and probabilistic programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that simplifies the construction of efficient estimators, making them accessible to a broader audience. 'Dimple' takes as input computer code representing a parameter of interest and outputs an efficient estimator. Unlike standard approaches, it does not require users to derive a functional derivative known as the efficient influence function. Dimple avoids this task by applying automatic differentiation to the statistical functional of interest. Doing so requires expressing this functional as a composition of primitives satisfying a novel differentiability condition. Dimple also uses this composition to determine the nuisances it must estimate. In software, primitives can be implemented independently of one another and reused across different estimation problems. We provide a proof-of-concept Python implementation and showcase through examples how it allows users to go from parameter specification to efficient estimation with just a few lines of code.</description>

      <title>Functional Clustering for Longitudinal Associations between Social Determinants of Health and Stroke Mortality in the US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding longitudinally changing associations between Social determinants of health (SDOH) and stroke mortality is crucial for timely stroke management. Previous studies have revealed a significant regional disparity in the SDOH -- stroke mortality associations. However, they do not develop data-driven methods based on these longitudinal associations for regional division in stroke control. To fill this gap, we propose a novel clustering method for SDOH -- stroke mortality associations in the US counties. To enhance interpretability and statistical efficiency of the clustering outcomes, we introduce a new class of smoothness-sparsity pursued penalties for simultaneous clustering and variable selection in the longitudinal associations. As a result, we can identify important SDOH that contribute to longitudinal changes in the stroke mortality, facilitating clustering of US counties into several regions based on how these SDOH relate to stroke mortality. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies. By applying our method to a county-level SDOH and stroke mortality longitudinal data, we identify 18 important SDOH for stroke mortality and divide the US counties into two clusters based on these selected SDOH. Our findings unveil complex regional heterogeneity in the longitudinal associations between SDOH and stroke mortality, providing valuable insights in region-specific SDOH adjustments for mitigating stroke mortality.</description>

      <title>Change Acceleration and Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:1710.00915v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel sequential change detection problem is proposed, in which the goal is to not only detect but also accelerate the change. Specifically, it is assumed that the sequentially collected observations are responses to treatments selected in real time. The assigned treatments determine the pre-change and post-change distributions of the responses and also influence when the change happens. The goal is to find a treatment assignment rule and a stopping rule that minimize the expected total number of observations subject to a user-specified bound on the false alarm probability. The optimal solution is obtained under a general Markovian change-point model. Moreover, an alternative procedure is proposed, whose applicability is not restricted to Markovian change-point models and whose design requires minimal computation. For a large class of change-point models, the proposed procedure is shown to achieve the optimal performance in an asymptotic sense. Finally, its performance is found in simulation studies to be comparable to the optimal, uniformly with respect to the error probability.</description>

      <title>Contamination Bias in Linear Regressions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.05024v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study regressions with multiple treatments and a set of controls that is flexible enough to purge omitted variable bias. We show that these regressions generally fail to estimate convex averages of heterogeneous treatment effects -- instead, estimates of each treatment's effect are contaminated by non-convex averages of the effects of other treatments. We discuss three estimation approaches that avoid such contamination bias, including the targeting of easiest-to-estimate weighted average effects. A re-analysis of nine empirical applications finds economically and statistically meaningful contamination bias in observational studies; contamination bias in experimental studies is more limited due to smaller variability in propensity scores.</description>

      <title>Radial Neighbors for Provably Accurate Scalable Approximations of Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14692v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In geostatistical problems with massive sample size, Gaussian processes can be approximated using sparse directed acyclic graphs to achieve scalable $O(n)$ computational complexity. In these models, data at each location are typically assumed conditionally dependent on a small set of parents which usually include a subset of the nearest neighbors. These methodologies often exhibit excellent empirical performance, but the lack of theoretical validation leads to unclear guidance in specifying the underlying graphical model and sensitivity to graph choice. We address these issues by introducing radial neighbors Gaussian processes (RadGP), a class of Gaussian processes based on directed acyclic graphs in which directed edges connect every location to all of its neighbors within a predetermined radius. We prove that any radial neighbors Gaussian process can accurately approximate the corresponding unrestricted Gaussian process in Wasserstein-2 distance, with an error rate determined by the approximation radius, the spatial covariance function, and the spatial dispersion of samples. We offer further empirical validation of our approach via applications on simulated and real world data showing excellent performance in both prior and posterior approximations to the original Gaussian process.</description>

      <title>Phylogenetic least squares estimation without genetic distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Least squares estimation of phylogenies is an established family of methods with good statistical properties. State-of-the-art least squares phylogenetic estimation proceeds by first estimating a distance matrix, which is then used to determine the phylogeny by minimizing a squared-error loss function. Here, we develop a method for least squares phylogenetic inference that does not rely on a pre-estimated distance matrix. Our approach allows us to circumvent the typical need to first estimate a distance matrix by forming a new loss function inspired by the phylogenetic likelihood score function; in this manner, inference is not based on a summary statistic of the sequence data, but directly on the sequence data itself. We use a Jukes-Cantor substitution model to show that our method leads to improvements over ordinary least squares phylogenetic inference, and is even observed to rival maximum likelihood estimation in terms of topology estimation efficiency. Using a Kimura 2-parameter model, we show that our method also allows for estimation of the global transition/transversion ratio simultaneously with the phylogeny and its branch lengths. This is impossible to accomplish with any other distance-based method as far as we know. Our developments pave the way for more optimal phylogenetic inference under the least squares framework, particularly in settings under which likelihood-based inference is infeasible, including when one desires to build a phylogeny based on information provided by only a subset of all possible nucleotide substitutions such as synonymous or non-synonymous substitutions.</description>

      <title>Random Pareto front surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of multi-objective optimisation is to identify the Pareto front surface which is the set obtained by connecting the best trade-off points. Typically this surface is computed by evaluating the objectives at different points and then interpolating between the subset of the best evaluated trade-off points. In this work, we propose to parameterise the Pareto front surface using polar coordinates. More precisely, we show that any Pareto front surface can be equivalently represented using a scalar-valued length function which returns the projected length along any positive radial direction. We then use this representation in order to rigorously develop the theory and applications of stochastic Pareto front surfaces. In particular, we derive many Pareto front surface statistics of interest such as the expectation, covariance and quantiles. We then discuss how these can be used in practice within a design of experiments setting, where the goal is to both infer and use the Pareto front surface distribution in order to make effective decisions. Our framework allows for clear uncertainty quantification and we also develop advanced visualisation techniques for this purpose. Finally we discuss the applicability of our ideas within multivariate extreme value theory and illustrate our methodology in a variety of numerical examples, including a case study with a real-world air pollution data set.</description>
