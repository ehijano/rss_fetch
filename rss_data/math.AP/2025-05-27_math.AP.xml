      <title>Inverse dynamic problem for the wave equation with periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse dynamic problem for the wave equation with a potential on an interval $(0,2\pi)$ with periodic boundary conditions. We use a boundary triplet to set up the initial-boundary value problem. As an inverse data we use a response operator (dynamic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map). Using the auxiliary problem on the whole line, we derive equations of the inverse problem. We also establish the relationships between dynamic and spectral inverse data.</description>

      <title>A BKM-type criterion for the Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new BKM-type blow-up criterion for solutions of the incompressible Euler equations that belong to Sobolev or H\" older spaces. Our criterion involves the $L^2$ norm in time of the $L^\infty$ norm of the first order tangential derivatives. Moreover, it applies to various domains such as the full space, the half-space, torus, (in)finite channel, and domains with curved boundaries. Additionally, we provide a mixed criterion involving the $L^1_t L^\infty(\Omega_1)$ norm of the vorticity and the $L^2_t L^\infty(\Omega_2)$ norm of the first order conormal derivatives of the velocity where $\Omega_1 \cup \Omega_2 = \Omega$ is a suitable decomposition of the physical space. Finally, we prove a blow-up criterion for the class of solutions that belong to the Sobolev conormal spaces that is recently constructed in~\cite{AK1}.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Bochner-Riesz Means for Grushin Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of boundedness of the bilinear Bochner-Riesz mean $\mathcal{B}^{\alpha}$ associated with the Grushin operator $\mathcal{L} = -\Delta_{x'} - |x'|^2 \Delta_{x''}$ on $\mathbb{R}^{d_1} \times \mathbb{R}^{d_2}$. We prove that $\mathcal{B}^{\alpha}$ is bounded from $L^{p_1} \times L^{p_2}$ to $L^{p}$ whenever $\alpha &gt; \alpha(p_1, p_2)$, with $1/p=1/p_1+1/p_2$ and $1\leq p_1, p_2 \leq \infty$. We show that our result almost resembles the corresponding Euclidean results, where the Euclidean dimension in the threshold $\alpha(p_1, p_2)$ is replaced by the topological dimension $d=d_1+d_2$ of $\mathbb{R}^{d_1} \times \mathbb{R}^{d_2}$, except at few cases.</description>

      <title>Partial data stability for the inverse fractional conductivity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Calder\'on problem with partial data is known to be log-log stable in some special cases, but even the uniqueness problem is open in general. We study the partial data stability of an analogous inverse fractional conductivity problem on bounded smooth domains. Using the fractional Liouville reduction, we obtain a log-log stability estimate when the conductivities a priori agree in the measurement set and their difference has compact support. In the case in which the conductivities are assumed to agree a priori in the whole exterior of the domain, we obtain a shaper logarithmic stability estimate.</description>

      <title>Desingularization of vortex sheets for the 2D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to regularize vortex sheets by means of smooth, compactly supported vorticities that asymptotically evolve according to the Birkhoff-Rott vortex sheet dynamics. More precisely, consider a vortex sheet initial datum $\omega^0_{\mathrm{sing}}$, which is a signed Radon measure supported on a closed curve. We construct a family of initial vorticities $\omega^0_\varepsilon \in C^\infty_c(\mathbb{R}^2)$ converging to $\omega^0_{\mathrm{sing}}$ distributionally as $\varepsilon \to 0^+$, and show that the corresponding solutions $\omega_\varepsilon(x,t)$ to the 2D incompressible Euler equations converge to the measure defined by the Birkhoff-Rott system with initial datum $\omega^0_{\mathrm{sing}}$. The regularization relies on a layer construction designed to exploit the key observation that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability has a strongly anisotropic effect: while vorticities must be analytic in the "tangential" direction, the way layers can be arranged in the "normal" direction is essentially arbitrary.</description>

      <title>Global Weak Solutions of a Thermodynamically Consistent Diffuse Interface Model for Nonhomogeneous Incompressible Two-phase Flows with a Soluble Surfactant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a thermodynamically consistent diffuse interface model that describes the motion of a two-phase flow of two viscous incompressible Newtonian fluids with unmatched densities and a soluble surfactant in a bounded domain of two or three dimensions. The resulting hydrodynamic system consists of a nonhomogeneous Navier-Stokes system for the (volume averaged) velocity $\mathbf{u}$ and a coupled Cahn-Hilliard system for the phase-field variables $\phi$ and $\psi$ that represent the difference in volume fractions of the binary fluids and the surfactant concentration, respectively. For the initial boundary value problem with physically relevant singular potentials subject to a no-slip boundary condition for the fluid velocity and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for the phase-field variables and the chemical potentials, we first establish the existence of global weak solutions in the case of non-degenerate mobilities based on a suitable semi-implicit time discretization. Next, we prove the existence of global weak solutions for a class of general degenerate mobilities, with the aid of a new type of approximations for both the mobilities and the singular parts of the potential densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a first-order homogenization result for quadratic functionals. In particular, we identify the scaling of the energy and the explicit form of the limiting functional in terms of the first-order correctors. The main novelty of the paper is the use of the dual correspondence between quadratic functionals and PDEs, combined with a refinement of the classical Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma.</description>

      <title>A geometric approximation of non-local interface and boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze an approximation of a Laplacian subject to non-local interface conditions of a $\delta'$-type by Neumann Laplacians on a family of Riemannian manifolds with a sieve-like structure. We establish a (kind of) resolvent convergence for such operators, which in turn implies the convergence of spectra and eigenspaces, and demonstrate convergence of the corresponding semigroups. Moreover, we provide an explicit example of a manifold allowing to realize any prescribed integral kernel appearing in that interface conditions. Finally, we extend the discussion to similar approximations for the Laplacian with non-local Robin-type boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Local asymptotics for singular solutions to critical Hartree equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the qualitative properties of a critical Hartree equation defined on punctured domains.
  Our study has two main objectives: analyzing the asymptotic behavior near isolated singularities and establishing radial symmetry of positive singular solutions.
  First, employing asymptotic analysis, we characterize the local behavior of solutions near the singularity.
  Specifically, we show that, within a punctured ball, solutions behave like the blow-up limit profile.
  This is achieved through classification results for entire bubble solutions, a standard blow-up procedure, and a removable singularity theorem, yielding sharp upper and lower bounds near the origin.
  To run the blow-up analysis, we develop an asymptotic integral version of the moving spheres technique, a technique of independent interest.
  Second, we establish the radial symmetry of blow-up limit solutions using an integral moving spheres method.
  On the technical level, we apply the integral dual method from Jin, Li, Xiong \cite{MR3694645, arxiv:1901.01678} to provide local asymptotic estimates within the punctured ball and to prove that solutions in the entire punctured space are radially symmetric with respect to the origin.
  Our results extend seminal theorems of Caffarelli, Gidas, and Spruck \cite{MR982351} to the setting of Hartree equations.</description>

      <title>Subsonic Euler-Poisson flows with nonzero vorticity in convergent nozzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns subsonic Euler-Poisson flows in a two-dimensional convergent nozzle of finite length. Due to the geometry of the nozzle, we first introduce new variable to prove the existence of radially symmetric subsonic flows to the steady Euler-Poisson system. We then investigate the structural stability of the background subsonic flow under perturbations of suitable boundary conditions, and establish the existence and uniqueness of smooth subsonic Euler-Poisson flows with nonzero vorticity. The solution shares the same regularity for the velocity, the pressure, the entropy and the electric potential. The deformation-curl-Poisson decomposition is utilized to reformulate the steady Euler-Poisson system as a deformation-curl-Poisson system together with several transport equations. The key point lies on the analysis of the well-posedness of the boundary value problem for the associated linearized elliptic system, which is established by using a special structure of the system to derive a priori estimates. The result also indicates that the electric field force in compressible flows can counteract the geometric effects of the convergent nozzle to stabilize certain physical features of the flow.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and nonuniqueness of $p$-harmonic Green functions on weighted $\mathbf{R}^n$ and metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study uniqueness of $p$-harmonic Green functions in domains $\Omega$ in a complete metric space equipped with a doubling measure supporting a $p$-Poincar\'e inequality, with $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. For bounded domains in unweighted $\mathbf{R}^n$, the uniqueness was shown for the $p$-Laplace operator $\Delta_p$ and all $p$ by Kichenassamy--V\'eron (Math. Ann. 275 (1986), 599-615), while for $p=2$ it is an easy consequence of the linearity of the Laplace operator $\Delta$. Beyond that, uniqueness is only known in some particular cases, such as in Ahlfors $p$-regular spaces, as shown by Bonk--Capogna--Zhou (arXiv:2211.11974). When the singularity $x_0$ has positive $p$-capacity, the Green function is a particular multiple of the capacitary potential for $\text{cap}_p(\{x_0\},\Omega)$ and is therefore unique. Here we give a sufficient condition for uniqueness in metric spaces, and provide an example showing that the range of $p$ for which it holds (while $x_0$ has zero $p$-capacity) can be a nondegenerate interval. In the opposite direction, we give the first example showing that uniqueness can fail in metric spaces, even for $p=2$.</description>

      <title>Regularizing effects for an elliptic system of singular equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of two singular semi-linear elliptic equations, patterned after the Schr\"odinger-Maxwell system, is considered. If the reaction term of the first equation contains a datum $f\in L^m$, existence of positive solutions with finite energy is established for suitable ranges of $m$. In particular, the results from the theory of elliptic single equations are improved. At the same time, thanks to an approach based on approximation schemes and a priori estimates on the approximated sequences of solutions, it is shown that the integrability assumptions on the datum produce higher integrability of the solutions.</description>

Abstract: In this article we study the semiclassical asymptotics of the Martinet sub-Laplacian on the flat toroidal cylinder $M = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}^2$. We describe the asymptotic distribution of sequences of eigenfunctions oscillating at different scales prefixed by Rothschild-Stein estimates by the introduction of adapted two-microlocal semiclassical measures. We obtain concentration and invariance properties of these measures in terms of effective dynamics governed by harmonic or an-harmonic oscillators depending on the regime, and we show new weak-dispersive properties with respect to critical points of the eigenvalues of the Montgomery family of quartic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Existence of self-similar solutions for the surface diffusion flow with nonlinear boundary conditions in the half space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Mullins' problem that was proposed by Mullins in 1957 and is one of the models of the thermal grooving by surface diffusion. Mathematically, this is the problem of evolving curves in the half space that is governed by the surface diffusion flow with the contact angle condition and the no-flux condition on the boundary. The no-flux condition is represented as the equation that the first order derivative of the curvature with respect to the arc-length parameter is equal to zero, so that it is the nonlinear boundary condition. For this original Mullins' problem, we show the existence and the uniqueness of the self-similar solution. The self-similar solution is obtained as the mild solution under the smallness assumption on the contact angle and the gradient difference between the solutions to the nonlinear and the linear problems.</description>

      <title>Existence results for Tzitz\'eica equation via topological degree method on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive some existence results for the solutions of the Tzitz\'eica equation
  \begin{equation*}
  -\Delta u + h_1(x)e^{Au} + h_2(x)e^{-Bu}=0
  \end{equation*}
  and the generalized Tzitz\'eica equation
  \begin{equation*}
  -\Delta u + h_1(x)e^{Au}(e^{Au}-1)+h_2(x)e^{-Bu}(e^{-Bu}-1)=0
  \end{equation*}

Our approach involves computing the topological degree and using the connection between the degree and the critical group of an associated functional.</description>

      <title>Forward and inverse problems for a finite Krein-Stieltjes string. Approximation of constant density by point masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic inverse problem for a dynamical system which describes the propagation of waves in a Krein string. The problem is reduced to an integral equation and an important special case is considered when the string density is determined by a finite number of point masses distributed over the interval. We derive an equation of Krein type, with the help of which the string density is restored. We also consider the approximation of constant density by point masses uniformly distributed over the interval and the effect of the appearance of a finite wave propagation velocity in the dynamical system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem for the dynamical system with discrete Schr\"odinger operator and discrete time. As an inverse data we take a \emph{response operator}, the natural analog of the dynamical Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. We derive two types of equations of inverse problem and answer a question on the characterization of the inverse data, i.e. we describe the set of operators, which are \emph{response operators} of the dynamical system governed by the discrete Schr\"odinger operator.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion equations in periodic media: convergence to pulsating fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with reaction-diffusion-advection equations in spatially periodic media. Under an assumption of weak stability of the constant states 0 and 1, and of existence of pulsating traveling fronts connecting them, we show that fronts' profiles appear, along sequences of times and points, in the large-time dynamics of the solutions of the Cauchy problem, whether their initial supports are bounded or unbounded. The types of equations that fit into our assumptions are the combustion and the bistable ones. We also show a generalized Freidlin-G{\"a}rtner formula and other geometrical properties of the asymptotic invasion shapes, or spreading sets, of invading solutions, and we relate these sets to the upper level sets of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Global stability for the compressible isentropic magnetohydrodynamic equations in 3D bounded domains with Navier-slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the global stability of large solutions to the compressible isentropic magnetohydrodynamic equations in a three-dimensional (3D) bounded domain with Navier-slip boundary conditions. It is shown that the solutions converge to an equilibrium state exponentially in the $L^2$-norm provided the density is essentially uniform-in-time bounded from above. Moreover, we also obtain that the density and magnetic field converge to their equilibrium states exponentially in the $L^\infty$-norm if additionally the initial density is bounded away from zero. These greatly improve the previous work in (J. Differential Equations 288 (2021), 1-39), where the authors considered the torus case and required the $L^6$-norm of the magnetic field to be uniformly bounded as well as zero initial total momentum and an additional restriction $2\mu&gt;\lambda$ for the viscous coefficients. This paper provides the first global stability result for large strong solutions of compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations in 3D general bounded domains.</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics for an increasing population of agents. A symmetric continuous agent model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we formulate a continuous opinion model that takes into account population growth, i.e. increase with time in the number of interacting agents $N(t)$. In our setting the population growth is governed by a generic growth rate function $b(t, N(t))$. The two main components of our model are the growth rate $b(t, N(t))$, as well as the opinions of the incoming agents which are modeled in our system as boundary conditions in a free boundary problem. We give results on the well-posedness of the model and results that showcase how these two components affect the long time asymptotic behavior of our system. Moreover, we provide a kinetic (probabilistic) description of our model and give results on well-posedness and asymptotics for the kinetic model.</description>

      <title>Stability properties of solutions to convection-reaction equations with nonlinear diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a convection-reaction-diffusion equation of the form \begin{equation*} u_t=\varepsilon(h(u)u_x)_x-f(u)_x+f'(u), \quad t&gt;0, \end{equation*} with a nonlinear diffusion in a bounded interval of the real line. In particular, we first focus our attention on the existence of stationary solutions with at most one zero inside the interval, studying their behavior with respect to the viscosity coefficient $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and their stability/instability properties. Then, we investigate the large time behavior of the solutions for finite times and the asymptotic regime. We also show numerically that, for a particular class of initial data, the so-called metastable behavior occurs, meaning that the time-dependent solution persists for an exponentially long (with respect to $\varepsilon$) time in a transition non-stable phase, before converging to a stable configuration.</description>

      <title>The stability threshold for 3D MHD equations around Couette with rationally aligned magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a stability threshold problem of the Couette flow $(y,0,0)$ in a uniform magnetic fleld $\alpha(\sigma,0,1)$ with $\sigma\in\mathbb{Q}$ for the 3D MHD equations on $\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$. We obtain the threshold $\gamma=1$ in $H^N(N&gt;13/2)$, hence improving the results in \cite{L20,RZZ25}. The nonlinear inviscid damping for velocity $u^2_{\neq}$ is also established. Moreover, our result shows that the nonzero modes of magnetic field has an amplification of order $\nu^{-1/3}$ even on low regularity, which is very different from the case of $\sigma\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ satisfying a generic Diophantine condition in \cite{L20,RZZ25}.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the helicity conservation of weak solutions for the compressible Euler equations in a bounded domain with general pressure law and vacuum. We deduce a sufficient condition for a weak solution conserving the helicity based on the interior Besov-VMO type regularity, the continuous conditions for velocity and vorticity near the boundary, and some regularities for density near vacuum.</description>

      <title>Global existence and stability of viscous Alfv\'en waves in the large-box limit for MHD systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper rigorously analyzes how the {\it large box limit} fundamentally alters the global existence theory and dynamics behavior of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system with small viscosity/resistivity $(0&lt;\mu\ll 1)$ on periodic domains $Q_L=[-L,L]^3$, in presence of a strong background magnetic field. While the existence of global solutions (viscous Alfv\'en waves) on the whole space $\R^3$ was previously established in \cite{He-Xu-Yu}, such results cannot be expected for general finite periodic domains. We demonstrate that global solutions do exist on the torus $Q_L=[-L,L]^3$ precisely when the domain exceeds a size $L_\mu&gt;e^{\f1\mu}$, providing the first quantitative characterization of the transition to infinite-domain-like behavior.</description>

Abstract: Let $n &gt; 2$, $\gamma &gt; \frac{n-1}{n-2}$, and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove that if $M$ and $N$ are two smooth $n$-manifolds that admit a complete Riemannian metric satisfying
  \[
  -\gamma\Delta + \mathrm{Ric} &gt; \lambda,
  \]
  then the connected sum $M \# N$ also admits such a metric. The construction geometrically resembles a Gromov-Lawson tunnel; the range $ \gamma &gt; \frac{n-1}{n-2} $ is sharp for this to hold.</description>

      <title>SPDEBench: An Extensive Benchmark for Learning Regular and Singular Stochastic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) driven by random noise play a central role in modelling physical processes whose spatio-temporal dynamics can be rough, such as turbulence flows, superconductors, and quantum dynamics. To efficiently model these processes and make predictions, machine learning (ML)-based surrogate models are proposed, with their network architectures incorporating the spatio-temporal roughness in their design. However, it lacks an extensive and unified datasets for SPDE learning; especially, existing datasets do not account for the computational error introduced by noise sampling and the necessary renormalization required for handling singular SPDEs. We thus introduce SPDEBench, which is designed to solve typical SPDEs of physical significance (e.g., the $\Phi^4_d$, wave, incompressible Navier--Stokes, and KdV equations) on 1D or 2D tori driven by white noise via ML methods. New datasets for singular SPDEs based on the renormalization process have been constructed, and novel ML models achieving the best results to date have been proposed. In particular, we investigate the impact of computational error introduced by noise sampling and renormalization on the performance comparison of ML models and highlight the importance of selecting high-quality test data for accurate evaluation. Results are benchmarked with traditional numerical solvers and ML-based models, including FNO, NSPDE and DLR-Net, etc. It is shown that, for singular SPDEs, naively applying ML models on data without specifying the numerical schemes can lead to significant errors and misleading conclusions. Our SPDEBench provides an open-source codebase that ensures full reproducibility of benchmarking across a variety of SPDE datasets while offering the flexibility to incorporate new datasets and machine learning baselines, making it a valuable resource for the community.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate of vanishing viscosity approximations to mean field games with non-separable Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the vanishing viscosity approximation to mean field games (MFGs) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a nonlocal and possibly non-separable Hamiltonian. We prove that the value function converges at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\beta)$, where $\beta^2$ is the diffusivity constant, which matches the classical convergence rate of vanishing viscosity for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations. The same rate is also obtained for the approximation of the distribution of players as well as for the gradient of the value function. The proof is a combination of probabilistic and analytical arguments by first analyzing the forward-backward stochastic differential equation associated with the MFG, and then applying a general stability result for HJ equations. Applications of our result to $N$-player games, mean field control, and policy iteration for solving MFGs are also presented.</description>

      <title>A generalized Riemann problem solver for a hyperbolic model of two-layer thin film flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a second-order generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solver is developed for a two-layer thin film model. Extending the first-order Godunov approach, the solver is used to construct a temporal-spatial coupled second-order GRP-based finite-volume method. Numerical experiments including comparisons to MUSCL finite-volume schemes with Runge-Kutta time stepping confirm the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the higher-order ansatz.
  The construction of GRP methods requires to compute temporal derivatives of intermediate states in the entropy solution of the generalized Riemann problem. These derivatives are obtained from the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions as well as a characteristic decomposition using Riemann invariants. Notably, the latter can be computed explicitly for the two-layer thin film model, which renders this system to be very suitable for the GRP approach. Moreover, it becomes possible to determine the derivatives in an explicit, computationally cheap way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a parabolic Harnack inequality for positive solutions of the $\phi$-heat equation and prove Gaussian upper and lower bounds for the $\phi$-heat kernel on weighted Riemannian manifolds under lower $N$-Ricci curvature bound with $\varepsilon$-range. Building on these results, we demonstrate: The $L^1_\phi$-Liouville theorem for $\phi$-subharmonic functions, $L^1_\phi$-uniqueness property for solutions of the $\phi$-heat equation and lower bounds for eigenvalues of the weighted Laplacian $\Delta_\phi$.
  Furthermore, leveraging the Gaussian upper bound of the weighted heat kernel, we construct a Li-Yau-type gradient estimate for the positive solution of weighted heat equation under a weighted $L^p(\mu)$-norm constraint on $|\nabla\phi|^2$.</description>

      <title>On some coupled local and nonlocal diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study problems in which a local model is coupled with a nonlocal one. We propose two energies: both of them are based on the same classical weighted $H^1$-semi norm to model the local part, while two different weighted $H^s$-semi norms, with $s \in (0,1)$, are used to model the nonlocal part. The corresponding strong formulations are derived. In doing so, one needs to develop some technical tools, such as suitable integration by parts formulas for operators with variable diffusivity, and one also needs to study the mapping properties of the Neumann operators that arise. In contrast to problems coupling purely local models, in which one requires transmission conditions on the interface between the subdomains, the presence of a nonlocal operator may give rise to nonlocal fluxes. These nonlocal fluxes may enter the problem as a source term, thereby changing its structure. Finally, we focus on a specific problem, that we consider most relevant, and study regularity of solutions and finite element discretizations. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the most salient features of the models.</description>

Abstract: We establish an energy quantization for constrained Willmore surfaces, where the constraints are given by area, volume, and total mean curvature, assuming that the underlying conformal structures remain bounded. Furthermore, we show strong compactness of constrained Willmore surfaces under some energy threshold, proving in particular the strong compactness of minimizers of two previously studied problems.</description>

      <title>From one-dimensional diffusion processes metastable behaviour to parabolic equations asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the one-dimensional elliptic operator given by \begin{equation*} (L_\epsilon f)(x) \;=\; b (x) \, f'(x) \,+\, \epsilon\, a (x)\, f''(x) \;, \end{equation*} where the drift $b\colon R \to R$ and the diffusion coefficient $a\colon R \to R$ are periodic $C^1(R)$ functions satisfying further conditions, and $\epsilon&gt;0$. Consider the initial-valued problem \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} &amp; \partial_{t}\,u_{\epsilon}\,=\,L_{\epsilon}\,u_{\epsilon}\;,\\ &amp; u_{\epsilon}(0,\,\cdot)=u_{0}(\cdot)\;, \end{aligned} \right.\end{equation*} for some bounded continuous function $u_{0}$. We prove the existence of time-scales $\theta_{\epsilon}^{(1)},\,\dots,\,\theta_{\epsilon}^{(\mathfrak{q})}$ such that $\theta_{\epsilon}^{(1)}\to\infty$, $\theta_{\epsilon}^{(p+1)}/\theta_{\epsilon}^{(p)}\to\infty$, $1\le p\le\mathfrak{q}-1$, probability measures $p(x,\cdot)$, $x\in R$, and kernels $R_{t}^{(p)}(m_j,m_k)$, where $\{m_j:j\in Z\}$ represents the set of stable equilibrium of the ODE $\dot{x}(t) = b(x(t))$ such that \begin{equation*} \lim_{\epsilon\to0} u_{\epsilon}(t\theta_{\epsilon}^{(p)}, x) \;=\;\sum_{j,k\in Z} p(x,m_j)\, R_{t}^{(p)} (m_j,m_k) \,u_{0}(m_k)\;, \end{equation*} for all $t&gt;0$ and $x\in R$. The solution $u_{\epsilon}$ asymptotic behavior description is completed by the characterisation of its behaviour in the intermediate time-scales $\varrho_{\epsilon}$ such that $\varrho_{\epsilon}/\theta_{\epsilon}^{(p)}\to\infty$, $\varrho_{\epsilon}/\theta_{\epsilon}^{(p+1)}\to0$ for some $0\le p\le\mathfrak{q}$, where $\theta_{\epsilon}^{(0)}=1$, $\theta_{\epsilon}^{(\mathfrak{q}+1)}=+\infty$.
  The proof relies on the analysis of the diffusion $X_\epsilon(\cdot)$ induced by the generator $L_\epsilon$ based on the resolvent approach to metastability introduced in [21].</description>

Abstract: By establishing a sharp Strichartz estimate for the velocity and density, we prove the local well-posedness of solutions for the Cauchy problem of two-dimensional compressible Euler equations, where the initial velocity, density, and specific vorticity $(\bv_0, \rho_0, \varpi_0) \in H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^2)\times H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^2) \times H^2(\mathbb{R}^2), s&gt;\frac{7}{4}$. Our strategy relies on Smith-Tataru's work \cite{ST} for quasi-linear wave equations.</description>

      <title>Effective Boundary Conditions for Heat Equation Arising from Anisotropic and Optimally Aligned Coatings in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the initial boundary value problem for a heat equation in a domain surrounded by a layer. The main features of this problem are twofold: on one hand, the layer is thin compared to the scale of the domain, and on the other hand, the thermal conductivity of the layer is drastically different from that of the bulk; moreover, the bulk is isotropic, but the layer is anisotropic and ``optimally aligned" in the sense that any vector in the layer normal to the interface is an eigenvector of the thermal tensor. We study the effects of the layer by thinking of it as a thickless surface, on which ``effective boundary conditions" (EBCs) are imposed. In the three-dimensional case, we obtain EBCs by investigating the limiting solution of the initial boundary value problem subject to either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions as the thickness of the layer shrinks to zero. These EBCs contain not only the standard boundary conditions but also some nonlocal ones, including the Dirichlet-to-Neumann mapping and the fractional Laplacian. One of the main features of this work is to allow the drastic difference in the thermal conductivity in the normal direction and two tangential directions within the layer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01190v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a kind of degenerate normalized $p$-Laplacian equation with general variable exponents. We establish local $C^{1,\alpha'}$ regularity of viscosity solutions by making use of the compactness argument, scaling techniques and the localized oscillating method. In addition, we also obtain almost optimal pointwise $C^{1,\tau} $ regularity for degenerate free transmission problem related to normalized $ p$-Laplacian. Our argument is based on a new improved oscillation-type estimate combined with a localized analysis.</description>

      <title>On existence of minimizers for weighted $L^p$-Hardy inequalities on $C^{1,\gamma}$-domains with compact boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p \in (1,\infty)$, $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$, and $\Omega\subsetneq \mathbb{R}^N$ be a $C^{1,\gamma}$-domain with a compact boundary $\partial \Omega$, where $\gamma\in (0,1]$. Denote by $\delta_{\Omega}(x)$ the distance of a point $x\in \Omega$ to $\partial \Omega$. Let $\widetilde{W}^{1,p;\alpha}_0(\Omega)$ be the closure of $C_c^{\infty}(\Omega)$ in $\widetilde{W}^{1,p;\alpha}(\Omega)$, where
  $$\widetilde{W}^{1,p;\alpha}(\Omega):= \left\{\varphi \in {W}^{1,p}_{\mathrm{loc}} (\Omega) \mid \left( \| \, |\nabla \varphi \, |\|_{L^p(\Omega;\delta_{\Omega}^{-\alpha})}^p + \|\varphi\|_{L^p(\Omega;\delta_{\Omega}^{-(\alpha+p)})}^p\right)&lt;\infty \!\right\}.$$
  We study the following two variational constants: the weighted Hardy constant \begin{align*}
  H_{\alpha,p}(\Omega): =\!\inf \left\{\int_{\Omega} |\nabla \varphi|^p \delta_{\Omega}^{-\alpha} \mathrm{d}x \biggm| \int_{\Omega} |\varphi|^p \delta_{\Omega}^{-(\alpha+p)} \mathrm{d}x\!=\!1, \varphi \in \widetilde{W}^{1,p;\alpha}_0(\Omega) \right\} , \end{align*}
  and the weighted Hardy constant at infinity \begin{align*} \lambda_{\alpha,p}^{\infty}(\Omega) :=\sup_{K\Subset \Omega}\,
  \inf_{W^{1,p}_{c}(\Omega\setminus \overline{K})} \left\{\int_{\Omega\setminus \overline{K}} |\nabla \varphi|^p \delta_{\Omega}^{-\alpha} \mathrm{d}x \biggm| \int_{\Omega\setminus \overline{K}} |\varphi|^p \delta_{\Omega}^{-(\alpha+p)} \mathrm{d}x=1 \right\}. \end{align*} We show that $H_{\alpha,p}(\Omega)$ is attained if and only if the spectral gap $\Gamma_{\alpha,p}(\Omega):= \lambda_{\alpha,p}^{\infty}(\Omega)-H_{\alpha,p}(\Omega)$ is strictly positive. Moreover, we obtain tight decay estimates for the corresponding minimizers.</description>

      <title>On semipositone problems over $\mathbb{R}^N$ for the fractional $p$-Laplace operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16953v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $N \geq 1, s\in (0,1)$, and $p \in (1, \frac{N}{s})$ we find a positive solution to the following class of semipositone problems associated with the fractional $p$-Laplace operator: \begin{equation}\tag{SP}
  (-\Delta)_{p}^{s}u = g(x)f_a(u) \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^N, \end{equation} where $g \in L^1(\mathbb{R}^N) \cap L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ is a positive function, $a&gt;0$ is a parameter and $f_a \in \mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R})$ is defined as $f_a(t) = f(t)-a$ for $t \ge 0$, $f_a(t) = -a(t+1)$ for $t \in [-1, 0]$, and $f_a(t) = 0$ for $t \le -1$, where $f$ is a non-negative continuous function on $[0,\infty)$ satisfies $f(0)=0$ with subcritical and Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz type growth. Depending on the range of $a$, we obtain the existence of a mountain pass solution to (SP) in $\mathcal{D}^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$. Then, we prove mountain pass solutions are uniformly bounded with respect to $a$, over $L^r(\mathbb{R}^N)$ for every $r \in \left[\frac{Np}{N-sp}, \infty\right]$. In addition, if $p&gt;\frac{2N}{N+2s}$, we establish that (SP) admits a non-negative mountain pass solution for each $a$ near zero. Finally, under the assumption $g(x) \leq \frac{B}{|x|^{\beta(p-1)+sp}}$ for $B&gt;0, x \neq 0$, and $ \beta \in \left(\frac{N-sp}{p-1}, \frac{N}{p-1}\right)$, we derive an explicit positive radial subsolution to (SP) and show that the non-negative solution is positive a.e. in $\mathbb{R}^N$.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of globally H\"{o}lder continuous solutions to certain elliptic partial differential equations with lower-order terms. Our result is applicable to coefficients controlled by a negative power of the distance from the boundary of the domain and significantly improves Theorem 8.30 in Gilbarg and Trudinger (1983). The proof is derived by applying the strategy of Ancona (1986) to a new Morrey-type space.</description>

Abstract: We prove a Kato square root estimate with anisotropically degenerate matrix coefficients. We do so by doing the harmonic analysis using an auxiliary Riemannian metric adapted to the operator. We also derive $L^2$-solvability estimates for boundary value problems for divergence form elliptic equations with matrix degenerate coefficients. Main tools are chain rules and Piola transformations for fields in matrix weighted $L^2$ spaces, under $W^{1,1}$ homeomorphism.</description>

Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem of the defocusing energy-critical stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (SNLS) on the three dimensional torus, forced by an additive noise. We adapt the atomic spaces framework in the context of the energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, and employ probabilistic perturbation arguments in the context of stochastic PDEs, establishing the global well-posedness of the defocusing energy-critical quintic SNLS in the energy space. It is the first global well-posedness result for the periodic SNLS in a critical space.</description>

      <title>On Landis' conjecture for positive Schr\"odinger operators on graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we study the Landis conjecture for positive Schr\"odin\-ger operators on graphs. More precisely, we prove a Landis-type result in the form of a decay criterion that ensures when $\mathcal{H}$-harmonic functions for a positive Schr\"odinger operator $\mathcal{H}$ with potentials bounded from above by $ 1 $ are trivial. The positivity assumption on the operator allows us to impose slow decay across the entire graph, while requiring fast decay in only one direction, rather than throughout the whole graph. We then specifically look at the special cases of $ \mathbb{Z}^{d} $ and regular trees for which we get a explicit decay criterion. Moreover, we consider the fractional analogue of the Landis conjecture on $ \mathbb{Z}^{d} $. Our approach relies on the discrete version of Liouville comparison principle which is also proved in this article.</description>

      <title>Attaining the optimal constant for higher-order Sobolev inequalities on manifolds via asymptotic analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$, and $k\geq 1$ an integer such that $n&gt;2k$. We show that there exists $B_0&gt;0$ such that for all $u \in H^{k}(M)$, \[\|u\|_{L^{2^\sharp}(M)}^2 \leq K_0^2 \int_M |\Delta_g^{k/2} u|^2 \,dv_g + B_0 \|u\|_{H^{k-1}(M)}^2,\] where $2^\sharp = \frac{2n}{n-2k}$ and $\Delta_g = -\operatorname{div}_g(\nabla\cdot)$. Here $K_0$ is the optimal constant for the Euclidean Sobolev inequality $\big(\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |u|^{2^\sharp}\big)^{2/2^\sharp} \leq K_0^2 \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |\nabla^k u|^2$ for all $u \in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$. This result is proved as a consequence of the pointwise blow-up analysis for a sequence of positive solutions $(u_\alpha)_\alpha$ to polyharmonic critical non-linear equations of the form $(\Delta_g + \alpha)^k u = u^{2^\sharp-1}$ in $M$. We obtain a pointwise description of $u_\alpha$, with explicit dependence in $\alpha$ as $\alpha\to \infty$.</description>

When $k=\frac4n$, problem $(E)$ only has the solutions with the form $$u_{\tilde x,t}(x)=\beta_n \Big(\frac{t}{t^2+|x-\tilde x|^2)}\Big)^{\frac{n}{2}}\quad \text{ for any $t&gt;0$, $\tilde x\in\mathbb{R}^n$},$$ where $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $\beta_n=2^{\frac n2} e^{\frac n2\psi(\frac n2) }&gt;0$. When $k\in(0,+\infty)\setminus\{\frac 4n\}$, problem $(E)$ has no any positive solution.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We refine the understanding of continuous dependence on coefficients of solution operators under the nonlocal $H$-topology viz Schur topology in the setting of evolutionary equations in the sense of Picard. We show that certain components of the solution operators converge strongly. The weak convergence behaviour known from homogenisation problems for ordinary differential equations is recovered on the other solution operator components. The results are underpinned by a rich class of examples that, in turn, are also treated numerically, suggesting a certain sharpness of the theoretical findings. Analytic treatment of an example that proves this sharpness is provided too. Even though all the considered examples contain local coefficients, the main theorems and structural insights are of operator-theoretic nature and, thus, also applicable to nonlocal coefficients. The main advantage of the problem class considered is that they contain mixtures of type, potentially highly oscillating between different types of PDEs; a prototype can be found in Maxwell's equations highly oscillating between the classical equations and corresponding eddy current approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the problem of moisture propagation in porous media with a nonlinear relation between the mass flux and the pressure gradient as a counterpart of the Darcy law exhibits the property of bounded speed of propagation even in the case of a hysteresis relation between the capillary pressure and the moisture content. The paper specifies conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions, and provides an upper bound for the moisture propagation speed.</description>

      <title>Removable singularity of (-1)-homogeneous solutions of stationary Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the removable singularity problem for $(-1)$-homogeneous solutions of the three-dimensional incompressible stationary Navier-Stokes equations with singular rays. We prove that any local $(-1)$-homogeneous solution $u$ near a potential singular ray from the origin, which passes through a point $P$ on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$, can be smoothly extended across $P$ on $\mathbb{S}^2$, provided that $u=o(\ln \text{dist} (x, P))$ on $\mathbb{S}^2$. The result is optimal in the sense that for any $\alpha&gt;0$, there exists a local $(-1)$-homogeneous solution near $P$ on $\mathbb{S}^2$, such that $\lim_{x\in \mathbb{S}^2, x\to P}|u(x)|/\ln |x'|=-\alpha$. Furthermore, we discuss the behavior of isolated singularities of $(-1)$-homogeneous solutions and provide examples from the literature that exhibit varying behaviors. We also present an existence result of solutions with any finite number of singular points located anywhere on $\mathbb{S}^2$.</description>

      <title>On the Resolution of Partial Differential Equations for Lattice Structures on Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the embedding of lattice structures $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ into smooth manifolds $M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ through a rigorous mathematical framework. Building upon the foundational results established in "Embedding of a Discrete Lattice Structure in a Smooth Manifold," this work investigates the existence and solvability of partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the embedding process. The primary aim is to derive and analyze solutions to these PDEs while preserving the geometric and topological properties of $L$ and $M$.
  The solutions are shown to exist under initial boundary conditions, with the geometric structure of $M$ and the discrete topology of $L$ playing crucial roles in ensuring well-posedness and regularity.
  This paper provides a detailed exposition of the mathematical interplay between discrete and continuous spaces, offering novel insights into embedding theory and the geometry of manifolds interacting with discrete substructures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear time-asymptotic stability of the composite wave consisting of two viscous shocks and a viscous contact discontinuity for the one-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations. Specifically, we establish that if the composite wave strength and the perturbations are sufficiently small, the NSF system admits a unique global-in-time strong solution, which converges uniformly in space as time tends to infinity, towards the corresponding composite wave, up to dynamical shifts in the positions of the two viscous shocks. Notably, the strengths of the two viscous shocks can be chosen independently. Our proof relies upon the $a$-contraction method with time-dependent shifts and suitable weight functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and multiplicity of weak solutions to problems involving a superposition operator of the type $$\int_{[0, 1]}(- \Delta)^s u d \mu(s),$$ for a signed measure $\mu$ on the interval of fractional exponents $[0,1]$, when the nonlinearity is subcritical and asymptotically linear at infinity; thus, we deal with a perturbation of the eigenvalue problem for the superposition operator. We use variational tools, extending to this setting well-known results for the classical and the fractional Laplace operators.</description>

      <title>Linear damping estimates for periodic roll wave solutions of the inviscid Saint Venant equations and related systems of hyperbolic balance laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Substantially extending previous results of the authors for smooth solutions in the viscous case, we develop linear damping estimates for periodic roll-wave solutions of the inviscid Saint Venant equations and related systems of hyperbolic balance laws. Such damping estimates, consisting of $H^s$ energy estimates yielding exponential slaving of high-derivative to low-derivative norms, have served as crucial ingredients in nonlinear stability analyses of traveling waves in hyperbolic or partially parabolic systems, both in obtaining high-frequency resolvent estimates and in closing a nonlinear iteration for which available linearized stability estimates apparently lose regularity. Here, we establish for systems of size $n\leq 6$ a Lyapunov-type theorem stating that such energy estimates are available whenever strict high-frequency spectral stability holds; for dimensions 7 and higher, there may be in general a gap between high-frequency spectral stability and existence of the type of energy estimate that we develop here. A key ingredient is a dimension-dependent linear algebraic lemma reminiscent of Lyapunov's Lemma for ODE that is to our knowledge new.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider $2\times 2$ matrix-valued pseudodifferential equations in which the two characteristic sets intersect with finite contact order. We show that the asymptotic behavior of its solution changes dramatically before and after the crossing point, and provide a precise asymptotic formula. This is a generalization of the previous results for matrix-valued Schr\"odinger operators and Landau-Zener models. The proof relies on a normal form reduction and a detailed analysis of a simple first-order system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper provides symmetry results for a class of overdetermined problems of elliptic and parabolic type in multi-phase settings, including various extensions of remarkable results obtained by S. Sakaguchi in [12, 13]. A new alternative approach to proving this type of results is presented, leveraging the weak formulation of the problem. The resulting proofs are direct and elegant, and bring several benefits, including extensions to multi-phase settings (possibly with infinitely many phases) and generalizations to rough interfaces.</description>

      <title>Determining evolutionary equations by a single passive boundary observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive study of inverse boundary problems for evolutionary equations with a single passive boundary observation, focusing on hyperbolic and parabolic equations. We establish unique identifiability results for simultaneously determining several key parameters, including the wave/diffusion speed $c$, causal sources $f$ and $h$, and conductivity tensor $\sigma$, under generic conditions. As a central application, we provide a complete resolution to the joint reconstruction problem in thermoacoustic and photoacoustic tomography (TAT/PAT), proving for the first time that both the initial pressure distribution $f$ and the heterogeneous sound speed $c$ can be uniquely and simultaneously determined from just a single, passive, partial boundary observation. We develop a novel, state-of-the-art framework that exploits the full spectral content of the wave field, combining both low-frequency and high-frequency asymptotics. Our approach avoids artificial decoupling assumptions and extends to general domain geometries and general evolutionary equations. This result resolves a long-standing open problem in coupled-physics imaging and provides a rigorous mathematical framework for addressing similar inverse problems in more sophisticated evolutionary setups.</description>

      <title>Solutions of Second Order Schr\"odinger Wave Equations Near Static Black Holes and Strong Singularities of the Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a linear Schr\"odinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$ with a strongly singular potential $V$ not bounded from below on a non-compact incomplete Riemannian manifold $M$. We assume that the negative part of potential $V_{-}$ is measurable, and it does not necessarily belong to either local Kato or Stummel classes, and we define new geometric conditions on the growth of $V_{-}$ in a special $\textit{range control neighborhood (RCN)}$ such that $H$ is semibounded from below on functions compactly supported in these neighborhoods. We define RCN by means of $\textit{an inner time metric}$ which estimates the minimal time for a classical particle to travel between any two points on $M$, and we assume that $M$ is complete w.r.t. this metric, i.e. the potential $V$ is classically complete on $M$. For the corresponding Cauchy problem of the wave equation $u_{tt} + Hu = 0$, we define locally a Lorentzian metric such that its light cone is formed along the minimizing curves with respect to the inner time metric, where both an energy inequality and uniqueness of solutions hold. Inversely, for well-known Lorentzian metrics of static black holes - Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, and de Sitter metrics - we study the wave equations for the corresponding Schr\"odinger operators, and we show that the event horizons of these black holes belong to the RCNs of infinity w.r.t. the inner time metrics, and that all solutions of the mixed problems stay in these neighborhoods indefinitely long.</description>

Abstract: We prove the interior and global Lipschitz regularity results for a solution of fully nonlinear equations with $(p,q)$-growth. We prove that for a small gap $q-p$, a solution is locally or globally Lipschitz continuous. We also prove that a given H\"older continuous solution is Lipschitz continuous under improved bounds for the gap. These gap conditions are similar to those required for the regularity of double phase problems in divergence form.</description>

Abstract: This work focuses on the nonhomogeneous nonlocal double phase problem \begin{align*}
  L_au(x)=f(x,u,D_s^p u, D_{a,t}^q u) \text{ in } \Omega, \end{align*} where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary, $0&lt;s,t&lt;1&lt;p\leq q&lt;\infty$ with $tq\leq sp$ and the operator $L_a$ is defined as \begin{align*}
  L_a u(x)&amp;=2\operatorname{P.V.}\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p-2}(u(x)-u(y))K_{s,p}(x,y)

In addition, the local boundedness of weak solutions in some special cases on $f$ is also obtained using the notion of De Giorgi classes.</description>

      <title>Large-scale behaviour of Sobolev functions in Ahlfors regular metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the behaviour at infinity of $p$-Sobolev functions in the setting of Ahlfors $Q$-regular metric measure spaces supporting a $p$-Poincar\'e inequality. By introducing the notions of sets which are $p$-thin at infinity, we show that functions in the homogeneous space $\dot N^{1,p}(X)$ necessarily have limits at infinity outside of $p$-thin sets, when $1\le p&lt;Q&lt;+\infty$. When $p&gt;Q$, we show by example that uniqueness of limits at infinity may fail for functions in $\dot N^{1,p}(X)$. While functions in $\dot N^{1,p}(X)$ may not have any reasonable limit at infinity when $p=Q$, we introduce the notion of a $Q$-thick set at infinity, and characterize the limits of functions in $\dot N^{1,Q}(X)$ along infinite curves in terms of limits outside $Q$-thin sets and along $Q$-thick sets. By weakening the notion of a thick set, we show that a function in $\dot N^{1,Q}(X)$ with a limit along such an almost thick set may fail to have a limit along any infinite curve. While homogeneous $p$-Sobolev functions may have infinite limits at infinity when $p\ge Q$, we provide bounds on how quickly such functions may grow: when $p=Q$, functions in $\dot N^{1,p}(X)$ have sub-logarithmic growth at infinity, whereas when $p&gt;Q$, such functions have growth at infinity controlled by $d(\cdot, O)^{1-Q/p}$, where $O$ is a fixed base point in $X$. For the inhomogeneous spaces $N^{1,p}(X)$, the phenomenon is different. We show that for $1\le p\le Q$, the limit of a function $u\in N^{1,p}(X)$ is zero outside of a $p$-thin set, whereas $\lim_{x\to+\infty}u(x)=0$ for all $u\in N^{1,p}(X)$ when $p&gt;Q$.</description>

      <title>On the past maximal development of near-FLRW data for the Einstein scalar-field Vlasov system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the maximal globally hyperbolic development of near-FLRW initial data for the Einstein scalar-field Vlasov system exhibits stable Big Bang formation in the collapsing direction. The solutions exhibit stable Kretschmann scalar blow-up, causing the spacetime to become causally geodesically past incomplete, and are asymptotically velocity term dominated. This is the first stability result for the Einstein equations in the collapsing spacetime direction in presence of Vlasov matter that does not rely on any symmetry assumptions. Furthermore, the Vlasov distribution remains close to that of the FLRW solution as a function on the co-mass shell, and so does its momentum support if one assumes it to be close to that of the FLRW distribution initially. On the other hand, the leading order terms in components of the Vlasov energy-momentum tensor exbihit an offset in asymptotic order controlled by the perturbation size, and when viewed on the mass shell, the distribution asymptotically concentrates in certain preferred velocity directions. To ensure that this behaviour is sufficiently mitigated by the scalar field, we crucially exploit a scaling hierarchy between horizontal and vertical derivatives in the commuted Vlasov equation.</description>

Abstract: We consider a volume preserving curvature evolution of surfaces in an asymptotically Euclidean initial data set with positive ADM-energy. The speed is given by a nonlinear function of the mean curvature which generalizes the spacetime mean curvature recently considered by Cederbaum-Sakovich (Calc. Var. PDE, 2021). Following a classical approach by Huisken-Yau (Invent. Math., 1996), we show that the flow starting from suitably round initial surfaces exists for all times and converges to a constant (spacetime) curvature limit. This provides an alternative construction of the CSTMC foliation by Cederbaum-Sakovich and has applications in the definition of center of mass of an isolated system in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>The uniqueness of Poincar\'e type constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a smooth divisor on a closed K\"ahler manifold $X$. First, we prove that Poincar\'e type constant scalar curvature K\"ahler (cscK) metric with a singularity at $D$ is unique up to a holomorphic transformation on $X$ that preserves $D$, if there are no nontrivial holomorphic vector fields on $D$. For the general case, we propose a conjecture relating the uniqueness of Poincar\'e type cscK metric to its asymptotic behavior near $D$. We give an affirmative answer to this conjecture for those Poincar\'e type cscK metrics whose asymptotic behavior is invariant under any holomorphic transformation of $X$ that preserve $D$. We also show that this conjecture can be reduced to a fixed point problem.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for the focusing $\Phi^4$-measure in the infinite volume limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of the focusing $\Phi^4$-measure on the one-dimensional torus in the infinite volume limit. This measure is an invariant Gibbs measure for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. It had previously been shown by B. Rider that the measure is strongly concentrated around a family of minimizers of the Hamiltonian associated with the measure. These exhibit increasingly sharp spatial concentration, resulting in a trivial limit to first order. We study the fluctuations around this soliton manifold. We show that the scaled field under the Gibbs measure converges to white noise in the limit, identifying the next order fluctuations predicted by B. Rider.</description>

      <title>Bulk-edge correspondence in finite photonic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the bulk-edge correspondence principle for finite two-dimensional photonic structures. Specifically, we focus on the divergence-form operator with periodic coefficients and prove the equality between the well-known gap Chern number (the bulk invariant) and an edge index defined via a trace formula for the operator restricted to a finite domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We demonstrate that the edge index characterizes the circulation of electromagnetic energy along the system's boundary, and the BEC principle is a consequence of energy conservation. The proof leverages Green function techniques and can be extended to other systems. These results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for designing robust topological photonic devices with finite geometries, complementing recent advances in discrete models.</description>

      <title>The multilinear fractional sparse operator theory II: refining weighted estimates via multilinear fractional sparse forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17300v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper refines the main results from our previous study on sparse bounds of generalized commutators of multilinear fractional singular integral operators in \cite{CenSong2412}. The key improvements are: 1. We replace pointwise domination with the $(m+1)$-linear fractional sparse form ${\mathcal A}_{\eta,\mathcal{S},\tau,{\vec{r}},s'}^\mathbf{b,k,t}$, advancing the vector-valued multilinear fractional sparse form domination principle, and relax conditions from multilinear weak type boundedness to multilinear locally weak type boundedness $W_{\vec{p}, q}(X)$. 2. We introduce a multilinear fractional $\vec{r}$-type maximal operator $\mathscr{M}_{\eta,\vec{r}}$ and develop a new class of weights $A_{(\vec{p},q),(\vec{r}, s)}(X)$ to characterize it, establishing norm equivalence with the sparse forms. 3. This norm equivalence provides sharp quantitative weighted estimates for $(m+1)$-linear fractional sparse form, removing exponent parameter limitations and achieving sharp operator norm bounds. 4. We demonstrate applications in two ways:
  (1) Providing sharp or Bloom type estimates for generalized commutators of multilinear fractional Calder\'on--Zygmund operators and multilinear fractional rough singular integral operators.
  (2) Investigating sparse form type weighted Lebesgue $L^p(\omega)$ and weighted Sobolev $W^{s,p}(\omega)$ regularity estimates for solutions of fractional Laplacian equations with higher-order commutators.</description>

      <title>Multi-Step Consistency Models: Fast Generation with Theoretical Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consistency models have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional SDE-based diffusion models. They offer a significant acceleration in generation by producing high-quality samples in very few steps. Despite their empirical success, a proper theoretic justification for their speed-up is still lacking. In this work, we address the gap by providing a theoretical analysis of consistency models capable of mapping inputs at a given time to arbitrary points along the reverse trajectory. We show that one can achieve a KL divergence of order $ O(\varepsilon^2) $ using only $ O\left(\log\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\right) $ iterations with a constant step size. Additionally, under minimal assumptions on the data distribution (non smooth case) an increasingly common setting in recent diffusion model analyses we show that a similar KL convergence guarantee can be obtained, with the number of steps scaling as $ O\left(d \log\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\right) $. Going further, we also provide a theoretical analysis for estimation of such consistency models, concluding that accurate learning is feasible using small discretization steps, both in smooth and non-smooth settings. Notably, our results for the non-smooth case yield best in class convergence rates compared to existing SDE or ODE based analyses under minimal assumptions.</description>
