      <title>Analyzing Player Involvement in the Indian Pro Kabaddi League: A Network Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to apply network analysis to all players who have participated in the Indian Pro Kabaddi League since its inception. The Kabaddi network has been constructed based on the number of teams and players they have played with. The players have been ranked with the help of the degree and PageRank algorithm. Small-world phenomenon is observed in the Kabaddi network. The significance of the player performance has been compared with the player rank received by the network analysis.</description>

      <title>A District level Flood Severity Index for India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: India is one of the worst affected countries in the world in terms of fatalities and economic damage due to natural disasters, particularly floods. For planning flood mitigating and relief measures, granular historical information on a pan-India basis is required, which has been missing. Through recent efforts, a few national scale datasets have been created, but they lack the requisite information on fatalities and damages, which has limited the ability to develop a flood severity index. This paper describes the development of the India Flood Inventory with Impacts (IFI-Impacts) database, which contains death and damage statistics, and combines population and historically flooded area information sourced from a national hydrologic-hydrodynamic modeling system. We also propose a novel District Flood Severity Index (DFSI), which accounts for the historical severity of floods in India based on the number of people they have affected and the spread and duration of such floods. Districts being the administrative units of the government, this novel index fulfills a major need and gap in currently available flood management tools. The dataset as well as the index is expected to significantly advance disaster preparedness towards floods in the country. DFSI can be improved further by collecting and incorporating additional variables, e.g., economic losses and by improving the reliability/robustness of the data of other variables. Based on DFSI, actions need to be addressed to mitigate flood damages, beginning with the districts with the high DFSI values.</description>

      <title>Cohesive urban bicycle infrastructure design through optimal transport routing in multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bicycle infrastructure networks must meet the needs of cyclists to position cycling as a viable transportation choice in cities. In particular, protected infrastructure should be planned cohesively for the whole city and spacious enough to accommodate all cyclists safely and prevent cyclist congestion -- a common problem in cycling cities like Copenhagen. Here, we devise an adaptive method for optimal bicycle network design and for evaluating congestion criticalities on bicycle paths. The method goes beyond static network measures, using computationally efficient adaptation rules inspired by Optimal Transport on the dynamically updating multilayer network of roads and protected bicycle lanes. Street capacities and cyclist flows reciprocally control each other to optimally accommodate cyclists on streets with one control parameter that dictates the preference of bicycle infrastructure over roads. Applying our method to Copenhagen confirms that the city's bicycle network is generally well-developed. However, we are able to identify the network's bottlenecks, and we find, at a finer scale, disparities in network accessibility and criticalities between different neighborhoods. Our model and results are generalizable beyond this particular case study to serve as a scalable and versatile tool for aiding urban planners in designing cycling-friendly cities.</description>

      <title>City size distributions are driven by each generation's stay-vs-leave decision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout history most young adults have chosen to live where their parents did while a smaller number moved away. This is sufficient, by proof and simulation, to account for the well-known power law distributions of city sizes. The model needs only two parameters, $r$ = the probability that a child stays, and the maximum number of cities (which models the observed saturation at high city rank). The power law exponent follows directly as $\alpha = 1 + 1/r$, with Zipf's Law simply the limiting case as $r \rightarrow 1$. Observed exponents $(\alpha = 2.2 \pm 0.4, n = 158)$ are consistent with stay-or-leave data from large genealogic studies. This model is self-initializing and could have applied from the time of the earliest stable settlements. The driving narrative behind city-size distributions is fundamentally about family ties, familiarity, and risk-avoidance, rather than economic optimization.</description>

      <title>Functional reducibility of higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical complex systems are widely assumed to be characterized not only by pairwise interactions, but also by higher-order (group) interactions that affect collective phenomena, from metabolic reactions to epidemics. Nevertheless, higher-order networks' superior descriptive power -- compared to classical pairwise networks -- comes with a much increased model complexity and computational cost. Consequently, it is of paramount importance to establish a quantitative method to determine when such a modeling framework is advantageous with respect to pairwise models, and to which extent it provides a parsimonious description of empirical systems. Here, we propose a principled method, based on information compression, to analyze the reducibility of higher-order networks to lower-order interactions, by identifying redundancies in diffusion processes while preserving the relevant functional information. The analysis of a broad spectrum of empirical systems shows that, although some networks contain non-compressible group interactions, others can be effectively approximated by lower-order interactions -- some technological and biological systems even just by pairwise interactions. More generally, our findings mark a significant step towards minimizing the dimensionality of models for complex systems</description>

      <title>Bounded-Confidence Models of Opinion Dynamics with Adaptive Confidence Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People's opinions change with time as they interact with each other. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, individuals (which are represented by the nodes of a network) have continuous-valued opinions and are influenced by neighboring nodes whose opinions are sufficiently similar to theirs (i.e., are within a confidence bound). In this paper, we formulate and analyze discrete-time BCMs with heterogeneous and adaptive confidence bounds. We introduce two new models: (1) a BCM with synchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Hegselmann--Krause (HK) model and (2) a BCM with asynchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Deffuant--Weisbuch (DW) model. We analytically and numerically explore our adaptive BCMs' limiting behaviors, including the confidence-bound dynamics, the formation of clusters of nodes with similar opinions, and the time evolution of an "effective graph", which is a time-dependent subgraph of a network with edges between nodes that {are currently receptive to each other.} For a variety of networks and a wide range of values of the parameters that control the increase and decrease of confidence bounds, we demonstrate numerically that our adaptive BCMs result in fewer major opinion clusters and longer convergence times than the baseline (i.e., nonadaptive) BCMs. We also show that our adaptive BCMs can have adjacent nodes that converge to the same opinion but are not {receptive to each other.} This qualitative behavior does not occur in the associated baseline BCMs.</description>

      <title>New Trends on the Systems Approach to Modeling SARS-CoV-2 Pandemics in a Globally Connected Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a critical analysis of the literature and perspective research ideas for modeling the epidemics caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It goes beyond deterministic population dynamics to consider several key complexity features of the system under consideration. In particular, the multiscale features of the dynamics from contagion to the subsequent dynamics of competition between the immune system and the proliferating virus. Other topics addressed in this work include the propagation of epidemics in a territory, taking into account local transportation networks, the heterogeneity of the population, and the study of social and economic problems in populations involved in the spread of epidemics. The overall content aims to show how new mathematical tools can be developed to address the above topics and how mathematical models and simulations can contribute to the decision making of crisis managers.</description>
