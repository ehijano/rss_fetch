      <title>Influence of Dimensionality of Carbon-based Additives on Thermoelectric Transport Parameters in Polymer Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the thermoelectric properties of solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) containing lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI) salts, along with carbon-based additives of various dimensionalities. Increasing salt concentration leads to higher Seebeck coefficients as a result of the increasing number of free charge carriers and additional, superimposed effects by ion-ion and ion-polymer interactions. NaTFSI-based electrolytes exhibit negative Seebeck coefficients (up to $S = -1.5\,\mathrm{mV\,K^{-1}}$), indicating dominant mobility of $\mathrm{TFSI^-}$ ions. Quasi-one-dimensional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) increase the Seebeck coefficient by a factor of 3. Planar, two-dimensional graphite flakes (GF) moderately enhance it, affecting $\mathrm{Na^+}$ and $\mathrm{TFSI^-}$ ion mobilities and electronic conductivity. Bulky, three-dimensional carbon black (CB) additives induce a unique behavior where the sign of the Seebeck coefficient changes with temperature, presumably due to interaction with $\mathrm{TFSI^-}$ ions within the CB structure. Changes in activation energy and Vogel temperature with salt concentration suggest structural and mechanical modifications in the polymer matrix. The choice of carbon-based additives and salt concentration significantly influences the thermoelectric properties of SPEs thermoelectric properties, providing insights into their potential for thermoelectric applications. Sodium-based electrolytes emerge as promising, sustainable alternatives to lithium-based systems, aligning with sustainable energy research demands.</description>

      <title>Microwave photonic transversal filters based on microcombs with feedback control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback control plays a crucial role in improving system accuracy and stability for a variety of scientific and engineering applications. Here, we theoretically and experimentally investigate the implementation of feedback control in microwave photonic (MWP) transversal filter systems based on optical microcomb sources, which offer advantages in achieving highly reconfigurable processing functions without requiring changes to hardware. We propose four different feedback control methods including (1) one stage spectral power reshaping, (2) one stage impulse response reshaping, (3) two stage spectral power reshaping, and (4) two stage synergic spectral power reshaping and impulse response reshaping. We experimentally implement these feedback control methods and compare their performance. The results show that the feedback control can significantly improve not only the accuracy of comb line shaping as well as temporal signal processing and spectral filtering, but also the systems long term stability. Finally, we discuss the current limitations and future prospects for optimizing feedback control in microcomb based MWP transversal filter systems implemented by both discrete components and integrated chips. Our results provide a comprehensive guide for the implementation of feedback control in microcomb based MWP filter systems in order to improve their performance for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Dual-polarization RF Channelizer Based on Kerr Soliton Microcomb Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a dual-polarization radio frequency (RF) channelizer based on microcombs. With the tailored mismatch between the FSRs of the active and passive MRRs, wideband RF spectra can be channelized into multiple segments featuring digital compatible bandwidths via the Vernier effect. Due to the use of dual polarization states, the number of channelized spectral segments, and thus the RF instantaneous bandwidth (with a certain spectral resolution), can be doubled. In our experiments, we used 20 microcomb lines with 49 GHz FSR to achieve 20 channels for each polarization, with high RF spectra slicing resolutions at 144 MHz (TE) and 163 MHz (TM), respectively; achieving an instantaneous RF operation bandwidth of 3.1 GHz (TE) and 2.2 GHz (TM). Our approach paves the path towards monolithically integrated photonic RF receivers (the key components active and passive MRRs are all fabricated on the same platform) with reduced complexity, size, and unprecedented performance, which is important for wide RF applications with digital compatible signal detection.</description>

      <title>Optical Calibration of Holographic Acoustic Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, acoustic tweezers based on an array of ultrasonic transducers have been reported taking inspiration from holographic optical tweezers. In the latter technique, the calibration of the optical trap is an essential procedure to obtain the trap stiffnesses. On the contrary, in the case of acoustic tweezers the calibration of the acoustic forces is seldom carried out. To cover this gap, in this work, we adapt the calibration protocols employed in optical tweezers to acoustic tweezers based on arrays of ultrasonic transducers. We measure trap stiffnesses in the mN/m range that are consistent with theoretical estimates obtained by calculations of the acoustic radiation forces based on the Gorkov potential. This work gives a common framework to the optical and acoustic manipulation communities, paving the way to a consistent calibration of hybrid acoustooptical setups.</description>

      <title>Generation of Picosecond Ion Pulses by Ultrafast Electron-Stimulated Desorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient method to produce laser-triggered proton pulses below 500\,ps pulse width at keV energies. We use femtosecond photoelectron pulses emitted from a cathode to enable ultrafast electron-stimulated desorption of adsorbates on a stainless steel plate under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. While direct photoionization of atoms to form well-timed ion pulses can suffer from a laser-focus-limited large starting volume, in our method the starting plane of the ions is defined with nanometer precision at a solid surface. We clearly outline how the method could be used in the future to efficiently produce ion beam pulses in the (sub-)picosecond range for pump-probe experiments with ions.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of Pseudospin-Polarized Ultra-Wideband Waveguide Supporting Hybrid Spoof Surface Plasmon Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, novel low-loss waveguides and power dividers for ultra-broadband surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are introduced. This article uses complementary metasurfaces in place of traditional SPP, which are typically produced as metasurface unit cells on the dielectric sublayer. It has been demonstrated that the use of complementary metasurfaces considerably improves wave confinement and inhibits wave propagation. Because of this, it is anticipated that waveguides and power dividers made from these complimentary unit cells will have significantly lower losses and greater bandwidth than SPP used in traditional devices. In the frequency range of 0 GHz to 100 GHz, waveguides and bent waveguides with complementary metasurface unit cells exhibit insertion loss greater than 0.5 dB. Utilizing complementary metasurfaces, symmetric and asymmetric power dividers have been created and researched. The results of the simulation have shown that using this type of unit cell in the construction of microwave devices is advantageous.</description>

      <title>Proton-CAT: a Novel Proposal for Enhanced Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an innovative nitrogen-targeted proton carbon alpha therapy method, abbreviated as Proton-CAT, which partially converts protons into carbon-12 and alpha particles through nuclear reactions between protons and nitrogen-15. The effectiveness of Proton-CAT was validated using Monte Carlo simulations, and the study focused on the relative energy deposition distribution. The findings indicate that the presence of nitrogen enhances the maximum dose level of protons, resulting in more severe damage confined to tumor cells. Statistical analysis of secondary ions demonstrated that Proton-CAT significantly increases the efficiency of carbon-12 and alpha particle production. Furthermore, our results revealed that elevating the nitrogen concentration significantly boosts the dose of carbon and alpha particles within the tumor region. These outcomes offer a novel pathway for proton radiation therapy and hold promise for contributing to the future development of proton therapy.</description>

      <title>Efficient Combinatorial Optimization via Heat Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are widespread but inherently challenging due to their discrete nature.The primary limitation of existing methods is that they can only access a small fraction of the solution space at each iteration, resulting in limited efficiency for searching the global optimal. To overcome this challenge, diverging from conventional efforts of expanding the solver's search scope, we focus on enabling information to actively propagate to the solver through heat diffusion. By transforming the target function while preserving its optima, heat diffusion facilitates information flow from distant regions to the solver, providing more efficient navigation. Utilizing heat diffusion, we propose a framework for solving general combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance across a range of the most challenging and widely encountered combinatorial optimizations. Echoing recent advancements in harnessing thermodynamics for generative artificial intelligence, our study further reveals its significant potential in advancing combinatorial optimization.</description>
