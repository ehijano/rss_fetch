      <title>Massive Black Holes Seeded by Dark Matter -- Implications for Little Red Dots and Gravitational Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts challenge standard seeding scenarios. We examine a dissipative self-interacting dark matter (dSIDM) model in which gravothermal collapse leads to the formation of massive BH seeds ab initio. We utilize a semi-analytical framework to predict properties of the dSIDM-seeded SMBH population. Billion solar mass quasars are reproduced along with low-mass faint active galactic nuclei (known as little red dots) with SMBH-to-galaxy stellar mass ratios consistent with recent James Webb Space Telescope observations. To match the abundance of the observed bright quasars, a percent-level duty-cycle is suggested, implying a large population of dormant SMBHs. The gravitational wave (GW) signals from mergers of these massive SMBHs can be detected by LISA while remaining within the NANOGrav constraints on the GW background. These results provide testable signatures of DM-driven SMBH formation, offering a pathway to probe hidden-sector physics through SMBH and GW observables.</description>

      <title>The global energetics of radio AGN kinetic feedback in the local universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [abridged] AGN feedback is a crucial ingredient for understanding galaxy evolution. However, a complete quantitative time-dependent framework, including the dependence of such feedback on AGN, host galaxy, and host halo properties, is yet to be developed. Using the complete sample of 682 radio AGN from the LOFAR-eFEDS survey ($z&lt;0.4$), we derive the average jet power of massive galaxies and its variation as a function of stellar mass ($M_*$), halo mass ($M_h$) and radio morphology. We compare the incidence distributions of compact and complex radio AGN as a function of specific black hole kinetic power, $\lambda_{\rm Jet}$, and synthesise, for the first time, the radio luminosity function (RLF) by $M_*$ and radio morphology. Our RLF and derived total radio AGN kinetic luminosity density, $\log \Omega_{\rm kin}/[\rm {W~Mpc^{-3}}]=32.15_{-0.34}^{+0.18}$, align with previous work. We find that kinetic feedback from radio AGN dominates over any plausible inventory of radiatively-driven feedback for galaxies with $\log M_*/M_\odot &gt; 10.6$. More specifically, it is the compact radio AGN which dominate this global kinetic energy budget for all but the most massive galaxies ($10.6 &lt; \log M_*/M_{\odot} &lt; 11.5$). Subsequently, we compare the average injected jet energy against the galaxy and halo binding energy, and against the total thermal energy of the host gas within halos. We find that radio AGN cannot fully unbind their host galaxies nor host halos. However, they have enough energy to impact the global thermodynamical heating and cooling balance in small halos and significantly contribute to offsetting local cooling flows in even the most massive clusters cores. Overall, our findings provide important insights on jet powering, accretion processes and black hole-galaxy coevolution via AGN feedback, as well as a clear observational benchmark to calibrate AGN feedback simulations.</description>

      <title>The Origin of the Cluster of Local Interstellar Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium within $\rm\approx 15 \; pc$ of the Sun consists of a complex of fifteen diffuse, partially ionized clouds. Located within the Local Bubble, these clouds, known as the Cluster of Local Interstellar Clouds (CLIC), constitute the interstellar environment impinging upon our heliosphere. While each individual cloud can be modeled with a distinct velocity vector, the complex demonstrates a coherent bulk motion suggestive of a common origin. Here we examine two theories for the origin of the CLIC: that it formed due to an ionization front associated with nearby Str\"{o}mgren spheres and/or due to a nearby supernova explosion that occurred within the pre-evacuated cavity of the Local Bubble. Tracing back the trajectory of the clouds, we disfavor a purely Str\"{o}mgren sphere origin, given the CLIC's position interior to the surface of the most significant nearby Stromgren sphere and its motion transverse to the sphere's trajectory. Turning to a supernova origin, we model the formation of the CLIC assuming individual clouds have been swept up over time due to the expansion of a supernova remnant in its pressure-driven snowplow phase. We find that the 3D spatial-dynamical properties of the CLIC can be explained by the most recent supernova that exploded in the nearby Upper Centaurus Lupus cluster $\approx \rm 1.2 \; Myr$ ago and propagated into an ambient density of $n \approx 0.04 \;\rm cm^{-3}$. Our model predicts that the formation of the individual CLIC clouds occurred progressively over the past $1 \; \rm Myr$ and offers a natural explanation for the observed distribution, column density, temperature, and magnetic field structure of the complex.</description>

      <title>The MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS) data release 3: Cold atomic gas associated with the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of a blind search for Galactic HI 21-cm absorption lines toward 19130 radio sources, using 390 pointings of MALS, each pointing centered on a source brighter than 200 mJy. We detected 3640 HI absorption features. This represents the largest Galactic HI absorption line catalog to date. Based on the strong correlation between the HI 21-cm emission line column densities ($N_{HI}$) and the visual extinction ($A_V$) measured toward the pointing center, along with the confinement of the absorption features to a narrow range in radial velocities (-25$&lt;v_{\rm LSR}$[kms$^{-1}$]$&lt;$+25), we infer that the detected absorption lines form a homogeneous sample of HI clouds in the local interstellar medium (LISM). The HI 21-cm absorption optical depth is linearly correlated to $N_{HI}$ and $A_V$, up to $A_V$ of about 1 mag. Above this threshold, $A_V$ traces the total hydrogen content, and consequently, $A_V$ and $N_{HI}$ scale, differently. The slopes of $N_{HI}$ distributions of central sight lines with HI 21-cm absorption detections and non-detection differ at $&gt;2\sigma$. A similar difference is observed for H$_2$ detections and non-detections in damped Lyman-alpha systems at $z$ &gt; 1.8, implying that turbulence-driven WNM-to-CNM conversion is the common governing factor for the presence of HI 21-cm and H$_2$ absorption. Through a comparison of central and off-axis absorption features, we find that the slope of rms fluctuations in the optical depth variations in the quiescent gas associated with LISM is shallower than the earlier measurements in the disk. The densities (20-30 cm$^{-3}$) inferred from the optical depth variations are typical of the CNM values. The negligible velocity shifts between central and off-axis absorbers are in line with the hypothesis that the CNM and LNM clouds freeze out of the extended WNM phase.</description>

      <title>Timescales for the Effects of Interactions on Galaxy Properties and SMBH Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy interaction and merging have clear effects on the systems involved. We find an increase in the star formation rate (SFR), potential ignition of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and significant morphology changes. However, at what stage during interactions or mergers these changes begin to occur remains an open question. With a combination of machine learning and visual classification, we select a sample of 3,162 interacting and merging galaxies in the Cosmic Evolutionary Survey (COSMOS) field across a redshift range of 0.0 - 1.2. We divide this sample into four distinct stages of interaction based on their morphology, each stage representing a different phase of the dynamical timescale. We use the rich ancillary data available in COSMOS to probe the relation between interaction stage, stellar mass, SFR, and AGN fraction. We find that the distribution of SFRs rapidly change with stage for mass distributions consistent with being drawn from the same parent sample. This is driven by a decrease in the fraction of red sequence galaxies (from 17% as close pairs to 1.4% during merging) and an increase in the fraction of starburst galaxies (from 7% to 32%). We find the AGN fraction increases by a factor of 1.2 only at coalescence. We find the effects of interaction peak at the point of closest approach and coalescence of the two systems. We show that the point in time of the underlying dynamical timescale - and its related morphology - is as important to consider as its projected separation.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Non-Thermal Pressure at galaxy cluster outskirts from a Joint SPT and XMM-Newton Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present joint South Pole Telescope (SPT) and XMM-Newton observations of 8 massive galaxy clusters (0.8--1.7$\times$10$^{15}$ M$_{\odot}$) spanning a redshift range of 0.16 to 0.35. Employing a novel SZ+X-ray fitting technique, we effectively constrain the thermodynamic properties of these clusters out to the virial radius. The resulting best-fit electron density, deprojected temperature, and deprojected pressure profiles are in good agreement with previous observations of massive clusters. For the majority of the cluster sample (5 out of 8 clusters), the entropy profiles exhibit a self-similar behavior near the virial radius. We further derive hydrostatic mass, gas mass, and gas fraction profiles for all clusters up to the virial radius. Comparing the enclosed gas fraction profiles with the universal gas fraction profile, we obtain non-thermal pressure fraction profiles for our cluster sample at $&gt;$$R_{500}$, demonstrating a steeper increase between $R_{500}$ and $R_{200}$ that is consistent with the hydrodynamical simulations. Our analysis yields non-thermal pressure fraction ranges of 8--28% (median: 15 $\pm$ 11%) at $R_{500}$ and 21--35% (median: 27 $\pm$ 12%) at $R_{200}$. Notably, weak-lensing mass measurements are available for only four clusters in our sample, and our recovered total cluster masses, after accounting for non-thermal pressure, are consistent with these measurements.</description>

      <title>Early Co-formation of the Milky Way's Thin and Thick Disks at Redshift z &gt; 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way serves as a template for understanding the formation and evolution of late-type massive disk galaxies since we can obtain detailed chemical and kinematic information for large samples of individual stars. However, the early formation of the disk and the dichotomy between the chemical thick and thin disks remain under intense debate. Some mechanisms have been proposed to explain the formation of this dichotomy, such as the injection of metal-poor gas by a gas-rich merger such as Gaia-Sausage Enceladus (GSE), or by cosmic gas filaments, radial migration, and the presence of star-forming clumps at high redshift ($z &gt; 2$). In this work, we combine astrometric data from the Gaia mission, chemical abundances from APOGEE and LAMOST spectroscopic surveys, and StarHorse ages to map the evolution of our Galaxy. The Bayesian isochrone-fitting code StarHorse can estimate ages for thousands of stars in the solar neighborhood, being most reliable for main sequence turnoff and sub-giants, computing distances and extinction simultaneously. From these samples, we show that (i) there is an old thin disk population ($&gt;11$ Gyr) that indicates a period of co-formation between the thick and thin disks of the Milky Way before the GSE merger, i.e. the Galaxy itself could initiate the formation of a low-alpha disk without the need for a gas-rich merger, and (ii) this merger would have been important to stop the formation of stars in the thick disk.</description>

      <title>Evidence for evolutionary pathway-dependent black hole scaling relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have identified an abundance of high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) with supermassive black holes (BHs) that are over-massive compared to the local BH mass$-$total stellar mass ($M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\star$) relation. $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ measurements at high-$z$ are critical for probing the growth histories of BHs and their host galaxies, including BH seeding and evolution of the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\star$ relation. However, BH masses in high-$z$ AGN are generally estimated from single-epoch measurements, which are anchored to local relations based on reverberation mapping and carry large systematic uncertainties. Alternate $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ detection methods such as dynamical measurements are more reliable but currently only possible in the local Universe or with strongly lensed systems. Recently, dynamical $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ measurements were made in a $z\sim2$ lensed quiescent galaxy as well as a sample of six local galaxies identified as likely relics of common quiescent red nugget galaxies at cosmic noon. We compare the $z\sim2$ red nugget and relic BHs to recent results for $4&lt;z&lt;11$ AGN, quasars, and Little Red Dots. Intriguingly, the $z\sim2$ galaxy and local relic galaxies all lie on both the local $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\star$ relation for bulges and the $4&lt;z&lt;7$ $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\star$ relation. Our results suggest the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\star$ relation for bulges was likely in place at high-$z$ and indicate careful consideration of different evolutionary pathways is needed when building BH scaling relations. While improvements to $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ estimates in AGN will increase our confidence in high-$z$ BH masses, detecting BHs in relic galaxies and lensed galaxies presents a complementary probe of the high-$z$ relations.</description>

      <title>An Updated Repository of Sub-mJy Extragalactic Source-Count Measurements in the Radio Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated repository of sub-mJy extragalactic radio source counts between $150$ MHz and $10$ GHz, incorporating recent advances in radio surveys and observational techniques. By compiling and refining previous datasets, we provide a comprehensive catalog that enhances the understanding of faint radio-source populations, including Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies (DSFGs) and Radio-Quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (RQAGNs), from intermediate to high redshifts. Our analysis accounts for observational biases, such as resolution effects and Eddington bias, ensuring improved accuracy in flux-density estimations. We also discuss the implications of new-generation radio telescopes, such as the Square-Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) and its precursors and pathfinders, to further resolve these populations. Our collection contributes to constraining evolutionary models of radio sources, highlighting the increasing role of polarization studies in distinguishing different classes. This work serves as a key reference for future deep radio surveys targeting the faintest end of the extragalactic radio sky.</description>

      <title>Identifying Dwarfs of MC Analog GalaxiEs (ID-MAGE): The Search for Satellites Around Low-Mass Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from ID-MAGE (Identifying Dwarfs of MC Analog GalaxiEs), a survey aimed at identifying and characterizing unresolved satellite galaxies around 36~nearby LMC- and SMC-mass hosts (D$=$4$-$10~Mpc). We use archival DESI Legacy Survey imaging data and perform an extensive search for dwarf satellites, extending out to a radius of 150~kpc ($\sim$$R_{vir}$). We identify \tot candidate satellite galaxies, including \new new discoveries. Extensive tests with injected galaxies demonstrate that the survey is complete down to $M_V\sim-$9.0 (assuming the distance of the host) and $\mu_{0,V}\sim$26 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ (assuming a n$=$1 \sersic profile). We perform consistent photometry, via \sersic profile fitting, on all candidates and have initiated a comprehensive follow-up campaign to confirm and characterize candidates. Through a systematic visual inspection campaign, we classify the top candidates as high-likelihood satellites. On average, we find \LMCLFer high-likelihood candidate satellites per LMC-mass host and \SMCLFer per SMC-mass host which is within the range predicted by cosmological models. We use this sample to establish upper and lower estimates on the satellite luminosity function of LMC/SMC-mass galaxies. ID-MAGE nearly triples the number of low-mass galaxies surveyed for satellites with well-characterized completeness limits, providing a unique dataset to explore small-scale structure and dwarf galaxy evolution around low-mass hosts in diverse environments.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Morphology Classification via Deep Semi-Supervised Learning with Limited Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy morphology classification plays a crucial role in understanding the structure and evolution of the universe. With galaxy observation data growing exponentially, machine learning has become a core technology for this classification task. However, traditional machine learning methods predominantly rely on supervised learning frameworks, and their dependence on large of labeled samples limits practical applications. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative hybrid semi-supervised model, GC-SWGAN, designed to tackle galaxy morphology classification under conditions of limited labeled data. This model integrates semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (SGAN) with Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP), establishing a multi-task learning framework. Within this framework, the discriminator and classifier are designed independently while sharing part of the architecture. By collaborating with the generator, the model significantly enhances both classification performance and sample generation capabilities, while also improving convergence and stability during training. Experimental results demonstrate that, on the Galaxy10 DECals dataset, GC-SWGAN achieves comparable or even superior classification accuracy (exceeding 75%) using only one-fifth of the labeled samples typically required by conventional fully supervised methods. Under identical labeled conditions, the model displays excellent generalization performance, attaining approximately 84% classification accuracy. Notably, in extreme scenarios where only 10\% of the data is labeled, GC-SWGAN still achieves high classification accuracy (over 68%), fully demonstrating its stability and effectiveness in low-labeled data environments. Furthermore, galaxy images generated by GC-SWGAN are visually similar to real samples.</description>

      <title>Effects of chemically homogeneous evolution of the first stars on the 21-cm signal and reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first generation of stars, known as Population III (Pop III), played a crucial role in the early Universe through their unique formation environment and metal-free composition. These stars can undergo chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) due to fast rotation, becoming more compact and hotter/bluer than their (commonly assumed) non-rotating counterparts. In this study, we investigate the impact of Pop III CHE on the 21-cm signal and cosmic reionization under various assumptions on Pop III star formation, such as their formation efficiency, initial mass function, and transition to metal-enriched star formation. We combine stellar spectra computed by detailed atmosphere models with semi-numerical simulations of Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization ($z\sim 6-30$). The key effect of CHE arises from the boosted ionizing power of Pop III stars, which reduces the Pop III stellar mass density required to reproduce the observed Thomson scattering optical depth by a factor of $\sim 2$. Meanwhile, the maximum 21-cm global absorption signal is shallower by up to $\sim 15$ mK (11%), partly due to the reduced Lyman-band emission from CHE, and the large-scale ($k\sim 0.2\ \rm cMpc^{-1}$) power drops by a factor of a few at $z\gtrsim 25$. In general, the effects of CHE are comparable to those of Pop III star formation parameters, showing an interesting interplay with distinct features in different epochs. These results highlight the importance of metal-free/poor stellar evolution in understanding the early Universe and suggest that future studies should consider joint constraints on the physics of star/galaxy formation and stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>Outflowing Gas in the Planetary Nebula K 3-54</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As planetary nebulae (PNe) evolve, they develop slow and strong dust-driven stellar winds, making the joint study of dust and gas essential for understanding their nature. As a pilot investigation, we selected PN K 3-54 as our target, the only known PN in the Milky Way to exhibit infrared emission from both graphene (C$_{24}$) and fullerene (C$_{60}$). The gas is traced via molecular line emissions from $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O ($J = 1 \rightarrow 0$), observed using the 13.7 m telescope of the Purple Mountain Observatory. We investigate the dynamics of this PN and identify a bipolar outflow. Preliminary results suggest that the large dynamical timescale of the outflow and the weak shock environment may account for the simultaneous survival of C$_{24}$ and C$_{60}$ within and around PN K 3-54.</description>

      <title>The GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Programme: The NIRISS Spectroscopic Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We release a spectroscopic redshift catalogue of sources in the Abell 2744 cluster field, derived from JWST/NIRISS observations taken as part of the GLASS-JWST Early Release Science programme. We describe the data reduction, contamination modelling and source detection, as well as the data quality assessment, redshift determination and validation. The catalogue consists of 354 secure and 134 tentative redshifts, of which 245 are new spectroscopic redshifts, spanning a range $0.1 \leq z \leq 8.2$. These include 17 galaxies at the cluster redshift, one galaxy at $z \approx 8$, and a triply-imaged galaxy at $z = 2.653 \pm 0.002$. Comparing against galaxies with existing spectroscopic redshifts $z_{\rm{spec}}$, we find a small offset of $\Delta z = (z_{\rm{spec}} - z_{\rm{NIRISS}} )/(1 + z_{\rm{spec}} ) = (1.3 \pm 1.6) \times 10^{-3}$. We also release a forced extraction tool "pygrife" and a visualisation tool "pygcg" to the community, to aid with the reduction and classification of grism data. This catalogue will enable future studies of the spatially-resolved properties of galaxies throughout cosmic noon, including dust attenuation and star formation. As the first exploitation of the catalogue, we discuss the spectroscopic confirmation of multiple image systems, and the identification of multiple overdensities at $1 &lt; z &lt; 2.7$.</description>

      <title>The Role of Magnetic Fields in the Formation of High-Mass Star-Forming Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are often invoked as playing a primary role in star formation and in the formation of high-mass stars. We investigate the effect of magnetic fields on the formation of high-mass cores using the 3-dimensional smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) code PHANTOM. We follow the collapse of six molecular clouds of mass 1000 M$_{\odot}$, four of which are initially magnetized with mass-to-flux ratios 3, 5, 10 and 100, respectively, and two purely hydrodynamic clouds with varying initial strengths of turbulence. We then apply an in-house clump-finding algorithm to the 3D SPH data in order to quantify the differences in mass and properties of the cores across the degrees of magnetic and turbulent support. We find that although the magnetic fields cause differences in the global cloud evolution, the masses and properties of the cores which form are broadly similar across the different initial conditions. Cores initially form with masses comparable to the initial thermal Jeans mass of the clouds, and then slowly increase in mass with time. We find that regardless of initial magnetization, the fields become dynamically relevant at densities of $\rho &gt; 1\times10^{-17}$ g cm$^{-3}$ - comparable to core densities - and channel material along the field lines, decreasing the stable magnetic Jeans mass, such that the limiting factor for fragmentation is the thermal Jeans mass. We conclude that magnetic fields are not capable of forming and supporting initially high-mass cores against fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Group Accretion in Milky Way-like Stellar Haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As galaxies form hierarchically, larger satellites may accrete alongside smaller companions in group infall events. This coordinated accretion is likely to have left signatures in the Milky Way's stellar halo at the present day. Our goal is to characterise the possible groups of companions that accompanied larger known accretion events of our Galaxy, and infer where their stellar material could be in physical and dynamical space at present day. We use the AURIGA simulation suite of Milky Way-like haloes to identify analogues to these large accretion events and their group infall companions, and we follow their evolution in time. We find that most of the material from larger accretion events is deposited on much more bound orbits than their companions. This implies a weak dynamical association between companions and debris, but it is strongest with the material lost first. As a result, the companions of the Milky Way's earliest building blocks are likely to contribute stars to the solar neighbourhood, whilst the companions of our last major merger are likely found in both the solar neighbourhood and the outer halo. More recently infallen groups of satellites, or those of a smaller mass, are more likely to retain dynamical coherence, for example, through clustering in the orientation of angular momentum. We conclude that group infall has likely shaped the Milky Way's stellar halo. Disentangling this will be challenging for the earliest accretion events, although overlap with their less-bound debris may be particularly telling.</description>

      <title>A neutral hydrogen absorption study of cold gas in the outskirts of the Magellanic Clouds using the GASKAP-HI survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold neutral hydrogen (HI) is a crucial precursor for molecular gas formation and can be studied via HI absorption. This study investigates HI absorption in low column density regions of the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC) using the Galactic-ASKAP HI (GASKAP-HI) survey, conducted by the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We select 10 SMC directions in the outer regions and 18 LMC directions, with 4 in the outskirts and 14 within the main disk. Using the radiative transfer method, we decompose the emission and absorption spectra into individual cold neutral medium (CNM) and warm neutral medium (WNM) components. In the SMC, we find HI peak optical depths of 0.09-1.16, spin temperatures of ~20-50 K, and CNM fractions of 1-11%. In the LMC, optical depths range from 0.03 to 3.55, spin temperatures from ~10 to 100 K, and CNM fractions from 1% to 100%. The SMC's low CNM fractions likely result from its low metallicity and large line-of-sight depth. Additionally, the SMC's outskirts show lower CNM fractions than the main body, potentially due to increased CNM evaporation influenced by the hot Magellanic Corona. Shell motions dominate the kinematics of the majority of CNM clouds in this study and likely supply cold HI to the Magellanic Stream. In the LMC, high CNM fraction clouds are found near supergiant shells, where thermal instability induced by stellar feedback promotes WNM-to-CNM transition. Although no carbon monoxide (CO) has been detected, enhanced dust shielding in these areas helps maintain the cold HI.</description>

      <title>A Large-Scale Search for Photometrically Variable AGNs in Dwarf Galaxies Using the Young Supernova Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct an analysis of over 60,000 dwarf galaxies (7&lt;=log(M_*/M_\odot)&lt;=10) in search of photometric variability indicative of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Using data from the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE), a time domain survey on the Pan-STARRS telescopes, we construct light curves for each galaxy in up to four bands (griz) where available. We select objects with AGN-like variability by fitting each light curve to a damped random walk (DRW) model. After quality cuts and removing transient contaminants, we identify 1100 variability-selected AGN candidates (representing 2.4% of the available sample). We analyze their spectra to measure various emission lines and calculate black hole (BH) masses, finding general agreement with previously found mass scaling-relations and nine potential IMBH candidates. Furthermore, we re-analyze the light curves for our candidates to calculate the dampening timescale tau_DRW associated with the DRW and see a similar correlation between this value and the BH mass. Finally, we estimate the active fraction as a function of stellar mass and see evidence that active fraction increases with host mass.</description>

      <title>Searching for exotic object companions in the dense core of NGC 362: a multi-wavelength and multi-epoch photometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dense cores of globular clusters (GCs) are efficient environments for the production of exotic stellar populations, including millisecond pulsars (MSPs), low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and cataclysmic variables (CVs). Most of these objects likely form through two- and three-body interactions and are useful tracers of the cluster's dynamical evolution. In this work we explore the exotic object population in the galactic GC NGC 362, searching for the optical counterpart of 33 X-ray sources identified within 1 arcmin from the cluster center. To this aim, we exploit a large Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data-set, obtained in eight different epochs and covering a wavelength range from near UV to the optical I band. To identify the most promising counterparts we follow a multi-step analysis, which is based on four main ingredients, namely positional coincidence, position in the colour-magnitude-diagrams (CMDs), H$\alpha$ excess and photometric variability. In addition, we complement the photometric analysis with spectroscopic information coming from the analysis of MUSE radial velocity (RV) curves. Thanks to this multi-diagnostic approach, we are able to identify 28 high-confidence optical counterparts, including several candidate MSPs, active binaries (ABs) and CVs. The most intriguing counterparts include a candidate black widow (BW) system, an eclipsing binary blue straggler, and a system in outburst, potentially representing either a LMXB or a nova eruption from a CV. The candidate MSPs proposed in this work will contribute to ongoing radio analyses with MeerKAT for the identification and detailed study of MSPs in NGC 362.</description>

      <title>ATOMIUM: Dust and tracers of binarity in the continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low- and intermediate-mass stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) account for a significant portion of the dust and chemical enrichment in their host galaxy. Here we present ALMA observations of the continuum emission at 1.24 mm around a sample of 17 stars from the ATOMIUM survey. From our analysis of the stellar contributions to the continuum flux, we find that the semi-regular variables all have smaller physical radii and fainter monochromatic luminosities than the Mira variables. Comparing these properties with pulsation periods, we find a positive trend between stellar radius and period only for the Mira variables with periods above 300 days and a positive trend between the period and the monochromatic luminosity only for the red supergiants and the most extreme AGB stars with periods above 500 days. We find that the continuum emission at 1.24 mm can be classified into four groups. "Featureless" continuum emission is confined to the (unresolved) regions close to the star for five stars in our sample, relatively uniform extended flux is seen for four stars, tentative bipolar features are seen for three stars, and the remaining five stars have unique or unusual morphological features in their continuum maps. These features can be explained by binary companions to 10 out of the 14 AGB stars in our sample. Based on our results we conclude that there are two modes of dust formation: well established pulsation-enhanced dust formation and our newly proposed companion-enhanced dust formation. If the companion is located close to the AGB star, in the wind acceleration region, then additional dust formed in the wake of the companion can increase the mass lost through the dust driven wind. This explains the different dust morphologies seen around our stars and partly accounts for a large scatter in literature mass-loss rates, especially among semiregular stars with small pulsation periods.</description>

      <title>Cosmography with the Double Source Plane Strong Gravitational Lens AGEL150745+052256</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lenses with two background sources at widely separated redshifts are a powerful and independent probe of cosmological parameters. We can use these systems, known as Double-Source-Plane Lenses (DSPLs), to measure the ratio ($\beta$) of angular-diameter distances of the sources, which is sensitive to the matter density ($\Omega_m$) and the equation-of-state parameter for dark-energy ($w$). However, DSPLs are rare and require high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy for detection, lens modeling, and measuring $\beta$. Here we report only the second DSPL ever used to measure cosmological parameters. We model the DSPL AGEL150745+052256 from the ASTRO 3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses (AGEL) survey using HST/WFC3 imaging and Keck/KCWI spectroscopy. The spectroscopic redshifts for the deflector and two sources in AGEL1507 are $z_{\rm defl}=0.594$, $z_{\rm S1}=2.163$, and $z_{\rm S2}=2.591$. We measure a stellar velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{\rm obs}=109 \pm 27$ km s$^{-1}$ for the nearer source. Using $\sigma_{\rm obs}$ for the main deflector (from literature) and S1, we test the robustness of our DSPL model. We measure $\beta=0.953^{+0.008}_{-0.010}$ for AGEL1507 and infer $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.33^{+0.38}_{-0.23}$ for $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Combining AGEL1507 with the published model of the Jackpot lens improves the precision on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ ($\Lambda$CDM) and w (wCDM) by $\sim 10 \%$. The inclusion of DSPLs significantly improves the constraints when combined with Plancks cosmic microwave background observations, enhancing precision on w by $30 \%$. This paper demonstrates the constraining power of DSPLs and their complementarity to other standard cosmological probes. Tighter future constraints from larger DSPL samples discovered from ongoing and forthcoming large-area sky surveys would provide insights into the nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>UVIT Data Release version 7: Regenerated high-level UVIT data products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on board AstroSat is an active telescope capable of high-resolution far-ultraviolet imaging (&lt;1.5'') and low resolution (${\lambda}/{\delta}{\lambda}$ $\approx$ 100) slitless spectroscopy with a field of view as large as ~0.5 degrees. Now almost a decade old, UVIT continues to be operational and generates valuable data for the scientific community. UVIT is also capable of near-ultraviolet imaging (&lt;1.5''); however, the near-ultraviolet channel stopped working in August 2018 after providing data for nearly three years. This article gives an overview of the latest version (7.0.1) of the UVIT pipeline and UVIT Data Release version 7. The high-level products generated using pipeline versions having a major version number of seven will be called "UVIT Data Release version 7". The latest pipeline version overcomes the two limitations of the previous version (6.3), namely (a) the inability to combine all episode-wise images and (b) the failure of the astrometry module in a large fraction of the observations. The procedures adopted to overcome these two limitations, as well as a comparison of the performance of this new version over the previous one, are presented in this paper. The UVIT Data Release version 7 products are available at the Indian Space Science Data Center of the Indian Space Research Organisation for archival and dissemination from 01 June 2024. The new pipeline version is open source and made available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Assembly and Evolution in the P-Millennium simulation: galaxy clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: [abridged] We present results from the latest version of the GAEA theoretical model of galaxy formation coupled with merger trees extracted from the Planck Millennium Simulation (PMS). With respect to the Millennium Simulation, the PMS provides a better mass resolution, a larger volume and assumes cosmological parameters consistent with latest results from the Planck mission. The model includes a treatment for the partition of cold gas into atomic and molecular (H$_2$) components; a better treatment for environmental processes; an updated modelling of cold gas accretion on Super-Massive Black Holes. We compare GAEA predictions based on the PMS, with model realizations based on other simulations in the Millennium Suite, showing that the new model provides a remarkable consistency for most statistical properties of galaxy populations. We interpret this as due to the interplay between AGN feedback and H$_2$-based SFR, as model versions considering only one of the two mechanisms do not show the same level of consistency. We then compare model predictions with available data for the galaxy 2-point correlation function (2pCF) in the redshift range 0&lt;z$\lesssim$3. We show that GAEA runs correctly recover the main dependencies of the 2pCF as a function of stellar mass, star formation activity, HI-content and redshift for galaxies more massive than 10$^{9}$ M$_\odot$. These results suggest that our model correctly captures both the distribution of galaxy populations in the Large Scale Structure and the interplay between the main physical processes regulating their baryonic content, both for central and satellite galaxies. The model predicts a small redshift evolution of the clustering amplitude, that results in an overprediction of z$\sim$3 clustering strength with respect to the available estimates, but is still consistent with data within 1-$\sigma$ uncertainties.</description>

      <title>The molecular gas content throughout the low-z merger sequence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploiting IRAM 30m CO spectroscopy, we find that SDSS post-merger galaxies display gas fractions and depletion times enhanced by 25-50%, a mildly higher CO excitation, and standard molecular-to-atomic gas ratios, compared to non-interacting galaxies with similar redshift, stellar mass ($M_{\star}$) and star-formation rate (SFR). To place these results in context, we compile further samples of interacting or starbursting galaxies, from pre-coalescence kinematic pairs to post-starbursts, carefully homogenising gas mass, $M_{\star}$ and SFR measurements in the process. We explore systematics by duplicating our analysis for different SFR and $M_{\star}$ estimators, finding good qualitative agreement in general. Gas fractions and depletion times are enhanced in interacting pairs, albeit by less than for post-mergers. Among all samples studied, gas fraction and depletion time enhancements appear largest in young (a few 100 Myr) post-starbursts. While there is only partial overlap between post-mergers and post-starbursts, this suggests that molecular gas reservoirs are boosted throughout most stages of galaxy interactions, plausibly due to torque-driven inflows of halo gas and gas compression. The gas fraction and depletion time offsets of mergers and post-starbursts anti-correlate with distance from the galaxy main sequence $\Delta({\rm MS})$, evidencing the role of SFE in driving the high SFRs of the strongest starbursts. Post-starbursts display the steepest dependency of gas fraction and SFE-offsets on $\Delta({\rm MS})$, with an evolving normalisation that reflects gas reservoir depletion over time. Our multi-sample analysis paints a coherent picture of the starburst-merger connection throughout the low-z merger sequence. It reconciles contradictory literature findings by highlighting that gas fraction enhancements and SFE variations both play their part in merger-driven star formation.</description>

      <title>Partially Ionized Gas at Equilibrium Powered by Ultraviolet Irradiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation of a partially ionized zone behind the usual H II zone in photo-ionized gas for gas density intermediate between ordinary H II regions and AGN BLRs and without X-rays. While Lyman continuum photons are depleted before reaching this zone, Balmer continuum photons can ionize the $n=2$ hydrogen atoms as those are pumped by scattering-trapped Ly$\alpha$ photons. Ly$\alpha$ photons need to be replenished in a steady state, but fast radiative cooling at high gas temperature makes replenishment through electron collisional excitation of $n=2$ inefficient. Independently of the temperature, Raman scattering of incident continuum photons on the Lyman-series damping wings injects Ly$\alpha$ photons in the line core and pumps the $n=2$ state, which helps realize a partially ionized equilibrium at $5000$--$7000\,$K. Since the ratio between the incident radiation flux and gas density is limited by the dynamic effects of radiation pressure, significant ionization fraction is only realized at densities $n_{\rm H} \gtrsim 10^7\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. A large H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ line ratio results from such partially ionized gas as large Balmer line optical depths enhance the $n=3$ population relative to higher $n$ states. Partial ionization also provides the ideal condition for internally forming an intense and very broad Ly$\alpha$ line, which can power strong fluorescent metal emission lines observed from the Weigelt blobs of $\eta$ Carinae in the Galaxy, and from a candidate young super star cluster in the Cosmic Noon Sunburst galaxy. This phenomenon may also have implications for understanding the spectra of high-$z$ galaxies that show unusually dense ionized gas.</description>

      <title>Strong nebular HeII emission induced by He$^+$ ionizing photons escaping through the clumpy winds of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of nebular HeII-emission in both local and high-redshift galaxies remains an unsolved problem. Various theories have been proposed to explain it, including HeII-ionization by high mass X-ray binaries, ultra-luminous X-ray sources, or "stripped" He stars, shock ionization, and hidden AGNs. All these theories have shortcomings, however, leaving the cause of nebular HeII emission unclear. We investigate the hypothesis that the photons responsible for driving nebular HeII emissions are produced by the evolution of single massive stars and/or WR stars. We combine models of stellar evolution with population synthesis and nebular models to identify the most favorable scenarios for producing nebular HeII via this channel. We find that, if WR winds are clumpy enough to become close to optically thin, stellar populations with a wide range of metallicities and rotation rates can produce HeII ionizing photons at rates sufficient to explain the observed nebular $I(HeII)/I(\mathrm{H}\beta)$ ratio $\sim 0.004-0.07$ found in HeII-emitting galaxies. Metal-poor, rapidly rotating stellar populations ($[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]=-2.0$, $v/v_\mathrm{crit}=0.4$) also reach these levels of HeII production even for partially clumpy winds. These scenarios also yield HeII, H$\beta$, and "Blue-Bump" line equivalent widths comparable to those observed in HeII emitters. Only for laminar, non-clumpy winds, do we fail to find combinations of metallicity and stellar rotation rate that yield $I(HeII)/I(\mathrm{H}\beta)$ values as high as those observed in HeII-emitters. Contrary to previous findings, we conclude that single WR stars can be a strong source for nebular HeII emission if their winds are sufficiently clumpy allowing significant escape of hard ionizing photons.</description>

      <title>Realistic predictions for Gaia black hole discoveries: comparison of isolated binary and dynamical formation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrometry from Gaia has enabled discovery of three dormant black holes (BHs) in au-scale binaries. Numerous models have been proposed to explain their formation, including several that have forecasted Gaia detections. However, previous works have used simplified detectability metrics that do not capture key elements of the Gaia astrometric orbit selection function. We apply a realistic forward-model of Gaia astrometric orbit catalogs to BH binary populations generated through (a) isolated binary evolution (IBE) and (b) dynamical formation in star clusters. For both formation channels, we analyze binary populations in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy with a realistic metallicity-dependent star formation history and 3D dust map. We generate epoch astrometry for each binary from the Gaia scanning law and fit it with the cascade of astrometric models used in Gaia DR3. The IBE model of Chawla et al. (2022) predicts that no BH binaries should have been detected in DR3 and thus significantly underpredicts the formation rate of Gaia BHs. In contrast, the dynamical model of Di Carlo et al. (2024) overpredicts the number of BHs receiving DR3 orbital solutions by a factor of $\sim$8. The two models predict very different orbital period distributions, with the IBE model predicting only binaries that avoided common envelope evolution and have $P_{\text{orb}} \gtrsim 2,000$ d to be detectable, and the dynamical formation model predicting a period distribution that is roughly log-uniform. Adopting the dynamical channel as a fiducial model and rescaling by a factor of 1/8 to match DR3, we predict that $\sim$30 BH binaries will be detected in Gaia DR4, representing $\sim0.1\%$ of Milky Way BHs with luminous companions in au-scale orbits.</description>

      <title>Galactic foreground emissions randomization due to chaotic/turbulent dynamics of magnetized plasma dominated by magnetic helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using results of numerical simulations and astrophysical observations (mainly in the WMAP and Planck frequency bands) it is shown that Galactic foreground emission becomes more sensitive to the mean magnetic field with the frequency, that results in the appearance of two levels of its randomization due to chaotic/turbulent dynamics of magnetized interstellar medium dominated by the magnetic helicity. The galactic foreground emission is more randomized at higher frequencies. The Galactic synchrotron and polarized dust emissions have been studied in detail. It is shown that the magnetic field imposes its level of randomization on the synchrotron and dust emission. The background magnetic field and emission have also been briefly discussed in this context. It is shown that they are considerably less randomized than the foreground ones. The main method for the theoretical consideration used in this study is the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology in the frames of distributed chaos notion. Despite the vast differences in the values of physical parameters and spatio-temporal scales between the numerical simulations and the astrophysical observations, there is a quantitative agreement between the results of the astrophysical observations and the numerical simulations in the frames of the distributed chaos notion.</description>

      <title>Formation of the Little Red Dots from the Core-collapse of Self-interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a statistical study on the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) seeded by gravothermal core-collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos at high redshifts, using a semi-analytical framework based on Monte-Carlo merger trees. We demonstrate that BH formation via gravothermal collapse naturally occurs in high-concentration halos at a characteristic mass scale determined by the SIDM cross section, and only during the early Universe. This mechanism is particularly promising for explaining the abundance of little red dots (LRDs) -- a population of early, apparently galaxy-less active galactic nuclei hosting supermassive BHs. By incorporating this seeding process with simplified models of BH growth and mergers, we successfully reproduce the observed LRD mass function for moderately large cross sections of $\sigma_{0m} \sim 30 \mathrm{cm^2\,g^{-1}}$ and $\omega \sim 80\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, intriguingly consistent with independent local constraints derived from galaxy rotation curves. Our results highlight the potential of high-redshift BH statistics as a complementary probe for constraining SIDM models.</description>

      <title>A shock crashing into confined dense circumstellar matter brightens the nascent SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Red supergiants may experience a short-lived period of episodic mass loss rather than steady winds before their core collapses, leading to dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Interaction of SN ejecta with such nearby CSM can generate additional radiation, appending to the cooling radiation from the shock breakout of the progenitor envelope, to brighten the nascent SN explosion. This phenomenon is conspicuous for SN 2023ixf as its V-band brightness showed a rapid increase of about three magnitudes from the first to the third day after the explosion, which is distinctive among type II SNe with flash ionized signatures. In this paper, we employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate the radiative diffusion process in the unshocked CSM. Considering a wide range of mass-loss rates from 10^-5 to 10^-2 Msun/yr, we confirmed that the fast-rising light curve of SN 2023ixf can be fitted by the interaction of the SN ejecta with a CSM having a mass-loss rate of about 10^-2 Msun/yr located within 10^15 cm to the progenitor.</description>
