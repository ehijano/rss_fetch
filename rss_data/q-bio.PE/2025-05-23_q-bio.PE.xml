      <title>Towards improved pest management of the soybean aphid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The soybean aphid (\emph{Aphis glycines}) is an invasive insect pest that continues to cause large-scale damage to soybean crops in the North Central United States. The current manuscript proposes several mathematical models for the top-down bio-control of the aphid, as well as control via pesticides and neonicotinoids. The models are motivated empirically, and constructed based on laboratory experiments conducted to test control of aphids by Lacewing larvae, as well as by a parasitic wasp (\emph{Aphidius colemani}). The effectiveness of these models is compared by taking into account factors such as economic injury levels for soybeans, life history traits such as cannibalism amongst the predator, and intraguild predation between competing bio-control agents such as predators and parasitoids. The models predict multiple population peaks and transient chaotic dynamics when a predator and/or insecticides are used. It is observed that parasitoids, in conjunction with predators, are more efficient at stabilizing the population dynamics than insecticide use. They also suggest a combination of predators, parasitoids, and insecticides would be more efficient at suppressing aphid populations than using only predators or parasitoids. The models also qualitatively capture the features seen in long-time field data from 2000-2013. We discuss applications of our results to pest management strategies for soybean aphids in the context of a changing climate, as well as regime shifts.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal agent-based modelling of malaria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the majority of malaria morbidity and mortality each year. Malaria transmission rates vary by location and time of year due to climate and environmental conditions. We show the impact of these factors by developing a stochastic spatiotemporal agent-based malaria model that captures the impact of spatially distributed interventions on malaria transmission. Our model uses spatiotemporal estimates of mosquito climatic suitability and household location data to model the interaction between human and mosquito agents. We apply our model to investigate how strategies for distributing interventions to households in Vietnam impact the disease burden. Our study shows that providing some level of protection to a wide range of households reduces malaria prevalence more compared to providing a strong level of protection to a limited number of households.</description>

      <title>Long-term impact of PM2.5 on mortality is exacerbated when wildfire events occur</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is extensive evidence that long-term exposure to all-source PM2.5 increases mortality. However, to date, no study has evaluated whether this effect is exacerbated in the presence of wildfire events. Here, we study 60+ million older US adults and find that wildfire events increase the harmful effects of long-term all-source PM2.5 exposure on mortality, providing a new and realistic conceptualization of wildfire health risks.</description>

      <title>Projected Gradient Descent Method for Tropical Principal Component Analysis over Tree Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2019, Yoshida et al. developed tropical Principal Component Analysis (PCA), that is, an analogue of the classical PCA in the setting of tropical geometry and applied it to visualize a set of gene trees over a space of phylogenetic trees which is an union of lower dimensional polyhedral cones in an Euclidean space with its dimension $m(m-1)/2$ where $m$ is the number of leaves. In this paper, we introduce a projected gradient descent method to estimate the tropical principal polytope over the space of phylogenetic trees and we apply it to apicomplexa dataset. With computational experiment against Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers, we show that our projected gradient descent has a lower sum of tropical distances between observations and their projections on an estimated best-fit tropical polytope compared with the MCMC approach proposed by Page et al.~in 2020.</description>
