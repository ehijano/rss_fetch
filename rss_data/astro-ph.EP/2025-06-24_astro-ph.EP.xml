      <title>The OATMEAL Survey. II. The 3D spin-orbit obliquity of an eccentric transiting brown dwarf in the Ruprecht 147 open cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new analysis of the CWW 89 system as part of the Orbital Architectures of Transiting Massive Exoplanets And Low-mass stars (OATMEAL) survey. The CWW 89 system is a member of the 2.8 Gyr old Ruprecht 147 (NGC 6774) cluster and features two stars, CWW 89A (EPIC 219388192) and CWW 89B, with the primary hosting a transiting brown dwarf. We use in-transit, highly precise radial velocity measurements with the Keck Planet Finder (KPF) to characterize the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect and measure the projected spin-orbit obliquity $|\lambda|=1.4\pm2.5^\circ$ and the full 3D spin-orbit obliquity of the brown dwarf to be $\psi=15.1^{+15.0^\circ}_{-10.9}$. This value of $\lambda$ implies that the brown dwarf's orbit is prograde and well-aligned with the equator of the host star, continuing the trend of transiting brown dwarfs showing a preference for alignment ($\lambda \approx 0^\circ$) regardless of the stellar effective temperature. We find that this contrast with the transiting giant planet population, whose spin-orbit alignments depend on host $T_{\rm eff}$, shows an increasingly clear distinction in the formation and orbital migration mechanisms between transiting giant planets and transiting brown dwarfs like CWW 89Ab. For this system in particular, we find it plausible that the brown dwarf may have undergone coplanar high-eccentricity migration influence by CWW 89B.</description>

      <title>A Large Outburst, Coma Asymmetries, and the Color of Comet 243P/NEAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water ice is a fundamental building material of comets and other bodies in the outer solar system. Yet, the properties of cometary water ice are challenging to study, due to its volatility and the typical distances at which comets are observed. Cometary outbursts, impulsive mass-loss events that can liberate large amounts of material, offer opportunities to directly observe and characterize cometary water ice. We present a study of comet 243P/NEAT, instigated by a $-3$ mag outburst that occurred in December 2018. Optical images and a 251-day lightcurve were examined to characterize the outburst and the comet's quiescent activity. Variations in the quiescent lightcurve appear to be dominated by coma asymmetries, rather than changing activity levels as the comet approached and receded from the Sun. Furthermore, the lightcurve shows evidence for 1 to 2 additional small outbursts ($-0.3$ mag) occurring in September 2018. The large December 2018 outburst likely ejected water ice grains, yet no signatures of ice were found in color photometry, a color map, nor a near-infrared spectrum. We discuss possible dynamical and thermal reasons for this non-detection. In this context, we examined the comae of comets 103P/Hartley 2 and C/2013 US$_{10}$ (Catalina), and show that a one-to-one mapping between continuum color and the presence of water ice cannot be supported. We also discuss possible causes for the large outburst, and find that there is an apparent grouping in the kinetic energy per mass estimates for the outbursts of 5 comets.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Jupiter and Saturn as a function of the Semi-convective Parameter R$_{\rho}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computed using the APPLE planetary evolution code, we present updated evolutionary models for Jupiter and Saturn that incorporate helium rain, non-adiabatic thermal structures, and "fuzzy" extended heavy-element cores. Building on our previous Ledoux-stable models, we implement improved atmospheric boundary conditions that account for composition-dependent effective temperatures and systematically explore the impact of varying the density ratio parameter R$_{\rho}$, which governs in an approximate way the efficiency of semi-convection. For both Jupiter and Saturn, we construct models spanning R$_{\rho}$=1 (Ledoux) to R$_{\rho}$=0 (Schwarzschild), and identify best-fit solutions that match each planet's effective temperature, equatorial radius, lower-order gravitational moments, and atmospheric composition at 4.56 Gyr. We find that lower R$_{\rho}$ values lead to stronger convective mixing, resulting in higher surface metallicities and lower deep interior temperatures, while requiring reduced heavy-element masses and lower initial entropies to stabilize the dilute inner cores. Our Saturn models also agree with the observed Brunt-Vaisala frequency profile inferred from Cassini ring seismology, with stable layers arising from both the helium rain region and the dilute core. These findings support the presence of complex, compositionally stratified interiors in both gas giants.</description>

      <title>Observed Latitudinal, Longitudinal and Temporal Variability of Io's Atmosphere Simulated by a Purely Sublimation Driven Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How much of Io's SO$_2$ atmosphere is driven by volcanic outgasing or sublimation of SO$_2$ surface frost is a question with a considerable history. We develop a time dependent surface temperature model including thermal inertia and the exact celestial geometry to model the radiation driven global structure and temporal evolution of Io's atmosphere. We show that many observations can be explained by assuming a purely sublimation driven atmosphere. We find that a thermal diffusivity $\alpha=2.41\times10^{-7}$ m$^2$s$^{-1}$ yields an averaged atmospheric SO$_2$ column density decreasing by more than one order of magnitude from the equator to the poles in accordance with the observed spatial variations of Io's column densities. Our model produces a strong day-night-asymmetry with modeled column density variations of almost two orders of magnitude at the equator as well as a sub-anti-Jovian hemisphere asymmetry, with maximum dayside column densities of $3.7\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the sub-Jovian and $8.5\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the anti-Jovian hemisphere. Both are consistent with the observed temporal and large-scale longitudinal variation of Io's atmosphere. We find that the diurnal variations of the surface temperature affect the subsurface structure up to a depth of 0.6m. Furthermore, we quantify seasonal effects with Io having a northern summer close to perihelion and a northern winter close to aphelion. Finally, we found that at Io's anomalous warm polar regions a conductive heat flux of at least 1.2 Wm$^{-2}$ is necessary to reach surface temperatures consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>The HUSTLE Program: The UV to Near-IR Transmission Spectrum of the Hot Jupiter KELT-7b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultraviolet and optical wavelength ranges have proven to be a key addition to infrared observations of exoplanet atmospheres, as they offer unique insights into the properties of clouds and hazes and are sensitive to signatures of disequilibrium chemistry. Here we present the 0.2-0.8 $\mu$m transmission spectrum of the Teq = 2000 K Jupiter KELT-7b, acquired with HST WFC3/UVIS G280 as part of the HUSTLE Treasury program. We combined this new spectrum with the previously published HST WFC3/IR G141 (1.1-1.7 $\mu$m) spectrum and Spitzer photometric points at 3.6$\mu$m and 4.5$\mu$m, to reveal a generally featureless transmission spectrum between 0.2 and 1.7 $\mu$m, with a slight downward slope towards bluer wavelengths, and a asymmetric water feature in the 1.1-1.7 $\mu$m band. Retrieval models conclude that the 0.2 - 1.7$\mu$m spectrum is primarily explained by a high H- abundance ($\sim 10^{-5}$), significantly above the equilibrium chemistry prediction ($\sim 10^{-12}$), suggesting disequilibrium in KELT-7b's upper atmosphere. Our retrievals also suggest the presence of bright inhomogeneities in the stellar surface, and tentative evidence of CO2 at the Spitzer wavelengths. We demonstrate that with the UV-optical coverage provided by WFC3 UVIS/G280, we are able to confirm the presence and constrain the abundance of H-, and obtain evidence for bright stellar inhomogeneities that would have been overlooked using infrared data alone. Observations redward of 1$\mu$m with JWST should be able to further constrain the abundance of H-, as well as confirm the presence of CO2 inferred by the two Spitzer datapoints.</description>

      <title>HD 143006: Interferometric Confirmation of Misaligned Protoplanetary Disc with CHARA/MIRCX and VLTI/PIONIER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outer regions of the protoplanetary disc surrounding the T Tauri star HD 143006 show rings, dust asymmetries and shadows. Whilst rings and dust asymmetries can arise from companions and other mechanisms, shadows and misaligned discs in particular are typically attributed to the presence of misaligned planets or stellar-mass companions. To understand the mechanisms that drive these traits, the innermost regions of discs need to be studied. Using CHARA/MIRCX and VLTI/PIONIER, we observed the sub-au region of HD 143006. We constrain the orientation of the inner disc of HD 143006 and probe whether a misalignment between the inner and outer disc could be the cause of the shadows. Modelling the visibilities using a geometric model, the inclination and position angle are found to be $i=22^\circ\pm 3^\circ$ and $\mathrm{PA}=158^\circ\pm 8^\circ$ respectively, with an inner dust sublimation radius of $\sim0.04$ au. The inner disc is misaligned by $39^\circ\pm4^\circ$ with respect to the outer disc, with the far side of the inner disc to the east and the far side of the outer disc to the west. We constrain $h/R$ (scattering surface/radius of scattered light) of the outer disc at $18$ au to be about $13\%$ by calculating the offset between the shadow position and the central star. No companion was detected, with a magnitude contrast of $4.4$ in the H-band and placing an upper mass limit of $0.17 M_\odot$ at separations of $0-8$ au. Therefore, we cannot confirm or rule out that a low-mass star or giant planet is responsible for the misalignment and dust sub-structures.</description>

      <title>Extreme Learning Machines for Exoplanet Simulations: A Faster, Lightweight Alternative to Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing resolution and coverage of astrophysical and climate data necessitates increasingly sophisticated models, often pushing the limits of computational feasibility. While emulation methods can reduce calculation costs, the neural architectures typically used--optimised via gradient descent--are themselves computationally expensive to train, particularly in terms of data generation requirements. This paper investigates the utility of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a lightweight, non-gradient-based machine learning algorithm for accelerating complex physical models.
  We evaluate ELM surrogate models in two test cases with different data structures: (i) sequentially-structured data, and (ii) image-structured data. For test case (i), where the number of samples $N$ &gt;&gt; the dimensionality of input data $d$, ELMs achieve remarkable efficiency, offering a 100,000$\times$ faster training time and a 40$\times$ faster prediction speed compared to a Bi-Directional Recurrent Neural Network (BIRNN), whilst improving upon BIRNN test performance. For test case (ii), characterised by $d &gt;&gt; N$ and image-based inputs, a single ELM was insufficient, but an ensemble of 50 individual ELM predictors achieves comparable accuracy to a benchmark Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with a 16.4$\times$ reduction in training time, though costing a 6.9$\times$ increase in prediction time. We find different sample efficiency characteristics between the test cases: in test case (i) individual ELMs demonstrate superior sample efficiency, requiring only 0.28% of the training dataset compared to the benchmark BIRNN, while in test case (ii) the ensemble approach requires 78% of the data used by the CNN to achieve comparable results--representing a trade-off between sample efficiency and model complexity.</description>

      <title>Line ratio identification of external photoevaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs, by massive O stars in stellar clusters, is thought to be a significant process in the evolution of a disc. It has been shown to result in significant mass loss and disc truncation, ultimately reducing the lifetime of the discs, and possibly affecting potential planet populations. It is a well-studied process in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) where the cometary morphology of proplyds is spatially resolvable due to its proximity to Earth. However, we need to study external photoevaporation in additional stellar clusters to better understand its prevalence and significance more globally. Unfortunately, more massive stellar clusters where the majority of stars form are much farther away than the ONC. In these more distant clusters the proplyds are spatially unresolvable with current facilities, hence the cometary morphology is not a useful identification of external photoevaporation. Therefore, in order to identify and interpret external photoevaporation, the only observations we have are of spatially unresolved emission lines. To resolve this issue we have used the CLOUDY code to develop an approximate general model of the emission lines emanating from the hot ionized wind of a proplyd. We have used the model to determine which line ratios are most sensitive to the distance from an OB star, and found that the most sensitive line ratios vary by multiple orders of magnitude over an FUV field of between 10$^3$ G$_0$ to 10$^6$ G$_0$. By identifying spatial gradients of line ratios in stellar clusters, we can identify regions of ongoing external photoevaporation.</description>

      <title>Metallicities from High-Resolution TRES Spectra with The Payne and uberMS: Performance Benchmarks and Literature Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the field of exoplanetary astronomy has matured, there has been growing demand for precise stellar abundances to probe subtle correlations between stellar compositions and planetary demographics. However, drawing population-level conclusions from the disparate measurements in the literature is challenging, with various groups measuring metallicities using bespoke codes with differing line lists, radiative transfer models, and other assumptions. Here we use the neural-net framework uberMS to measure iron abundances and alpha enchriments from high-resolution optical spectra observed by the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES), a key resource used for the follow-up of candidate exoplanet hosts. To contextualize these measurements and benchmark the performance of our method, we compare to external constraints on metallicity using the Hyades cluster, wide binaries, and asteroids, to external constraints on $T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log g$ using stars with interferometric radii, and to the results of other abundance measurement methods using overlap samples with the APOGEE and SPOCS catalogs, as well as by applying the SPC method directly to TRES spectra. We find that TRES-uberMS provides parameter estimates with errors of roughly 100K in $T_{\rm eff}$, 0.09dex in $\log g$, and 0.04dex in [Fe/H] for nearby dwarf stars. However, [Fe/H] performance is significantly poorer for mid-to-late K dwarfs, with the bias worsening with decreasing $T_{\rm eff}$. Performance is also worse for evolved stars. Our [$\alpha$/Fe] error may be as good as 0.03dex for dwarfs based on external benchmarks, although there are large systematic differences when comparing with specific alpha-element abundances from other catalogs.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved p-mode oscillations for subgiant HD 142091 with NEID at WIYN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detections of Earth-analog planets in radial velocity observations are limited by stellar astrophysical variability occurring on a variety of timescales. Current state-of-the-art methods to disentangle potential planet signals from intrinsic stellar signals assume that stellar signals introduce asymmetries to the line profiles that can therefore be separated from the pure translational Doppler shifts of planets. Here, we examine this assumption using a time series of resolved stellar p-mode oscillations in HD 142091 ($\kappa$ CrB), as observed on a single night with the NEID spectrograph at 2-minute cadence and with 25 cm/s precision. As an evolved subgiant star, this target has p-mode oscillations that are larger in amplitude (4-8 m/s) and occur on longer timescales (80 min.) than those of typical Sun-like stars of RV surveys, magnifying their corresponding effects on the stellar spectral profile. We show that for HD 142091, p-mode oscillations manifest primarily as pure Doppler shifts in the average line profile -- measured by the cross-correlation function (CCF) -- with "shape-driven" CCF variations as a higher-order effect. Specifically, we find that the amplitude of the shift varies across the CCF bisector, with 10% larger oscillation amplitudes closer to the core of the CCF, and 25% smaller oscillation amplitudes for bisector velocities derived near the wings; we attribute this trend to larger oscillation velocities higher in the stellar atmosphere. Using a line-by-line analysis, we verify that a similar trend is seen as a function of average line depth, with deeper lines showing larger oscillation amplitudes. Finally, we find no evidence that p-mode oscillations have a chromatic dependence across the NEID bandpass beyond that due to intrinsic line depth differences across the spectrum.</description>

      <title>28 Years of Sun-as-a-star Extreme Ultraviolet Light Curves from SOHO EIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) has been taking images of the Solar disk and corona in four narrow EUV bandpasses (171\AA, 195\AA, 284\AA, and 304\AA) at a minimum cadence of once per day since early 1996. The time series of fully-calibrated EIT images now spans approximately 28 years, from early 1996 to early 2024, covering solar cycles 23, 24, and the beginning of cycle 25. We convert this extensive EIT image archive into a time series of `Sun-as-a-star' light curves in EIT's four bandpasses, providing a long-term record of solar EUV variability. These Sun-as-a-star light curves, available for download from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15474179, trace the Sun as if it were a distant point source, viewed from a fixed perspective. We find that our EUV light curves trace the $\sim$ 11-year solar activity cycle and the $\sim$ 27-day rotation period much better than comparable optical observations. In particular, we can accurately recover the solar rotation period from our 284\AA light curve for 26 out of 28 calendar years of EIT observations (93% of the time), compared to only 3 out of 29 calendar years (10% of the time) of the VIRGO total solar irradiance time series, which is dominated by optical light. Our EIT light curves, in conjunction with Sun-as-a-star light curves at optical wavelengths, will be valuable to those interested in inferring the EUV/UV character of stars with long optical light curves but no intensive UV observations, as well as to those interested in long-term records of solar and space weather.</description>

Abstract: We present the numerical lunar time ephemeris LTE440 based on the definition of Lunar Coordinate Time (TCL) given by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in IAU 2024 Resolution II. LTE440 can be used to obtain the numerical transformation between TCL and Solar System Barycentric Dynamical Time (TCL-TDB) or Solar System Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCL-TCB). The theoretical model, numerical method, and performance of LTE440 are discussed. The secular drifts between TCL and TDB and between TCL and TCB are respectively estimated as $\left&lt; d\mathrm{TCL}/d\mathrm{TDB}\right&gt;=1-6.798\,355\,238\times10^{-10}$, and $\left&lt; d\mathrm{TCL}/d\mathrm{TCB}\right&gt;=1-1.482\,536\,216\,67\times10^{-8}$. The most significant periodic terms have amplitudes of about 1651 microseconds for the annual term and 126 microseconds for the monthly term. The precision of LTE440 is estimated to be at the level of several picoseconds. LTE440 is freely available at https://github.com/xlucn/LTE440.</description>

      <title>Reassessing Sub-Neptune Structure, Radii, and Thermal Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel python-based 1D sub-Neptune evolution model that emphasizes the thermal evolution and potential solidification of the rock/iron core and the structure of the radiative atmosphere. This model explores planetary structure from the molten center to nbar pressure levels. Treating the radiative atmosphere is crucial for sub-Neptunes, due to the large scale height and low gravity, which contributes up to 40\% of their observed radius, especially for low-mass, highly irradiated planets. Consequently, we generically find that lower H/He mass fractions are needed to match a given planetary radius, compared to previous work. While the presence of metal-enrichment in the H/He layers (here modeled as 50$\times$ solar) does not substantially influence the size of the convective envelope, it notably reduces the transit radius by shrinking the radiative atmospheric scale height. Sub-Neptunes cool differently from terrestrial planets, with the rock/iron core's cooling rate limited by the envelope, leading to longer solidification timescales. Complete solidification of the silicate mantle by 10 Gyr is found only for planets with very low masses ($\leq 1M_\oplus$) and small H/He envelopes ($\leq$ 0.1\%). Dynamo action in sub-Neptune iron cores persists as long as the mantle surface remains molten, often exceeding 10 Gyr, and becomes sensitive to core thermal conductivity after solidification. We examine aspects of ''boil-off,'' which sets the maximum allowed H/He mass and planetary radius for subsequent evolution. The rock/iron's cooling energy moderately decreases the post-boil-off H/He mass fraction in planets with large atmospheric scale heights only.</description>

      <title>11 New Transiting Brown Dwarfs and Very Low Mass Stars from TESS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 11 new transiting brown dwarfs and low-mass M-dwarfs from NASA's TESS mission: TOI-2844, TOI-3122, TOI-3577, TOI-3755, TOI-4462, TOI-4635, TOI-4737, TOI-4759, TOI-5240, TOI-5467, and TOI-5882. They consist of 5 brown dwarf companions and 6 very low mass stellar companions ranging in mass from $25 M_{\rm J}$ to $128 M_{\rm J}$. We used a combination of photometric time-series, spectroscopic, and high resolution imaging follow-up as a part of the TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP) in order to characterize each system. With over 50 transiting brown dwarfs confirmed, we now have a large enough sample to directly test different formation and evolutionary scenarios. We provide a renewed perspective on the transiting brown dwarf desert and its role in differentiating between planetary and stellar formation mechanisms. Our analysis of the eccentricity distribution for the transiting brown dwarf sample does not support previous claims of a transition between planetary and stellar formation at $\sim42$ $M_{\rm J}$. We also contribute a first look into the metallicity distribution of transiting companions in the range $7 - 150$ $M_{\rm J}$, showing that this too does not support a $\sim42$ $M_{\rm J}$ transition. Finally, we also detect a significant lithium absorption feature in one of the brown dwarf hosts (TOI-5882) but determine that the host star is likely old based on rotation, kinematic, and photometric measurements. We therefore claim that TOI-5882 may be a candidate for planetary engulfment.</description>

      <title>Polar motion of Venus</title>

Abstract: Five Venus missions are under development to study the planet in the next decade, with both NASA's VERITAS and ESA's EnVision featuring a geophysical investigation among their objectives. Their radar and gravity experiments will determine Venus's orientation, enabling analyses of its spin dynamics to infer relevant geophysical and atmospheric properties. This work aims to characterize Venus's polar motion, defined as the motion of its spin axis in a body-fixed frame. We focus on signatures from its interior and atmosphere to support potential detections of polar motion by future orbiters. We developed a polar motion model for a triaxial planet accounting for solar torque, centrifugal and tidal deformations of a viscoelastic mantle, and atmospheric dynamics. Core-mantle coupling effects were analyzed separately, considering a simplified spherical core. We computed the period and damping time of the free motion (i.e., the Chandler wobble) and determined the frequencies and amplitudes of the forced motion. We revisited the Chandler frequency expression. Solar torque is the dominant phenomenon affecting Venus's Chandler frequency, increasing it by a factor of 2.75. Our model predicts a Chandler period in the range [12900 ; 18900] years. The Chandler wobble appears as a linear polar drift of about 90 meters on Venus's surface during EnVision's 4-year primary mission, at the limit of its resolution. We also predict forced polar motion oscillations with an amplitude of about 20 meters, driven by the atmosphere and the solar torque. Compared to the 240 meter spin axis precession occurring in inertial space over this duration, these results suggest that Venus's polar motion could also be detectable by future orbiters. Polar motion should be incorporated into rotation models when anticipating these missions, providing additional constraints on the interior structure of Venus.</description>
