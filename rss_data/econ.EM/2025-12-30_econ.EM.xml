      <title>Canonical correlation regression with noisy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study instrumental variable regression in data rich environments. The goal is to estimate a linear model from many noisy covariates and many noisy instruments. Our key assumption is that true covariates and true instruments are repetitive, though possibly different in nature; they each reflect a few underlying factors, however those underlying factors may be misaligned. We analyze a family of estimators based on two stage least squares with spectral regularization: canonical correlations between covariates and instruments are learned in the first stage, which are used as regressors in the second stage. As a theoretical contribution, we derive upper and lower bounds on estimation error, proving optimality of the method with noisy data. As a practical contribution, we provide guidance on which types of spectral regularization to use in different regimes.</description>

      <title>Causal-Policy Forest for End-to-End Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes an end-to-end algorithm for policy learning in causal inference. We observe data consisting of covariates, treatment assignments, and outcomes, where only the outcome corresponding to the assigned treatment is observed. The goal of policy learning is to train a policy from the observed data, where a policy is a function that recommends an optimal treatment for each individual, to maximize the policy value. In this study, we first show that maximizing the policy value is equivalent to minimizing the mean squared error for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) under $\{-1, 1\}$ restricted regression models. Based on this finding, we modify the causal forest, an end-to-end CATE estimation algorithm, for policy learning. We refer to our algorithm as the causal-policy forest. Our algorithm has three advantages. First, it is a simple modification of an existing, widely used CATE estimation method, therefore, it helps bridge the gap between policy learning and CATE estimation in practice. Second, while existing studies typically estimate nuisance parameters for policy learning as a separate task, our algorithm trains the policy in a more end-to-end manner. Third, as in standard decision trees and random forests, we train the models efficiently, avoiding computational intractability.</description>

      <title>Computing Nash equilibria for product design based on hierarchical Bayesian mixed logit models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite a substantial body of theoretical and empirical research in the fields of conjoint and discrete choice analysis as well as product line optimization, relatively few papers focused on the simulation of subsequent competitive dynamics employing non-cooperative game theory. Only a fraction of the existing frameworks explored competition on both product price and design, none of which used fully Bayesian choice models for simulation. Most crucially, no one has yet assessed the choice models' ability to uncover the true equilibria, let alone under different types of choice behavior. Our analysis of thousands of Nash equilibria, derived in full and numerically exact on the basis of real prices and costs, provides evidence that the capability of state-of-the-art mixed logit models to reveal the true Nash equilibria seems to be primarily contingent upon the type of choice behavior (probabilistic versus deterministic), regardless of the number of competing firms, offered products and features in the market, as well as the degree of preference heterogeneity and disturbance. Generally, the highest equilibrium recovery is achieved when applying a deterministic choice rule to estimated preferences given deterministic choice behavior in reality. It is especially in the latter setting that incorporating Bayesian (hyper)parameter uncertainty further enhances the detection rate compared to posterior means. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the above factors on other equilibrium characteristics such as product (line) differentiation.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Identification of Demand without Exogenous Product Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the identification of differentiated product demand with exogenous supply-side instruments, allowing product characteristics to be endogenous. Past analyses have argued that exogenous characteristic-based instruments are essentially necessary given a sufficiently flexible demand model with a suitable index restriction. We show, however, that price counterfactuals are nonparametrically identified by recentered instruments -- which combine exogenous shocks to prices with endogenous product characteristics -- under a weaker index restriction and a new condition we term faithfulness. We argue that faithfulness, like the usual completeness condition for nonparametric identification with instruments, can be viewed as a technical requirement on the richness of identifying variation rather than a substantive economic restriction, and we show that it holds under a variety of non-nested conditions on either price-setting or the index.</description>

      <title>From Model Choice to Model Belief: Establishing a New Measure for LLM-Based Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human behavior, but common practices to use LLM-generated data are inefficient. Treating an LLM's output ("model choice") as a single data point underutilizes the information inherent to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. This paper introduces and formalizes "model belief," a measure derived from an LLM's token-level probabilities that captures the model's belief distribution over choice alternatives in a single generation run. The authors prove that model belief is asymptotically equivalent to the mean of model choices (a non-trivial property) but forms a more statistically efficient estimator, with lower variance and a faster convergence rate. Analogous properties are shown to hold for smooth functions of model belief and model choice often used in downstream applications. The authors demonstrate the performance of model belief through a demand estimation study, where an LLM simulates consumer responses to different prices. In practical settings with limited numbers of runs, model belief explains and predicts ground-truth model choice better than model choice itself, and reduces the computation needed to reach sufficiently accurate estimates by roughly a factor of 20. The findings support using model belief as the default measure to extract more information from LLM-generated data.</description>

      <title>Impact of Volatility on Time-Based Transaction Ordering Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Arbitrum's Express Lane Auction (ELA), an ahead-of-time second-price auction that grants the winner an exclusive latency advantage for one minute. Building on a single-round model with risk-averse bidders, we propose a hypothesis that the value of priority access is discounted relative to risk-neutral valuation due to the difficulty of forecasting short-horizon volatility and bidders' risk aversion. We test these predictions using ELA bid records matched to high-frequency ETH prices and find that the result is consistent with the model.</description>

      <title>Panel Coupled Matrix-Tensor Clustering Model with Applications to Asset Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle the challenge of estimating grouping structures and factor loadings in asset pricing models, where traditional regressions struggle due to sparse data and high noise. Existing approaches, such as those using fused penalties and multi-task learning, often enforce coefficient homogeneity across cross-sectional units, reducing flexibility. Clustering methods (e.g., spectral clustering, Lloyd's algorithm) achieve consistent recovery under specific conditions but typically rely on a single data source. To address these limitations, we introduce the Panel Coupled Matrix-Tensor Clustering (PMTC) model, which simultaneously leverages a characteristics tensor and a return matrix to identify latent asset groups. By integrating these data sources, we develop computationally efficient tensor clustering algorithms that enhance both clustering accuracy and factor loading estimation. Simulations demonstrate that our methods outperform single-source alternatives in clustering accuracy and coefficient estimation, particularly under moderate signal-to-noise conditions. Empirical application to U.S. equities demonstrates the practical value of PMTC, yielding higher out-of-sample total $R^2$ and economically interpretable variation in factor exposures.</description>

      <title>Bellman Calibration for V-Learning in Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Iterated Bellman Calibration, a simple, model-agnostic, post-hoc procedure for calibrating off-policy value predictions in infinite-horizon Markov decision processes. Bellman calibration requires that states with similar predicted long-term returns exhibit one-step returns consistent with the Bellman equation under the target policy. We adapt classical histogram and isotonic calibration to the dynamic, counterfactual setting by repeatedly regressing fitted Bellman targets onto a model's predictions, using a doubly robust pseudo-outcome to handle off-policy data. This yields a one-dimensional fitted value iteration scheme that can be applied to any value estimator. Our analysis provides finite-sample guarantees for both calibration and prediction under weak assumptions, and critically, without requiring Bellman completeness or realizability.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies nonparametric identification and estimation of causal effects in centralized school assignment. In many centralized assignment algorithms, students face both lottery-driven variation and regression discontinuity- (RD) driven variation. We characterize the full set of identified atomic treatment effects (aTEs), defined as the conditional average treatment effect between a pair of schools given student characteristics. Atomic treatment effects are the building blocks of more aggregated treatment contrasts, and common approaches to estimating aTE aggregations can mask important heterogeneity. In particular, many aggregations of aTEs put zero weight on aTEs driven by RD variation, and estimators of such aggregations put asymptotically vanishing weight on the RD-driven aTEs. We provide a diagnostic and recommend new aggregation schemes. Lastly, we provide estimators and asymptotic results for inference on these aggregations.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Causal Inference Under Network Confounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07823v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies causal inference with observational data from a single large network. We consider a nonparametric model with interference in both potential outcomes and selection into treatment. Specifically, both stages may be the outcomes of simultaneous equations models, allowing for endogenous peer effects. This results in high-dimensional network confounding where the network and covariates of all units constitute sources of selection bias. In contrast, the existing literature assumes that confounding can be summarized by a known, low-dimensional function of these objects. We propose to use graph neural networks (GNNs) to adjust for network confounding. When interference decays with network distance, we argue that the model has low-dimensional structure that makes estimation feasible and justifies the use of shallow GNN architectures.</description>

      <title>Estimating Effects of Long-Term Treatments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the effects of long-term treatments through A/B testing is challenging. Treatments, such as updates to product functionalities, user interface designs, and recommendation algorithms, are intended to persist within the system for a long duration of time after their initial launches. However, due to the constraints of conducting long-term experiments, practitioners often rely on short-term experimental results to make product launch decisions. It remains open how to accurately estimate the effects of long-term treatments using short-term experimental data. To address this question, we introduce a longitudinal surrogate framework that decomposes the long-term effects into functions based on user attributes, short-term metrics, and treatment assignments. We outline identification assumptions, estimation strategies, inferential techniques, and validation methods under this framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing solutions by using data from two real-world experiments, each involving more than a million users on WeChat, one of the world's largest social networking platforms.</description>

      <title>Estimating Counterfactual Matrix Means with Short Panel Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a spectral approach for identifying and estimating average counterfactual outcomes under a low-rank factor model with short panel data and general outcome missingness patterns. Applications include event studies and studies of outcomes of "matches" between agents of two types, e.g. people and places, typically conducted using less-flexible Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE) models of outcomes. Given finite observed outcomes per unit, we show our approach identifies all counterfactual outcome means, including those not identified by existing methods, if a particular graph algorithm determines that units' sets of observed outcomes have sufficient overlap. Our analogous, computationally efficient estimation procedure yields consistent, asymptotically normal estimates of counterfactual outcome means under fixed-$T$ (number of outcomes), large-$N$ (sample size) asymptotics. When estimating province-level averages of held-out wages from an Italian matched employer-employee dataset, our estimator outperforms a TWFE-model-based estimator.</description>

      <title>Inference on High Dimensional Selective Labeling Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18381v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of simultaneous equation models arise in the many domains where observed binary outcomes are themselves a consequence of the existing choices of of one of the agents in the model. These models are gaining increasing interest in the computer science and machine learning literatures where they refer the potentially endogenous sample selection as the {\em selective labels} problem. Empirical settings for such models arise in fields as diverse as criminal justice, health care, and insurance. For important recent work in this area, see for example Lakkaruju et al. (2017), Kleinberg et al. (2018), and Coston et al.(2021) where the authors focus on judicial bail decisions, and where one observes the outcome of whether a defendant filed to return for their court appearance only if the judge in the case decides to release the defendant on bail. Identifying and estimating such models can be computationally challenging for two reasons. One is the nonconcavity of the bivariate likelihood function, and the other is the large number of covariates in each equation. Despite these challenges, in this paper we propose a novel distribution free estimation procedure that is computationally friendly in many covariates settings. The new method combines the semiparametric batched gradient descent algorithm introduced in Khan et al.(2023) with a novel sorting algorithms incorporated to control for selection bias. Asymptotic properties of the new procedure are established under increasing dimension conditions in both equations, and its finite sample properties are explored through a simulation study and an application using judicial bail data.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Properties of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator for Markov-switching Observation-driven Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Markov-switching observation-driven model is a stochastic process $((S_t,Y_t))_{t \in \mathbb{Z}}$ where $(S_t)_{t \in \mathbb{Z}}$ is an unobserved Markov chain on a finite set and $(Y_t)_{t \in \mathbb{Z}}$ is an observed stochastic process such that the conditional distribution of $Y_t$ given $(Y_\tau)_{\tau \leq t-1}$ and $(S_\tau)_{\tau \leq t}$ depends on $(Y_\tau)_{\tau \leq t-1}$ and $S_t$. In this paper, we prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator for such model. As a special case, we also give conditions under which the maximum likelihood estimator for the widely applied Markov-switching generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model introduced by Haas, Mittnik, and Paolella (2004b) is consistent and asymptotically normal.</description>

      <title>EASI Drugs in the Streets of Colombia: Modeling Heterogeneous and Endogenous Drug Preferences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The response of illicit drug consumers to policy changes like legalization is mediated by demand behavior. Since individual drug use is driven by many unobservable factors, accounting for unobserved heterogeneity becomes crucial for designing targeted policies. This paper introduces a finite Gaussian mixture of EASI demand systems to estimate joint demand for marijuana, cocaine, and basuco (a low-purity cocaine paste) in Colombia, accounting for corner solutions and endogenous prices. Our method classifies users into two groups with distinct preferences over consumption: "soft" and "hard" users. Nationally representative survey estimates find drugs are unit-elastic, with marijuana and cocaine complementary. International marijuana legalization episodes along with Colombia's low marijuana production cost suggest legalization is likely to drive prices down significantly. Legalization counterfactuals under the most likely scenario of a 50\% marijuana price decrease reveal \$363/year welfare gains for consumers, \$120M in governement revenue, and \$127M dealer losses.</description>

      <title>Learning What to Learn: Experimental Design when Combining Experimental with Observational Evidence</title>

Abstract: Experiments deliver credible treatment-effect estimates but, because they are costly, are often restricted to specific sites, small populations, or particular mechanisms. A common practice across several fields is therefore to combine experimental estimates with reduced-form or structural external (observational) evidence to answer broader policy questions such as those involving general equilibrium effects or external validity. We develop a unified framework for the design of experiments when combined with external evidence, i.e., choosing which experiment(s) to run and how to allocate sample size under arbitrary budget constraints. Because observational evidence may suffer bias unknown ex-ante, we evaluate designs using a minimax proportional-regret criterion that compares any candidate design to an oracle that knows the observational study bias and jointly chooses the design and estimator. This yields a transparent bias-variance trade-off that does not require the researcher to specify a bias bound and relies only on information already needed for conventional power calculations. We illustrate the framework by (i) designing cash-transfer experiments aimed at estimating general equilibrium effects and (ii) optimizing site selection for microfinance interventions.</description>

      <title>Identification of Multivariate Measurement Error Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops new identification results for multidimensional continuous measurement-error models where all observed measurements are contaminated by potentially correlated errors and none provides an injective mapping of the latent distribution. Using third order cross moments, the paper constructs a three way tensor whose unique decomposition, guaranteed by Kruskal theorem, identifies the factor loading matrices. Starting with a linear structure, the paper recovers the full distribution of latent factors by constructing suitable measurements and applying scalar or multivariate versions of Kotlarski identity. As a result, the joint distribution of the latent vector and measurement errors is fully identified without requiring injective measurements, showing that multivariate latent structure can be recovered in broader settings than previously believed. Under injectivity, the paper also provides user-friendly testable conditions for identification. Finally, this paper provides general identification results for nonlinear models using a newly-defined generalized Kruskal rank - signal rank - of intergral operators. These results have wide applicability in empirical work involving noisy or indirect measurements, including factor models, survey data with reporting errors, mismeasured regressors in econometrics, and multidimensional latent-trait models in psychology and marketing, potentially enabling more robust estimation and interpretation when clean measurements are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Learning the Macroeconomic Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), seemingly inapplicable to the small samples typical of macroeconomics, can be trained effectively for macroeconomic forecasting. We estimate a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model on an initial segment of the data to obtain a posterior distribution over structural parameters. We sample from this posterior to generate millions of theory-consistent synthetic panels that, when mixed with actual macroeconomic data, form the training corpus for a time-series transformer with attention. The trained model is then used to forecast out-of-sample through 2025. The results show that this hybrid forecaster, which combines the theoretical coherence of DSGE models with the representational power of modern LLMs, learns key features of the macroeconomic language.</description>

      <title>The Aligned Economic Index &amp; The State Switching Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A growing empirical literature suggests that equity-premium predictability is state dependent, with much of the forecasting power concentrated around recessionary periods (Henkel et al., 2011; Dangl and Halling, 2012; Devpura et al., 2018). I study U.S. stock return predictability across economic regimes and document strong evidence of time-varying expected returns across both expansionary and contractionary states. I contribute in two ways. First, I introduce a state-switching predictive regression in which the market state is defined in real time using the slope of the yield curve. Relative to the standard one-state predictive regression, the state-switching specification increases both in-sample and out-of-sample performance for the set of popular predictors considered by Welch and Goyal (2008), improving the out-of-sample performance of most predictors in economically meaningful ways. Second, I propose a new aggregate predictor, the Aligned Economic Index, constructed via partial least squares (PLS). Under the state-switching model, the Aligned Economic Index exhibits statistically and economically significant predictive power in sample and out of sample, and it outperforms widely used benchmark predictors and alternative predictor-combination methods.</description>
