      <title>Deep Searches for Radio Pulsations and Bursts from Four Magnetar and a Magnetar-like pulsar with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on radio observations of four magnetars SGR 0501+4516, Swift 1834.9-0846, 1E 1841-045, SGR 1900+14 and a magnetar-like pulsar PSR J1846-0258 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) at 1250 MHz. Notably, PSR J1846-0258 was observed one month after its 2020 X-ray outburst. The data from these observations were searched for periodic emissions and single pulses. No radio emission was detected for any of our targets. After accounting for the effect of red noise, the non-detections yield stringent upper limits on the radio flux density, with $S_{1250} \leq 16.9\, \mu $Jy for the four magnetars and the magnetar-like pulsar, along with constraints on single-pulse flux densities. Our deep radio observations suggest that these magnetars and the magnetar-like pulsar are indeed radio-quiet sources or unfavorably beamed. The resulting flux upper limits, along with previous findings, are discussed, highlighting the significance of further radio observations of radio-quiet magnetars and the high-B magnetar-like pulsar.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Gamma Ray Burst Lightcurves: A Machine/Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), which are highly energetic bursts, have been detected at high redshifts (z = 9.4) and are pivotal for cosmological research and the study of Population III stars. To address these studies, it is important to identify correlations between the key GRB variables while minimizing uncertainties. This requires comprehensive coverage of GRB Light curves (LCs), which are challenging to obtain given the observational gaps and noise. This study explores the reconstruction of GRB LCs using three machine-learning models: Bi-LSTM, CGAN, and a Sarimax-based Kalman filter. To evaluate these approaches, we also include well-established functional form parametric methods such as the Willingale model (W07) and the non-parametric Gaussian Processes (GPs), expanding upon arXiv:2305.12126 by applying our techniques to a larger sample of 545 GRBs, covering four different GRB classifications. Our findings reveal that the LSTM model achieves the highest reductions in the uncertainties of the plateau parameters, with decreases of 29% in log Ta, 31% in log Fa and 40% in {\alpha}. In comparison, GPs show a slightly smaller reduction of 22% in both log Ta and log Fa, and 32% in {\alpha} while CGANs exhibit a decrease of 23% in log Ta, 24% in log Fa, and 31% in {\alpha}. The Sarimax-based Kalman filter performs well for well-sampled and flare-free GRBs, but it has problems with reconstruction in more complex cases. It shows a decrease of 14% in log Ta, 5% in log Fa and 6% in {\alpha}. [..] For the subset of 299 Good GRBs, namely with well-defined plateau emission with no flares and bumps, the LSTM model achieved a reduction of approximately 40%, with a percentage increase of 8% compared to the results observed in arXiv:2305.12126. [..] These advancements are essential for using GRBs as standard candles in cosmology and investigating theoretical models.[..]</description>

      <title>Neutron star stability beyond the mass peak: assessing the role of out-of-equilibrium perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the radial stability of neutron stars under conditions where their composition may or may not remain in chemical equilibrium during oscillations. Using different equations of state that include nucleons, hyperons, and/or $\Delta$ resonances, we compute stellar configurations and examine their fundamental mode frequencies in two limiting scenarios. In one limit, nuclear reactions are fast enough to maintain chemical equilibrium throughout the pulsation, resulting in a lower effective adiabatic index, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{EQ}}$, and softer stellar responses. In the opposite limit, nuclear reactions are too slow to adjust particle abundances during oscillations, yielding a higher index, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{FR}}$, and stiffer stellar responses. We find that the equilibrium scenario triggers dynamic instability at the maximum mass configuration, whereas the frozen composition scenario allows stable solutions to persist beyond this mass, extending the stable branch. This effect is modest for simpler equations of state, but becomes increasingly pronounced for more complex compositions, where the emergence of new particle species at high densities leads to a significant disparity between $\Gamma_{\mathrm{EQ}}$ and $\Gamma_{\mathrm{FR}}$. Realistic conditions, in which different nuclear reactions have distinct timescales, will place the effective $\Gamma$ between these two extreme values. Short-timescale reactions push the star toward the equilibrium limit, potentially restricting the length of the stable branch. Conversely, slow reactions preserve a frozen composition, allowing the stable branch to grow. Thus, the actual extent of the stable configuration range depends critically on the interplay between nuclear-reaction timescales and the star's fundamental oscillation period.</description>

      <title>SgrA* spin and mass estimates through the detection of multiple extremely large mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the parameter estimation accuracy that can be achieved for the mass and spin of SgrA*, the SMBH in our Galactic Center, by detecting multiple extremely large mass-ratio inspirals (XMRIs). XMRIs are formed by brown dwarfs (BD) inspiraling into a supermassive black hole (SMBH), thus emitting gravitational waves (GWs) inside the detection band of future space-based detectors such as LISA and TianQin. Theoretical estimates suggest the presence of approximately 10 XMRIs emitting detectable GWs, making them some of the most promising candidates for space-based GW detectors. Our analysis indicates that even if individual sources have low SNRs ($\approx10$), high-precision parameter estimates can still be achieved by detecting multiple sources. In this case, the accuracy of the parameter estimates increases by approximately one to two orders of magnitude, at least. Moreover, by analyzing a small sample of 400 initial conditions for XMRIs formed in the Galactic Center, we estimate that almost 80 % of the detectable XMRIs orbiting SgrA* will have eccentricities between 0.43 to 0.95 and an SNR$\in [10,100]$. The remaining $\sim$20 % of the sources have an SNR$\in [100,1000]$ and eccentricities ranging from 0.25 to 0.92. Additionally, some XMRIs with high SNR are far from being circular. These loud sources with SNR$\approx 1000$ can have eccentricities as high as $e\approx0.7$; although their detection chances are low, representing $\lesssim$2 % of the detectable sources, their presence is not ruled out.</description>

      <title>Diprotodon on the sky. The Large Galactic Supernova Remnant (SNR) G278.94+1.35</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a re-discovery of G278.94+1.35 as possibly one of the largest known Galactic supernova remnants (SNR) - that we name Diprotodon. While previously established as a Galactic SNR, Diprotodon is visible in our new EMU and GLEAM radio continuum images at an angular size of 3.33x3.23 deg, much larger than previously measured. At the previously suggested distance of 2.7 kpc, this implies a diameter of 157x152 pc. This size would qualify Diprotodon as the largest known SNR and pushes our estimates of SNR sizes to the upper limits. We investigate the environment in which the SNR is located and examine various scenarios that might explain such a large and relatively bright SNR appearance. We find that Diprotodon is most likely at a much closer distance of $\sim$1 kpc, implying its diameter is 58x56 pc and it is in the radiative evolutionary phase. We also present a new Fermi-LAT data analysis that confirms the angular extent of the SNR in gamma-rays. The origin of the high-energy emission remains somewhat puzzling, and the scenarios we explore reveal new puzzles, given this unexpected and unique observation of a seemingly evolved SNR having a hard GeV spectrum with no breaks. We explore both leptonic and hadronic scenarios, as well as the possibility that the high-energy emission arises from the leftover particle population of a historic pulsar wind nebula.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the flaring activity in early 2015 of BL Lacertae object S5 0716+714</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyzed multi-wavelength data of the BL Lac object S5 0716+714 to investigate its emission mechanisms during a flaring state observed in early 2015. We examined the temporal behavior and broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) during the flare. The size of the $\gamma$-ray emission region was estimated based on the variability timescale. To explore the multi-wavelength properties of S5 0716+714, we employed three one-zone models: the SSC model, the SSC plus EC model, and the SSC plus pp interactions model, to reproduce the SEDs. Our findings indicate that while the SSC model can describe the SEDs, it requires an extreme Doppler factor. In contrast, the SSC plus EC model successfully fits the SEDs under the assumption of weak external photon fields but requires a high Doppler factor. Additionally, the SSC plus interactions model also reproduces the SEDs, with $\gamma$-ray emission originating from $\pi^{0}$ decay. However, this model leads to a jet power that exceeds the Eddington luminosity, which remains plausible due to the flaring state or the presence of a highly collimated jet.</description>

      <title>Hint at an axion-like particle from GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection by the LHAASO Collaboration of the gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A at redshift $z = 0.151$ with energies up to $(13-18) \, \rm TeV$ challenges conventional physics. Photons emitted with energies above $10 \, \rm TeV$ at this redshift can hardly be observed on Earth due to their interaction with the extragalactic background light (EBL). We show that indeed the LHAASO Collaboration should not have observed photons with energies above $10 \, \rm TeV$ if the state-of-the-art EBL model by Saldana-Lopez et al. is taken into account. A problem therefore arises: the Universe should be more transparent than currently believed. We also show that the issue is solved if we introduce the interaction of photons with axion-like particles (ALPs). ALPs are predicted by String Theory, are among the best candidates for dark matter and can produce spectral and polarization effects on astrophysical sources in the presence of external magnetic fields. In particular, for GRB 221009A, photon-ALP oscillations occur within the crossed magnetized media, i.e. the host galaxy, the extragalactic space, the Milky Way, partially reducing the EBL absorption to a level that explains the LHAASO detection of GRB 221009A and its observed spectrum without the need of contrived choices of parameter values, which are instead compulsory within proposed emission models within conventional physics. This fact regarding GRB 221009A represents a strong hint at the ALP existence, which adds to two other indications coming from blazars, a class of active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Counting the Unseen II: Tidal Disruption Event Rates in Nearby Galaxies with REPTiDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are a class of transients that occur when a star is destroyed by the tides of a massive black hole (MBH). Their rates encode valuable MBH demographic information, but this can only be extracted if accurate TDE rate predictions are available for comparisons with observed rates. In this work, we present a new, observer-friendly Python package called REPTiDE, which implements a standard loss cone model for computing TDE rates given a stellar density distribution and an MBH mass. We apply this software to a representative sample of 91 nearby galaxies over a wide range of stellar masses with high-resolution nuclear density measurements from arXiv:2407.10911. We measure per-galaxy TDE rates ranging between 10$^{-7.7}$ and 10$^{-2.9}$ per year and find that the sample-averaged rates agree well with observations. We find a turnover in the TDE rate as a function of both galaxy stellar mass and black hole mass, with the peak rates being observed in galaxies at a galaxy mass of $10^{9.5}$ M$_\odot$ and a black hole mass of $10^{6.5}$ M$_\odot$. Despite the lower TDE rates inferred for intermediate-mass black holes, we find that they have gained a higher fraction of their mass through TDEs when compared to higher mass black holes. This growth of lower mass black holes through TDEs can enable us to place interesting constraints on their spins; we find maximum spins of $a_\bullet \approx 0.9$ for black holes with masses below $\sim10^{5.5}$ M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Stiffening of matter in quark-hadron continuity: a mini-review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of neutron stars, combined with causality, thermodynamic stability, and nuclear constraints, indicate rapid stiffening of QCD matter at density slightly above nuclear saturation density ($n_0 \simeq 0.16\,{\rm fm}^{-3}$). The evolution of the stiffening is quicker than expected from purely nucleonic models with many-body repulsion. Taking into account the quark substructure of baryons, we argue that the saturation of quarks states occur at $\sim$ 2-3$n_0$, driving the quark matter formation even before baryonic cores of the radii $\sim$0.5 fm spatially overlap. We describe the continuous transitions from hadronic to quark matter are described within a quarkyonic matter model in which gluons are assumed to be confining at density of interest. To obtain analytic insights for the transient regime, we construct an ideal model of quarkyonic matter, IdylliQ model, in which one can freely switch from baryonic to quark languages and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Evolution of massive black hole in galactic nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scenario for mass evolution of massive black holes (MBH) in galactic nuclei, to explain both the mass correlation of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) with the bulge and the down-sizing behavior of the active galactic nuclei. Primordial gas structures to evolve galactic bulges are supposed to be formed at $z \sim$ 10 and the core region, called the nuclear region (NR) here, is considered to be a place for a MBH to grow to the SMBH. The down-sizing behavior requires the MBH to significantly increase the mass in a time $\sim$ 1 Gyr. The rapid mass increase is discussed to be realized only when the MBH stays in a very high density region such as a core of a molecular cloud throughout the period $\sim$ 1 Gyr. According to these arguments, the MBHs formed from the population III stars born in the mini halos at $z \sim$ 20 - 30 are excluded from the candidates for the seed black hole to the SMBH and only the MBHs from the population II stars born in the core of the central molecular cloud (CMC) in the NR remain as them. The MBHs in the dense core of the CMC started increasing the mass through mass-accretion and the most massive black hole (MMBH) got the most rapid evolution, possibly restraining relatively slow evolutions of the less massive black holes. Dynamical interactions of the MMBH with the ambient MCs induced the wandering motion and the further mass-increase. However, when the MMBH mass exceeded a boundary mass, the dynamical friction with the field stars brakes the MMBH wandering and the mass accretion. This scenario can semi-quantitatively reproduce both the down-sizing behavior and the SMBH mass - bulge mass correlation with reasonable parameter values.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing and Image Distortion by Buchdahl Inspired Metric in $\mathcal{R}^2$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational lensing by \textit{special} Buchdahl inspired metric with the Buchdahl parameter $\tilde{k}$. In strong deflection limit, we derive the deflection angle analytically for the light rays that diverge as photons approach the photon sphere. These are then used in order to compute the angular image positions modeling supermassive black holes, Sgr A* and M87* as lenses. The Einstein rings for the outermost relativistic images are also depicted here alongside observational constraints on $\tilde{k}$ by the Einstein radius and lens mass. Constraints on $\tilde{k}$ are obtained modelling black holes ( Sgr A* and M87*) and Canarias Einstein ring. In weak deflection limit, the analytic expression of deflection angle of the subject asymptotically flat metric in $\mathcal{R}^2$ gravity is determined using the Gauss Bonnet theorem. Considering M87* as a lens, weak deflection angle is used to study the image magnification and image distortion for primary and secondary images. It is shown that image distortion satisfies the hypothesis of Virbhadra. Moreover, it is seen that our general expression of deflection angle reduces, as a special case, to the deflection angle of Schwarzschild metric in both weak and strong deflection limits.</description>

      <title>Pre-trained Audio Transformer as a Foundational AI Tool for Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As gravitational wave detectors become more advanced and sensitive, the number of signals recorded by Advanced LIGO and Virgo from merging compact objects is expected to rise dramatically. This surge in detection rates necessitates the development of adaptable, scalable, and efficient tools capable of addressing a wide range of tasks in gravitational wave astronomy. Foundational AI models present a transformative opportunity in this context by providing a unified framework that can be fine tuned for diverse applications while leveraging the power of large scale pre training. In this work, we explore how advanced transformer models, specifically Whisper by OpenAI, can be adapted as a foundational model for gravitational wave data analysis. By fine tuning the encoder model of Whisper, originally trained on extensive audio data, and combining it with neural networks for specialized tasks, we achieve reliable results in detecting astrophysical signals and classifying transient noise artifacts or glitches.

      <title>Superradiance in acoustic black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating superradiance in cylinders has recently been observed experimentally using acoustic waves to shed light on the understanding of the superradiant phenomenon in black holes. In this paper, for the first time, we study superradiance in acoustic black holes through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation using COMSOL multiphysics. We find that superradiance can occur in acoustic black holes when the general superradiance condition is met. We also find the amplification effect is significantly weaker in acoustic black holes than in regular cylinders, due to the absorption in such structure.</description>

      <title>Probing Heavy Axion-like Particles from Massive Stars with X-rays and Gamma Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot interiors of massive stars in the later stages of their evolution provide an ideal place for the production of heavy axion-like particles (ALPs) with mass up to O(100 keV) range. We show that a fraction of these ALPs could stream out of the stellar photosphere and subsequently decay into two photons that can be potentially detected on or near the Earth. In particular, we estimate the photon flux originating from the spontaneous decay of heavy ALPs produced inside Horizontal Branch and Wolf-Rayet stars, and assess its detectability by current and future $X$-ray and gamma-ray telescopes. Our results indicate that current and future telescopes can probe axion-photon couplings down to $g_{a\gamma} \sim 4\times 10^{-11}$ GeV${}^{-1}$ for $m_a\sim 10-100$ keV, which covers new ground in the ALP parameter space.</description>

Abstract: Electron mass is known to modify at finite temperatures and densities. Weak nuclear processes have a great impact on electron mass which modifies in a statistical background. We demonstrate how the temperature change in electron mass is associated with beta decay in the early universe. Its precise contributions to the abundance of light elements in the early universe describe some of the details about nucleosynthesis. We employ the calculational scheme of the renormalization of QED to precisely compute the temperature dependence of electron mass during the nuclear processes. In this paper we precisely compute the concentration of electron and its mass change with temperature during nucleosynthesis and use it to describe the helium abundance, expansion rate and energy density of the universe during nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Time-averaging Polarimetric and Spectral Properties of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The composition and radiation mechanism of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) within jets continue to be hotly debated. Investigating the joint polarimetric and spectral properties is crucial for understanding GRB composition and radiation mechanism. Various jet properties, such as ``kinetic-energy-dominated" (KED), ``Poynting-flux-dominated" (PFD), and ``hybrid-dominated" (HD) relativistic outflows, have been inferred from observed GRB spectra, with expectations of differing polarization levels among them. In this study, we analyzed a sample of 27 GRBs detected by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on board the NASA Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, focusing on 26 bursts with significant polarization measurements. Our analysis revealed that 16 bursts (62\%) were predominantly associated with the ``PFD'' jet type, while 10 bursts (38\%) were classified as HD, implying that photosphere emission may also be a possible mechanism powering the high levels of polarization. Notably, no bursts were identified as KED-type. We found distinct polarization properties, with HD-type bursts exhibiting consistently higher polarization levels than PFD-type bursts. We proposed models incorporating ordered and random magnetic field configurations specific to hybrid jets.</description>

      <title>Late-time X-ray Observations of the Jetted Tidal Disruption Event AT2022cmc: The Relativistic Jet Shuts Off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2022cmc represents the fourth known example of a relativistic jet produced by the tidal disruption of a stray star providing a unique probe of the formation and evolution of relativistic jets in otherwise dormant supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Here we present deep, late-time Chandra observations of AT2022cmc extending to $t_{\rm obs} \approx 400$ days after disruption. Our observations reveal a sudden decrease in the X-ray brightness by a factor of $\gtrsim 14$ over a factor of $\approx 2.3$ in time, and a deviation from the earlier power-law decline with a steepening $\alpha \gtrsim 3.2$ ($F_X \propto t^{-\alpha}$), steeper than expected for a jet break, and pointing to the cessation of jet activity at $t_{\rm obs} \approx 215$ days. Such a transition has been observed in two previous TDEs (Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+05). From the X-ray luminosity and the timescale of jet shutoff, we parameterize the mass of the SMBH in terms of unknown jet efficiency and accreted mass fraction parameters. Motivated by the disk-jet connection in AGN, we favor black hole masses $\lesssim 10^5 \ \rm M_{\odot}$ (where the jet and disk luminosities are comparable), and disfavor larger black holes (in which extremely powerful jets are required to outshine their accretion disks). We additionally estimate a total accreted mass of $\approx 0.1 \rm \ M_{\odot}$. Applying the same formalism to Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+05, we favor comparable black hole masses for these TDEs of $\lesssim$ a few $\times 10^5 \ \rm M_{\odot}$, and suggest that jetted TDEs may preferentially form from lower mass black holes when compared to non-relativistic events, owing to generally lower jet and higher disk efficiencies at higher black hole masses.</description>

      <title>Star-Disk Collisions: Implications for Quasi-periodic Eruptions and Other Transients Near Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Athena++ to study the hydrodynamics of repeated star-accretion disk collisions close to supermassive black holes, and discuss their implications for the origin of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) and other repeating nuclear transients. We quantify the impact of the collisions on the stellar structure, the amount of stripped stellar debris, and the debris' orbital properties. We provide simple fitting functions for the stellar mass-loss per collision; the mass-loss is much larger after repeated collisions due to the dilute stellar atmosphere shock-heated in earlier collisions. The lifetime of the QPE-emitting phase set by stellar mass-loss in star-disk collision models for QPEs is thus at most ~1000 years; it is shortest for eRO-QPE2, of order a few decades. The mass of the stripped stellar debris per collision and its orbital properties imply that currently observed QPEs are not powered by direct star-disk collisions but rather by collisions between the stellar debris liberated in previous collisions and the accretion disk (`circularization shocks'). We discuss how the hydrodynamics of this interaction can explain the diverse timing properties of QPEs including the regular timing of GSN 069 and eRO-QPE2 and the large flare-to-flare timing variations observed in eRO-QPE1. QPEs with recurrence times of many days, if observed, may have more regular timing.</description>

      <title>Spectral dataset of young type Ib supernovae and their time evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to high-cadence automated surveys, we can now detect and classify supernovae (SNe) within a few days after explosion, if not earlier. Early-time spectra of young SNe directly probe the outermost layers of the ejecta, providing insights into the extent of stripping in the progenitor star and the explosion mechanism in the case of core-collapse supernovae. However, many SNe show overlapping observational characteristics at early times, complicating the early-time classification. In this paper, we focus on the study and classification of type Ib supernovae (SNe Ib), which are a subclass of core-collapse SNe that lack strong hydrogen lines but show helium lines in their spectra. Here we present a spectral dataset of eight SNe Ib, chosen to have at least three pre-maximum spectra, which we call early spectra. Our dataset was obtained mainly by the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) and it consists of a total of 82 optical photospheric spectra, including 38 early spectra. This dataset increases the number of published SNe Ib with at least three early spectra by ~60%. For our classification efforts, we used early spectra in addition to spectra taken around maximum light. We also converted our spectra into SN IDentification (SNID) templates and make them available to the community for easier identification of young SNe Ib. Our dataset increases the number of publicly available SNID templates of early spectra of SNe Ib by ~43%. Half of our sample has SN types that change over time or are different from what is listed on the Transient Name Server (TNS). We discuss the implications of our dataset and our findings for current and upcoming SN surveys and their classification efforts.</description>

      <title>Pythia 8 and Air Shower Simulations: A Tuning Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has revealed a significant challenge in air shower physics: a discrepancy between the simulated and observed muon content in cosmic-ray interactions, known as the 'Muon Puzzle'. This issue stems from a lack of understanding of high-energy hadronic interactions. Current state-of-the-art hadronic interaction models fall short, underscoring the need for improvements. In this contribution, we explore the integration of the Pythia 8 hadronic interaction model into air shower simulations. While Pythia 8 is primarily used in Large Hadron Collider experiments, recent advancements in its Angantyr module show promise in better describing hadron-nucleus interactions, making it a valuable tool for addressing the Muon Puzzle.</description>

      <title>Quasi-steady evolution of fast neutrino-flavor conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs), neutrinos potentially experience substantial flavor mixing due to the refractive effects of neutrino self-interactions. Determining the survival probability of neutrinos in asymptotic states is paramount to incorporating flavor conversions' effects in the theoretical modeling of CCSN and BNSM. Some phenomenological schemes have shown good performance in approximating asymptotic states of fast neutrino-flavor conversions (FFCs), known as one of the collective neutrino oscillation modes induced by neutrino self-interactions. However, a recent study showed that they would yield qualitatively different asymptotic states of FFC if the neutrino number is forced to evolve. It is not yet fully understood why the canonical phenomenological models fail to predict asymptotic states. In this paper, we perform detailed investigations through numerical simulations and then provide an intuitive explanation with a quasi-homogeneous analysis. Based on the analysis, we propose a new phenomenological model, in which the quasi-steady evolution of FFCs is analytically determined. The model also allows us to express the convolution term of spatial wave number as a concise form, which corresponds to useful information on analyses for the non-linear feedback from small-scale flavor conversions to large-scale ones. Our model yields excellent agreement with numerical simulations, which lends support to our interpretation.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity of nuclear matter with pions in the neutrino-trapped regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work [B. Fore and S. Reddy, Phys. Rev. C 101 035809 (2020)] has shown that the population of thermal pions could modify the equation of state and transport properties of hot and dense neutron-rich matter and introduce new reaction pathways to change the proton fraction. In this article we study their impact on the bulk viscosity of dense matter, focusing on the neutrino-trapped regime that would be realized in neutron star mergers and supernovae. We find that the presence of a thermal population of pions alters the bulk viscosity by modifying the EoS (via the susceptibilities) and by providing new reaction pathways to achieve beta-equilibrium. In neutron star merger conditions, the bulk viscosity in neutrino-trapped $npe\mu$ matter (without pions) has its peak at temperatures of at most a couple MeV and is quite small at temperatures of tens of MeV. We find that thermal pions enhance the low-temperature peak of the bulk viscosity by a factor of a few and shift it to slightly lower temperatures. At higher temperatures, where the pion abundance is large but the bulk viscosity is traditionally small, pions can increase the bulk viscosity by an order of magnitude or more, although it is still orders of magnitude smaller than its peak value.</description>

      <title>Parametrized tests of general relativity using eccentric compact binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical population simulations predict that a subset of dynamically formed binary black holes (BBHs) may possess eccentricity $\gtrsim 0.1$ at a gravitational wave (GW) frequency of $10 \,\text{Hz}$. Presently, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration tests general relativity (GR) assuming that the binary eccentricity has decayed well before it enters the detector's frequency band. Previous works have shown that binary eccentricity can bias GR tests if unaccounted for. Here we develop two methods to extend parametrized tests of GR to eccentric binaries. The first method extends the standard null parametrized test for quasicircular binaries by adding fractional deviations at each post-Newtonian (PN) order in the eccentric part of the GW phasing (assuming the small-eccentricity limit). Simultaneous measurement of the circular and eccentric deviation parameters ($\delta\hat{\varphi}, \delta\hat{\varphi}^e$) allows us to constrain deviations from GR for eccentric binaries. While strong constraints on the deviation parameters are not achievable with LIGO's projected sensitivity, the multibanding of LISA and CE observations can constrain these deviations to $|\delta\hat{\varphi}_2| \lesssim 3 \times 10^{-3}$ and $|\delta\hat{\varphi}^e_2|\lesssim 2\times 10^{-2}$. The second method looks for GR deviations in the rate of periastron advance ($\Delta\alpha$). The parameter $\Delta\alpha$ ($\Delta\alpha^{\rm GR} \to 0$) can be constrained with LIGO to $|\Delta\alpha|\lesssim 4 \times 10^{-2}$ (with $1 \sigma$ confidence). Multiband sources observed by LISA and CE provide an improved constraint of $|\Delta\alpha|\lesssim 3\times 10^{-5}$. The space-based detector DECIGO provides the best constraint on $\Delta\alpha$ with $|\Delta\alpha|\lesssim 8 \times 10^{-6}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a gauge singlet scalar with mass around 1-100 TeV as a thermal heavy dark matter candidate along with a dilaton as a Higgs portal mediator in a dimensionless scalar extension of the Standard Model. We demonstrate analytically that such a model gives rise to very strong first-order electroweak phase transition through supercooling. We calculate the corresponding gravitational wave signals due to bubble collisions during the phase transition. The produced gravitational waves can be detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors in the frequency range from 10^{-4} Hz to 0.1 Hz.</description>

      <title>Early-time millimeter observations of the nearby Type II SN 2024ggi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The short-lived ionized emission lines in early spectroscopy of the nearby type II supernova SN 2024ggi signify the presence of dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to its progenitor star. We proposed the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations by its Director's Discretionary Time program to catch the potential synchrotron radiation associated with the ejecta-CSM interaction. Multi-epoch observations were conducted using ALMA band 6 at +8, +13, and +17 days after the discovery. The data show non-detections at the position of SN 2024ggi with a 3sigma upper limit of less than 0.15 mJy, corresponding to a luminosity of approximately 8*10^24 erg/s/Hz. In this paper, we leverage the non-detections to place constraints on the properties of CSM surrounding SN 2024ggi. We investigate both the Wind and Eruptive models for the radial distribution of CSM, assuming a constant mass-loss rate in the Wind model and a distance-variant mass-loss rate in the Eruptive model. The derived CSM distribution for the Wind model does not align with the early-time spectral features, while the ALMA observations suggest a mass-loss rate of ~ 5*10^-3 Msun/year for the Eruptive model. Conducting multi-epoch millimeter/submillimeter observations shortly after the explosion, with a cadence of a few days, could offer a promising opportunity to capture the observable signature of the Eruptive model.</description>
