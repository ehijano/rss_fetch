      <title>Constructing vortex functions and basis states of Chern insulators: ideal condition, inequality from index theorem, and coherent-like states on von Neumann lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of fractional Chern insulators, a great deal of effort has been devoted to characterizing Chern bands that exhibit properties similar to the Landau levels. Among them, the concept of the vortex function, which generalizes the complex coordinate used for the symmetric-gauge Landau-level basis, allows for a concise description. In this paper, we develop a theory of constructing the vortex function and basis states of Chern insulators. In the first half, we consider the optimization process of the vortex function, which minimizes an indicator that measures the difference from the ideal Chern insulators. In particular, we focus on the sublattice position dependence of the vortex function or the quantum geometric tensor. In the second half, we construct two types of basis sets for a given vortex function: radially localized basis set and coherent-like basis set. The former basis set is defined as the eigenstates of an analogy of the angular momentum operator. Remarkably, one can always find exact zero mode(s) for this operator, which is explained by the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem. As a byproduct, we propose an inequality rooted in the band topology. We also discuss the subtle differences between our formalism and the previous works about the momentum-space Landau level. The latter basis set generalizes the concept of coherent states on von Neumann lattice. While this basis set is not orthogonal, it is useful to compare the LLL and the given Chern insulator directly in the Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Spin Coulomb Drag Effect and Its Impact on Spin Transport in the Three-Dimensional Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin Coulomb drag effect, arising from the exchange of momentum between electrons of opposite spins, plays a crucial role in the spin transport of interacting electron systems. This effect leads to the emergence of a spin mass and the finite lifetime of spin currents, posing challenges for the accurate description of spin dynamics. Using the state-of-the-art Variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach, we investigate the spin-resolved exchange-correlation (XC) kernel in the three-dimensional uniform electron gas. Our analysis reveals a distinct nature in the spin response, characterized by a $1/q^2$ divergence in the spin XC kernel at finite frequencies. This so-called ultranonlocal behavior, stemming from the spin Coulomb drag effect, is absent in the charge channel. By extracting precise values for the spin mass enhancement factor, we observe a trend of increasing enhancement with decreasing electron density. Furthermore, we find compelling evidence for the suppression of spin diffusion at low temperatures, characterized by vanishing inverse relaxation times. These findings deepen our understanding of the intricate relation between the Coulomb interaction and the spin transport, providing valuable insights for the development of accurate density functional approximations and the advancement of spintronics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Neutron-superfluid vortices and proton-superconductor flux tubes: Development of a minimal model for pulsar glitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that allows us to explore the coupled motion of neutron-superfluid vortices and proton-superconductor flux tubes in a gravitationally collapsed condensate, which describe neutron stars that form pulsars. Our framework uses the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson-Equation (GPPE) for neutron Cooper pairs, the Real-Time-Ginzburg-Landau equation (RTGLE) for proton Cooper pairs, the Maxwell equations for the vector potential ${\bf A}$, and Newtonian gravity and interactions, both direct and induced by the Poisson equation, between the neutron and proton subsystems. For a pulsar we include a crust potential, characterized by an angle $\theta$, and frictional drag. By carrying out extensive direct numerical simulations, we obtain a variety of interesting results. We show that a rotating proton superconductor generates a uniform London magnetic field, which changes the field distribution inside flux tubes. In the absence of any direct interaction between the two species, they interact through the gravitational Poisson equation. The presence of attractive (repulsive) density-density interaction leads to the attraction (repulsion) between neutron vortices and proton flux tubes. The inclusion of the current-current interaction and the complete Maxwell equations allows us to quantify the entrainment effect that leads to induced magnetization of neutron vortices. We show that, with a strong external magnetic field ${\bf B}_{\rm ext}$, proton flux tubes are anchored to the crust, whereas neutron vortices leave the condensate and lead to abrupt changes of the crust angular momentum ${\rm J}_c$. The frictional term in the dynamical equation for $\theta$ yields stick-slip dynamics that leads, in turn, to glitches in the time series of ${\rm J}_c$. By calculating various statistical properties of this time series, we demonstrate that they display self-organised criticality(SOC).</description>

      <title>Interaction induced splitting of Dirac monopoles in the topological Thouless pumping of strongly interacting Bosons and SU($N$) Fermions</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the observation of the breakdown of quantization for the Thouless pump in the presence of strong interaction by ETH [Walter et. al. Nat. Phys. 19, 1471 (2023), Viebahn et. al. arXiv:2308.03756], we study the interplay of strong interaction and topology in the (1+1)-dimensional interacting Rice-Mele model. We point out that the quantization of the interacting Thouless pump is dictated by the Chern number, i.e., the Dirac monopoles enclosed by the generalized Brillouin zone of the many-body wave function. By analyzing the change of location monopoles due to interaction, we predict the Thouless charge pump for strongly interacting Bose and SU($N$) Fermi gases in optical lattices and explain the ETH experiment.</description>

      <title>Fast transport and splitting of spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the dynamics of tunable spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates confined within a harmonic trap, focusing on rapid transport, spin manipulation, and splitting dynamics. Using shortcuts to adiabaticity, we design time-dependent trap trajectories and spin-orbit-coupling strength to facilitate fast transport with simultaneous spin flip. Additionally, we showcase the creation of spin-dependent coherent states via engineering the spin-orbit-coupling strength. To deepen our understanding, we elucidate non-adiabatic transport and associated spin dynamics, contrasting them with simple scenarios characterized by constant spin-orbit coupling and trap velocity. Furthermore, we discuss the transverse Zeeman potential and nonlinear effect induced by interatomic interactions using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, highlighting the stability and feasibility of the proposed protocols for the state-of-the-art experiments with cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group Perspective on Gravitational Critical Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose extremal black holes (BH) as critical points of a new class of gravitational collapses. The conjecture is made by observing the Continuous Self Similarity (CSS) and Discrete Self Similarity (DSS) behaviours of perturbations of an extremal black hole spacetime and compare them to similar properties of Choptuik-type critical solutions. By performing analytical perturbation studies on extremal black holes, we explicitly show that the DSS solution found here can be interpreted as renormalization group (RG) limit cycles, and the transition between CSS and DSS regimes occurs as the stable and unstable fixed points collide and move to the complex plane. We argue that the DSS solutions found in spherically symmetric gravitational collapses can be similarly interpreted. We identify various phenomena in non-gravitational systems with RG limit cycles, including DSS correlation function, DSS scaling laws in correlation length and order parameters, which are observed in gravitational critical collapses. We also discuss a version of gravitational Efimov effect.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling in real dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of universality has shaped our understanding of many-body physics, but is mostly limited to homogenous systems. Here, we present a study of universality on a non-homogeneous graph, the long-range diluted graph (LRDG). Its scaling theory is controlled by a single parameter, the spectral dimension $d_{s}$, which plays the role of the relevant parameter on complex geometries. The graph under consideration allows us to tune the value of the spectral dimension continuously also to noninteger values and to find the universal exponents as continuous functions of the dimension. By means of extensive numerical simulations, we probe the scaling exponents of a simple instance of $O(\mathcal{N})$ symmetric models on the LRDG showing quantitative agreement with the theoretical prediction of universal scaling in real dimensions.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Enhanced Superradiance of a Ryderg-Atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the superradiant phase transition of an array of Rydberg atoms in a dissipative microwave cavity. Under the interplay of the cavity field and the long-range Rydberg interaction, the steady state of the system exhibits an interaction-enhanced superradiance, with vanishing critical atom-cavity coupling rates at a discrete set of interaction strengths. We find that, while the phenomenon can be analytically understood in the case of a constant all-to-all interaction, the enhanced superradiance persists under typical experimental parameters with spatially dependent interactions, but at modified critical interaction strengths. The diverging susceptibility at these critical points is captured by emergent quantum Rabi models, each of which comprises a pair of collective atomic states with different numbers of atomic excitations. These collective states become degenerate at the critical interaction strengths, resulting in a superradiant phase for an arbitrarily small atom-cavity coupling.</description>

      <title>Interplay between short-range and critical long-range fluctuations in the out-of-equilibrium behavior of the particle density at quantum transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium behavior of the particle density in many-body systems undergoing quantum transitions driven by the chemical potential $\mu$. They originate from a nontrivial interplay between noncritical short-range and critical long-range quantum fluctuations. As a paradigmatic model we consider the one-dimensional fermionic Kitaev chain, for which very accurate numerical studies can be performed, up to $O(10^4)$ sites. The search for dynamic scaling behaviors of the particle density is complicated by the fact that its equilibrium (ground state) behavior is dominated by short-range fluctuations, giving rise to regular background terms and peculiar logarithmic terms from resonances between renormalization-group perturbations associated with the energy and identity operator families within the conformal field theory. To study these issues, we focus on two dynamic protocols, either instantaneous quenches or quasi-adiabatic changes of $\mu$ to the critical value $\mu_c$, unveiling out-of-equilibrium scaling behaviors of the particle density, which arise from the critical modes, within a dynamic finite-size scaling framework.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Higher-Order Topology via Polarized Topological Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-space topological invariants were widely used to characterize chiral-symmetric higher-order topological phases (HOTPs). However, a momentum-space characterization to these HOTPs, which essentially reveals their intrinsic bulk-boundary correspondence and facilitates their detection in quantum simulation systems, is still lacking. Here, we propose an experimentally observable momentum-space characterization to the chiral-symmetric HOTPs by the concept of polarized topological charges. It provides a unified description to topological phase transitions caused by the closing and reopening of band gap not only of the bulk states but also the edge states. Remarkably, these polarized topological charges can be identified by measuring the pseudospin structures. A feasible scheme to detect the HOTPs in the $^{87}$Rb cold atomic system is given. Our work opens an avenue for characterization and experimental detection of the chiral-symmetric HOTPs in momentum space.</description>
