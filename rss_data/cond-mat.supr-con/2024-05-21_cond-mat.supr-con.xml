      <title>Evaluation of Doppler shifts in $d$-wave superconductor tunneling junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy levels of quasiparticles in superconductors experience Doppler shifts due to the influence of a finite current flow. The influence of the Doppler shift is particularly pronounced in unconventional superconductors with gap nodes. In the case of a normal/insulator/superconductor junction of $d$-wave superconductors, a zero-bias conductance peak exhibits a peak shift in an applied magnetic field. Although the shifts have been detected in experiments, the shifts showed different field responses depending on each experiment. In this paper, we evaluate the magnitude of the shift based on realistic junction shapes to elucidate the origin of the variability in experimental Doppler shifts. We found that the peak shift depended on the junction shape; the splitting was significantly suppressed when the junction was formed at a protruding position. Also, the shift was suppressed by the penetration of magnetic flux quanta, resulting in a nonlinear response to the magnetic field. The present results explain the origin of the variability in experimental Doppler shifts.</description>

      <title>Geometric Superfluid Weight of Composite Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superfluid weight of an isolated flat band in multi-orbital superconductors contains contributions from the band's quantum metric and a lattice geometric term that depends on the orbital positions in the lattice. Since the superfluid weight is a measure of the superconductor's energy fluctuation, it is independent of the lattice geometry, leading to the minimal quantum metric of a band. Here, a perturbation approach is developed to study the superfluid weight and its lattice geometric dependence for composite bands. When all orbitals exhibit uniform pairing, the quantum geometric term contains each band's contribution and an inter-band contribution between every pair of bands in the composite. Based on a band representation analysis, they provide a topological lower bound for the superfluid weight of an isolated composite of flat bands. Using this perturbation approach, an analytical expression of the lattice geometric contribution is obtained. It is expressed in terms of Bloch functions, providing a convenient formula to calculate the superfluid weight for multi-orbital superconductors.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Impact of Sulfur Doping on Copper-Substituted Lead Apatite: A Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Room-temperature superconductivity represents a significant scientific milestone, with the initial report of LK-99, a copper-substituted lead apatite $\mathrm{Pb}_{10-x}\mathrm{Cu}_{x}(\mathrm{PO}_{4})_{6}\mathrm{O}$, offering a potential breakthrough. However, other researchers have encountered numerous challenges in replicating the original experimental results. In recent studies, Wang et al. successfully observed signs of a possible superconducting phase, such as smaller resistance and stronger diamagnetism, upon doping S into the samples. This indicates that the introduction of S is of significant importance for achieving an appropriate structure. To further investigate the role of S, we have considered the $\mathrm{Pb}_{10-x}\mathrm{Cu}_{x}(\mathrm{PO}_{4})_{6}\mathrm{S}$, systematically discussing its thermodynamic stability, as well as the influence of S on the distribution, concentration, and electronic properties of Cu. We find that $\mathrm{Pb}_{10-x}\mathrm{Cu}_{x}(\mathrm{PO}_{4})_{6}\mathrm{S}$ maintains thermodynamic stability, with S primarily influencing the distribution of Cu. The critical element dictating the electronic characteristics of the material post-synthesis is Cu, while the impact of S on the electronic properties is relatively minor. Our work provides valuable insights into the synthesis of potential apatite based room-temperature superconductors and the role of S in facilitating Cu doping.</description>

      <title>Disorder effects in planar semiconductor-superconductor structures: Majorana wires versus Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder effects in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) nanowires, widely recognized as the main obstacle to realizing stable Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in these structures, have been systematically investigated theoretically in recent years. However, there are no corresponding detailed studies of disorder effects in planar Josephson junction (JJ) structures, which represent a promising alternative to the Majorana nanowire platform. In this paper, we perform a numerical analysis of the low-energy physics of JJ structures based on an effective microscopic model that includes two types of disorder, charge impurities inside the semiconductor and roughness on the surface of the superconducting film. We consider different parameter regimes, including low and high chemical potential values, weak and strong effective SM-SC coupling strengths, and weak and strong disorder strengths. The results are benchmarked using disordered hybrid nanowires realized in planar SM-SC structures similar to those involved in the fabrication of Josephson junctions and having similar model parameters and disorder strengths. We find that the topological superconducting phase hosted by a JJ structure is, generally, more robust against disorder than the topological superconductivity realized in a hybrid nanowire with similar parameters. On the other hand, we find that operating the JJ in a regime characterized by large values of chemical potential results in huge finite-size effects that can destroy the stability of MZMs.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Extended Interactions on Spin Dynamics in One-dimensional Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials provide a unique platform for understanding the importance and influence of extended interactions on the physics of strongly correlated systems due to their relative structural simplicity and the existence of powerful theoretical tools well-adapted to one spatial dimension. Recently, this was highlighted by anomalous observations in the single-particle spectral function $A(q,\omega)$ of 1D cuprate chain compounds, measured by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), which were explained by the presence of a long-range attractive interaction. Such an extended interaction should leave its fingerprints on other observables, notably the dynamical spin structure factor $S(q,\omega)$, measured by neutron scattering or resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). Starting from a simple Hubbard Hamiltonian in 1D and using time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) methods, we show that the presence of long-range attractive coupling, directly through an instantaneous Coulomb interaction $V$ or retarded electron-phonon ({\it el-ph}) coupling, can introduce significant spectral weight redistribution in $S(q,\omega)$ across a wide range of doping. This underscores the significant impact that extended interactions can have on dynamical correlations among particles, and the importance of properly incorporating this influence in modeling. Our results demonstrate that $S(q,\omega)$ can provide a sensitive experimental constraint, which complements ARPES measurements, in identifying key interactions in 1D cuprates, beyond the standard Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Non-Invasive Readout of the Kinetic Inductance of Superconducting Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy landscape of multiply connected superconducting structures is ruled by fluxoid quantization due to the implied single-valuedness of the complex wave function. The transitions and interaction between these energy states, each defined by a specific phase winding number, are governed by classical and/or quantum phase slips. Understanding these events requires the ability to probe, non-invasively, the state of the ring. Here, we employ a niobium resonator to examine the superconducting properties of an aluminum loop. By applying a magnetic field, adjusting temperature, and altering the loop's dimensions via focused ion beam milling, we correlate resonance frequency shifts with changes in the loop's kinetic inductance. This parameter is a unique indicator of the superconducting condensate's state, facilitating the detection of phase slips in nanodevices and providing insights into their dynamics. Our method presents a proof-of-principle spectroscopic technique with promising potential for investigating the Cooper pair density in inductively coupled superconducting nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced nearly perfect rectangular lattice and superconductivity in an organic molecular crystal (DMET-TTF)$_2$AuBr$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: External pressure and associated changes in lattice structures are key to realizing exotic quantum phases such as high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity. While applying external pressure is a standard method to induce novel lattice structures, its impact on organic molecular crystals has been less explored. Here we report a unique structural phase transition in (DMET-TTF)$_2$AuBr$_2$ under pressure. By combining advanced high-pressure techniques and $ab$ $initio$ calculations, we elucidate that (DMET-TTF)$_2$AuBr$_2$ undergoes a transition from a quasi-one-dimensional lattice to a nearly perfect rectangular lattice at 0.9 GPa. This transition leads to the realization of an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator with $T_{\rm N}=66$ K, the highest $T_{\rm N}$ in low-dimensional molecular crystal solids to date. Upon increasing the pressure, the antiferromagnetic ordering is suppressed, and a superconducting phase with $T_{\rm c}=4.8$ K emerges around 6 GPa. Our study reveals the significant impact of external pressure on lattice structures of organic molecular crystals and highlights the intricate relationship between geometrical frustration and superconductivity. Our findings also pave the way for realizing functional organic molecular crystals through changes in lattice structures by pressure.</description>

      <title>Neutron-superfluid vortices and proton-superconductor flux tubes: Development of a minimal model for pulsar glitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that allows us to explore the coupled motion of neutron-superfluid vortices and proton-superconductor flux tubes in a gravitationally collapsed condensate, which describe neutron stars that form pulsars. Our framework uses the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson-Equation (GPPE) for neutron Cooper pairs, the Real-Time-Ginzburg-Landau equation (RTGLE) for proton Cooper pairs, the Maxwell equations for the vector potential ${\bf A}$, and Newtonian gravity and interactions, both direct and induced by the Poisson equation, between the neutron and proton subsystems. For a pulsar we include a crust potential, characterized by an angle $\theta$, and frictional drag. By carrying out extensive direct numerical simulations, we obtain a variety of interesting results. We show that a rotating proton superconductor generates a uniform London magnetic field, which changes the field distribution inside flux tubes. In the absence of any direct interaction between the two species, they interact through the gravitational Poisson equation. The presence of attractive (repulsive) density-density interaction leads to the attraction (repulsion) between neutron vortices and proton flux tubes. The inclusion of the current-current interaction and the complete Maxwell equations allows us to quantify the entrainment effect that leads to induced magnetization of neutron vortices. We show that, with a strong external magnetic field ${\bf B}_{\rm ext}$, proton flux tubes are anchored to the crust, whereas neutron vortices leave the condensate and lead to abrupt changes of the crust angular momentum ${\rm J}_c$. The frictional term in the dynamical equation for $\theta$ yields stick-slip dynamics that leads, in turn, to glitches in the time series of ${\rm J}_c$. By calculating various statistical properties of this time series, we demonstrate that they display self-organised criticality(SOC).</description>

      <title>Giant Impurity Effects on Charge Loop Current Order States in Kagome Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exotic electronic states in the charge loop current (cLC) phase, in which the permanent charge current breaks the time-reversal-symmetry (TRS), have been attracting increasing attention in recently discovered kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K). Interestingly, the cLC state is sensitively controlled by applying small magnetic field as well as tiny uniaxial strain. In addition, many experiments indicate that the cLC state is extremely sensitive to the small number of impurities. To understand the impurity effects on the cLC electronic states accurately, we analyze the giant unit-cell (up to 300 sites) kagome lattice model with single impurity potential. The loop current is found to be strongly suppressed within the current correlation length $\xi_J$ centered on the impurity site, where $\xi_J$ is inversely proportional to the cLC order parameter $\eta$. (The cLC order is the pure imaginary hopping integral modulation $\delta t_{i,j}=\pm i\eta$.) In addition, both the uniform orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ and the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ are drastically suppressed by dilute impurities. Especially, the suppression ratio $R=-\Delta M_{orb}/M_{orb}^0$ can exceed 50% by introducing $\sim1\,\%$ impurities. Unexpectedly, the ratio $R$ is insensitive to $\eta$, in highly contrast to a naive expectation that $R$ is proportional to the current suppression area $\pi \xi_J^2$. The obtained giant impurity effect of $M_{orb}$ would originate from the non-local contribution from the itinerant circulation of electrons. The present study gives a natural explanation why the cLC electronic states in kagome metals are extremely sensitive to the dilute impurities.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity in Fibonacci quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of a Fibonacci quasicrystal (QC) arrangement of a one-dimensional topological superconductor, such as a magnetic atom chain deposited on a superconducting surface. We uncover a general mutually exclusive competition between the QC properties and the topological superconducting phase with Majorana bound states (MBS): there are no MBS inside the QC gaps and the MBS never behaves as QC subgap states, and likewise, no critical, or winding, QC subgap states exist inside the topological superconducting gaps. Surprisingly, despite this competition, we find that the QC is still highly beneficial for realizing topological superconductivity with MBS. It both leads to additional large nontrivial regions with MBS in parameter space, that are topologically trivial in crystalline systems, and increases the topological gap protecting the MBS. We also find that shorter approximants of the Fibonacci QC display the largest benefits. As a consequence, our results promote QCs, and especially their short approximants, as an appealing platform for improved experimental possibilities to realize MBS as well as generally highlights the fundamental interplay between different topologies.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Coherence Length in Superconductors with Quantum Metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05686v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coherence length $\xi$ is a fundamental length scale of superconductors which governs the sizes of Cooper pairs, vortices, Andreev bound states and more. In existing microscopic theories of superconductivity, it is expected that as the attractive interaction increases, $\xi$ decreases as the electrons are bound together more strongly. In BCS theory, for example, the coherence length is $\xi_\mathrm{BCS} = \hbar v_{F}/\Delta$, where $v_{F}$ is the Fermi velocity and $\Delta$ is the pairing gap. It is clear that increasing $\Delta$ will shorten $\xi_\mathrm{BCS}$. However, the situation is puzzling for superconductors with completely flat bands in which $v_{F}$ goes to zero and $\xi_\mathrm{BCS}$ is expected to be zero. In this work, we show that the quantum metric, which is the real part of the quantum geometric tensor, gives rise to an anomalous contribution to the coherence length. Specifically, $\xi = \sqrt{\xi_\mathrm{BCS}^2 +\ell_{\mathrm{qm}}^{2}}$ for a superconductor where $\ell_{\mathrm{qm}}$ is the quantum metric contribution. In the flat band limit, $\xi$ does not vanish but bound by $\ell_{\mathrm{qm}}$. Incredibly, for the nontrivial flat bands with Chern number $C$, $\xi$ has a topological bound of $\xi\geq a\sqrt{\vert C \vert/4\pi}$ where $a$ is the lattice constant. Physically, the Cooper pair size of a superconductor cannot be squeezed down to a size smaller than $\ell_{\mathrm{qm}}$ which is a fundamental length scale determined by the quantum geometry of the bands. Finally, we calculate the quantum metric contributions for the superconducting moir\'e graphene family and show that the quantum metric effects are very important in these superconductors.</description>

      <title>Transport signatures of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in normal metal/time-reversal symmetry broken $d$-wave superconductor junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent times, Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) in superconductors (SCs) have drawn significant attention due to a substantial population of Bogoliubov quasiparticles (BQPs) together with Cooper pairs (CPs) in them. The BQPs as zero energy excitations give rise to captivating and intricate charge dynamics within the BFSs. In this theoretical study, we propose to reveal the unique signatures of the topologically protected BFSs in bulk $d$-wave SCs using normal metal/time-reversal symmetry (TRS) broken $d$-wave SC hybrid setup, in terms of the differential conductance and Fano factor (FF). Orientation of crystal $a$ axis with respect to junction normal, quantified by the parameter $\alpha$, is crucial for transport properties in these hybrid devices. For $\alpha=0$, an enhancement in zero-bias conductance (ZBC) can be identified as a key signature of BFSs. However, for $\alpha\ne0$, this feature does not replicate due to the presence of the localized Andreev bound state (ABS) at the interface. The interplay of ABS and BFSs gives rise to an anomalous behavior in ZBC compared to the $\alpha=0$ case. This behavior remains qualitatively similar even at finite temperatures. Finally, we explain this anomalous behavior by analyzing the effective charge of the carriers in terms of the FF. The simplicity of our setup based on $d$-wave SC makes our proposal persuasive.</description>

      <title>Topological surface states host superconductivity induced by the bulk condensate in YRuB$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the possibility of topological superconductivity (TSC) in hybrid heterostructures involving topologically nontrivial band structure and superconductors has been proposed, the realization of TSC in a single stoichiometric material is most desired for fundamental experimental investigation of TSC and its device applications. Bulk measurements on YRuB$_2$ detect a single superconducting gap of $\sim$ 1 meV. This is supported by our electronic structure calculations which also reveal the existence of topological surface states in the system. We performed surface-sensitive Andreev reflection spectroscopy on YRuB$_2$ and detected the bulk superconducting gap as well as another superconducting gap of $\sim$ 0.5 meV. From our analysis of electronic structure, we show that the smaller gap is formed in the topological surface states in YRuB$_2$ due to the proximity of the bulk superconducting condensate. Thus, in agreement with the past theoretical predictions, we present YRuB$_2$ as a unique system that hosts superconducting topological surface states.</description>

      <title>Spin fluctuations in the ultranodal superconducting state of Fe(Se,S)</title>

Abstract: The iron-based superconductor FeSe isovalently substituted with S displays an abundance of remarkable phenomena that have not been fully understood, at the center of which are apparent zero-energy excitations in the superconducting state in the tetragonal phase. The phenomenology has been generally consistent with the proposal of the so-called ultranodal states where Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces are present. Recently, nuclear magnetic resonance measurements have seen unusually large upturns in the relaxation rate as temperature decreases to nearly zero in these systems, calling for theoretical investigations. In this paper, we calculate the spin susceptibility of an ultranodal superconductor including correlation effects within the random phase approximation. Although the non-interacting mean-field calculation rarely gives an upturn in the low temperature relaxation rate within our model, we found that correlation strongly enhances scattering between coherent parts of the Bogoliubov Fermi surface, resulting in robust upturns when the interaction is strong. Our results suggest that in addition to the presence of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, correlation and multiband physics also play important roles in the system's low energy excitations.</description>

      <title>Feynman Paradox about the Josephson effect and a sawtooth current in the double junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the Feynman approach to the Josephson effect, which employs a pair of linear coupling equations for its modeling. It is found that while the exact solutions can account for the AC Josephson effect when the coupling strength is significantly less than the voltage, they fail to produce the DC Josephson effect in any practical scenario. To address this fundamental discrepancy, we derive the coupled Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations for two interconnected superconductors based on BCS theory. These equations reveal that the nonlinear coupling, which is overlooked in the Feynman method, is crucial in describing the spontaneous symmetry breaking in superconductors, a critical factor for achieving the DC Josephson effect. When the coupled GL equations are applied to a double junction, a sawtooth current pattern emerges, a result unattainable via the Feynman approach.</description>

      <title>Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an $\textit{in situ}$ tunable magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a powerful tool for probing the momentum-resolved single-particle spectral function of materials. Historically, $\textit{in situ}$ magnetic fields have been carefully avoided as they are detrimental to the control of photoelectron trajectory during the photoelectron detection process. However, magnetic field is an important experimental knob for both probing and tuning symmetry-breaking phases and electronic topology in quantum materials. In this paper, we introduce an easily implementable method for realizing an $\textit{in situ}$ tunable magnetic field at the sample position in an ARPES experiment and analyze magnetic field induced artifacts in ARPES data. Specifically, we identified and quantified three distinct extrinsic effects of a magnetic field: Fermi surface rotation, momentum shrinking, and momentum broadening. We examined these effects in three prototypical quantum materials, i.e., a topological insulator (Bi$_2$Se$_3$), an iron-based superconductor (LiFeAs), and a cuprate superconductor (Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$), and demonstrate the feasibility of ARPES measurements in the presence of a controllable magnetic field. Our studies lay the foundation for the future development of the technique and interpretation of ARPES measurements of field-tunable quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram of the Square-Lattice $t$-$J$-$V$ Model for Electron-Doped Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05893</link>

Abstract: Motivated by significant discrepancies between experimental observations of electron-doped cuprates and numerical results of the Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models, we investigate the role of inter-site interactions $V$ by studying the $t$-$J$-$V$ model on square lattices. Based on large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations, we identify the ground-state phase diagram across varying inter-site interactions $V$ and doping concentration $\delta$. We find that the phase diagram with finite inter-site interactions $2\lesssim V/J\lesssim3$ offers a more accurate description of electron-doped cuprates than the conventional Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models. Moreover, we reveal the role of inter-site interactions $V$ at varying doping levels: at light doping, inter-site interactions favor N\'{e}el antiferromagnetic order, and suppress both superconductivity and charge density wave; around optimal doping, these interactions support a pseudogap-like phase while suppressing superconductivity, and we further perform the slave boson mean-field analysis to understand the numerical results microscopically; at higher doping, the effects of inter-site interactions become insignificant, with our numerical predictions suggesting the emergence of incommensurate spin density wave phase. Our specific focus around optimal doping with various inter-site interactions identifies successive phases including phase separation, uniform $d$-wave SC and a pseudogap-like phase, and reveals a relative insensitivity of charge density wave to superconductivity. Our study suggests the $t$-$J$-$V$ model as the minimal model to capture the essential physics of the electron-doped cuprates.</description>

      <title>Majorana zero-modes in a dissipative Rashba nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Condensed matter systems are continuously subjected to dissipation, which often has adverse effects on quantum phenomena. We focus on the impact of dissipation on a superconducting Rashba nanowire. We reveal that the system can still host Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) with a finite lifetime in the presence of dissipation. Most interestingly, dissipation can also generate two kinds of dissipative boundary states: four robust zero-modes (RZMs) and two MZMs, in the regime where the non-dissipative system is topologically trivial. The MZMs appear via bulk gap closing and are topologically characterized by a winding number. The RZMs are not associated with any bulk states and possess no winding number, but their emergence is instead tied to exceptional points. Further, we confirm the stability of the dissipation-induced RZMs and MZMs in the presence of random disorder. Our study paves the way for both realizing and stabilizing MZMs in an experimental setup, driven by dissipation.</description>
