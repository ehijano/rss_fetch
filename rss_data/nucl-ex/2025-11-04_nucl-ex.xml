      <title>Measurement of Transverse Single-Spin Asymmetries in $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ Meson Production in $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV $p^\uparrow+p$ Collisions with sPHENIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sPHENIX experiment is a next-generation collider detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) designed for rare jet and heavy-flavor probes of Au + Au, $p$ + Au, and polarized $p+p$ collisions. The experiment includes a large acceptance, granular electromagnetic calorimeter and very high-rate data acquisition plus trigger system. In RHIC Run-24, sPHENIX sampled 107 $\mathrm{pb}^{-1}$ of collision data with transversely polarized protons at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV using an efficient high-$p_T$ photon trigger. This dissertation describes the extraction of transverse single-spin asymmetries in inclusive production of $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ mesons decaying into two photons. Such observables are sensitive to multi-parton correlations in the proton, which are related to transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) effects. The new sPHENIX data set allows for significant extension of the kinematic range covered by previous RHIC mid-rapidity measurements. The results are corrected for background contributions and three different sources of systematic uncertainties are considered: the calculation method, the method of background subtraction, and contributions from possible false asymmetries due to instrumental effects. The results are presented and compared to existing measurements from the PHENIX experiment.</description>

      <title>First Study of Exclusive Production of Multi-Hadron Final States in Ultraperipheral Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of exclusive photoproduction of multi-hadron final states in ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) provides a unique avenue to explore quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and the nature of resonances emerging from gluonic interactions. The ALICE Collaboration has recently performed measurements of exclusive four-pion photoproduction using Run 2 data, favoring the presence of two resonances. However, the underlying nature of these resonances remains poorly understood. The enhanced capabilities of the ALICE detector during Run 3 open new opportunities for the study of multi-pion final states, including four and six-pion systems, and processes involving charmonium decays into four-hadron final states. These studies provide an invaluable way to probe the dynamics of highly dense gluonic matter and the interplay between resonant and non-resonant contributions in hadronic systems. In this paper, we outline the ALICE program focused on these analyses.</description>

      <title>Investigating charm-quark dynamics in the QGP via the charm-hadron elliptic flow in Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these proceedings, the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) measurement of prompt and non-prompt charm hadrons - originating respectively from the fragmentation of a charm quark and from the decay of hadrons with beauty-quark content - in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.36~\text{TeV}$, using the latest data collected during LHC Run 3 by the ALICE detector, is presented. The analysis is performed at midrapidity ($|y| &lt; 0.8$), and hadronic decay channels are used to reconstruct the signal candidates. The $v_{2}$ coefficient is measured via the Scalar Product (SP) technique. The prompt $v_{2}$ in semicentral collisions is reported for the $D^{0}$, $D^{+}$, $D_{s}^{+}$ mesons and, for the first time, for the $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ baryon. These results achieve unprecedented precision and low-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ reach for the D mesons and highlight the first observation of the splitting of baryon and meson elliptic flow at intermediate $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ in the charm sector. The $v_{2}$ is also measured for prompt $D^{0}$, $D^{+}$ and $D_{s}^{+}$ in peripheral collisions, offering new insights into the features of the fireball generated in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Lower $v_{2}$ values are observed for non-prompt $D^{0}$ and $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ hadrons in semicentral collisions, as expected from the larger beauty-quark mass.</description>

      <title>sPHENIX measurements of heavy flavor production in $p$+$p$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: sPHENIX is the first new collider detector experiment dedicated to heavy-ion physics since the LHC began collecting data. Successfully commissioned in 2023-2024, one of its standout features is a streaming-capable tracking system that enables the collection of large, unbiased $p$+$p$ datasets-previously unattainable at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Leveraging this capability, sPHENIX recorded over 100 billion unbiased $p$+$p$ collisions at 200 GeV during Run 24. This unprecedented dataset unlocks a high-precision open heavy flavor physics program with extended low-$p_T$ reach, spanning both charm and beauty sectors. These proceedings present the progress in the analysis of open heavy flavor in the $p$+$p$ dataset. From one hour of data and early-stage calibrations, we see observations of $D^0$ mesons and evidence of $\Lambda_c^+$ in $p$+$p$ collisions for the first time at RHIC. These resonances will allow for novel physics measurements to be performed for the first time at RHIC.</description>

      <title>Observation of oscillations and near-barrier suppression in the fusion of $^{20}$O + p</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an active target detector, the fusion excitation function for $^{20}$O + $^1$H was measured for the first time. Near the barrier, the fusion cross section manifests an oscillatory behavior with broad peaks $\sim$50-100 keV wide. The presence of these peaks likely reflects the low density of low-angular-momentum states in the quasibound regime. R-matrix coupled channel (CC) calculations that include the first excited 2$^+$ state in $^{20}$O are able to reproduce the observed oscillations. However, one channel CC calculations fail to reproduce the decrease in the sub-barrier cross section experimentally observed.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional sizes and shapes of pion emission in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of precision measurements in high-energy heavy-ion physics, there is an increasing expectation towards phenomenological and theoretical studies to provide a better description of data. In recent years, multiple experiments have confirmed through two-pion Bose-Einstein correlation measurements that the shape of the two-pion pair source can be well described by Levy-stable distributions. However, direct comparisons of new phenomenological results with the data are still needed to understand the underlying phenomena and learn more about the nature of pion emission. In this paper, we present a three-dimensional analysis of the two-pion source in Monte-Carlo simulations of Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV per nucleon collision energy, and discuss a detailed comparison with the most recent centrality-dependent measurements from the PHENIX Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Energy Correlators from Partons to Hadrons: Unveiling the Dynamics of the Strong Interactions with Archival ALEPH Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a remarkably rich theory exhibiting numerous emergent degrees of freedom, from flux tubes to hadrons. Their description in terms of the underlying quarks and gluons of the QCD Lagrangian remains a central challenge of modern physics. Colliders offer a unique opportunity to probe these phenomena experimentally: high energy partons produced from the QCD vacuum excite these emergent degrees, imprinting their dynamics in correlations in asymptotic energy flux. Decoding these correlations requires measurements with exceptional angular resolution, beyond that achieved in previous measurements. Recent progress has enabled precision calculations of energy flux on charged particles alone, allowing data-theory comparisons for measurements using high resolution tracking detectors. In this Letter, we resurrect thirty-year-old data from the ALEPH tracker, and perform a high angular resolution measurement of the two-point correlation of energy flux, probing QCD over three orders of magnitude in scale in a single measurement. Our measurement unveils for the first time the full spectrum of the correlator, including light-ray quasi-particle states, flux-tube excitations, and their transitions into confined hadrons. We compare our measurement with record precision theoretical predictions, achieving percent level agreement, and revealing interesting new phenomena in the confinement transitions. More broadly, we highlight the immense potential of this newly unlocked archival data set, the so called "recycling frontier", and emphasize synergies with ongoing and future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Search for dibaryon resonances in the reactions $dd\to dd\pi\pi$ and $pd \to pd\pi\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The isoscalar dibaryon resonance $D_{03}(2380)$, discovered at WASA@COSY in the total cross section of the reaction $pn\to d\pi^0\pi^0$ and in the elastic pn scattering in the energy range corresponding to the invariant mass of the pn system of 2380 MeV, can reveal itself in the $pd\to pd\pi\pi$ and $dd\to dd\pi\pi$ reactions at higher energies due to deuteron excitation in the $t$ channel. In this paper, the cross sections of these reactions are estimated based on the model of the reaction $pn\to d\pi^0\pi^0$, proposed earlier by Platonova and Kukulin.</description>

      <title>In-medium mass shifts of $B_c^{(*)}, B_s^{(*)}$ and $D_s^{(*)}$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our predictions for the Lorentz scalar mass shifts of two-flavored heavy mesons, $B_c^{(*)}, B_s^{(*)}$ and $D_s^{(*)}$ in symmetric nuclear matter. The in-medium mass shifts are estimated by evaluating the lowest order one-loop self-energies of the mesons based on a flavor-SU(5) effective Lagrangian approach. In-medium properties necessary for the estimates are calculated by the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model. The enhanced self-energies of the mesons in symmetric nuclear matter relative to those in free space, yield the negative mass shifts of these mesons.</description>

      <title>Investigation of $2\nu$ECEC in $^{132}$Ba and revisited for $^{78}$Kr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of two-neutrino double electron capture ($2\nu$ECEC) in $^{132}$Ba and $^{78}$Kr based on large-scale shell-model calculations. The nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for the $2\nu$ECEC process in $^{132}$Ba and $^{78}$Kr have been calculated using the SN100PN and GWBXG effective interactions, respectively. The reliability of these interactions is first assessed by reproducing the spectroscopic properties of the parent, intermediate, and granddaughter nuclei of the decay. Two different formulations are employed to estimate the half-lives. We also examine the cumulative contribution of $1^+$ and $0^+$ states in the intermediate nuclei to the NMEs associated with the Gamow-Teller (GT) and Fermi transitions, respectively. Our results provide an improved prediction of the NME and half-life for $2\nu$ECEC in $^{78}$Kr compared to previous studies and offer a precise theoretical benchmark for future experimental investigations in $^{132}$Ba.</description>

      <title>Skewness-dependent Moments of Pion GPD from Nonlocal Quark-Bilinear Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present lattice QCD calculations of the odd Mellin moments of pion valence-quark generalized parton distribution (GPD) up to fifth order, $\langle x^4\rangle$, and for the skewness range $[-0.33, 0]$ using operator product expansion of bilocal quark-bilinear operators. The calculations are performed on an ensemble with lattice spacing $a=0.04~\mathrm{fm}$ and valence pion mass $300$ $\mathrm{MeV}$, employing boosted pion states with momenta up to 2.428 GeV and momentum transfers reaching 2.748 GeV$^2$. We employ ratio-scheme renormalization and next-to-leading-logarithmic resummed perturbative matching. At zero skewness, our results are consistent with previous lattice studies. By combining matrix elements at multiple values of skewness and momentum transfer, skewness-dependent moments are obtained through simultaneous polynomiality-constrained fits.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Efficient Emulation of Proton-Deuteron Scattering via the Reduced Basis Method and Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce highly accurate and efficient emulators for proton-deuteron scattering below the deuteron breakup threshold. We explore two different reduced-basis method strategies: one based on the Kohn variational principle and another on Galerkin projections of the underlying system of linear equations. We use the adaptive greedy algorithm previously developed for two-body scattering for optimal selection of high-fidelity training points in the input parameter space. We demonstrate that these emulators reproduce ab initio hyperspherical harmonics calculations of $R$-matrix elements with remarkable precision, achieving relative errors as low as $10^{-7}$ with a small number of training points, even in regions of strong nonlinear parameter dependence. They also dramatically accelerate the exploration of the scattering predictions in the parameter space, a capability highly desired for calibrating (chiral) three-nucleon forces against scattering measurements. Our formalism can be further generalized to handle nucleon-deuteron scattering above the breakup threshold. These emulator developments will provide valuable tools to accelerate uncertainty quantification and rigorous parameter inference in the study of nuclear forces.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in the production of iron-group nuclides in core-collapse supernovae from Monte Carlo variations of reaction rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae, occurring at the end of massive star evolution, produce heavy elements, including those in the iron peak. Although the explosion mechanism is not yet fully understood, theoretical models can reproduce optical observations and observed elemental abundances. However, many nuclear reaction rates involved in explosive nucleosynthesis have large uncertainties, impacting the reliability of abundance predictions. To address this, we have previously developed a Monte Carlo-based nucleosynthesis code that accounts for reaction rate uncertainties and has been applied to nucleosynthesis processes beyond iron. Our framework is also well suited for studying explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae. In this paper, we investigate 1D explosion models using the "PUSH method", focusing on progenitors with varying metallicities and initial masses around $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 16 M_{\odot}$. Detailed post-process nucleosynthesis calculations and Monte Carlo analyses are used to explore the effects of reaction rate uncertainties and to identify key reaction rates in explosive nucleosynthesis. We find that many reactions have little impact on the production of iron-group nuclei, as these elements are primarily synthesized in the nuclear statistical equilibrium. However, we identify a few "key reactions" that significantly influence the production of radioactive nuclei, which may affect astrophysical observables. In particular, for the production of ${}^{44}$Ti, we confirm that several traditionally studied nuclear reactions have a strong impact. However, determining a single reaction rate is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.</description>

      <title>Measurement of $\Lambda$ Polarization in the $\pi^{-}p \to K^{0} \Lambda$ Reaction at $p_{\pi^{-}}=1.33$ GeV/$c$ toward a New $\Lambda p$ Scattering Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18598v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents high-precision experimental data of the polarization of the $\Lambda$ hyperon in the $\pi^{-}p \to K^{0} \Lambda$ reaction, measured in the angular range $0.6&lt;\cos \theta ^{CM}_{K0}&lt;1.0$ with a fine bin width of $d\cos \theta ^{CM}_{K0}=0.05$. The data were obtained from the J-PARC E40 experiment at the K1.8 beamline in the J-PARC Hadron Experimental Facility. The observed average polarization of $\Lambda$ in the range $0.60&lt;\cos \theta ^{CM}_{K0}&lt;0.85$ was $0.932 \pm 0.058 \,(\text{stat}) \pm 0.028 \,(\text{syst})$, demonstrating the successful extraction of precise polarization observables. This result provides essential experimental input for partial wave analysis (PWA) of dynamical coupled-channel (DCC) models, which aim to uncover the underlying mechanisms of $N^{*}$ resonances that emerge in intermediate states of $\pi N$ and $\gamma N$ interactions. Besides, it indicates the feasibility of a strongly polarized $\Lambda$ beam suitable for future $\Lambda p$ scattering experiments (e.g., J-PARC E86).</description>

      <title>Probing a Light Scalar Boson with a few-MeV Proton Beam Deep Underground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to investigate the production of a light scalar boson $\phi$ in low-energy proton-nucleus interactions using the 3.5 MV accelerator of the Bellotti Ion Beam Facility, located in the underground Gran Sasso National Laboratory. Nuclear reactions induced by a few-MeV proton beam on suitable target materials can act as a controlled source of $\phi$ particles. Owing to the deep-underground location, the facility benefits from substantial cosmic-ray shielding, enabling searches for rare processes with minimal background. The produced $\phi$ particles will be sought with large-volume, low-background detectors already operating or currently under construction at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory. This approach combines a tunable accelerator-based production mechanism with the exceptional sensitivity of underground rare-event searches, offering a novel avenue to probe light scalar bosons beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Particle background characterization and prediction for the NUCLEUS reactor CE$\nu$NS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NUCLEUS is a cryogenic detection experiment which aims to measure Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) and to search for new physics at the Chooz nuclear power plant in France. This article reports on the prediction of particle-induced backgrounds, especially focusing on the sub-keV energy range, which is a poorly known region where most of the CE$\nu$NS signal from reactor antineutrinos is expected. Together with measurements of the environmental background radiations at the experimental site, extensive Monte Carlo simulations based on the Geant4 package were run both to optimize the experimental setup for background reduction and to estimate the residual rates arising from different contributions such as cosmic ray-induced radiations, environmental gammas and material radioactivity. The NUCLEUS experimental setup is predicted to achieve a total rejection power of more than two orders of magnitude, leaving a residual background component which is strongly dominated by cosmic ray-induced neutrons. In the CE$\nu$NS signal region of interest between 10 and 100 eV, a total particle background rate of $\sim$ 250 d$^{-1}$kg$^{-1}$keV$^{-1}$ is expected in the CaWO$_4$ target detectors. This corresponds to a signal-to-background ratio $\gtrsim$ 1, and therefore meets the required specifications in terms of particle background rejection for the detection of reactor antineutrinos through CE$\nu$NS.</description>

      <title>Collective effects in O-O and Ne-Ne collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$=5.36 TeV from a hybrid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many features of heavy-ion collisions are well described by hybrid approaches, where the droplet of strongly coupled quark gluon plasma (QGP) is modeled by hydrodynamics and the subsequent dilute stage is performed with a hadronic transport model. Conventionally, the formation of a QGP is well established in larger collision systems like Lead and Gold. However, hints of collectivity were found even in proton-proton collisions, raising the question where the onset of QGP formation lays. This study aims at making predictions for the light ions run at the LHC in July 2025, in order to explore the applicability of hybrid approaches in smaller collision systems. We employ three different models, the SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid, the pure hadronic cascade of SMASH and Angantyr to simulate O-O collisions at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$=5.36 TeV. This setup allows us to compare evolutions with and without a hydrodynamic description on an equal basis, while Angantyr serves as a baseline for no collective effects.</description>
