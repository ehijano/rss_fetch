      <title>Layered Monoidal Theories II: Fibrational Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered monoidal theories provide a categorical framework for studying scientific theories at different levels of abstraction, via string diagrammatic algebra. We introduce models for three closely related classes of layered monoidal theories: fibrational, opfibrational and deflational theories. We prove soundness and completeness of these theories for the respective models. Our work reveals connections between layered monoidal theories and well-known categorical structures such as Grothendieck fibrations and displayed categories.</description>

      <title>A note on varieties of ordered algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to study the notions of lax protomodular and Ord-Mal'tsev category at the level of (coherent) varieties of (pre)ordered algebras and to further compare them, as has been done in the non-ordered context. We characterise varieties of ordered algebras which are (co)lax protomodular and those which are Ord-Mal'tsev, in terms of operations of arities given by ordered sets and inequalities involving them. We exhibit examples of (co)lax protomodular non-degenerate Ord-categories, which were unknown. We prove that, for varieties of ordered algebras which are Ord-Mal'tsev categories, the order of their algebras is degenerate (i.e. is symmetric). As a consequence, the implication "protomodular =&gt; Mal'tsev" cannot be carried out to our context. The case of non-coherent ordered varieties which are Ord-Mal'tsev categories is also addressed, where we show the existence of algebras with non-degenerate order.</description>

      <title>Relative $Q$-shaped homological algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact categories are a natural generalisation of abelian categories and provide a fertile ground to develop relative homological algebra. In this paper, starting from a class of relative Gorenstein projective objects in an exact category $(\mathcal{A},\mathscr{E})$, we define exact model structures on $\mathcal{A}$ and cohomology functors that detect trivial objects and weak equivalences. Moreover, we show that varying the exact structure on $\mathcal{A}$ induces Bousfield (co)localisation sequences between the corresponding homotopy categories. We use these techniques to study the category ${}_{Q,A}\operatorname{Mod}$ of ${}_{A}\operatorname{Mod}$-valued representations, for a ring $A$, of a suitable $\Bbbk$-linear small category $Q$, where we apply our results to a range of objectwise exact structures, ranging from the split exact structure to the abelian one. In particular, we recover the $Q$-shaped derived category of Holm and Jorgensen and construct an intermediate $Q$-shaped homotopy category, analogous to the homotopy category of complexes. Finally, we show that the $Q$-shaped derived category is a Verdier quotient of the $Q$-shaped homotopy category, and that this quotient functor is part of recollement - generalising results of Verdier, Krause, and Iyama-Kato-Miyachi for complexes and $N$-complexes, respectively.</description>

      <title>Effectful Toposes and Their Lawvere-Tierney Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces effectful toposes as an extension of the effective topos and investigates their structure relative to Lawvere-Tierney topologies. First, we formulate effectful toposes by lifting the evidenced frame, which is a recently proposed model for effectful computation. Next, we define Lawvere-Tierney topologies on effectful toposes and characterize the sheaves on them. In the effective topos, Lawvere-Tierney topologies are known to correspond to computational oracles. Finally, to demonstrate that our result contributes to the connection between realizability relativized by oracles and effects, we show that the sheaf topos for the double negation topology is isomorphic to the effectful topos with the Continuation-Passing-Style effect; these toposes serve as a model of classical realizability.</description>

      <title>Coalgebraic analysis of social systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The algebraic analysis of social systems, or algebraic social network analysis, refers to a collection of methods designed to extract information about the structure of a social system represented as a directed graph. Central among these are methods to determine the roles that exist within a given system, and the positions. The analysis of roles and positions is highly developed for social systems that involve only pairwise interactions among actors - however, in contemporary social network analysis it is increasingly common to use models that can take into account higher-order interactions as well. In this paper we take a category-theoretic approach to the question of how to lift role and positional analysis from graphs to hypergraphs, which can accommodate higher-order interactions. We use the framework of universal coalgebra - a 'theory of systems' with origins in computer science and logic - to formalize the main concepts of role and positional analysis and extend them to a large class of structures that includes both graphs and hypergraphs. As evidence for the validity of our definitions, we prove a very general functoriality theorem that specializes, in the case of graphs, to a folkloric observation about the compatibility of positional and role analysis.</description>

      <title>A $j$-translation with Kripke forcing relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a translation that combines the $j$-translation with Kripke forcing in the internal logic of an elementary topos. First, we show that our translation is sound for intuitionistic first-order logic and Heyting arithmetic. Furthermore, its interpretation in the effective topos provides an extension of the sheaf model of realizability introduced by de Jongh and Goodman. As an application, we systematically investigate translations of semi-classical axioms. Based on this investigation, we establish a separation result on semi-classical arithmetics, which cannot be obtained using the usual $j$-realizability.</description>

      <title>Approaching the Continuous from the Discrete: an Infinite Tensor Product Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasingly in recent years, probabilistic computation has been investigated through the lenses of categorical algebra, especially via string diagrammatic calculi. Whereas categories of discrete and Gaussian probabilistic processes have been thoroughly studied, with various axiomatisation results, more expressive classes of continuous probability are less understood, because of the intrinsic difficulty of describing infinite behaviour by algebraic means.
  In this work, we establish a universal construction that adjoins infinite tensor products, allowing continuous probability to be investigated from discrete settings. Our main result applies this construction to $\mathsf{FinStoch}$, the category of finite sets and stochastic matrices, obtaining a category of locally constant Markov kernels, where the objects are finite sets plus the Cantor space $2^{\mathbb{N}}$. Any probability measure on the reals can be reasoned about in this category. Furthermore, we show how to lift axiomatisation results through the infinite tensor product construction. This way we obtain an axiomatic presentation of continuous probability over countable powers of $2=\lbrace 0,1\rbrace$.</description>

      <title>Modular $\mathbb{Z}_2$-Crossed Tambara-Yamagami-like Categories for Even Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct nondegenerate braided $\mathbb{Z}_2$-crossed tensor categories of the form $\operatorname{Vect}_\Gamma\oplus\operatorname{Vect}_{\Gamma/2\Gamma}$. They are $\mathbb{Z}_2$-crossed extensions, in the sense of arXiv:0909.3140, of the braided tensor category $\operatorname{Vect}_\Gamma$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-action given by $-\mathrm{id}$ on the finite, abelian group $\Gamma$. Thus, we obtain generalisations of the Tambara-Yamagami categories, where now the abelian group $\Gamma$ may have even order and the nontrivial sector $\operatorname{Vect}_{\Gamma/2\Gamma}$ more than one simple object.
  The idea for this construction comes from a physically motivated approach in arXiv:2409.16357 to construct $\mathbb{Z}_2$-crossed extensions of $\operatorname{Vect}_\Gamma$ for any $\Gamma$ from an infinite Tambara-Yamagami category $\operatorname{Vect}_{\mathbb{R}^d}\oplus\operatorname{Vect}$, which itself is not fully rigorously defined, and then using condensation from $\operatorname{Vect}_{\mathbb{R}^d}$ to $\operatorname{Vect}_\Gamma$, which we prove commutes with crossed extensions.
  The $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariantisation of $\operatorname{Vect}_\Gamma\oplus\operatorname{Vect}_{\Gamma/2\Gamma}$ yields new modular tensor categories, which correspond to the orbifold of an arbitrary lattice vertex operator algebra under a lift of $-\mathrm{id}$, as discussed in arXiv:2409.16357.</description>

      <title>LeanCat: A Benchmark Suite for Formal Category Theory in Lean (Part I: 1-Categories)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in formal theorem proving, current benchmarks fail to adequately measure library-grounded abstraction -- the ability to reason with high-level interfaces and reusable structures central to modern mathematics and software engineering. We introduce LeanCat, a challenging benchmark comprising 100 fully formalized category-theory tasks in Lean. Unlike algebra or arithmetic, category theory serves as a rigorous stress test for structural, interface-level reasoning. Our evaluation reveals a severe abstraction gap: the best state-of-the-art model solves only 12.0% of tasks at pass@4, with performance collapsing from 55.0% on Easy tasks to 0.0% on High-difficulty tasks, highlighting a failure in compositional generalization. To overcome this, we evaluate LeanBridge, a retrieval-augmented agent that employs a retrieve-generate-verify loop. LeanBridge achieves a peak success rate of 24.0% -- doubling the performance of the best static baseline. These results empirically demonstrate that iterative refinement and dynamic library retrieval are not merely optimizations but strict necessities for neuro-symbolic reasoning in abstract domains. LeanCat offers a compact, reusable testbed for tracking progress toward reliable, research-level formalization.</description>

      <title>Deformation Theory of $\mathbb{E}_n$-Monoidal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the naive deformation problem of an $\mathbb{E}_n$-monoidal stable $k$-linear $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ is a $2$-proximate formal $\mathbb{E}_{n+2}$-moduli problem, whose corresponding formal moduli problem is controlled by the non-unital $\mathbb{E}_{n+2}$-algebra $\mathrm{fib}\big(\mathrm{End}_{\mathcal{Z}_{\mathbb{E}_n}(\mathcal{C})}(1)\rightarrow \mathrm{End}_{\mathcal{C}}(1)\big)$, where $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathbb{E}_n}(\mathcal{C})$ is the $\mathbb{E}_n$-center of $\mathcal{C}$. If $\mathcal{C}$ is rigid monoidal and tamely compactly generated by unobstructible objects, then this naive deformation problem is equivalent to the formal moduli problem. We also prove a uniqueness theorem for formal deformations of certain formal moduli problems, which can be applied to the $\mathbb{E}_1$ and $\mathbb{E}_2$-monoidal deformation problems of $\mathbf{Rep}(G)$ for a reductive algebraic group $G$ with a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}=T_e G$. Finally, we show factorization homology is compatible with deformations.</description>
