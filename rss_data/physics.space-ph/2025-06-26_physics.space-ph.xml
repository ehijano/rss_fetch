      <title>Particle Injection Problem in Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection and turbulence in magnetically-dominated environments have been proposed as important nonthermal particle acceleration mechanisms that generate high energy particles and associated emissions. While the acceleration to high energy that produces the power-law energy distribution has drawn strong interest, recent studies actively discuss pre-acceleration, or injection, to a sufficient energy for a sustained and prolonged Fermi-like acceleration. The injection process is important for determining the fraction of nonthermal particles and energy partition between thermal and nonthermal particles. We review recent advances in understanding the injection mechanisms responsible for populating these nonthermal power-law spectra, and conclude with an outlook for studies and applications of injection models.</description>

      <title>Direct High-Resolution Imaging of Earth-Like Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have surveyed all conventional methods proposed or conceivable for obtaining resolved images of an Earth-like exoplanet. Generating a 10x10 pixel map of a 1 R_Earth world at 10 pc demands ~0.85 uas angular resolution and photon collection sufficient for SNR &gt;= 5 per "micro-pixel". We derived diffraction-limit and photon-budget requirements for: (1) large single-aperture space telescopes with internal coronagraphs; (2) external starshades; (3) space-based interferometry (nulling and non-nulling); (4) ground-based extremely large telescopes with extreme adaptive optics; (5) pupil-densified "hypertelescopes"; (6) indirect reconstructions (rotational light-curve inversion, eclipse mapping, intensity interferometry); and (7) diffraction occultation by Solar System bodies. Even though these approaches serve their primary goals - exoplanet discovery and initial coarse characterization - each remains orders of magnitude away from delivering a spatially resolved image. In every case, technology readiness falls short, and fundamental barriers leave them 2-5 orders of magnitude below the astrometric resolution and photon-budget thresholds needed to map an Earth analog even on decadal timescales. Ultimately, an in situ platform delivered to &lt;= 0.1 AU of the target could, in principle, overcome both diffraction and photon-starvation limits - but such a mission far exceeds current propulsion, autonomy, and communications capabilities. By contrast, the Solar Gravitational Lens - providing on-axis gain of ~1e10 and inherent uas-scale focusing once a spacecraft reaches &gt;=550 AU - remains the only near-term, scientifically and technologically viable means to acquire true, resolved surface images and spatially resolved spectroscopy of Earth-like exoplanets in our stellar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Time-Dependent Diffusive Shock Acceleration in the 2022 September 5 Solar Energetic Particle Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On 2022 September 5, a large solar energetic particle (SEP) event was detected by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO), at heliocentric distances of 0.07 and 0.71 au, respectively. PSP observed an unusual velocity-dispersion signature: particles below $\sim$1 MeV exhibited a normal velocity dispersion, while higher-energy particles displayed an inverse velocity arrival feature, with the most energetic particles arriving later than those at lower energies. The maximum energy increased from about 20-30 MeV upstream to over 60 MeV downstream of the shock. The arrival of SEPs at PSP was significantly delayed relative to the expected onset of the eruption. In contrast, SolO detected a typical large SEP event characterized by a regular velocity dispersion at all energies up to 100 MeV. To understand these features, we simulate particle acceleration and transport from the shock to the observers with our newly developed SEP model - Particle ARizona and MIchigan Solver on Advected Nodes (PARMISAN). Our results reveal that the inverse velocity arrival and delayed particle onset detected by PSP originate from the time-dependent diffusive shock acceleration processes. After shock passage, PSP's magnetic connectivity gradually shifted due to its high velocity near perihelion, detecting high-energy SEPs streaming sunward. Conversely, SolO maintained a stable magnetic connection to the strong shock region where efficient acceleration was achieved. These results underscore the importance of spatial and temporal dependence in SEP acceleration at interplanetary shocks, and provide new insights to understand SEP variations in the inner heliosphere.</description>
