      <title>Finite density lattice QCD without extrapolations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite density lattice QCD usually relies on extrapolations in baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B$), be it Taylor expansion, T' expansion (\cite{Borsanyi:2021sxv}) or analytical continuation. However, their range of validity is difficult to control. In the canonical formulation, the baryon density is the parameter of the system, not $\mu_B$. Here we demonstrate that we can access finite density QCD in the canonical formulation with physical quark masses. We present first results with both the strangeness ($n_S$) and baryon ($n_B$) densities as parameters. Specifically, we compute the QCD pressure and chemical potentials as functions of $n_B$ and $n_S$. Our computations rely on high-statistics simulations with 2+1 4HEX-staggered fermions.</description>

      <title>Lattice determination of the QCD low-energy constant $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a non-perturbative determination of the scheme- and scale-independent low-energy constant $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}}$, appearing in the QCD effective chiral Lagrangian at next-to-leading order, by means of lattice QCD simulations with $N_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm f}}=2+1$ quark flavors. We adopt staggered fermions and extract $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}}$ from the pion mass splitting by suitably generalizing the method introduced in [Phys. Rev. D 104 (2021) 074513] for the Wilson discretization. Adopting 12 gauge ensembles with 3 different values of the pion mass, and 4 different values of the lattice spacing, we are able to achieve controlled extrapolations towards the continuum, infinite volume, and chiral limits. Our final result $\ell_{\scriptscriptstyle{7}} \,\times \, 10^3 = 1.98(48)_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm stat}}(26)_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm syst}} = 1.98(54)_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm tot}}$ agrees with and substantially improves on previous determinations.</description>

      <title>Real-time collisions of fractional charges in a trapped-ion Jackiw-Rebbi field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a trapped-ion quantum simulator of the Jackiw-Rebbi model, a paradigmatic quantum field theory in (1+1) dimensions where solitonic excitations of a scalar field can bind fermionic zero modes leading to fractionally charged excitations. In our approach, the scalar field is a coarse-grained description of the planar zigzag ion displacements in the vicinity of a structural phase transition. The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering. Our results reveal how back-reaction and quantum fluctuations modify the stability and real-time evolution of fractionalized fermions, predicting experimentally accessible signatures in current trapped-ion architectures.</description>

      <title>Dispersive determination of resonances from $\pi\pi$ scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a precise, model- and parametrization-independent dispersive determination of the $f_0(500)$, $\rho(770)$, $f_0(980)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_0(1370)$, $\rho(1450)$, $f_0(1500)$, and $\rho_3(1690)$ resonance pole parameters. They are obtained from the analytic continuation, by means of continued fractions, of forward dispersion relations, whose input is a recent global dispersive analysis of $\pi \pi$ scattering data. From this dispersive study, we find no indications of other resonant poles below 1.7 GeV. Beyond this energy, we also provide resonance pole parameters from the direct analytic continuation of Global Fits to the three existing incompatible data sets. Depending on the data set we find poles for the $\rho(1700)$, $f_0(1710)$, $\rho(1900)$, $f_2(1950)$, and $f_0(2020)$ resonances. We also present the Argand diagrams of these Global Fits and illustrate that each resonance does not necessarily have to trace a full circle in the diagram.</description>

      <title>Quantum bootstrap for central potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum-mechanical bootstrap as it applies to the bound states of several central potentials in three dimensions. As part of this effort, we show how the bootstrap approach may be applied to ``non-algebraic'' potentials, such as the Yukawa potential (which asymptotically decays as an exponential) and a Gaussian potential. We additionally review the bootstrap of the Coulomb potential, demonstrate a high-precision bootstrap of the Cornell potential, and study conformal quantum mechanics. These results further recommend the bootstrap as a numerical method for high-precision calculations of ground-state physics, where applicable: for example, we are able to determine the critical coupling in the Cornell potential to better than one part in $10^7$, the most precise determination to date. Lower bounds on energies are also of high precision, occasionally one part in greater than $10^8$. Finally, we discuss the circumstances under which we are able to obtain meaningful upper bounds on ground-state energies.</description>

      <title>Insights into Nucleon Resonances via Continuum Schwinger Function Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first baryon resonance was discovered in the early 1950s. The Roper resonance joined the collection ten years later. Today, many baryon resonances are known and more are being discovered. As baryons, these states are the must fundamental three-body systems in Nature. They must all be understood, not just the isolated ground state nucleon. This contribution sketches applications of continuum Schwinger function methods to the baryon resonance problem. Whilst spectroscopy is of value, particular emphasis is placed on resonance electroproduction because transition form factors extracted from electroproduction data provide a keen tool for revealing resonance structure.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative corrections to the Casimir energy for a scalar field theory with non-linear boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the case of a free real massive bulk scalar in D=4 dimensions, and embed two parallel plates as interfaces on which we impose non-linear boundary conditions, either Dirichlet- or Neumann-like, parameterized by a new coupling constant g. This mimics a non-Abelian gauge theory supplemented with boundary conditions on surfaces embedded in the bulk. We present the first evidence for a non-perturbative 1/g^2 boundary mass generation and its ensuing correction to the standard Casimir energy. This becomes possible by incorporating dynamical corrections to the effective boundary fields, which are used to build in the boundary conditions directly at the action level.</description>

      <title>A Precise $\alpha_s$ Determination from the R-improved QCD Static Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong coupling $\alpha_s$ is extracted with high precision through fits to lattice-QCD data for the static energy. Our theoretical framework is based on R-improving the three-loop fixed-order prediction for the static energy: we remove the $u=1/2$ renormalon and resum the associated large infrared logarithms. Combined with radius-dependent renormalization scales (the so-called profile functions), this procedure extends the range of validity of perturbation theory to distances as large as $\sim 0.5\,$fm. In addition, we resum large ultrasoft logarithms to N$^3$LL accuracy using renormalization-group evolution. Since the standard four-loop R-evolution treats N$^4$LL and higher-order contributions asymmetrically, we also incorporate this potential source of bias in our analysis. Our estimate of the perturbative uncertainty is obtained through a random scan over the parameters controlling the profile functions and the implementation of R-evolution. We analyze how the extracted value of $\alpha_s$ depends on the shortest and longest distances included in the fit, on the details of the R-evolution procedure, on the fitting strategy itself, and on the accuracy of ultrasoft resummation. From our final analysis, and after evolution to the $Z$ pole, we obtain $\alpha^{(n_f=5)}_s(m_Z)=0.1170\pm 0.0009$, a result fully compatible with the world average and with a comparable uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Necessary and sufficient conditions for correctness of complex Langevin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a family of correctness conditions for complex Langevin simulations. In particular, we show that if in a given theory the expectation values of all observables within a particular space satisfy the theory's Schwinger-Dyson equations as well as certain bounds, then these expectation values are necessarily correct. In fact, these findings are not only valid in the context of complex Langevin simulations, but they also hold for general probability densities on complex manifolds, given an initial complex density on a real manifold. We stress that, while the proposed conditions are necessary and sufficient in a mathematical sense, their practical use is not to prove the correctness of obtained simulation results. Rather, they are mainly useful for detecting incorrect convergence. In particular, we test these criteria in a few simple one- and two-dimensional toy models and find that they are indeed capable of ruling out incorrect results without the need of exact solutions.</description>

      <title>First Self-Renormalized Gluon PDF of Nucleon from Large-Momentum Effective Theory in the Continuum Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first lattice-QCD determination of the nucleon gluon parton distribution function (PDF) within the large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) framework, employing the hybrid scheme with self renormalization, in the continuum limit. High statistics calculations with boost momentum $P_z \approx 2.0$-$2.2$~GeV are performed at lattice spacings of $a \approx \{ 0.15, 0.12, 0.09 \}$~fm, a pion mass of $M_\pi \approx 310$~MeV, with $N_f=2+1+1$ quark flavors. We apply gradient flow smearing with $\mathcal{T}_\text{W} = 3a^2$, finding that self-renormalization remains stable. The renormalized gluon matrix elements and PDFs show consistent behavior across lattice spacings, with the $a \approx 0.09$~fm results statistically compatible with the continuum limit. Our final LaMET gluon PDF compares reasonably with select global-fit determinations, specifically preferring analyses which have near-zero gluonic density in the $x \gtrsim 0.6$ region.</description>

      <title>Systematic Study of the Self-Renormalized Nucleon Gluon PDF in Large-Momentum Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the nucleon gluon parton distribution function (PDF) using the self-renormalized large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) approach in lattice QCD. This work extends previous gluon-PDF extractions by performing a detailed analysis of key systematic effects, including gauge-link smearing, lattice spacing, pion mass, and nucleon boost momentum. The self-renormalization framework mitigates ultraviolet divergences associated with Wilson-line self-energy and renormalon contributions by combining lattice matrix elements with perturbative short-distance information, thereby preserving the correct infrared structure. Calculations are performed on $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ ensembles generated by the MILC Collaboration at three lattice spacings and two pion masses, with boosted nucleon states reaching momenta up to 2.2~GeV. We determine renormalization factors from zero-momentum matrix elements and apply hybrid renormalization to suppress discretization artifacts. After extrapolating large-separation behavior and performing Fourier transforms, we reconstruct quasi-PDFs and match them to lightcone PDFs using next-to-leading order Wilson coefficients. Our results demonstrate that smearing and lattice-spacing effects are under control, and pion-mass and lattice-spacing dependence is mild relative to the current $O(10^6)$ statistics; however, momentum dependence remains a significant source of uncertainty. Future work including even larger boost momenta will be essential to reduce systematics in lattice determinations of the gluon PDF and to advance toward precision QCD phenomenology at the LHC and the future Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Global QCD analysis of spin PDFs in the proton with high-$x$ and lattice constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive global QCD analysis of spin-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs), combining all available data on inclusive and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), as well as inclusive weak boson and jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions, simultaneously extracting spin-averaged PDFs and fragmentation functions. Including recent Jefferson Lab DIS data at high $x$, together with subleading power corrections to the leading twist framework, allows us to verify the stability of the PDFs for $W^2 \geq 4$ GeV$^2$ and quantify the uncertainties on the spin structure functions more reliably. We explore the use of new lattice QCD data on gluonic pseudo Ioffe-time distributions, which, together with jet production and high-$x$ DIS data, improve the constraints on the polarized gluon PDF. The expanded kinematic reach afforded by the data into the high-$x$ region allows us to refine the bounds on higher twist contributions to the spin structure functions, and test the validity of the Bjorken sum rule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate thermal properties of a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory in $1+1$-dimensions through real-time simulations. We extract the spectral functions directly coupling to the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons, demonstrating the thermal modifications of these states with increasing temperatures. Introducing the notion of energy-flow operators, we quantify the temporal build-up of correlations in the energy flows across the lattice. We demonstrate that energy-energy correlators fail to factorize to products of energy flows, both in the vacuum and at nonzero-temperature, indicating the presence of non-trivial correlations in the quantum states. Our results constitute a first real-time \textit{ab-initio} study of bound state thermal broadening and finite temperature energy-flow correlations in a gauge theory, providing a benchmark for future studies of hadronic matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>The Semiclassical limit of $SU(3)$ Gauge Field Coherent States: Peakedness and Overlap Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the heat kernel method, we construct diffeomorphism-covariant coherent states for the $SU(3)$ gauge group. We numerically demonstrate that these states exhibit the required semiclassical properties in the semiclassical limit: the peakedness property of the probability distribution and the peakedness property of the overlap function. We also provide the leading order term of the overlap amplitude in the combined limit where $t \rightarrow 0$ and $g\rightarrow g'$. This work provides the essential tool for deriving effective dynamics for $SU(3)$ gauge fields coupled to gravity via a coherent state path integral.</description>
