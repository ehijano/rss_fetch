      <title>The 2024 Active Metamaterials Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active metamaterials are engineered structures that possess novel properties that can be changed after the point of manufacture. Their novel properties arise predominantly from their physical structure, as opposed to their chemical composition and can be changed through means such as direct energy addition into wave paths, or physically changing/morphing the structure in response to both a user or environmental input. Active metamaterials are currently of wide interest to the physics community and encompass a range of sub-domains in applied physics (e.g. photonic, microwave, acoustic, mechanical, etc.). They possess the potential to provide solutions that are more suitable to specific applications, or which allow novel properties to be produced which cannot be achieved with passive metamaterials, such as time-varying or gain enhancement effects. They have the potential to help solve some of the important current and future problems faced by the advancement of modern society, such as achieving net-zero, sustainability, healthcare and equality goals. Despite their huge potential, the added complexity of their design and operation, compared to passive metamaterials creates challenges to the advancement of the field, particularly beyond theoretical and lab-based experiments. This roadmap brings together experts in all types of active metamaterials and across a wide range of areas of applied physics. The objective is to provide an overview of the current state of the art and the associated current/future challenges, with the hope that the required advances identified create a roadmap for the future advancement and application of this field.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale Semiconductor Grafting: Enabling High-Performance, Lattice-Mismatched Heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor heterojunctions are foundational to many advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, achieving high-quality, lattice-mismatched interfaces remains challenging, limiting both scalability and device performance. Semiconductor grafting offers a promising solution by directly forming electrically active, lattice-mismatched heterojunctions between dissimilar materials. However, its scalability and uniformity at the wafer level have yet to be demonstrated. This work demonstrates the achievement of highly uniform, reproducible results across silicon, sapphire, and gallium nitride (GaN) substrates using wafer-scale semiconductor grafting. To illustrate this scalability, we conducted an in-depth study of a grafted Si/GaN heterojunction, examining band alignment through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and confirming crystallinity and interfacial integrity with scanning transmission electron microscopy. The resulting p-n diodes exhibit significantly enhanced electrical performance and wafer-scale uniformity compared to conventional approaches. This work establishes wafer-scale semiconductor grafting as a versatile and scalable technology, bridging the gap between laboratory-scale research and industrial manufacturing for heterogeneous semiconductor integration, and paving the way for novel, high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Solid-state batteries enabled by ultra-high-frequency self-heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state batteries (SSBs) are promising next-generation batteries due to their high energy density and enhanced thermal stability and safety. However, their sluggish kinetics and transport at room temperature results in high internal impedance and critically reduces the attainable discharge energy density. Taking advantage of their strong temperature-dependent ionic conductivity, here we introduce ultra-high frequency ($&gt;10^5$ Hz) self-heating (UHFSH) of SSBs, which can rapidly warm up the batteries from room temperature to operating temperature (~65 {\deg}C) in less than a minute. As proof of concept, UHFSH experiments were conducted on symmetric solid-state cells with lithium aluminum germanium phosphate (LAGP) electrolyte with different configurations. Using an experimentally validated model, pack-level simulations predict fast heating (50 K/min) and minimized heating energy consumption (less than 4%). Without any modification of the materials or structure of the batteries, our non-intrusive self-heating strategy enables the SSBs to discharge more than two-fold energy in 25 {\deg}C ambient.</description>

      <title>Manufacturing carbon nanotube transistors using lift-off process: limitations and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) are regarded as promising candidates for next-generation energy-efficient computing systems. While research has employed the lift-off process to demonstrate the performance of CNT FETs, this method now poses challenges for enhancing individual FET performance and is not suitable for scalable fabrication. In this paper, we summarize the limitations of the lift-off process and point out that future advancements in manufacturing techniques should prioritize the development of etching processes.</description>

      <title>Remote-sensing based control of 3D magnetic fields using machine learning for in-operando applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-operando techniques enable real-time measurement of intricate physical properties at the micro- and nano-scale under external stimuli, allowing the study of a wide range of materials and functionalities. In nanomagnetism, in-operando techniques greatly benefit from precise three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field control, enabling access to complex magnetic states forming in systems where multiple energies are set to compete with each other. However, achieving such precision is challenging and uncommon, as specific applications impose constraints on the type and geometry of magnetic field sources, limiting their capabilities.
  Here, we introduce an approach that leverages machine learning algorithms to achieve precise 3D magnetic field control using a hexapole electromagnet that is composed of three independent, non-collinear dipole electromagnets. In our experimental setup, magnetic field sensors are placed at a distance from the sample position due to inherent constraints, leading to indirect field measurements that differ from the magnetic field experienced by the sample. We find that the existing relationship between the remote and sample frames of reference is non-linear, thus requiring a more complex calibration method. To address this, we employ a multi-layer perceptron neural network that processes multiple inputs from a dynamic magnetic field sequence, effectively capturing the time-dependent non-linear field response. The network achieves high calibration accuracy and demonstrates exceptional generalization to unseen magnetic field sequences. This study highlights the significant potential of machine learning in achieving high-precision control and calibration, crucial for in-operando experiments where direct measurement at the point of interest is not possible.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nitrogen vacancy centre in diamond is a versatile color center widely used for magnetometry, quantum computing, and quantum communications. In this article, we develop a new magnetometer using an ensemble of nitrogen vacancy centers and the Faraday effect. The sensitivity of our magnetometer is $300~nT/ \sqrt{Hz}$. We argue that by using an optical cavity and a high purity diamond, sensitivities in the femtotesla level can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of InGaAs and GaAsSb Nanowires for Room Temperature Operation of Avalanche Photodiodes at 1.55 {\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: III V semiconductor nanowire based photodetectors have significant potential for remote sensing and LiDAR applications, particularly due to their ability to operate at 1.55 {\mu}m. Achieving room temperature operation and near unity absorption using these nanowires at 1.55 {\mu}m is crucial for single photon detection, which offers a promising solution to the challenges posed by the existing superconducting nanowire single photon detectors. Key materials suited for this wavelength include lattice matched In0.53Ga0.47As and Ga0.5As0.5Sb to InP. This study reports a comparison between InGaAs and GaAsSb nanowires to achieve high absorption efficiency at room temperature. Through optimized nanowire arrangement and geometry, we aim to maximize absorption. Our approach features a comparative analysis of patterned InGaAs and GaAsSb nanowires with absorption characteristics modeled using finite difference time domain simulations to enhance absorption at the target wavelength. We also present the complete workflow for nanowire fabrication, modeling, and simulation, encompassing the production of tapered nanowire structures and measurement of their absorption efficiency. Our experimental results show that tapered InGaAs and GaAsSb nanowires exhibit an absorption efficiency of 93% and 92%, respectively, at room temperature around 1.55 {\mu}m.</description>

      <title>Solvated Electrons and Hydroxyl Radicals at the Plasma-Liquid Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While hydroxyl radicals ($\cdot$OH) play an important role as potent oxidizing agents in various plasma applications, their high reactivity confines them to a thin layer at the plasma-liquid interface, posing challenges in comprehending the intricate generation and transport processes. Similarly, solvated electrons ($\mathrm{e_{aq}}$), highly reactive reducing agents, are expected to exhibit distribution beneath the liquid surface and interact with $\cdot$OH in the thin layer. In this study, we have determined the penetration depth and concentration of ($\mathrm{e_{aq}}$) at the interface between an atmospheric argon plasma plume and an electrolyte anode via a lock-in amplification absorbance measurement. With bias voltages from 1000 to 2500 V, the penetration depth remains approximately 10 nm, and the peak concentration near the surface reaches 1 mM. Diffusion is the primary mechanism for $\cdot$OH generation in the electrolyte, with most $\cdot$OH reacting with ($\mathrm{e_{aq}}$) at the interface, thus influencing the ($\mathrm{e_{aq}}$) distribution. In contrast, the electrolyte cathode significantly boosts $\cdot$OH generation, leading to rapid recombination into hydrogen peroxide.</description>

      <title>Enhanced heat dissipation and lowered power consumption in electronics using two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Miniaturization of electronic components has led to overheating, increasing power consumption and causing early circuit failures. Conventional heat dissipation methods are becoming inadequate due to limited surface area and higher short-circuit risks. This study presents a fast, low-cost, and scalable technique using 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) coatings to enhance heat dissipation in commercial electronics. Inexpensive hBN layers, applied by drop casting or spray coating, boost thermal conductivity at IC surfaces from below 0.3 W/m-K to 260 W/m-K, resulting in over double the heat flux and convective heat transfer. This significantly reduces operating temperatures and power consumption, as demonstrated by a 17.4% reduction in a coated audio amplifier circuit board. Density functional theory indicates enhanced interaction between 2D hBN and packaging materials as a key factor. This approach promises substantial energy and cost savings for large-scale electronics without altering existing manufacturing processes.</description>

      <title>The Performance of Seeded Free-Electron Lasers Through Dispersion Strength Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, external seeded free electron lasers (FELs) have achieved significant advancements across various disciplines, progressively establishing themselves as indispensable tools in fields ranging from fundamental science to industrial applications. The performance of seeded FELs is critically dependent on the quality of the frequency up-conversion process. Optimized conditions for seeded FELs are typically considered as the maximization of the bunching factor. This paper discusses alternative perspectives on the optimization criteria for seeded FELs by analyzing the impact of dispersion strength on their overall performance. We investigate the relationship among the required dispersion strength for achieving the maximum bunching factor, maximum pulse energy, and optimal energy stability through theoretical analysis, simulation calculations, and experimental explorations. Additionally, the direct observation of pulse splitting emphasizes the consideration of trade-off between pulse energy and temporal coherence in seeded FELs. These results provide valuable insights and practical guidance for controlling the pulse characteristics of seeded FELs, contributing to the tuning and optimization of FEL facilities.</description>

      <title>Erbium doped yttrium oxide thin films grown by chemical vapour deposition for quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The obtention of quantum-grade rare-earth doped oxide thin films that can be integrated with optical cavities and microwave resonators is of great interest for the development of scalable quantum devices. Among the different growth methods, Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) offers high flexibility and has demonstrated the ability to produce oxide films hosting rare-earth ions with narrow linewidths. However, growing epitaxial films directly on silicon is challenging by CVD due to a native amorphous oxide layer formation at the interface. In this manuscript, we investigate the CVD growth of erbium-doped yttrium oxide (Er:Y2O3) thin films on different substrates, including silicon, sapphire, quartz or yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Alternatively, growth was also attempted on an epitaxial Y2O3 template layer on Si (111) prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in order to circumvent the issue of the amorphous interlayer. We found that the substrate impacts the film morphology and the crystalline orientations, with different textures observed for the CVD film on the MBE-oxide/Si template (111) and epitaxial growth on YSZ (001). In terms of optical properties, Er3+ ions exhibit visible and IR emission features that are comparable for all samples, indicating a high-quality local crystalline environment regardless of the substrate. Our approach opens interesting prospects to integrate such films into scalable devices for optical quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing with duplex qubits of silicon vacancy centers in SiC at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The silicon vacancy center in Silicon Carbide (SiC) provides an optically addressable qubit at room temperature in its spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ electronic state. However, optical spin initialization and readout are less efficient compared to those of spin-1 systems, such as nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, under non-resonant optical excitation. Spin-dependent fluorescence exhibits contrast only between $|m=\pm 3/2\rangle$ and $|m=\pm 1/2\rangle$ states, and optical pumping does not create a population difference between $|+1/2\rangle$ and $|-1/2\rangle$ states. Thus, operating one qubit (e.g., $\left\{|+3/2\rangle, |+1/2\rangle \right\}$ states) leaves the population in the remaining state ($|-1/2\rangle$) unaffected, contributing to background in optical readout. To mitigate this problem, we propose a sensing scheme based on duplex qubit operation in the quartet, using microwave pulses with two resonant frequencies to simultaneously operate $\left\{ |+3/2\rangle, |+1/2\rangle \right\}$ and $\left\{ |-1/2\rangle, |-3/2\rangle \right\}$. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach doubles signal contrast in optical readout and improves sensitivity in AC magnetometry compared to simplex operation.</description>

      <title>Indium tin oxide combined with anti-reflective coatings with high transmittance for wavelengths &lt; 400 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transparent and conductive properties of indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films, make them an attractive coating for optically integrated ion traps. However, the relatively low transmittance for wavelengths $&lt;$ 400 nm, high scattering and high production temperature limits the usability in trapped-ion-based quantum technologies. Here we present ITO coatings and a combined ITO + anti-reflective (AR) coating system optimized for an ion trap applied using ion beam sputtering (IBS). The coatings feature a high transmittance for wavelengths $&lt;$ 400 nm and additional wavelengths up to 1000 nm, low scattering and low production temperature $&lt;$ 150 $^{\circ}$C. The transmission, reflection and absorption spectra are simulated and the resistance, transmittance and scattering at 370 nm are measured for different ITO coating thicknesses and the ITO + AR coating system. For the ITO + AR coating system a resistance of 115 $\pm$ 5 $\Omega/\Box$, transmittance of 80$\%$ and scattering of 0.012 $\pm$ 0.002$\%$ at 370 nm is achieved.</description>

Integrating high-k pillars with superjunction structures beneath the split gate enhancing breakdown performance by reducing critical field intensity by up to 35%, the device achieves a 15% improvement in Figures of Merit (FOMs) for BV2/Ron,sp. Dynamic testing reveals approximately a 25% reduction in both input and output capacitance, as well as gate-to-drain charge (QGD). This reduction, coupled with an approximately 40% improvement in Baliga's High-Frequency Figure of Merit (BHFFOM) and over 20% increase in the New High-Frequency Figure of Merit (NHFFOM), underscores the design's suitability for high-speed, high-efficiency power electronics. Simulations examining the effects of high-k pillar depth indicate that an optimal depth of 3.5 um achieves a balanced performance between BV and Ron,sp. The influence of high-k materials on BT-Hk-SJ MOSFET performance was investigated by comparing hafnium dioxide (HfO2), nitride, and oxynitride. Among these, HfO2 demonstrated optimal performance across static, dynamic, and diode characteristics due to its high dielectric constant, while material choice had minimal impact, with variations kept within 5%.</description>

      <title>Real-time Deformation Correction in Additively Printed Flexible Antenna Arrays</title>

Abstract: Conformal phased arrays provide multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, which is typically limited by antenna aperture in rigid arrays. Silicon-based RF signal processing offers reliable, reconfigurable, multi-functional, and compact control for conformal phased arrays that can be used for on-the-move communication. While the lightweight, compactness, and shape-changing properties of the conformal phased arrays are attractive, these features result in dynamic deformation of the array during motion leading to significant dynamic beam pointing errors. We propose a silicon-based, compact, reconfigurable solution to self-correct these dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. Furthermore, additive printing is leveraged to enhance the flexibility of the conformal phased arrays, as the printed conductive ink is more flexible than bulk copper and can be easily deposited on flexible sheets using different printing tools, providing an environmentally-friendly solution for large-scale production. The inks such as conventional silver inks are expensive and copper-based printable inks suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. This work uses a low-cost molecular copper decomposition ink with reliable RF properties at different temperature and strain to print the proposed intelligent conformal phased array operating at 2.1 GHz. Proof-of-concept prototype $2\times2$ array self-corrects the deformation induces beampointing error with an error $&lt;1.25^\circ$. The silicon based array processing part occupying only 2.58 mm$^2$ area and 83 mW power per tile.</description>

      <title>Dense Suspension Inertial Microfluidic Particle Theory (DENSE-IMPACT) Model for Elucidating Outer Wall Focusing at High Cell Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inertial microfluidics has been limited to dilute particle concentrations due to defocusing (spreading out) at high particle concentrations. We observe a counterintuitive shift of focusing to the outer curved wall under high concentration flow, which contradicts the existing particle focusing theory. We developed a multiphase model incorporating lift forces and particle-particle interactions to explain this behaviour. Numerical simulations validated by experimental data reveal the shift is governed by the ratio of the lift force strength to that of particle interaction frequencies.</description>

      <title>Dual axis atomic magnetometer and gyroscope enabled by nuclear spin perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>
