      <title>Valleytronics and negative differential resistance in cubic boron nitride: a first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cubic boron nitride (c-BN) is an ultrawide-bandgap semiconductor of significant interest for high-frequency and high-power electronics applications owing to its high saturation drift velocity and high electric breakdown field. Beyond transistors, devices exploiting the valley degree of freedom or negative differential resistance are of keen interest. While diamond has been found to have potential for these applications, c-BN has not been considered owing to a lack of knowledge of the relevant charge transport properties. Here, we report a study of the high-field transport and noise properties of c-BN using first-principles calculations. We find that c-BN exhibits an abrupt region of negative differential resistance (NDR) below 140 K, despite the lack of multi-valley band structure typically associated with NDR. This feature is found to arise from a strong energy dependence of the scattering rates associated with optical phonon emission. The high optical phonon energy also leads to an intervalley scattering time rivaling that of diamond. The negative differential resistance and long intervalley scattering time indicate the potential of c-BN for transferred-electron and valleytronic devices, respectively.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Structure and Stability of Oxide Nanoscrolls from Dichalcogenide Precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional nanostructures such as nanotubes, nanoscrolls, and nanofilms have found applications in a wide variety of fields such as photocatalysis, sensing, and drug delivery. Recently, Chu et al. demonstrated that nanoscrolls of Mo and W transition metal oxides, which do not exhibit van der Waals (vdW) layering in their bulk counterparts, can be successfully synthesized using a plasma processing of corresponding layered transition metal dichalcogenides. In this work, we employ data mining, first-principles simulations, and physio-mechanical models to theoretically examine the potential of other dichalcogenide precursors to form oxide nanoscrolls. Through data mining of bulk and two-dimensional materials databases, we first identify dichalcogenides that would be mostly amenable to plasma processing on the basis of their vdW layering and thermodynamic stability. To determine the propensity of forming a nanoscroll, we develop a first-principles simulation-based physio-mechanical model to determine the thermodynamic stability of nanoscrolling as well as the equilibrium structure of the nanoscrolls, i.e. their inner radius, outer radius, and interlayer spacing. We validate this model using the experimental observations of Chu et al.'s study and find an excellent agreement for the equilibrium nanoscroll structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model's energies can be utilized for a generalized quantitative categorization of nanoscroll stability. We apply the model to study the oxide nanoscroll formation in MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, PdS$_2$, HfS$_2$ and GeS$_2$, paving the way for a systematic study of oxide nanoscroll formation atop other dichalcogenide substrates.</description>

      <title>Covariance Linkage Assimilation method for Unobserved Data Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a materials search method combining a data assimilation technique based on a multivariate Gaussian distribution with Bayesian optimization. The efficiency of the optimization using this method was demonstrated using a model function. By combining Bayesian optimization with data assimilation, the maximum value of the model function was found more efficiently. A practical demonstration was also conducted by constructing a data assimilation model for the bandgap of (Sr$_{1-x_{1}-x_{2}}$La$_{x_{1}}$Na$_{x_{2}}$)(Ti$_{1-x_{1}-x_{2}}$Ga$_{x_{1}}$Ta$_{x_{2}}$)O$_{3}$. The concentration dependence of the bandgap was analyzed, and synthesis was performed with chemical compositions in the sparse region of the training data points to validate the predictions.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Imaging of Fractional Spinon Quasiparticles in Open-Shell Triangulene Spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of spinon quasiparticles, which carry spin but lack charge, is a hallmark of collective quantum phenomena in low-dimensional quantum spin systems. While the existence of spinons has been demonstrated through scattering spectroscopy in ensemble samples, real-space imaging of these quasiparticles within individual spin chains has remained elusive. In this study, we construct individual Heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chains using open-shell [2]triangulene molecules as building blocks. Each [2]triangulene unit, owing to its sublattice imbalance, hosts a net spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ in accordance with Lieb's theorem, and these spins are antiferromagnetically coupled within covalent chains with a coupling strength of $J = 45$ meV. Through scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we probe the spin states, excitation gaps, and their spatial excitation weights within covalent spin chains of varying lengths with atomic precision. Our investigation reveals that the excitation gap decreases as the chain length increases, extrapolating to zero for long chains, consistent with Haldane's gapless prediction. Moreover, inelastic tunneling spectroscopy reveals an m-shaped energy dispersion characteristic of confined spinon quasiparticles in a one-dimensional quantum box. These findings establish a promising strategy for exploring the unique properties of excitation quasiparticles and their broad implications for quantum information.</description>

      <title>Accelerating ab initio melting property calculations with machine learning: Application to the high entropy alloy TaVCrW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Melting properties are critical for designing novel materials, especially for discovering high-performance, high-melting refractory materials. Experimental measurements of these properties are extremely challenging due to their high melting temperatures. Complementary theoretical predictions are, therefore, indispensable. The conventional free energy approach using density functional theory (DFT) has been a gold standard for such purposes because of its high accuracy. However,it generally involves expensive thermodynamic integration using ab initio molecular dynamic simulations. The high computational cost makes high-throughput calculations infeasible. Here, we propose a highly efficient DFT-based method aided by a specially designed machine learning potential. As the machine learning potential can closely reproduce the ab initio phase space, even for multi-component alloys, the costly thermodynamic integration can be fully substituted with more efficient free energy perturbation calculations. The method achieves overall savings of computational resources by 80% compared to current alternatives. We apply the method to the high-entropy alloy TaVCrW and calculate its melting properties, including melting temperature, entropy and enthalpy of fusion, and volume change at the melting point. Additionally, the heat capacities of solid and liquid TaVCrW are calculated. The results agree reasonably with the calphad extrapolated values.</description>

      <title>Substrate-aware computational design of two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials have attracted considerable attention due to their remarkable electronic, mechanical and optical properties, making them prime candidates for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic applications. Despite their widespread use in combination with substrates in practical applications, including the fabrication process and final device assembly, computational studies often neglect the effects of substrate interactions for simplicity. This study presents a novel method for predicting the atomic structure of 2D materials on arbitrary substrates by combining an evolutionary algorithm, a lattice-matching technique, an automated machine learning interatomic potentials training protocol, and the ab initio thermodynamics approach for predicting the possible conditions of experimental synthesis of the predicted 2D structures. Using the Mo-S system on a c-cut sapphire substrate as a case study, we reveal several new stable and metastable structures, including previously known 1H-MoS2 and newly found Pmma Mo3S2, P-1 Mo2S, P21m Mo5S3, and P4mm Mo4S, where the Mo4S structure is specifically stabilized by interaction with the substrate. Electronic band structure calculations of Mo3S2, Mo2S, Mo5S3, and Mo4S showed their metallic behavior, while phonon properties calculations indicated their dynamic stability and substrate-induced modulation of the phonon density of states. Finally, we use the ab initio thermodynamics approach to predict the synthesis conditions of the discovered structures in the parameter space of the commonly used CVD technique. These results provide insights into computational substrate engineering, allowing one to study the substrate effect on the thermodynamic and dynamical stability of 2D materials and to modulate their electronic and phonon properties for their future applications, as well as to provide guide maps for their experimental synthesis.</description>

      <title>Orbital moment generation by circularly polarized phonons in strontium titanate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent observation by Basini [Nature \textbf{628}, 534 (2024)] of a large transient magnetization induced by circularly polarized ferroelectric phonons in SrTiO3 suggests the existence of hitherto unrecognized mechanisms coupling chiral lattice dynamics with electric degrees of freedom. Here, we develop an atomistic tight-binding model demonstrating a possible contribution to this effect arising from the pumping of atomic electron orbital angular momentum of Ti by chiral motion of oxygen atoms coordinating it, and facilitated by the degeneracy of its t2g orbitals allowing unquenched transient orbital moments. The proposed mechanism may be relevant to other materials with orbitally degenerate or quasi-degenerate electron states, and is attractive for efficient orbital moment generation in orbitronic applications without electric currents.</description>

      <title>P-V relationship of elements in the pressure range of 200-300 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyzed the pressure-volume ($P-V$) relationship of elements using the equation of state at an ambient temperature within the multi-megabar pressure range of 200-300 GPa. We investigated the compressibility of elements under ultra-high pressures based on their positions in the periodic table. For the elemental materials in this region, pressure ($P$) can be approximated as an $N$-order function of volume ($V$): $P$ $\propto$ $1/V^N$. By determining the $N$ value, we can evaluate the contribution of the volume change to the total energy of the system. The $N$ value is also an indicator the bulk modulus in this pressure range and shows periodicity with increasing atomic number, and shows significant values in the range of 4.5-6, for transition metals with close-packed structures (fcc, hcp). This suggests that the total energy of these elements increases rapidly as volume decreases. Furthermore, the current results provide basic data for understanding the compressibility of elemental materials under extreme ultra high-pressure conditions based on the quantum theory of solids.</description>

      <title>Tailoring light holes in $\beta$-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$ via Anion-Anion Antibonding Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant limitation of wide-bandgap materials is their low hole mobility related to localized holes with heavy effective masses ($m_h^*$). We identify in low-symmetric wide-bandgap compounds an anion-anion antibonding coupling (AAAC) effect as the intrinsic factor behind hole localization, which explains the extremely heavy $m_h^*$ and self-trapped hole (STH) formation observed in gallium oxide ($\beta$-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$). We propose a design principle for achieving light holes by manipulating AAAC, demonstrating that specific strain conditions can reduce $m_h^*$ in $\beta$-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$ from 4.77 $m_0$ to 0.38 $m_0$, making it comparable to the electron mass (0.28 $m_0$), while also suppressing STH. The light holes show significant anisotropy, potentially enabling two-dimensional transport in bulk material. This study provides a fundamental understanding of hole mass enhancement and STH formation in novel wide-bandgap materials and suggest new pathways for engineering hole mobilities.</description>

      <title>Contact and bulk rectification effects in ferromagnetic resonance experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental study of the spin rectification effects produced by ferromagnetic resonance in a NiFe wire. A system of four independent nonmagnetic contact probes was used to supply both rf and dc currents to the wire and to measure dc voltages at different locations in the wire. The rf current drives the ferromagnet's magnetization into resonance and produces a dc photovoltage which results from the rectification of rf current in the ferromagnet with oscillating magnetization. Our 4-probe system provided a means to detect the photovoltage and separate contributions from the ferromagnet/nonmagnet contacts and the bulk of the ferromagnet. The contact photovoltage was found to increase approximately linearly with the dc bias applied to the wire. In contrast, the bulk contribution was found to be almost independent of the dc bias. By tuning properties of individual contact probes we were able to change the magnitude of the contact photovoltage and even reverse its sign. Our results highlight the different contributions to photovoltage and the importance of contact properties/nonlinearities for rectification effects in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Dissipative split-charge formalism: Ohm's law, Nyquist noise, and non-contact friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The split-charge equilibration method is extended to describe dissipative charge transfer similarly as the Drude model, whereby the generic frequency-dependent dielectric permitivitties or conductivities of dielectrics and metals can be mimicked. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, a resistor-capacitor circuit is simulated using an all-atom representation for resistor and capacitor. The simulated dynamics reproduce the expected charging process and Nyquist noise, the latter resulting from the thermal voltages acting on individual split charges. The method bears promise to model friction caused by the motion of charged particles past metallic or highly polarizable media.</description>

      <title>Multipolar Anisotropy in Anomalous Hall Effect from Spin-Group Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional view of the anomalous Hall effect~(AHE) in ferromagnets is that it arises from the magnetization perpendicular to the measurement plane and that there is a linear dependence on the latter. Underlying such a view is the thinking that the AHE is a time-reversal symmetry breaking phenomenon and can therefore be treated in terms of a power series in the magnetic order. However, this view is squarely challenged by a number of experiments recently, urging for a thorough theoretical investigation on the fundamental level. We find that for strong magnets, it is more appropriate and fruitful to regard the AHE as a spin-group symmetry breaking phenomenon where the critical parameter is the spin-orbit interaction strength, which involves a much smaller energy scale. In ferromagnets, the spin-orbit coupling breaks the $\infty 2^\prime$ spin rotation symmetry, and the key to characterizing such symmetry breaking is the identification of spin-orbit vectors which transform regularly under spin group operations. Born out of our framework is a rich multi-polar relationship between the anomalous Hall conductivity and the magnetization direction, with each pole being expanded progressively in powers of the spin-orbit coupling strength. For the leading order contribution, i.e., the dipole, its isotropic part corresponds to the traditional view, and its anisotropic part can lead to the in-plane AHE where the magnetization lies within the measurement plane. Beyond the dipolar one, the octupolar structure offers the leading order source of nonlinearity and hence introduces unique anisotropy where the dipolar structure cannot. The dipolar and octupolar structure offers a unified explanation for the in-plane AHE recently observed in various ferromagnets, and our comprehensive analysis further extends the candidate material systems.</description>

      <title>Phase-Separated Charge Order and Twinning Across Length Scales in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present X-ray scattering studies resolving structural twinning and phase separation in the charge density wave (CDW) state of the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. The three-dimensional CDW state in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is reported to form a complex superposition of Star of David (SoD) or Tri-Hexagonal (TrH) patterns of distortion within its kagome planes, but the out-of-plane stacking is marked by metastability. In order to resolve the impact of this metastability, we present reciprocal space mapping and real-space images of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ collected across multiple length scales using temperature-dependent high-dynamic range mapping (HDRM) and dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM). The experimental data provide evidence for a rich microstructure that forms in the CDW state. Data evidence metastability in the formation of $2\times 2\times 4$ and $2\times 2\times 2$ CDW supercells dependent on thermal history and mechanical deformation. We further directly resolve the real space phase segregation of both supercells as well as a real-space, structural twinning driven by the broken rotational symmetry of the CDW state. Our combined results provide insights into the role of microstructure and twinning in experiments probing the electronic properties of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ where rotational symmetry is broken by the three-dimensional charge density wave order but locally preserved for any single kagome layer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With advancements in computational molecular modeling and powerful structure search methods, it is now possible to systematically screen crystal structures for small organic molecules. In this context, we introduce the Python package High-throughput Organic Crystal Structure Prediction (HTOCSP), which enables the prediction and screening of crystal packing for small organic molecules in an automated, high-throughput manner. Specifically, we describe the workflow, which encompasses molecular analysis, force field generation, and crystal generation and sampling, all within customized constraints based on user input. We demonstrate the application of \texttt{HTOCSP} by systematically screening organic crystals for 100 molecules using different sampling strategies and force field options. Furthermore, we analyze the benchmark results to understand the underlying factors that influence the complexity of the crystal energy landscape. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of the package and potential future extensions.</description>

      <title>Large Bandgap Observed on the Surfaces of EuZn2As2 Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EuM2As2 (M = Zn, Cd, In, Sn etc.) is an excellent material system for studying topological properties, which can be easily tuned by magnetism involved. Theoretical calculations predict gapped and flat bands in EuZn2As2 but gapless structure in EuCd2As2. In this work, low-temperature (77 K) cleaved EuZn2As2 crystals are studied using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Defects-induced local density of states (LDOS) modification with a triangular shape helps identify the surface terminations: Eu versus AsZn surface. While large bandgaps (~1.5 eV at 77 K) are observed on both pristine surfaces, the bandgap width is found to be very sensitive to local heterogeneity, such as defects and step edges, with the tendency of reduction. Combining experimental data with DFT simulations, we conclude that the modified bandgap in the heterogeneous area arises from Zn vacancies and/or substitution by As atoms. Our investigation offers important information for reevaluating the electron topology of the EuM2As2 family.</description>

Abstract: The interplay of topology, magnetism, and correlations gives rise to intriguing phases of matter. In this study, through state-of-the-art angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations, we visualize a fourfold degenerate Dirac nodal line at the boundary of the bulk Brillouin zone in the antiferromagnet YMn2Ge2. We further demonstrate that this gapless, antiferromagnetic Dirac nodal line is enforced by the combination of magnetism, space-time inversion symmetry and nonsymmorphic lattice symmetry. The corresponding drumhead surface states traverse the whole surface Brillouin zone. YMn2Ge2 thus serves as a platform to exhibit the interplay of multiple degenerate nodal physics and antiferromagnetism. Interestingly, the magnetic nodal line displays a d-orbital dependent renormalization along its trajectory in momentum space, thereby manifesting Hund coupling. Our findings offer insights into the effect of electronic correlations on magnetic Dirac nodal lines, leading to an antiferromagnetic Hund nodal line.</description>

Abstract: This study presents the fabrication and characterizations of an Al$_{0.3}$Ga$_{0.7}$As/Ge$_{0.87}$Sn$_{0.13}$/GeSn p-i-n double heterostructure (DHS) diode following the grafting approach for enhanced optoelectronic applications. By integrating ultra-thin Al$_2$O$_3$ as a quantum tunneling layer and enhancing interfacial double-side passivation, we achieved a heterostructure with a substantial 1.186 eV conduction band barrier between AlGaAs and GeSn, along with a low interfacial density of states. The diode demonstrated impressive electrical characteristics with high uniformity, including a mean ideality factor of 1.47 and a mean rectification ratio of 2.95E103 at +/-2 V across 326 devices, indicating high-quality device fabrication. Comprehensive electrical characterizations, including C-V and I-V profiling, affirm the diode's capability to provide robust electrical confinement and efficient carrier injection. These properties make the Al$_{0.3}$Ga$_{0.7}$As/Ge$_{0.87}$Sn$_{0.13}$/GeSn DHS a promising candidate for next-generation electrically pumped GeSn lasers, potentially operable at higher temperatures. Our results provide a viable pathway for further advancements in various GeSn-based devices.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear electrical transport unveils Fermi surface malleability in a moir\'e heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van Hove singularities enhance many-body interactions and induce collective states of matter ranging from superconductivity to magnetism. In magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, van Hove singularities appear at low energies and are malleable with density, leading to a sequence of Lifshitz transitions and resets observable in Hall measurements. However, without a magnetic field, linear transport measurements have limited sensitivity to the band's topology. Here, we utilize nonlinear longitudinal and transverse transport measurements to probe these unique features in twisted bilayer graphene at zero magnetic field. We demonstrate that the nonlinear responses, induced by the Berry curvature dipole and extrinsic scattering processes, intricately map the Fermi surface reconstructions at various fillings. Importantly, our experiments highlight the intrinsic connection of these features with the moir\'e bands. Beyond corroborating the insights from linear Hall measurements, our findings establish nonlinear transport as a pivotal tool for probing band topology and correlated phenomena.</description>

      <title>About the significance of the driving current direction in ferromagnetic resonance experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental study of the effects of driving current direction on ferromagnetic resonance in NiFe foils. The rf driving current was applied to NiFe foils of different shapes. In rectangular samples with a close-to-uniform flow of the applied current along the long edge of the sample we find the resonance field to follow a simple 'cos' dependence on the angle between the current and external dc magnetic field. We argue that this behavior cannot be explained by the in-plane demagnetizing field of the rectangular foil. In triangular samples where the current partially flows along all three sample edges we observed three independent 'cos' features. The latter suggests individual contributions from different areas with different current directions. We were able to switch off one of these contributions by covering one edge of the triangular sample with a conducting overlayer and thereby effectively short-circuiting the corresponding current path. Our findings highlight the significance of driving current distributions in ferromagnetic resonance experiments.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Antiferromagnetic Chains via Combined On-surface Synthesis and Reduction for Spinon Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains are excellent one-dimensional platforms for exploring quantum magnetic states and quasiparticle fractionalization. Understanding its quantum magnetism and quasiparticle excitation at the atomic scale is crucial for manipulating the quantum spin systems. Here, we report the fabrication of spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains through on-surface synthesis and in-situ reduction. A closed-shell nanographene is employed as a precursor for Ullman coupling to avoid radical fusing, thus obtaining oligomer chains. Following exposure to atomic hydrogen and tip manipulation, closed-shell polymers are transformed into spin-1/2 chains with controlled lengths by reducing the ketone groups and subsequent hydrogen desorption. The spin excitation gaps are found to decrease in power-law as the chain lengths, suggesting its gapless feature. More interestingly, the spinon dispersion is extracted from the inelastic spectroscopic spectra, agreeing well with the calculations. Our results demonstrate the great potential of fabricating desired quantum systems through a combined on-surface synthesis and reduction approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) are a new class of magnetic materials that combine the beneficial spintronics properties of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, garnering significant attention recently. Here, we have identified altermagnetism in a layered intercalated transition metal diselenide, CoNb$_4$Se$_8$, which crystallizes with an ordered sublattice of intercalated Co atoms between NbSe$_2$ layers. Single crystals are synthesized, and the structural characterizations are performed using single crystal diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy. Magnetic measurements reveal easy-axis antiferromagnetism below 168 K. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that A-type antiferromagnetic ordering with easy-axis spin direction is the ground state, which is verified through single crystal neutron diffraction experiments. Electronic band structure calculations in this magnetic state display spin-split bands, confirming altermagnetism in this compound. The layered structure of CoNb$_4$Se$_8$ presents a promising platform for testing various predicted properties associated with altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Transduction Using Anti-Ferromagnetic Topological Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transduction of quantum information between distinct quantum systems is an essential step in various applications, including quantum communications and quantum computing. However, mediating photons of vastly different frequencies and designing high-performance transducers are highly nontrivial, due to multifaceted and sometimes conflicting requirements. In this work, we first discuss some general principles for quantum transducer design, and then propose solid-state anti-ferromagnetic topological insulators to serve as particularly effective transducers. First, the anti-ferromagnetic order can minimize detrimental influences on nearby quantum systems caused by magnetic interactions. Second, topological insulators exhibit band-inversion, which can greatly enhance their optical responses. This property, coupled with robust spin-orbit coupling and high spin density, results in strong nonlinear interaction in magnetic topological insulators, thereby substantially improving transduction efficiency. Using MnBi2Te4 as an example, we discuss the potential experimental realization of quantum transduction based on magnetic topological materials. Particularly, we showcase that quantum transduction efficiency exceeding 90% can be achieved with modest experimental requirements, while the transduction bandwidth can reach the GHz range. The strong nonlinear photonic interactions in magnetic topological insulators can find diverse applications besides quantum transduction, such as quantum squeezing.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale modeling of deformations and defects in thin crystalline sheets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a mesoscale description of deformations and defects in thin, flexible sheets with crystalline order, tackling the interplay between in-plane elasticity, out-of-plane deformation, as well as dislocation nucleation and motion. Our approach is based on the Phase-Field Crystal (PFC) model, which describes the microscopic atomic density in crystals at diffusive timescales, naturally encoding elasticity and plasticity effects. In its amplitude expansion (APFC), a coarse-grained description of the mechanical properties of crystals is achieved. We introduce surface PFC and surface APFC models in a convenient height-function formulation encoding deformation in the normal direction. This framework is proven consistent with classical aspects of strain-induced buckling, defect nucleation on deformed surfaces, and out-of-plane relaxation near dislocations. In particular, we benchmark and discuss the results of numerical simulations by looking at the continuum limit for buckling under uniaxial compression and at evidence from microscopic models for deformation at defects and defect arrangements, demonstrating the scale-bridging capabilities of the proposed framework. Results concerning the interplay between lattice distortion at dislocations and out-of-plane deformation are also illustrated by looking at the annihilation of dislocation dipoles and systems hosting many dislocations. With the novel formulation proposed here, and its assessment with established approaches, we envision applications to multiscale investigations of crystalline order on deformable surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce CrystalFormer, a transformer-based autoregressive model specifically designed for space group-controlled generation of crystalline materials. The incorporation of space group symmetry significantly simplifies the crystal space, which is crucial for data and compute efficient generative modeling of crystalline materials. Leveraging the prominent discrete and sequential nature of the Wyckoff positions, CrystalFormer learns to generate crystals by directly predicting the species and locations of symmetry-inequivalent atoms in the unit cell. We demonstrate the advantages of CrystalFormer in standard tasks such as symmetric structure initialization and element substitution compared to conventional methods implemented in popular crystal structure prediction software. Moreover, we showcase the application of CrystalFormer of property-guided materials design in a plug-and-play manner. Our analysis shows that CrystalFormer ingests sensible solid-state chemistry knowledge and heuristics by compressing the material dataset, thus enabling systematic exploration of crystalline materials. The simplicity, generality, and flexibility of CrystalFormer position it as a promising architecture to be the foundational model of the entire crystalline materials space, heralding a new era in materials modeling and discovery.</description>

      <title>Disruptive Atomic Jumps Induce Grain Boundary Stagnation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grain growth in polycrystalline materials can be impeded by grain boundary (GB) stagnation. Using atomistic simulations, we observed that during GB migration, the disruptive jumps of a few GB atoms can disturb the original ordered collective movement of GB atoms, leading to the stagnation of the entire GB. These disruptive atomic jumps can be activated by both high driving forces and high temperatures, with even jumps of a few atoms capable of causing the stagnation of an entire GB. This mechanism also explains the non-Arrhenius behavior observed in some GBs. Additionally, a large model size could increase the rate of disruptive atomic jumps, and a clear transition in thermal behavior is observed with the increase of the GB size in GBs exhibiting clear thermally activated stagnation. Our further investigation shows that the disruptive atoms involved in these jumps do not differ from other GB atoms in terms of atomic energy, volume, density, local entropy, or Voronoi tessellation, and no "jam transition" was observed in the energy barrier spectra. This fact makes those disruptive jumps challenging to detect. To address this issue, we propose a displacement vector analysis method that effectively identifies these subtle disruptive jumps.</description>

      <title>Ultra-fast Digital DPC Yielding High Spatio-Temporal Resolution for Low-Dose Phase Characterisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the scanning transmission electron microscope, both phase imaging of beam-sensitive materials and characterisation of a material's functional properties using in-situ experiments are becoming more widely available. As the practicable scan speed of 4D-STEM detectors improves, so too does the temporal resolution achievable for both differential phase contrast (DPC) and ptychography. However, the read-out burden of pixelated detectors, and the size of the gigabyte to terabyte sized data sets, remain a challenge for both temporal resolution and their practical adoption. In this work, we show that a high-fidelity DPC phase reconstruction can be achieved from both annular segmented detectors or pixelated arrays with relatively few elements using signal digitisation. Unlike conventional analog data, even at the fastest scan speeds, phase reconstructions from digitised DPC-segment images yield reliable data. Finally, dose fractionation by fast scanning and multi-framing allows for post-process binning of frame streams to balance signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution for low-dose phase imaging for in-situ experiments.</description>

      <title>Roles of the Narrow Electronic Band near the Fermi Level in 1T-TaS$_2$-Related Layered Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.06553v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we use low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) to reveal the roles of the narrow electronic band in two 1T-TaS$_2$-related materials (bulk 1T-TaS$_2$ and 4Hb-TaS$_2$). 4Hb-TaS$_2$ is a superconducting compound with alternating 1T-TaS$_2$ and 1H-TaS$_2$ layers, where the 1H-TaS$_2$ layer has weak charge density wave (CDW) pattern and reduces the CDW coupling between the adjacent 1T-TaS$_2$ layers. In the 1T-TaS$_2$ layer of 4Hb-TaS$_2$, we observe a narrow electronic band located near Fermi level, and its spatial distribution is consistent with the tight-binding calculations for two-dimensional 1T-TaS$_2$ layers. The weak electronic hybridization between the 1T-TaS$_2$ and 1H-TaS$_2$ layers in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ shifts the narrow electronic band to be slightly above the Fermi level, which suppresses the electronic correlation induced band splitting. In contrast, in bulk 1T-TaS$_2$, there is an interlayer CDW coupling induced insulating gap. In comparison with the spatial distributions of the electronic states in bulk 1T-TaS$_2$ and 4Hb-TaS$_2$, the insulating gap in bulk 1T-TaS$_2$ results from the formation of a bonding band and an antibonding band due to the overlap of the narrow electronic bands in the dimerized 1T-TaS$_2$ layers.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Machine-Learned Exchange Functional for Molecules and Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00682v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design of better exchange-correlation functionals for Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a central challenge of modern electronic structure theory. However, current developments are limited by the mathematical form of the functional, with efficient semilocal functionals being inaccurate for many technologically important systems and the more accurate hybrid functionals being too expensive for large solid-state systems due to the use of the exact exchange operator. In this work, we use machine learning combined with exact physical constraints to design an exchange functional that is both orbital-dependent and nonlocal, but which can be evaluated at roughly the cost of semilocal functionals and is significantly faster than hybrid DFT in plane-wave codes. By training functionals with several different feature sets, we elucidate the roles of orbital-dependent and nonlocal features in learning the exchange energy and determine that both types of features provide vital and independently important information to the model. Having trained our new exchange functional with an expressive, nonlocal feature set, we substitute it into existing hybrid functionals to achieve hybrid-DFT accuracy on thermochemical benchmark sets and improve the accuracy of band gap predictions over semilocal DFT. To demonstrate the scalability of our approach as well as the practical benefits of improved band gap prediction, we compute charged defect transition levels in silicon using large supercells. Due to its transferability and computational efficiency for both molecular and extended systems, our model overcomes the cost-accuracy trade-off between semilocal and hybrid DFT, and our general approach provides a feasible path toward a universal exchange-correlation functional with post-hybrid DFT accuracy and semilocal DFT cost.</description>

      <title>DPA-2: a large atomic model as a multi-task learner</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are catalyzing transformative changes in atomic modeling, simulation, and design. AI-driven potential energy models have demonstrated the capability to conduct large-scale, long-duration simulations with the accuracy of ab initio electronic structure methods. However, the model generation process remains a bottleneck for large-scale applications. We propose a shift towards a model-centric ecosystem, wherein a large atomic model (LAM), pre-trained across multiple disciplines, can be efficiently fine-tuned and distilled for various downstream tasks, thereby establishing a new framework for molecular modeling. In this study, we introduce the DPA-2 architecture as a prototype for LAMs. Pre-trained on a diverse array of chemical and materials systems using a multi-task approach, DPA-2 demonstrates superior generalization capabilities across multiple downstream tasks compared to the traditional single-task pre-training and fine-tuning methodologies. Our approach sets the stage for the development and broad application of LAMs in molecular and materials simulation research.</description>

      <title>Alternating Bias Assisted Annealing of Amorphous Oxide Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07415v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a transformational technique for controllably tuning the electrical properties of fabricated thermally oxidized amorphous aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions. Using conventional test equipment to apply an alternating bias to a heated tunnel barrier, giant increases in the room temperature resistance, greater than 70%, can be achieved. The rate of resistance change is shown to be strongly temperature-dependent, and is independent of junction size in the sub-micron regime. In order to measure their tunneling properties at mK temperatures, we characterized transmon qubit junctions treated with this alternating-bias assisted annealing (ABAA) technique. The measured frequencies follow the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation between the shifted resistance and critical current. Further, these studies show a reduction of junction-contributed loss on the order of $\approx 2 \times10^{-6}$, along with a significant reduction in resonant- and off-resonant-two level system defects when compared to untreated samples. Imaging with high-resolution TEM shows that the barrier is still predominantly amorphous with a more uniform distribution of aluminum coordination across the barrier relative to untreated junctions. This new approach is expected to be widely applicable to a broad range of devices that rely on amorphous aluminum oxide, as well as the many other metal-insulator-metal structures used in modern electronics.</description>

      <title>Cross Validation in Stochastic Analytic Continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Analytic Continuation (SAC) of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) imaginary-time correlation function data is a valuable tool in connecting many-body models to experimentally measurable dynamic response functions. Recent developments of the SAC method have allowed for spectral functions with sharp features, e.g. narrow peaks and divergent edges, to be resolved with unprecedented fidelity. Often times, it is not known what exact sharp features, if any, are present \textit{a priori}, and, due to the ill-posed nature of the analytic continuation problem, multiple spectral representations may be acceptable. In this work, we borrow from the machine learning and statistics literature and implement a cross validation technique to provide an unbiased method to identify the most likely spectrum amongst a set obtained with different spectral parameterizations and imposed constraints. We demonstrate the power of this method with examples using imaginary-time data generated by QMC simulations and synthetic data generated from artificial spectra. Our procedure, which can be considered a form of model selection, can be applied to a variety of numerical analytic continuation methods, beyond just SAC.</description>
