      <title>OrbDot: A Python package for studying the secular evolution of exoplanet orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OrbDot is a Python package for studying the secular (long-term) evolution of exoplanet orbits from observational data. It employs nested sampling algorithms to fit evolutionary models to any combination of transit and eclipse mid-times, radial velocities, and transit durations. Beyond model fitting, OrbDot offers tools for interpreting results, generating reports on model comparisons, derived tidal decay parameters, predicted precession rates, implications for planetary companions, and more.</description>

      <title>Identifying Microlensing by Compact Dark Matter through Diffraction Patterns in Gravitational Waves with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave lensing, particularly microlensing by compact dark matter (DM), offers a unique avenue to probe the nature of dark matter. However, conventional detection methods are often computationally expensive, inefficient, and sensitive to waveform systematics. In this work, we introduce the Wavelet Convolution Detector (WCD), a deep learning framework specifically designed to identify wave-optics diffraction patterns imprinted in gravitationally lensed signals. The WCD integrates multi-scale wavelet analysis within residual convolutional blocks to efficiently extract time-frequency interference structures, and is trained on a realistically generated dataset incorporating compact DM mass functions and astrophysical lensing probabilities. This work is the first machine learning-based approach capable of identifying such wave-optics signatures in lensed gravitational waves. Tested on simulated binary black hole events, the model achieves 92.2\% accuracy (AUC=0.965), with performance rising to AUC$\sim$0.99 at high SNR. Crucially, it maintains high discriminative power across a wide range of lens masses without retraining, demonstrating particular strength in the low-impact-parameter and high-lens-mass regimes where wave-optics effects are most pronounced. Compared to Bayesian inference, the WCD provides orders-of-magnitude faster inference, making it a scalable and efficient tool for discovering compact DM through lensed gravitational waves in the era of third-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>PRIMA survey of the Virgo cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clusters of galaxies are unique laboratories for investigating the dependence of galaxy evolution on their environment. The Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS) mapped the central 84 square degrees region of the Virgo Cluster in five bands between 100 and 500 micron, which resulted in the first detailed view of cold dust in cluster galaxies. Major limitations of the HeViCS survey were the lack of data, or its limited availability, in the 20 to 80 micron range, and the quite low sensitivity of the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer instrument, resulting in poor constraints on the warmer dust component. The PRIMAger instrument onboard PRIMA offers the capability to map a large portion of the Virgo Cluster -- including regions beyond its virial radius -- in hyperspectral and polarimetric bands from 25 to 265 micron, enabling a direct comparison with the area previously covered by HeViCS. By combining PRIMA and Herschel data with existing multi-wavelength photometry, it becomes possible to explore the connection between stellar and dust properties in a complete sample of cluster galaxies, to investigate environmental effects on the warm dust component within the Virgo Cluster, to map the magnetic field structure of the cold interstellar medium (ISM), to search for dust emission from the intra-cluster medium, and to study the ISM in background galaxies projected behind the cluster.</description>

      <title>CONCERTO: forward modeling of interferograms for calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CarbON [CII] line in post-rEionisation and ReionisaTiOn epoch (CONCERTO) instrument is a low-resolution mapping Fourier-transform spectrometer, based on lumped-element kinetic inductance detector (LEKID) technology, operating at 130- 310 GHz. It was installed on the 12-meter APEX telescope in Chile in April 2021 and operated until December 2022. CONCERTO's main science goal is to constrain the [CII] line fluctuations at high redshift. To reach that goal CONCERTO observed 1.4 deg2 in the COSMOS field. To ensure accurate calibration of the data, we have developed a forward model capable of simulating both the spectral response and the corresponding interferograms for each scan of observation in the COSMOS field. We present the modeling approach that enables us to reproduce the expected instrument outputs under controlled input conditions and provides a framework for the different calibration steps, including the absolute brightness calibration of the spectra. We constructed a dedicated analysis pipeline to characterize the raw interferometric data (interferograms) obtained under a broad range of atmospheric conditions at APEX. Using the forward model, we measured the interferogram alignment with the optical path difference (zero path difference, ZPD) and the relative response of each KID (flatfield). Together, these elements enable a robust characterization of the instrument's spectral brightness calibration.</description>

      <title>Results and plans to apply interferometry to air shower observations at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analysing the radio emissions from air showers using interferometry, we can estimate their properties. In this contribution, we apply interferometry to reconstruct air-shower parameters based on measurements taken with the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) at the Pierre Auger Observatory. This reconstruction method is achievable at AERA through precise clock synchronisation with a beacon and an accurate survey of the station locations. Interferometry has been applied to several thousand inclined air-shower observations for the first time, which allows for tests on the performance of air-shower geometry reconstruction, recovery of the radio signal from low-energy air showers, and methods to study the polarisation of the radio-emission mechanisms. Additionally, in this contribution, we will also provide an overview of efforts to enable interferometry for the recently installed radio detectors that are part of the AugerPrime upgrade.</description>

      <title>Radiation damage to the Hubble Space Telescope during two Solar cycles, and correction of Charge Transfer Inefficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From 2002 to 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys has suffered in the harsh radiation environment above the protection of the Earth's atmosphere. We track the degradation of its image quality, as Solar protons and galactic cosmic rays have damaged its photosensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging sensors. The damage is consistent with defects in the silicon lattice that have all annealed into one of three configurations. The rate of damage in low Earth orbit is modulated by $18.5^{+4.5}_{-0.5}$ per cent during an 11 year Solar cycle, peaking $430^{+11}_{-5}$ days after Solar minimum as recorded in the number of sunspots. We also present the open-source Algorithm for Charge Transfer Inefficiency correction (ArCTIc) v7. This models the (instantaneous or gradual) capture of photoelectrons into lattice defects, and their release after (a discrete set or continuum of) characteristic time delays, which creates spurious trailing in an image. Calibrated using the trailing of hot pixels, and applied during post-processing of astronomical images, ArCTIc can correct 99.5% of Charge Transfer Inefficiency trailing averaged over the camera's lifetime, and 99.9% of trailing in the worst-affected recent data.</description>

      <title>EUSO-SPB2 Cosmic Ray Searches and Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) flew in May of 2023, marking an important step towards the observation of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) and neutrino-induced showers from space. The ultimate goal of this endeavor is to complement ground-based detectors and achieve unprecedented exposure and nearly uniform full-sky coverage at the highest energies, thereby enabling charged particle astronomy and enriching the multi-messenger approach to high-energy astrophysics and astroparticle physics. As a pathfinder to the POEMMA mission (Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics), EUSO-SPB2 flew two distinct cameras at the focus of two Schmidt telescopes, one made of multi-anode photomultiplier tubes (MAPMTs), looking towards the nadir for fluorescence light detection, the other made of Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), looking towards the limb of the Earth for direct Cherenkov light detection. The flight was terminated prematurely due to a failure in the balloon, and thus no showers were detected in the fluorescence mode. However, several lower-energy (PeV scale) cosmic-ray events were observed in the Cherenkov channel. The data collected by both telescopes also confirmed the pertinence and maturity of the technology. We will report on the mission's cosmic ray results, and lessons learned for future balloon and satellite missions, notably the POEMMA Balloon with Radio (PBR), currently under development.</description>

      <title>Granulation on a quiet K dwarf: HD 166620 I. Spectral signatures as a function of line-formation temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Radial velocity (RV) spectrographs reach unprecedented precision and stability below 1 m/s, the challenge of granulation in the context of exoplanet detection has intensified. Despite promising advancements in post-processing tools, granulation remains a significant concern for the EPRV community. We present a pilot study to detect and characterise granulation using the High-Accuracy Radial-velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) spectrograph. We observed HD166620, a K2 star in the Maunder Minimum phase, intensely for two successive nights, expecting granulation to be the dominant nightly noise source in the absence of strong magnetic activity. Following the correction for a newly identified instrumental signature arising from illumination variations across the CCD, we detected the granulation signal using structure functions and a one-component Gaussian Process (GP) model. The granulation signal exhibits a characteristic timescale of 43.65$\pm$15.8 minutes, within one $\sigma$, and a standard deviation of 22.9$\pm$0.77 cm/s, with in three $\sigma$ of the predicted value. By examining spectra and RVs as a function of line formation temperature , we investigated the sensitivity of granulation-induced RV variations across different photospheric layers. We extracted RVs from various photospheric depths using both the line-by-line (LBL) and cross-correlation function (CCF) methods to mitigate any extraction method biases. Our findings indicate that granulation variability is detectable in both temperature bins, with the cooler bins, corresponding to the shallower layers of the photosphere, aligning more closely with predicted values.</description>

      <title>Using Cosmic Rays to Predict the Weather: Meteorological Data Assimilation of Atmospheric Muon Flux Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical weather prediction requires initial estimates of the atmospheric state. Since the atmospheric density field is intricately woven into the atmosphere's governing equations, advancing atmospheric density estimation will improve numerical weather prediction. However, current meteorological instrumentation cannot directly measure the atmospheric density field over large volumes. Existing techniques rely on sparse point measurements, limiting our ability to accurately estimate the three-dimensional atmospheric density field. One potential solution is to employ measurements of the atmospheric muon flux. Atmospheric muons are particles produced when energetic atomic nuclei (cosmic rays) collide with nuclei in the upper atmosphere, producing a shower of secondary particles (muons) that propagates to the Earth's surface. The surface atmospheric muon flux is known to be proportional to the local atmospheric density field, implying that this technique can be used as a measurement of atmospheric density. This study examines the potential for using atmospheric muon flux measurements to improve atmospheric state estimation via a case study of simulated atmospheric muon observations in the path of tropical cyclone Freddy. We show that improvement in data assimilation performance can be achieved using data from a relatively small astroparticle detector, well within the capabilities of existing astroparticle technology. We additionally show that the improvements to atmospheric state estimates associated with muon flux assimilation are at least partially unique to muon flux measurements, as comparable surface pressure point measurements do not reproduce a similar effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kete is an open-source software package for quickly and accurately predicting the positions and magnitudes of asteroids and comets in large-scale, all-sky surveys. It can predict observable objects for any ground or space-based telescope. Kete contains a collection of tools, including simple optical and thermal modeling, $n$-body orbit calculations, and custom multi-threaded SPICE kernel support. It can be used for observation planning, pre-discovery of detections at a large scale, and labeling known solar system objects in images. Here we demonstrate some of the capabilities by predicting all observations of every numbered asteroid seen by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) surveys during single years of their operations, predicting locations and magnitudes of 756,999 asteroids in over 11 million images.</description>

      <title>Identifying Exoplanets with Deep Learning: A CNN and RNN Classifier for Kepler DR25 and Candidate Vetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of exoplanet survey missions such as Kepler, TESS, and the upcoming PLATO mission has generated massive light-curve datasets that challenge traditional vetting pipelines. We introduce a hybrid deep-learning framework that integrates convolutional networks, bidirectional LSTMs, and an attention mechanism to identify planetary transit signals with improved accuracy and interpretability. Trained on Kepler DR25 data, the model achieves F1 = $0.910 \pm 0.008$ (AUC--ROC = $0.984 \pm 0.004$), significantly outperforming CNN-only baselines. Attention-based visualizations highlight ingress and egress phases consistent with astrophysical expectations. Applied to 1,360 DR25 candidate dispositions, our pipeline identified 190 high-confidence signals (P(model) $&lt;$ 0.70) that passed initial validation. Following comprehensive false positive probability (FPP) analysis and contamination tests, 13 candidates achieved statistical validation, of which three were fully confirmed as robust exoplanets: KOI-901.01 (warm mini-Neptune), KOI-1066.01 (hot Jupiter), and KOI-212.01 (warm Neptune). With an inference time of $\sim 80$ ms per candidate, this framework enables scalable real-time triage for TESS and future PLATO operations, while the validated candidates provide a prioritized list for radial velocity, timing, and atmospheric follow-up. This interpretable, efficient pipeline addresses the bottleneck in exoplanet confirmation, advancing scalable discovery in the era of large-scale surveys.</description>

      <title>Assessing the feasibility range of Solar-powered Planetesimals Redirection operations for Terraforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work aims to assess principal physical technical constraints of the key technological concept for achieving maximal carrying capacity expansive potential of Planetary Systems. Chemical composition of most potential Biosphere Substrates is in most cases very far from optimal for full-scale habitability thus productivity potential realization. To cover all surface of a Biosphere Substrate with a dense photosynthesising layer during most of remaining Planetary System lifecycle for achieving maximal carrying capacity thus workforce productivity enabling further expansion of biosphere to new substrates importing significant amounts of the limiting chemical elements by planetesimals redirection is ubiquitously inevitable. Although the price of such operations is high the value of maximal population productivity of Biosphere Substrates during the remaining Planetary Systems lifecycle is orders of magnitude higher. The farther planetesimal is orbiting from a star the more time but less energy is required for its delivery. The more distant from a star, the more rich in volatiles planetesimals are. The most technically detailed and feasible scheme to date of Planetesimals Redirection was proposed in 1993 by Dr. Zubrin based on NTRs. Nuclear fuel is extremely scarce and might be the principal limiting factor for final stages of interstellar colonization missions. We investigate possibilities of using concentrated beamed solar power Planetesimals Redirection operations for Terraforming as it can increase the possible scale of such operations to orders of magnitude. Such a mission might consist of Planetesimal Tug Spacecraft Systems (PTSS) to redirect a planetesimal, and solar Power Harvesting Beaming System (PHBS) tracking the spacecraft with a beam to power it. We found Solarpowered Planetesimals Redirection for Terraforming is feasible within Kuiper Belt with present technologies.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Machine Learning Driven Tools for Detecting Millimeter Sources in Timestream Pre-processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new pipeline utilizing machine learning for classifying short-duration features in raw time-ordered data (TOD) of cosmic microwave background survey observations. The pipeline, specifically designed for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, works in conjunction with the previous TOD preprocessing techniques that employ statistical thresholding to indiscriminately remove all large spikes in the data, whether they are due to noise features, cosmic rays, or true astrophysical sources, in a process called ``data cuts". This has the undesirable effect of excising real astrophysical sources, including transients, from the data. The classification pipeline demonstrated in this work uses the output from these data cuts and is able to differentiate between electronic noise, cosmic rays, and point sources, enabling the removal of undesired signals while retaining true astrophysical signals during TOD preprocessing. We achieve an overall accuracy of 90\% in categorizing data spikes of different origin and, importantly, 94\% for identifying those caused by astrophysical sources. Our pipeline also measures the amplitude of any detected source seen more than once and produces a subminute-to-minute light curve, providing information on its short timescale variability. This automated pipeline for source detection and amplitude estimation will be particularly useful for upcoming surveys with large data volumes, such as the Simons Observatory.</description>

      <title>POEMMA-Balloon with Radio: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is an Ultra Long Duration Balloon payload scheduled for launch in Spring 2027 from Wanaka, New Zealand. It will circle over the Southern Ocean for a mission duration as long as 50 days, serving as a precursor to the dual satellite mission, Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA). The PBR mission represents a significant step towards establishing a space-based multi-messenger observatory. Observations from space will enhance the statistics of the highest-energy cosmic rays and complement ground-based observatories by enabling simultaneous observations of both hemispheres with a single instrument. Additionally, POEMMA will facilitate the measurement of Very-High-Energy Neutrinos (VHENs) following multi-messenger alerts of astrophysical transient events, such as gamma-ray bursts. PBR is an adaptation of the POEMMA mission, featuring three primary science goals: 1. Observe Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) via the fluorescence technique from suborbital space. 2. Observe horizontal high-altitude air showers (HAHAs) with energies exceeding the cosmic ray knee (E &gt; 3 PeV) using optical and radio detection for the first time. 3. Follow astrophysical event alerts in the search for VHENs. This contribution provides an overview of the PBR payload and discusses the expected performance of its various detectors.</description>

      <title>GrAviPaSt's Lens to the Past: Unveiling the Evolution of Filamentary Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the evolution of cosmic filaments across redshifts 1, 0.5, and 0 using the IllustrisTNG100-1 magneto-hydrodynamical simulation. To achieve this, we introduce GrAviPaSt, a simple, efficient and parameter-free filament identification method that leverages gravitational potential, an A*-like path-finding algorithm, and spanning trees. Applying this method to galaxy distributions at different redshifts allows us to analyze various filament properties, including their length, thickness, mass density contrast, and radial profile. Additionally, we investigate dynamic characteristics such as the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton, their weighted mean velocity, and velocity trends normalized by their positions within the filaments. Our findings reveal the evolution of cosmic filaments from redshift 1 to 0, highlighting key differences across classifications. In particular, we examine the mass density contrast radial profile of filaments connecting two galaxy groups and those linking two galaxy clusters, identifying distinct differences in profile shape between these categories. Furthermore, in the context of weighted mean velocity, we analyze cosmic filaments exhibiting either negative or positive weighted mean velocity, demonstrating their differing evolutionary trends in terms of the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton.</description>

      <title>Extending the micro-Hertz detection horizons via orbital resonance effect for geocentric gravitational wave antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19185v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\mu$Hz gravitational wave band holds crucial insights into coalescing supermassive black hole binaries and stochastic backgrounds but remains inaccessible due to technical challenges. We demonstrate that geocentric space-based GW detectors (e.g., TianQin, gLISA, GADFLI) can bridge this gap by considering orbital resonance effects, circumventing the need for prohibitively long baselines. When GW frequencies match with integer multiples of a satellite's orbital frequency, sustained tidal forces induce cumulative orbital deviations through resonant effects, which, combined with orbital modulation, improve detector sensitivity by 1-2 orders of magnitude in the $\mu$Hz band. Consequently, geocentric missions can detect SMBHBs across significantly expanded mass-redshift parameter space and track their inspiral-merger-ringdown evolution. Crucially, such observations could synergize with pulsar timing array data of the same binaries at earlier inspiral stages, enabling unprecedented joint tests of strong-field gravity and binary evolution. Our findings establish geocentric antennas as a cost-effective, near-term precursor for unlocking the $\mu$Hz GW astronomy.</description>

      <title>Modeling Orbital Decay of Low-Earth Orbit Satellites due to Atmospheric Drag: A Simplified Analytical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are crucial for communications, navigation, and Earth observation. However, their operational lifetimes are strongly influenced by orbital decay due to atmospheric drag. This work presents a simplified analytical model of orbital decay in LEO, incorporating atmospheric density variations and satellite parameters. Using standard drag force equations and density models, we explore how altitude, satellite mass, and cross-sectional area affect decay timescales. Comparisons are made with existing NASA models and previous literature. The results highlight the importance of accurate atmospheric density representation and solar activity in predicting satellite lifetimes, especially relevant in the context of increasing space debris and mega-constellations.</description>
