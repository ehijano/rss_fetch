      <title>The discontinuous limit case of an archetypal oscillator with constant excitation and van der Pol damping: A single equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the global dynamics of the discontinuous limit case of an archetypal oscillator with constant excitation that exhibits a single equilibrium. For parameter regions in which this oscillator possesses two or three equilibria, the global bifurcation diagram and the corresponding phase portraits on the Poincare disc have been presented in [Phys. D, 438 (2022) 133362]. The present work completes the global structure of the discontinuous limit case of an archetypal oscillator with constant excitation. Although the dynamical phenomena are less rich compared to systems with more than one equilibrium, the presence of a single equilibrium gives rise to additional limit cycles surrounding it, thereby enriching the overall dynamics and making the analysis substantially more intricate than in the previously studied cases.</description>

      <title>H\"{o}lder classifications of finite-dimensional linear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two flows on a finite-dimensional normed space $X$ are equivalent if some homeomorphism $h$ of $X$ preserves all orbits, i.e., $h$ maps each orbit onto an orbit. Under the assumption that $h$, $h^{-1}$ both are $\beta$-H\"{o}lder continuous near the origin for some (or all) $0&lt;\beta&lt; 1$, a complete classification with respect to some-H\"{o}lder (or all-H\"{o}lder) equivalence is established for linear flows on $X$, in terms of basic linear algebra properties of their generators. Consistently utilizing equivalence instead of the more restrictive conjugacy, the classification theorems extend and unify known results. Though entirely elementary, the analysis is somewhat intricate and highlights, more clearly than does the existing literature, the fundamental roles played by linearity and the finite-dimensionality of $X$.</description>

      <title>A structure theorem for polynomial return-time sets in minimal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of return-time sets determined by orbits along polynomial tuples in minimal topological dynamical systems. Building on the topological characteristic factor theory of Glasner, Huang, Shao, Weiss, and Ye, we prove a structure theorem showing that, in a minimal system, return-time sets coincide -- up to a non-piecewise syndetic set -- with those in its maximal infinite-step pronilfactor. As applications, we establish three new multiple recurrence theorems concerning linear recurrence along dynamically defined syndetic sets and polynomial recurrence along arithmetic progressions in minimal and totally minimal systems. We also show how our main theorem can be used to prove that two previously separate conjectures -- one due to Glasner, Huang, Shao, Weiss, and Ye and the other due to Leibman -- are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation of Limit Cycles from a Fold-Fold Singularity in a Glacial Cycles Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the occurrence of limit cycles from a point on the discontinuity hyperplane $L$ between two smooth vector fields where the two vector fields both point towards one another. Generically, such a point (called switched equilibrium in control) is asymptotically stable, but we consider the situation where the two vector fields become tangent to L at the switched equilibrium under varying parameter making a degenerate fold-fold singularity. We prove that moving the parameter past such a singular value leads to the occurrence of an attracting limit cycle, which is exactly the dynamical mechanism we then discover in a conceptual model of glacial cycles.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the multifractal spectrum of Birkhoff averages for non-uniformly expanding R\'{e}nyi interval maps with countably many branches. Our main theorem substantially strengthens conditional variational formulas established by Jaerisch and Takahasi. Furthermore, our results enable a detailed analysis of Khinchin exponents and arithmetic means of backward continued fraction expansions in terms of the Hausdorff dimension. We also give a positive answer to the conjecture of Jaerisch and Takahasi. In addition, we develop the thermodynamic formalism for non-uniformly expanding R\'{e}nyi interval maps with countably many branches.</description>

      <title>Decay of correlations and limit theorems for random intermittent maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the problem of polynomial memory loss and the central limit theorem for time-dependent LSV maps. More precisely, we show that for random LSV maps corresponding to a random parameter beta() we obtain quenched memory loss, decay of correlations, central limit theorems with rates, moment bounds and almost sure invariance principles (ASIP) when the essential infimum of beta() is less than 1/5 and the driving process (i.e. random environment) is mixing sufficiently fast. In [59, Corollary 3.8] the ASIP was obtained for ergodic driving systems when the essential supremum of \b{eta} is less than 1/2. As will be elaborated in Section 1, restrictions on the essential infimum are more natural in our context. Our results have an abstract form which we believe could be useful in other circumstances, as will be elaborated in a future work</description>

      <title>Shrinking Targets versus Recurrence: a brief survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,d)$ be a compact metric space and $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu,T)$ a measure preserving dynamical system. Furthermore, given a real, positive function $\psi$, let $W(T, \psi)$ and $ R(T,\psi) $ respectively denote the shrinking target set and the recurrent set associated with the dynamical system. Under certain mixing properties it is known that if the natural measure sum diverges then the recurrent and shrinking target sets are of full $\mu$-measure. The purpose of this survey is to provide a brief overview of such results, to discuss the potential quantitative strengthening of the full measure statements and to bring to the forefront key differences in the theory.</description>

      <title>Kneading the Lorenz attractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Lorenz map $f:[0,1]\to[0,1]$ is a piecewise continuous map, modeled after an idealized version of the Lorenz attractor. In this paper we settle the following question - how much of the dynamics of the Lorenz attractor can be modeled by such one-dimensional model? In this paper we will prove there exist open regions in the parameter space of the Lorenz system where one can canonically reduce the dynamics of the Lorenz attractor into those of a symmetric Lorenz map $F_\beta$ with a constant slope $\beta\in(1,2]$. As we will show, not only the map $F_\beta$ encodes many of the essential features of the Lorenz attractor, it also governs many of its bifurcations. As such, our results correlate closely with the results of numerical studies, and possibly explain the bifurcation phenomena observed in the Lorenz attractor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of ``most" cases of the polynomial Wiener-Wintner theorem for $\sigma$-finite spaces, using hard-analytic methods. Specifically, we prove that whenever $(X,\mu,T)$ is a $\sigma$-finite measure-preserving system, and $f \in L^p(X), \ 1 \leq p &lt; \infty$, there exists a co-null set $X_f \subset X$ so that for all $\omega \in X_f$ \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n \leq N} e^{2 \pi i P(n)} f(T^n \omega) \] converges for all polynomials $P$ which are either linear, or vanish to degree $2$ at the origin.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Khintchine theorem on manifolds in positive characteristics: convergence case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the convergence case of Khintchine's theorem for analytic nonplanar manifolds over local fields of positive characteristic, in the setting of simultaneous Diophantine approximation. Our approach is based on the method of counting rational points near manifolds developed by Beresnevich and Yang. The results obtained here extend the work of Beresnevich and Yang, and Beresnevich and Datta, to the function field setting. In the course of the proof, we also establish several new results in the geometry of numbers over function fields, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior for a general class of spreading models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing literatures on epidemic and rumor dynamics show that infection and information coevolve. We present a unified framework for modeling the spread of infection and information: a general class of interaction-driven fluid-limit models expressed as coupled ODEs. The class includes the SIR epidemic model, the Daley-Kendall rumor model, and many extensions. For this general class, we derive theoretical results: under explicit graph-theoretic conditions, we obtain a classification of asymptotic behavior and motivate a conjecture of exponential decay for vanishing states. When these conditions are violated, the classification can fail, and decay may become non-exponential (e.g., algebraic). In deriving the main result, we establish asymptotic stability and $L^1$-integrability properties for state variables. Alongside these results, we introduce the dependency graph that captures outflow dependencies and offers a new angle on the structure of this model class. Finally, we illustrate the results with several examples, including a heterogeneous rumor model and a rumor-dependent SIR model, showing how small changes to the dependency graph can flip asymptotic behavior and reshape epidemic trajectories.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff measures of sets in Exact Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X, d)$ be a compact metric space. Given a countable subset $Q \subset X$, a positive function $R: Q \to \mathbb{R}^+:\xi \mapsto R_{\xi}$, and a non-decreasing function $\phi$, we consider the set $E(Q, R, \phi)$ of points $x \in X$ for which there are infinitely many $\xi \in Q$ satisfying $$d(x, \xi) &lt; \phi(R_{\xi}),$$ yet for any $0&lt;\epsilon&lt;1$, there are only finitely many $\xi \in Q$ such that $$d(x, \xi) &lt; (1-\epsilon)\phi(R_{\xi}).$$ We provide sufficient conditions (which are also necessary under some mild assumptions) for the $s$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of $E(Q, R, \phi)$ to be infinite. This framework generalizes not only the classical set $\mathrm{Exact}(\psi)$ of points exactly $\psi$-approximable by rationals (where $\psi$ is non-increasing), but also certain restricted Diophantine approximation sets.</description>

      <title>Self-similar blow-up solutions for the supercritical parabolic Hardy-H\'enon equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify the self-similar solutions presenting finite time blow-up to the parabolic Hardy-H\'enon equation $$ \partial_tu=\Delta u+|x|^{\sigma}u^p, \quad (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^N\times(0,\infty), $$ in dimension $N\geq3$ and the range of exponents $$ \sigma\in(-2,\infty), \quad p&gt;p_S(\sigma):=\frac{N+2\sigma+2}{N-2}. $$ We establish the \emph{existence of self-similar blow-up solutions for any $p&gt;p_S(\sigma)$}, provided $\sigma\geq2$. Moreover, we prove that, if $k$ is any natural number and $\sigma\geq 4k-2$, the parabolic Hardy-H\'enon equation has at least $k$ different self-similar blow-up solutions for any $p&gt;p_S(\sigma)$. These results are in a stark contrast with the standard reaction-diffusion equation $$ \partial_tu=\Delta u+u^p, \quad (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^N\times(0,\infty), $$ for which non-existence of any self-similar solution has been established, provided $p$ overpasses the Lepin exponent $p_L:=1+\frac{6}{N-10}$, $N\geq11$.
  For $\sigma\in(-2,2)$, we derive the expression of generalized Lepin exponents $p_L(\sigma)$ for $\sigma\in(0,2)$, respectively $\overline{p_L}(\sigma)$ for $\sigma\in(-2,0)$, and prove existence of self-similar solutions with finite time blow-up for $p\in(p_S(\sigma),p_L(\sigma))$, respectively $p\in(p_S(\sigma),\overline{p_L}(\sigma))$. Numerical evidence of the optimality of these exponents is also included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove two results on the algebraic dynamics of billiards in generic algebraic curves of degree $d \geq 2$. First, the dynamical degree grows quadratically in $d$; second, the set of complex periodic points has measure 0, implying the Ivrii Conjecture for the classical billiard map in generic algebraic domains. To prove these results, we specialize to a new billiard table, the Fermat hyperbola, on which the indeterminacy points satisfy an exceptionality property. Over $\mathbb{C}$, we construct an algebraically stable model for this billiard via an iterated blowup. Over more general fields, we prove essential stability, i.e. algebraic stability for a particular big and nef divisor.</description>

      <title>Computational Bifurcation Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bifurcation analysis collects techniques for characterizing the dependence of certain classes of solutions of a dynamical system on variations in problem parameters. Common solution classes of interest include equilibria and periodic orbits, the number and stability of which may vary as parameters vary. Continuation techniques generate continuous families of such solutions in the combined state and parameter space, e.g., curves (branches) of periodic orbits or surfaces of equilibria. Their advantage over simulation-based approaches is the ability to map out such families independently of the dynamic stability of the equilibria or periodic orbits. Bifurcation diagrams represent families of equilibria and periodic orbits as curves or surfaces in appropriate coordinate systems. Special points, such as bifurcations, are often highlighted in such diagrams.
  This article provides an illustration of this paradigm of synergy between theoretical derivations and computational analysis for several characteristic examples of bifurcation analysis in commonly encountered classes of problems. General theoretical principles are deduced from these illustrations and collected for the reader's subsequent reference.</description>

We establish an error bound in the functional central limit theorem with respect to an integral probability metric of smooth test functions under a functional correlation decay bound. For systems with a sufficiently fast polynomial rate of correlation decay, the error bound is of order $O(N^{-1/2})$, under an additional condition on the linear growth of variance. Applications include a family of interval maps with neutral fixed points and unbounded derivatives, and two-dimensional dispersing Sinai billiards.</description>

      <title>The hybrid matching of Hurwitz systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study planar hybrid systems composed by two stable linear systems, defined by Hurwitz matrices, in addition with a jump that can be a piecewise linear, a polynomial or an analytic function. We provide an explicit analytic necessary and sufficient condition for this class of hybrid systems to be asymptotically stable. We also prove the existence of limit cycles in this class of hybrid systems. Our results can be seen as generalizations of results already obtained in the literature. This was possible due to an embedding of piecewise smooth vector fields in a hybrid structure.</description>

      <title>New functionalities in MatCont: delay equations and Lyapunov exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MatCont is a powerful toolbox for numerical bifurcation analysis focussing on smooth ODEs. A user can study equilibria, periodic and connecting orbits, and their stability and bifurcations. Here, we report on additional features in version 7p6. The first is a delay equation importer enabling MatCont users to study a much larger class of models, namely delay equations with finite delay (including delay differential and renewal equations). This importer translates the delay equation into a system of ODEs using a pseudospectral approximation with an order specified by the user. We also implemented Lyapunov exponent computations, event functions for Poincar\'e maps, and enhanced homoclinic continuation. We demonstrate these features with test cases, such as the Mackey-Glass equation and a renewal equation, and provide additional examples in online tutorials.</description>

      <title>Periodic Points of Hamiltonian Diffeomorphisms Equal to Nondegenerate Linear Maps at Infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on symplectic Euclidean spaces that are equal to non-degenerate linear maps at infinity. Under the assumption that there exists an isolated homologically nontrivial fixed point satisfying the twist condition, we prove the existence of infinitely many simple periodic points. More precisely, if such a diffeomorphism has only finitely many fixed points, then it admits simple periodic points with arbitrarily large prime periods.</description>

      <title>The pointwise ergodic theorem on finitely additive spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The almost sure convergence of ergodic averages in Birkhoff's pointwise ergodic theorem is known to fail in the finitely additive setting. We introduce a natural reformulation of almost sure convergence suitable for finitely additive measures, which we call finite almost sure convergence. Unlike the classical formulation, finite almost sure convergence only involves measures of finite unions and intersections, making it well adapted to finitely additive spaces. Using this notion, we extend the pointwise ergodic theorem to finitely additive probability spaces. Our proof relies on demonstrating that several quantitative generalizations of the pointwise ergodic theorem remain valid in the finitely additive setting via an extension of the Calder\'on transference principle. The result then follows by exploiting the relationships between quantitative notions of almost sure convergence developed by the author and Powell (c.f. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. Series B 12 (2025), 974-1019).</description>

      <title>Why and When Deep is Better than Shallow: An Implementation-Agnostic State-Transition View of Depth Supremacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why and when is deep better than shallow? We answer this question in a framework that is agnostic to network implementation. We formulate a deep model as an abstract state-transition semigroup acting on a general metric space, and separate the implementation (e.g., ReLU nets, transformers, and chain-of-thought) from the abstract state transition. We prove a bias-variance decomposition in which the variance depends only on the abstract depth-$k$ network and not on the implementation (Theorem 1). We further split the bounds into output and hidden parts to tie the depth dependence of the variance to the metric entropy of the state-transition semigroup (Theorem 2). We then investigate implementation-free conditions under which the variance grow polynomially or logarithmically with depth (Section 4). Combining these with exponential or polynomial bias decay identifies four canonical bias-variance trade-off regimes (EL/EP/PL/PP) and produces explicit optimal depths $k^\ast$. Across regimes, $k^\ast&gt;1$ typically holds, giving a rigorous form of depth supremacy. The lowest generalization error bound is achieved under the EL regime (exp-decay bias + log-growth variance), explaining why and when deep is better, especially for iterative or hierarchical concept classes such as neural ODEs, diffusion/score-matching models, and chain-of-thought reasoning.</description>

      <title>Coherence and Transients in Nonlocally Coupled Dissipative Kicked Rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of nonlocally coupled dissipative kicked rotors is rich and complex. In this study, we consider a network of rotors where each interacts equally with a certain range of its neighbors. We focus on the influence of the coupling strength and the coupling range, and show both analytically and numerically the critical transitions in the phase diagram, which include bifurcations of simple spatiotemporal patterns and changes in basin sizes of coherent states with different wavenumbers. We highlight that this diagram is fundamentally different from those found in other coupled systems such as in coupled logistic maps or Lorenz systems. Finally, we show an interesting domain-wall phenomenon in the coupled chaotic rotors, where a super-long transient interface state (partially regular and partially chaotic) is observed and can persist exponentially long as the coupling range increases up to a critical threshold.</description>

      <title>A Single-Equation Approach to Classifying Neuronal Operational Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neural coding is yet to be discovered. The neuronal operational modes that arise with fixed inputs but with varying degrees of stimulation help to elucidate their coding properties. In neurons receiving {\it in vivo} stimulation, we show that two operation modes can be described with simplified models: the coincidence detection mode and the integration mode. Our derivations include a simplified polynomial model with non-linear coefficients ($\beta_i$) that capture the subthreshold dynamics of these modes of operation. The resulting model can explain these transitions with the sign and size of the smallest nonlinear coefficient of the polynomial alone. Defining neuronal operational modes provides insight into the processing and transmission of information through electrical currents. Requisite operational modes for proper neuronal functioning may explain disorders involving dysfunction of electrophysiological behavior, such as channelopathies.</description>
