      <title>Scalable ADER-DG Transport Method with Polynomial Order Independent CFL Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are known to suffer from increasingly restrictive time step constraints as the polynomial order increases, limiting their efficiency at high orders. In this paper, we introduce a novel locally implicit, but globally explicit ADER-DG scheme designed for transport-dominated problems. The method achieves a maximum stable time step governed by an element-width based CFL condition that is independent of the polynomial degree. By solving a set of element-local implicit problems at each time step, our approach more effectively captures the domain of dependence. As a result, our method remains stable for CFL numbers up to $1/\sqrt{d}$ in $d$ spatial dimensions. We provide a rigorous stability proof in one dimension, and extend the analysis to two and three dimensions using a semi-analytical von Neumann stability analysis. The accuracy and convergence of the method are demonstrated through numerical experiments on both linear and nonlinear test cases.</description>

      <title>Spectral connvergece of random feature method in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the various machine learning methods solving partial differential equations, the Random Feature Method (RFM) stands out due to its accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we demonstrate that the approximation error of RFM exhibits spectral convergence when it is applied to the second-order elliptic equations in one dimension, provided that the solution belongs to Gevrey classes or Sobolev spaces. We highlight the significant impact of incorporating the Partition of Unity Method (PUM) to enhance the convergence of RFM by establishing the convergence rate in terms of the maximum patch size. Furthermore, we reveal that the singular values of the random feature matrix (RFMtx) decay exponentially, while its condition number increases exponentially as the number of the features grows. We also theoretically illustrate that PUM may mitigate the excessive decay of the singular values of RFMtx.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving finite element framework for the Vlasov-Maxwell system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stabilized, structure-preserving finite element framework for solving the Vlasov-Maxwell equations. The method uses a tensor product of continuous polynomial spaces for the spatial and velocity domains, respectively, to discretize the Vlasov equation, combined with curl- and divergence-conforming N\'ed\'elec and Raviart-Thomas elements for Maxwell's equations on Cartesian grids. A novel, robust, consistent, and high-order accurate residual-based artificial viscosity method is introduced for stabilizing the Vlasov equations. The proposed method is tested on the 1D2V and 2D2V reduced Vlasov-Maxwell system, achieving optimal convergence orders for all polynomial spaces considered in this study. Several challenging benchmarks are solved to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform time-stepping in k-space pseudospectral time domain models of acoustic propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-uniform time stepping in acoustic propagation models can be used to preserve accuracy or reduce computational cost for an acoustic simulation with a wave front propagating through a domain with both heterogeneous and homogenous regions, such as for a simulation of breast ultrasound tomography. The k-space correction already exist within the literature to remove numerical dispersion caused by the time stepping procedure in pseudo-spectral time domain models, but requires a uniform time step. Here we expand this correction to be able to account for a non-uniform time stepping method and illustrate the potential advantages and considerations. A version of this Article has been submitted for review to the Journal of Theoretical and Computational Acoustics.</description>

      <title>A preconditioned boundary value method for advection-diffusion equations with half Laplacian via spectrum doubling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an advection-diffusion equation that involves a half-Laplacian operator derived from the Riesz fractional Laplacian, combined with a differential operator \(\mathcal{L}\). By applying the half-Laplacian operator $(-\Delta)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ on both sides of the equation and using the relationship between the Hilbert transform and $(-\Delta)^{\frac{1}{2}}$, we reformulate the problem as a second-order damped Cauchy problem and then convert it into an equivalent first-order system. This \textit{spectrum doubling} (SD) reformulation applies the half-Laplacian only once to the initial condition, thereby eliminating the need to evaluate singular integrals during the time evolution and reducing truncation-related numerical errors. For the resulting SD system, we show that standard time-stepping schemes can lose stability because of the backward-diffusion term. To address this, we adopt Boundary Value Methods (BVMs), which yield unconditional stability and second-order accuracy. We present eigenvalue-based stability criteria, error estimates, and an efficient block formulation to solve the resulting large linear systems. To further enhance computational efficiency, we propose a parallel preconditioned iterative solver. Numerical experiments confirm the second-order convergences in both time and space, even under strong advection or for complex fractional Schr\"odinger-type problems, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Towards an Efficient Shifted Cholesky QR for Applications in Model Order Reduction using pyMOR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many model order reduction (MOR) methods rely on the computation of an orthonormal basis of a subspace onto which the large full order model is projected. Numerically, this entails the orthogonalization of a set of vectors. The nature of the MOR process imposes several requirements for the orthogonalization process. Firstly, MOR is oftentimes performed in an adaptive or iterative manner, where the quality of the reduced order model, i.e., the dimension of the reduced subspace, is decided on the fly. Therefore, it is important that the orthogonalization routine can be executed iteratively. Secondly, one possibly has to deal with high-dimensional arrays of abstract vectors that do not allow explicit access to entries, making it difficult to employ so-called `orthogonal triangularization algorithms' such as Householder QR.
  For these reasons, (modified) Gram-Schmidt-type algorithms are commonly used in MOR applications. These methods belong to the category of `triangular orthogonalization' algorithms that do not rely on elementwise access to the vectors and can be easily updated. Recently, algorithms like shifted Cholesky QR have gained attention. These also belong to the aforementioned category and have proven their aptitude for MOR algorithms in previous studies. A key benefit of these methods is that they are communication-avoiding, leading to vastly superior performance on memory-bandwidth-limited problems and parallel or distributed architectures. This work formulates an efficient updating scheme for Cholesky QR algorithms and proposes an improved shifting strategy for highly ill-conditioned matrices.
  The proposed algorithmic extensions are validated with numerical experiments on a laptop and computation server.</description>

      <title>A fast algorithm for the wave equation using time-windowed Fourier projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new arbitrarily high-order method for the rapid evaluation of hyperbolic potentials (space-time integrals involving the Green's function for the scalar wave equation). With $M$ points in the spatial discretization and $N_t$ time steps of size $\Delta t$, a naive implementation would require $\mathcal O(M^2N_t^2)$ work in dimensions where the weak Huygens' principle applies. We avoid this all-to-all interaction using a smoothly windowed decomposition into a local part, treated directly, plus a history part, approximated by a $N_F$-term Fourier series. In one dimension, our method requires $\mathcal O\left((M + N_F \log N_F)N_t\right)$ work, with $N_F =\mathcal O(1/\Delta t)$, by exploiting the non-uniform fast Fourier transform. We demonstrate the method's performance for time-domain scattering problems involving a large number $M$ of springs (point scatterers) attached to a vibrating string at arbitrary locations, with either periodic or free-space boundary conditions. We typically achieve 10-digit accuracy, and include tests for $M$ up to a million.</description>

      <title>Efficient Parametric SVD of Koopman Operator for Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.</description>

      <title>COALA: Numerically Stable and Efficient Framework for Context-Aware Low-Rank Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case. Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores a novel approach to time series forecasting applied to the context of Chennai's climate data. Our methodology comprises two distinct established time series models, leveraging their strengths in handling seasonality and periods. Notably, a new algorithm is developed to compute the period of the time series using unsupervised machine learning and spline interpolation techniques. Through a meticulous ensembling process that combines these two models, we achieve optimized forecasts. This research contributes to advancing forecasting techniques and offers valuable insights into climate data analysis.</description>

      <title>Pay Attention to Attention Distribution: A New Local Lipschitz Bound for Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local Lipschitz constants of the whole network.</description>

      <title>First-passage time for PDifMPs: an Exact simulation approach for time-varying thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piecewise Diffusion Markov Processes (PDifMPs) are valuable for modelling systems where continuous dynamics are interrupted by sudden shifts and/or changes in drift and diffusion. The first-passage time (FPT) in such models plays a central role in understanding when a process first reaches a critical boundary. In many systems, time-dependent thresholds provide a flexible framework for reflecting evolving conditions, making them essential for realistic modelling. We propose a hybrid exact simulation scheme for computing the FPT of PDifMPs to time-dependent thresholds. Exact methods traditionally exist for pure diffusions, using Brownian motion as an auxiliary process and accepting sampled paths with a probability weight. Between jumps, the PDifMP evolves as a diffusion, allowing us to apply the exact method within each inter-jump interval. The main challenge arises when no threshold crossing is detected in an interval: We then need the value of the process at the jump time, and for that, we introduce an approach to simulate a conditionally constrained auxiliary process and derive the corresponding acceptance probability. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the method and illustrate it using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Meshless projection model-order reduction via reference spaces for smoothed-particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a model-order reduction framework for the meshless weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The proposed framework introduces the concept of modal reference spaces to overcome the challenges of discovering low-dimensional subspaces from unstructured, dynamic, and mixing numerical topology that is often seen in SPH simulations. The proposed modal reference spaces enable a low-dimensional representation of the SPH field equations while maintaining their inherent meshless qualities. Modal reference spaces are constructed by projecting SPH snapshot data onto a reference space where low-dimensionality of field quantities can be discovered via traditional modal decomposition techniques (e.g., the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)). Modal quantities are mapped back to the meshless SPH space via scattered data interpolation during the online predictive stage. The proposed model-order reduction framework is cast into the \emph{meshless} Galerkin POD (GPOD) and the Adjoint Petrov--Galerkin (APG) projection model-order reduction (PMOR) formulation. The PMORs are tested on three numerical experiments: 1) the Taylor--Green vortex; 2) lid-driven cavity; and 3) flow past an open cavity. Results show good agreement in reconstructed and predictive velocity fields, which showcase the ability of the proposed framework to evolve the unstructured, dynamic, and mixing SPH field equations in a low-dimensional subspace. Results also show that the pressure field is sensitive to the projection error due to the stiff weakly-compressible assumption made in the current SPH framework, but can be alleviated through nonlinear approximations, such as the APG approach. Ultimately, the presented meshless model-order reduction framework marks a step toward enabling drastic cost savings of SPH simulations.</description>

Abstract: Unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) is a natural extension of optimal transport (OT) allowing comparison between measures of different masses. It arises naturally in machine learning by offering a robustness against outliers. The aim of this work is to provide convergence rates of the regularized transport cost and plans towards their original solution when both measures are weighted sums of Dirac masses.</description>

      <title>New Feedback Control and Adaptive Evolve-Filter-Relax Regularization for the Navier-Stokes Equations in the Convection-Dominated Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose, analyze, and investigate numerically a novel feedback control strategy for high Reynolds number flows. For both the continuous and the discrete (finite element) settings, we prove that the new strategy yields accurate results for high Reynolds numbers that were not covered by current results. We also show that the new feedback control yields more accurate results than the current control approaches in marginally-resolved numerical simulations of a two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers $Re=1000$. We note, however, that for realistic control parameters, the stabilizing effect of the new feedback control strategy is not sufficient in the convection-dominated regime. Our second contribution is the development of an adaptive evolve-filter-relax (aEFR) regularization that stabilizes marginally-resolved simulations in the convection-dominated regime and increases the accuracy of the new feedback control in realistic parameter settings. For the finite element setting, we prove that the novel feedback control equipped with the new aEFR method yields accurate results for high Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, our numerical investigation shows that the new strategy yields accurate results for reduced order models that dramatically decrease the size of the feedback control problem.</description>

      <title>A Simplified Fast Multipole Method Based on Strong Recursive Skeletonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a kernel-independent, multilevel, adaptive algorithm for efficiently evaluating a discrete convolution kernel with a given source distribution. The method is based on linear algebraic tools such as low rank approximation and ``skeleton representations'' to approximate far-field interactions. While this work is related to previous linear algebraic formulations of the fast multipole method, the proposed algorithm is distinguished by relying on simpler data structures.
  The proposed algorithm eliminates the need for explicit interaction lists by restructuring computations to operate exclusively on the near-neighbor list at each level of the tree, thereby simplifying both implementation and data structures. This work also introduces novel translation operators that significantly simplify the handling of adaptive point distributions. As a kernel-independent approach, it only requires evaluation of the kernel function, making it easily adaptable to a variety of kernels. By using operations on the neighbor list (of size at most 27 in 3D) rather than the interaction list (of size up to 189 in 3D), the algorithm is particularly well-suited for parallel implementation on modern hardware.
  Numerical experiments on uniform and non-uniform point distributions in 2D and 3D demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed parallel algorithm for Laplace and (low-frequency) Helmholtz kernels. The algorithm constructs a tailored skeleton representation for the given geometry during a precomputation stage. After precomputation, the fast summation achieves high efficiency on the GPU using batched linear algebra operations.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates for Systems of Nonlocal Balance Laws Modeling Dense Multilane Vehicular Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16928v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a class of coupled systems of nonlocal nonlinear balance laws modeling multilane traffic, with the nonlocality present in both convective and source terms. The uniqueness and existence of the entropy solution are proven via doubling of the variables arguments and convergent finite volume approximations, respectively. The primary goal is to establish that the finite volume numerical approximations of the system converge to the unique entropy solution at a rate of $\sqrt{\Delta t}$, even when using relatively less regular one-sided kernels, compared to the globally smooth kernels analyzed in [Num. Math., 156(1):237-271, 2024] and [IMA J. Numer. Anal., 44(6):3354-3392, 2024]. The applicability of the proven theory to a general class of systems of nonlocal balance laws coupled strongly through the convective part and weakly through the source part, is indicated. As the support of the kernel tends to zero, the convergence of the entropy solutions of the proposed model to its local counterparts [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 51: 3694--3713, 2019] is also discussed. Numerical simulations illustrating the behavior of the entropy solutions of the coupled nonlocal systems are also shown.</description>

      <title>An efficient Asymptotic-Preserving scheme for the Boltzmann mixture with disparate mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop and implement an efficient asymptotic-preserving (AP) scheme to solve the gas mixture of Boltzmann equations under the disparate mass scaling relevant to the so-called "epochal relaxation" phenomenon. The disparity in molecular masses, ranging across several orders of magnitude, leads to significant challenges in both the evaluation of collision operators and the designing of time-stepping schemes to capture the multi-scale nature of the dynamics. A direct implementation of the spectral method faces prohibitive computational costs as the mass ratio increases due to the need to resolve vastly different thermal velocities. Unlike [I. M. Gamba, S. Jin, and L. Liu, Commun. Math. Sci., 17 (2019), pp. 1257-1289], we propose an alternative approach based on proper truncation of asymptotic expansions of the collision operators, which significantly reduces the computational complexity and works well for small $\varepsilon$. By incorporating the separation of three time scales in the model's relaxation process [P. Degond and B. Lucquin-Desreux, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 6 (1996), pp. 405-436], we design an AP scheme that captures the specific dynamics of the disparate mass model while maintaining computational efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in handling large mass ratios of heavy and light species, as well as capturing the epochal relaxation phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Using curved meshes to derive a priori error estimates for a linear elasticity problem with Robin boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work concerns the numerical analysis of the linear elasticity problem with a Robin boundary condition on a smooth domain. A finite element discretization is presented using high-order curved meshes in order to accurately discretize the physical domain. The primary objective is to conduct a detailed error analysis for the elasticity problem using the vector lift operator, which maps vector-valued functions from the mesh domain to the physical domain. Error estimates are established, both in terms of the finite element approximation error and the geometric error, respectively associated to the finite element degree and to the mesh order. These theoretical a priori error estimates are validated by numerical experiments in 2D and 3D.</description>

      <title>A spline-based hexahedral mesh generator for patient-specific coronary arteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a spline-based hexahedral mesh generator for tubular geometries commonly encountered in haemodynamics studies, in particular coronary arteries. We focus on techniques for accurately meshing vessels with stenoses and aneurysms, as well as non-planar bifurcations. Our approach incorporates several innovations, including a spline-based description of the vessel geometry in both the radial and the longitudinal directions, the use of Hermite curves for modeling non-planar bifurcations, and a generalization to non-planar n intersecting branches. This method eliminates the need for a concrete vessel surface, grid smoothing, and other post-processing. A technique to generate grids with boundary layers is also presented. We validate the generated meshes using commonly employed quality indices, compare them against state-of-the-art mesh generators and apply our method to complex coronary trees. Finally, we present finite element fluid flow simulations with physiological boundary conditions. To validate the proposed framework, a wall-shear-stress-based convergence test and computations of haemodynamic indices are also presented.</description>

Abstract: This articles investigates physics-based passive imaging problem, wherein one infers an unknown medium using ambient noise and correlation of the noise signal. We develop a general backpropagation framework via the so-called extended adjoint state, suitable for any linear PDE; crucially, this approach reduces by half the number of required PDE solves. Applications to several different PDE models demonstrate the universality of our method. In addition, we analyze the nonlinearity of the correlated model, revealing a surprising tangential cone condition-like structure, thereby advancing the state of the art towards a convergence guarantee for regularized reconstruction in passive imaging.</description>

      <title>Inverse source problems for the stochastic wave equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the ill-posedness of the inverse source problem for the one-dimensional stochastic Helmholtz equations without attenuation, this study develops a novel computational framework designed to mitigate this inherent challenge at the numerical implementation level. For the stochastic wave equation driven by a finite-jump L\'evy process (assuming that its jump amplitude obeys a Gaussian distribution and the jump time interval obeys a Poisson distribution), this paper firstly establish the existence of a mild solution to its direct problem satisfying a particular stability estimate. Building upon these theoretical foundations, we further investigate the well-posedness of the inverse problem and develop a methodology to reconstruct the unknown source terms $f$ and $g$ using the data of the wave field at the final time point $u(x,T)$. This work not only provides rigorous theoretical analysis and effective numerical schemes for solving inverse source problems in these two specific classes of stochastic wave equations, but also offers new perspectives and methodological approaches for addressing a broader range of wave propagation inverse problems characterized by non-Gaussian stochastic properties. The proposed framework demonstrates significant relevance for characterizing physical phenomena influenced by jump-type stochastic perturbations, offering promising applications in diverse domains including but not limited to seismic wave propagation analysis and financial market volatility modeling.</description>

Abstract: We study an elliptic interface problem with discontinuous diffusion coefficients on unfitted meshes using the CutFEM method. Our main contribution is the reconstruction of conservative fluxes from the CutFEM solution and their use in a posteriori error estimation. We introduce a hybrid mixed formulation with locally computable Lagrange multipliers and reconstruct the flux in the immersed Raviart-Thomas space. Based on this, we propose a new a posteriori error estimator that includes both volume and interface terms. We state its robust reliability and local efficiency, and validate the approach through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>The semi-analytic theory and computation of finite-depth standing water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Stokes expansion ansatz for finite-depth standing water waves in two dimensions and devise a recursive algorithm to compute the expansion coefficients. We implement the algorithm on a supercomputer using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. The Stokes expansion introduces hyperbolic terms that require exponentiation of power series, which we handle efficiently using Bell polynomials. Although exact resonances occur at a countable dense set of fluid depths, we prove that for almost every depth, the divisors that arise in the recurrence are bounded away from zero by a slowly decaying function of the wave number. A direct connection between small divisors and imperfect bifurcations is observed. They are found to activate secondary standing waves that oscillate non-uniformly in space and time on top of the primary wave, with different amplitudes and phases on each bifurcation branch. We compute new families of standing waves using a shooting method and find that Pad\'e approximants of the Stokes expansion continue to converge to the shooting method solutions at large amplitudes as new small divisors enter the recurrence. Closely spaced poles and zeros of the Pad\'e approximants are observed, which suggests that the bifurcation branches are separated by branch cuts.</description>

Abstract: We explore a hybrid technique to quantify the variability in the numerical solutions to a free boundary problem associated with magnetic equilibrium in axisymmetric fusion reactors amidst parameter uncertainties. The method aims at reducing computational costs by integrating a surrogate model into a multilevel Monte Carlo method. The resulting surrogate-enhanced multilevel Monte Carlo methods reduce the cost of simulation by factors as large as $10^4$ compared to standard Monte Carlo simulations involving direct numerical solutions of the associated Grad-Shafranov partial differential equation. Accuracy assessments also show that surrogate-based sampling closely aligns with the results of direct computation, confirming its effectiveness in capturing the behavior of plasma boundary and geometric descriptors.</description>

      <title>Determinant Estimation under Memory Constraints and Neural Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculating or accurately estimating log-determinants of large positive definite matrices is of fundamental importance in many machine learning tasks. While its cubic computational complexity can already be prohibitive, in modern applications, even storing the matrices themselves can pose a memory bottleneck. To address this, we derive a novel hierarchical algorithm based on block-wise computation of the LDL decomposition for large-scale log-determinant calculation in memory-constrained settings. In extreme cases where matrices are highly ill-conditioned, accurately computing the full matrix itself may be infeasible. This is particularly relevant when considering kernel matrices at scale, including the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) of neural networks trained on large datasets. Under the assumption of neural scaling laws in the test error, we show that the ratio of pseudo-determinants satisfies a power-law relationship, allowing us to derive corresponding scaling laws. This enables accurate estimation of NTK log-determinants from a tiny fraction of the full dataset; in our experiments, this results in a $\sim$100,000$\times$ speedup with improved accuracy over competing approximations. Using these techniques, we successfully estimate log-determinants for dense matrices of extreme sizes, which were previously deemed intractable and inaccessible due to their enormous scale and computational demands.</description>

      <title>Scale Dilation Dynamics in Flexible Bandwidth Needlet Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flexible bandwidth needlets offer a versatile multiscale framework for analyzing functions on the sphere. A key element in their construction is the dilation sequence, which controls how the multipole consecutive scales are spaced and overlapped. At any resolution level, this sequence determines the center positions of the needlet weight functions and influences their localization in the spatial domain and spectral concentration properties by means of the relative bandwidth ratio. In this paper, we explore the different asymptotic regimes that arise when the dilation sequence exhibits shrinking, stable (standard), or spreading behavior. Moreover, we assume the dilation sequence grows regularly enough to ensure well-defined asymptotic properties. For each regime, we characterize the impact on the geometry of the center scales and the shape of the multipole windows, with particular attention to their overlap structure and spectral coverage. These insights help to clarify the trade-offs between localization, redundancy, and scalability in the design of needlet-type systems, particularly in relation to the study of the asymptotic uncorrelation of needlet coefficients when applied to random fields.</description>
