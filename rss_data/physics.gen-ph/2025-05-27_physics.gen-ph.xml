      <title>Off-diagonal deformations of regular Schwarzschild black holes and general relativistic G. Perelman thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new classes of solutions describing generic off-diagonal deformations of regular Schwarzschild black holes (BHs) in general relativity (GR). Examples of such (primary) diagonal metrics reducing the Einstein equations to integrable systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations were studied in a recent work by R. Casadio, A. Kamenshchik and J. Ovalle in Phys. Rev. D 111 (2025) 064036. We develop and apply our anholonomic frame and connection deformations method, which allows us to generate new classes of target off-diagonal solutions. Ansatz that reduces the gravitational field equations to systems of (exactly or parametric) integrable systems of nonlinear partial differential equations are used. We find and analyze certain families of deformed regular BHs containing an off-diagonal de Sitter condensate encoding solitonic vacuum configurations, with possible deformations of horizons and/or gravitational polarizations of constants. We emphasize that general off-diagonal solutions do not involve certain hypersurface or holographic configurations. This means that the Bekenstein-Hawking thermodynamic paradigm is not applicable for characterizing the physical properties of such target regular solutions. We argue that the concept of G. Perelman's entropy and relativistic geometric flow thermodynamics is more appropriate. Using nonlinear symmetries involving effective cosmological constants, we show how to compute thermodynamic variables for various classes of physically essential solutions in GR.</description>

      <title>Mapping between Spin-Glass Three-Dimensional (3D) Ising Model and Boolean Satisfiability Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The common feature for a nontrivial hard problem is the existence of nontrivial topological structures, non-planarity graphs, nonlocalities, or long-range spin entanglements in a model system with randomness. For instance, the Boolean satisfiability (K-SAT) problems are nontrivial, due to the existence of non-planarity graphs, nonlocalities, and the randomness. In this work, the relation between a spin-glass three-dimensional (3D) Ising model with the lattice size N = mnl and the K-SAT problems is investigated in detail. With the Clifford algebra representation, it is easy to reveal the existence of the long-range entanglements between Ising spins in the spin-glass 3D Ising lattice. The internal factors in the transfer matrices of the spin-glass 3D Ising model lead to the nontrivial topological structures and the nonlocalities. At first, we prove that the absolute minimum core (AMC) model exists in the spin-glass 3D Ising model, which is defined as a spin-glass 2D Ising model interacting with its nearest neighboring plane. Any algorithms, which use any approximations and/or break the long-range spin entanglements of the AMC model, cannot result in the exact solution of the spin-glass 3D Ising model. Second, we prove that the dual transformation between the spin-glass 3D Ising model and the spin-glass 3D Z2 lattice gauge model shows that it can be mapped to a K-SAT problem for K &gt; = 4 also in the consideration of random interactions and frustrations. Third, we prove that the AMC model is equivalent to the K-SAT problem for K = 3.</description>

      <title>Time-like Extra Dimensions: Quantum Nonlocality, Spin, and Tsirelson Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $E_8 \otimes E_8$ octonionic theory of unification suggests that our universe is six-dimensional and that the two extra dimensions are time-like. These time-like extra dimensions, in principle, offer an explanation of the quantum nonlocality puzzle, also known as the EPR paradox. Quantum systems access all six dimensions, whereas classical systems such as detectors experience only four dimensions. Therefore, correlated quantum events that are time-like separated in 6D can appear to be space-like separated and, hence, nonlocal, when projected to 4D. Our lack of awareness of the extra time-like dimensions creates the illusion of nonlocality, whereas, in reality, the communication obeys special relativity and is local. Bell inequalities continue to be violated because quantum correlations continue to hold. In principle, this idea can be tested experimentally. We develop our analysis after first constructing the Dirac equation in 6D using quaternions and using the equation to derive spin matrices in 6D and then in 4D. We also show that the Tsirelson bound of the CHSH inequality can in principle be violated in 6D.</description>

      <title>Universal Entanglement and an Information-Complete Quantum Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.13457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most challenging problem of modern physics is how to reconcile quantum theory and general relativity, namely, to find a consistent quantum theory in which gravity is quantized. This Progress Report focuses on such a tentative theory called the information-complete quantum theory (ICQT), in which (1) spacetime (gravity) as a physical quantum system plays a central role for formulating the theory, and (2) there are no any classical systems and concepts. Here universal spacetime-matter entanglement "glues" spacetime and matter (matter fermions and their gauge fields) as an indivisible trinity, encodes information-complete physical predictions of the world, and is as universal as universal gravitation. After summarizing the basic theoretic structure of the ICQT, conceptual advances achieved so far and some new issues within the ICQT are considered. While such a theory integrating quantum gravity is of fundamental interest to a wider audience, its relevance to quantum information technologies is discussed, with emphasis on its potential impacts on quantum computing and quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Simple and accurate complete elliptic integrals for the full range of modulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complete elliptic integral of the first and second kind, K(k) and E(k), appear in a multitude of physics and engineering applications. Because there is no known closed-form, the exact values have to be computed numerically. Here, approximations for the integrals are proposed based on their asymptotic behaviors. An inverse of K is also presented. As a result, the proposed K(k) and E(k) reproduce the exact analytical forms both in the zero and asymptotic limits, while in the mid-range of modulus maintain average error of 0.06% and 0.01% respectively. The key finding is the ability to compute the integrals with exceptional accuracy on both limits of elliptical conditions. An accuracy of 1 in 1,000 should be sufficient for practical or prototyping engineering and architecture designs. The simplicity should facilitate discussions of advanced physics topics in introductory physics classes, and enable broader collaborations among researchers from other fields of expertise. For example, the phase space of energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum using only elementary functions is discussed. The proposed inverse of K is shown to be Never Failing Newton Initialization and is an important step for the computation of the exact inverse.</description>
