      <title>Electron Spectroscopy using Transition-Edge Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-edge sensors (TESs) have the potential to perform electron spectroscopic measurements with far greater measurement rates and efficiencies than can be achieved using existing electron spectrometers. Existing spectrometers filter electrons by energy before detecting a narrow energy band at a time, discarding the vast majority of electrons available for measurement. In contrast, transition-edge sensors (TES) have intrinsic energy sensitivity and so do not require prior filtering to perform energy-resolved measurements. Despite this fundamental advantage, TES electron spectroscopy has not, to our knowledge, previously been reported in the literature. We present the results of a set of proof-of-principle experiments demonstrating TES electron spectroscopy experiments using Mo/Au TESs repurposed for electron calorimetry. Using these detectors, we successfully measured the electron spectrum generated by an electron beam striking a graphite target with energies between 750 and 2000 eV, at a noise-limited energy resolution of 4 eV. Based on the findings of these experiments, we suggest improvements that could be made to TES design to enhance their electron detection capabilities through the use of of a dedicated electron absorber in the device with integrated electron optics.</description>

      <title>Improved Modelling of Detector Response Effects in Phonon-based Crystal Detectors used for Dark Matter Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various dark matter search experiments employ phonon-based crystal detectors operated at cryogenic temperatures. Some of these detectors, including certain silicon detectors used by the SuperCDMS collaboration, are able to achieve single-charge sensitivity when a voltage bias is applied across the detector. The total amount of phonon energy measured by such a detector is proportional to the number of electron-hole pairs created by the interaction. However, crystal impurities and surface effects can cause propagating charges to either become trapped inside the crystal or create additional unpaired charges, producing non-quantized measured energy as a result. A new analytical model for describing these detector response effects in phonon-based crystal detectors is presented. This model improves upon previous versions by demonstrating how the detector response, and thus the measured energy spectrum, is expected to differ depending on the source of events. We use this model to extract detector response parameters for SuperCDMS HVeV detectors, and illustrate how this robust modelling can help statistically discriminate between sources of events in order to improve the sensitivity of dark matter search experiments.</description>

      <title>Optical-coherence-tomography-based deep-learning scatterer-density estimator using physically accurate noise model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a deep-learning-based scatterer density estimator (SDE) that processes local speckle patterns of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and estimates the scatterer density behind each speckle pattern. The SDE is trained using large quantities of numerically simulated OCT images and their associated scatterer densities. The numerical simulation uses a noise model that incorporates the spatial properties of three types of noise, i.e., shot noise, relative-intensity noise, and non-optical noise. The SDE's performance was evaluated numerically and experimentally using two types of scattering phantom and in vitro tumor spheroids. The results confirmed that the SDE estimates scatterer densities accurately. The estimation accuracy improved significantly when compared with our previous deep-learning-based SDE, which was trained using numerical speckle patterns generated from a noise model that did not account for the spatial properties of noise.</description>

      <title>A clear case for dust obscuration of the lunar retroreflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The passive retroreflector arrays placed on the moon by Apollo 11, 14 and 15 astronauts continue to produce valuable Earth-Moon range measurements that enable high-precision tests of gravitational physics, as well as studies of geo- and selenophysics. The optical throughput of these retroreflectors has declined since their deployment, with an additional signal loss at full moon when the reflectors experience direct solar illumination. We show that the loss in return rate can be attributed to the accumulation of a thin layer of lunar dust on the surfaces of the corner cube retroreflectors. First, a careful analysis of the optical link budget for the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO) experiment reveals that the lunar return rate is 15--20 times smaller than predicted, a deficit that can be explained by a reflector dust covering fraction of ${\sim} 50$\%. Second, range measurements taken during a lunar eclipse indicate that the solar illumination of the retroreflectors degrades their throughput by an additional factor of ${\sim}15$. Finally, a numerical simulation of heat transfer in dust-coated reflectors is able to model the resulting thermal lensing effect, in which thermal gradients in the retroreflectors degrade their far-field diffraction pattern. A comparison of this simulation to eclipse measurements finds a dust coverage fraction of ${\sim}50$%. Taken together, the link analysis, eclipse observations and thermal modeling support the claim that the retroreflectors are obscured by lunar dust, with both link budget and simulation independently finding the dust fraction to be $\sim$50%.</description>

      <title>Long-Distance Signal Propagation in AC-LGAD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the signal propagation in AC-LGAD (aka RSD), which are LGAD with a common N+ layer and segmented AC-coupled readout contacts, by measuring response to IR laser TCT on a large selection of AC-LGAD with strip readout. The interest for this topic derives from the realization that while large charge sharing between neighboring strips is essential for good position resolution, large sharing beyond the next neighbor generates background signals which in general are detrimental to the sensor goal of low occupancy. Using AC-LGAD with strip readout produced by Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK), we evaluate the effects of a variety of sensor properties, including geometrical parameters (strip length, width), process parameters like the N+ layer resistivity, the coupling capacitance, and the thickness of the bulk on the signal sharing and the position resolution.</description>

      <title>First-principle event reconstruction by time-charge readouts for the Taishan Antineutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) is a liquid-scintillator satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to measure the reference reactor neutrino spectrum with sub-percent energy resolution. We use inhomogeous Poisson process and Tweedie generalized linear model (GLM) to calibrate the detector response and the charge distribution of a SiPM. We develop a pure probabilistic method using time and charge of SiPMs from first principles to reconstruct point-like events in the TAO central detector. Thanks to our precise model and the high photo-coverage and quantum efficiency of the SiPM tiles at TAO, we achieve a vertex position resolution better than 16 mm and an energy resolution of about 2% at 1 MeV, marking the world's best performance of liquid scintillator detectors. Our methodology is applicable to other experiments that utilize PMTs for time and charge readouts.</description>

      <title>Aerosol Jet Printing of High-Temperature Multimodal Sensors for Strain and Temperature Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating multiple sensing capabilities into a single multimodal sensor greatly enhances its applications for in-situ sensing and structural health monitoring. However, the fabrication of multimodal sensors is complicated and limited by the available materials and existing manufacturing methods that often involve complex and expensive fabrication processes. In this study, a high-temperature multimodal sensor is demonstrated by aerosol jet printing of gold and ITO nanoparticle inks. The printed multimodal sensor for concurrent strain and temperature sensing possesses a high gauge factor of 2.54 and thermopower of 55.64 V/{\deg}C combined with excellent high-temperature thermal stability up to 540 {\deg}C. Compared to traditional single-modality sensors, the printed multimodal sensor significantly increases sensing capacity and improves spatial resolution using microscale printed patterns. The study also demonstrates that the strain sensor with integrated thermocouple enables in-situ compensation of the temperature effect on strain sensing, significantly improving strain measurement accuracy at high temperatures. By combining aerosol jet printing with nanomaterial inks, a wide range of multifunctional devices can be developed for a broad range of emerging applications.</description>

      <title>Anodization-free fabrication process for high-quality cross-type Josephson tunnel junctions based on a Nb/Al-AlO$_x$/Nb trilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson tunnel junctions form the basis for various superconducting electronic devices. For this reason, enormous efforts are routinely taken to establish and later on maintain a scalable and reproducible wafer-scale manufacturing process for high-quality Josephson junctions. Here, we present an anodization-free fabrication process for Nb/Al-AlO$_x$/Nb cross-type Josephson junctions that requires only a small number of process steps and that is intrinsically compatible with wafer-scale fabrication. We show that the fabricated junctions are of very high-quality and, compared to other junction types, exhibit not only a significantly reduced capacitance but also an almost rectangular critical current density profile. Our process hence enables the usage of low capacitance Josephson junctions for superconducting electronic devices such as ultra-low noise dc-SQUIDs, microwave SQUID multiplexers based on non-hysteretic rf-SQUIDs and RFSQ circuits.</description>

      <title>Heterodyne dispersive cavity ring-down spectroscopy exploiting eigenmode frequencies for high-fidelity measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring low light absorption with combined uncertainty &lt; 1 permille is crucial in a wide range of applications. Popular cavity ring-down spectroscopy can provide ultra-high precision, below 0.01 permille, but its accuracy is strongly dependent on the measurement capabilities of the detection system and typically is about 10 permille. Here, we exploit the optical frequency information carried by the ring-down cavity electromagnetic field, not explored in conventional CRDS, for high-fidelity spectroscopy. Instead of measuring only the decaying light intensity, we perform heterodyne detection of ring-downs followed by Fourier analysis to provide exact frequencies of optical cavity modes and a dispersive spectrum of a gas sample from them. This approach is insensitive to inaccuracies in light intensity measurements and eliminates the problem of detector band nonlinearity, the main cause of measurement error in traditional CRDS. Using the CO and HD line intensities as examples, we demonstrate the sub-permille accuracy of our method, confirmed by the best ab initio results, and the long-term repeatability of our dispersion measurements at 10^(-4) level. Such results have not been achieved in optical spectroscopy before. The high accuracy of the presented method indicates its potential in atmospheric studies, isotope ratio metrology, thermometry, and the establishment of primary gas standards.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Three-Dimensional Imaging of Integrated Circuits using a Scanning Electron Microscope and Transition-Edge Sensor Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray nanotomography is a powerful tool for the characterization of nanoscale materials and structures, but is difficult to implement due to competing requirements on X-ray flux and spot size. Due to this constraint, state-of-the-art nanotomography is predominantly performed at large synchrotron facilities. We present a laboratory-scale nanotomography instrument that achieves nanoscale spatial resolution while changing the limitations of conventional tomography tools. The instrument combines the electron beam of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with the precise, broadband X-ray detection of a superconducting transition-edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeter. The electron beam generates a highly focused X-ray spot in a metal target held micrometers away from the sample of interest, while the TES spectrometer isolates target photons with high signal-to-noise. This combination of a focused X-ray spot, energy-resolved X-ray detection, and unique system geometry enable nanoscale, element-specific X-ray imaging in a compact footprint. The proof-of-concept for this approach to X-ray nanotomography is demonstrated by imaging 160 nm features in three dimensions in 6 layers of a Cu-SiO2 integrated circuit, and a path towards finer resolution and enhanced imaging capabilities is discussed.</description>

      <title>Classical and Bayesian statistical methods for low-level metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This document presents the statistical methods used to process low-level measurements in the presence of noise. These methods can be classical or Bayesian. The question is placed in the general framework of the problem of nuisance parameters, one of the canonical problems of statistical inference. By using a simple criterion proposed by Bolstad (2007), it is possible to define statistically significant results during a measurement process (act of measuring in the vocabulary of metrology). This result is similar for a classic paradigm (called ``frequentist'') or Bayesian: the presence of zero in the interval considered (confidence or credibility). It is shown that in the case of homoskedastic Gaussians, the commonly used results are found. The case of Poisson distributions is then considered. In the case of heteroscedastic Gaussians, which is that of radioactivity measurement, we can consider them as Poisson laws in the limit of large counts. The results are different from those commonly used, and in particular those from standards (ISO 11929). Their statistical performances, characterized by simulation, are better and are well verified experimentally. This is confirmed theoretically by the use of the Neyman-Pearson lemma which makes it possible to formally determine the statistical tests with the best performances. These results also make it possible to understand the paradox of the possible divergence of the detection limit. It is also formally shown that the confidence intervals thus calculated by getting rid of the nuisance parameter according to established methods result in the commonly used confidence interval. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first formal derivation of these confidence intervals.This method is based on keeping the measurement results whether they are significant or not (not censoring them). This is recommended in several standards or documents, is compatible with the ISO 11929 standard and is in line with recent proposals in the field of statistics. On the other hand, all the information necessary to determine whether a measurement result is significant or not remains available. The conservation and restitution of all results is currently applied in the USA. The textbook case of the WIPP incident makes it possible to ensure favorable public perception.The implications and applications of this method in different fields are finally discussed.</description>

      <title>Considerations on time resolution of neutron irradiated single pixel 3D structures at fuences up to $10^{17}$ n$_{eq}$/cm$^{2}$ using 120 GeV SPS pion beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proven radiation hardness of silicon 3D devices up to fluences of $1 {\times} 10^{17}$ $n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ makes them an excellent choice for next generation trackers, providing &lt; 10 ${\mu}m$ position resolution at a high multiplicity environment. The anticipated pile-up increase at HL-LHC conditions and beyond, requires the addition of &lt; 50 ps per hit timing information to successfully resolve displaced and primary vertices. In this study, the timing performance, uniformity and efficiency of neutron and proton irradiated single pixel 3D devices is discussed. Fluences up to $1 {\times} 10^{17}$ $n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ in three different geometrical implementations are evaluated using 120 GeV SPS pion beams. A MIMOSA-26 type telescope is used to provide detailed tracking information with a ~ 5 ${\mu}m$ position resolution. Productions with single- and double-sided processes, yielding active thicknesses of 130 and 230 ${\mu}m$ respectively, are examined with varied pixel sizes from $55 {\times} 55$ ${\mu}m^{2}$ to $25 {\times} 100$ ${\mu}m^{2}$ and a comparative study of field uniformity is presented with respect to electrode geometry. The question of electronics bandwidth is extensively addressed with respect to achievable time resolution, efficiency and collected charge, forming a 3D phase space to which an appropriate operating point can be selected depending on the application requirements.</description>

Abstract: We present the study of a fuzzy clustering algorithm for the Belle II electromagnetic calorimeter using Graph Neural Networks. We use a realistic detector simulation including simulated beam backgrounds and focus on the reconstruction of both isolated and overlapping photons. We find significant improvements of the energy resolution compared to the currently used reconstruction algorithm for both isolated and overlapping photons of more than 30% for photons with energies E &lt; 0.5 GeV and high levels of beam backgrounds. Overall, the GNN reconstruction improves the resolution and reduces the tails of the reconstructed energy distribution and therefore is a promising option for the upcoming high luminosity running of Belle II.</description>

      <title>Muon identification using multivariate techniques in the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identification of prompt and isolated muons, as well as muons from heavy-flavour hadron decays, is an important task. We developed two multivariate techniques to provide highly efficient identification for muons with transverse momentum greater than 10 GeV. One provides a continuous variable as an alternative to a cut-based identification selection and offers a better discrimination power against misidentified muons. The other one selects prompt and isolated muons by using isolation requirements to reduce the contamination from nonprompt muons arising in heavy-flavour hadron decays. Both algorithms are developed using 59.7 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions data at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV collected in 2018 with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC.</description>

Abstract: We propose here a set of new methods to directly detect light mass dark matter through its scattering with abundant atmospheric muons or accelerator beams. Firstly, we plan to use the free cosmic-ray muons interacting with dark matter in a volume surrounded by tracking detectors, to trace possible interaction between dark matter and muons. Secondly, we will interface our device with domestic or international muon beams. Due to much larger muon intensity and focused beam, we anticipate the detector can be made further compact and the resulting sensitivity on dark matter searches will be improved. In line with above projects, we will develop muon tomography methods and apply them on atmospheric and environmental sciences, archaeology and civil engineering. Furthermore, we will measure precisely directional distributions of cosmic-ray muons, either at mountain or sea level, and the differences may reveal possible information of dark matter distributed near the earth. In the future, we may also extend our study to muon on target experiments. Specifically, our methods can have advantages over exotic dark matters which are either muon-philic or slowed down due to some mechanism.</description>
