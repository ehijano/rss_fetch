      <title>A General Fixed-Point Theorem for Correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new local condition on correspondences called the "weak local connectedness property" (WLCP) is introduced. Working in ZFC, it is shown in our main theorem that - under mild restrictions - any correspondence from a connected subset X of a real TVS to itself will have a fixed point if the WLCP holds at each point of the domain. Since the WLCP generalizes several well - known conditions on correspondences, it is utilized in this paper to gather together a sampling of several disparate fixed-point and related results that are special cases of our main theorem.</description>

      <title>Interval-valued Value Functions from Uncertain Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of numerical value scales (or priority values) is a recurrent topic in decision-aiding research. However, in real contexts, uncertainty and limited cognitive precision often lead decision-makers to provide interval judgments rather than exact values. In this scenario, even though obtaining a numerical value scale from interval preferences could be feasible, it implies a loss of information and an oversimplification of the input information. This paper proposes a general framework for deriving interval-valued value scales from interval-valued pairwise comparisons. This implies addressing fundamental challenges regarding the elicitation, the determination of representative value functions, and the preservation of properties such as monotonicity and interpretability. We start by presenting a new definition for the consistency of an interval-valued preference relation. We show that when consistency holds, interval-valued value functions can be determined, and we establish conditions for their uniqueness. Furthermore, we show that our proposal extends and unifies classical models such as fuzzy preference relations, Saaty's preference relations, and the Deck of Cards Method. Methodologically, we develop optimization models that provide procedures to guide decision-makers towards consistency when contradictions arise. The framework provides a coherent and interpretable foundation for constructing monotonic interval value functions, bridging classical and interval-valued preference models, and enhancing robustness in decision-making.</description>

      <title>The One-Seventh Area Triangle in the Complex Plane: Proving the Proportionality Using Features of the Complex Number System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores and proves the one-seventh area triangle using a purely algebraic approach as opposed to a geometric one. A triangle set purely in the complex plane is used so that we can utilise features of the complex number system to determine areas. The area of a triangle in determinant form is derived using these features, and a rigorous proof of the one-seventh area triangle follows.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of the Fox H-function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a generalization of the Fox H-function called Fox-Barnes I-function. Like the Fox H-function, it is defined as a contour integral in the complex plane, but instead of an integrand given by a ratio of products of gamma functions involving several parameters, we use a ratio of products of double gamma functions. We study the conditions for its existence and how to choose a contour of integration based on the involved parameters. We discuss how the Fox H-function appears as a particular case and prove some properties of the Fox-Barnes I-function. As an application, we show how the Laplace transform of the Kilbas-Saigo function can be conveniently written in terms of the Fox-Barnes I-function, even in cases where the usual series representation is not convergent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $B$ be Banach algebra and $M$ be topological space. If there exists homeomorphism \[ f:M\rightarrow N \] of topological space $M$ into convex set $N$ of the space $B^n$, then homeomorphism $f$ is called chart of the set $M$. The set $M$ is called simple $B$-manifold of class $C^k$ if for any two charts \[ f_1:M\rightarrow N_1\subseteq B^n \] \[ f_2:M\rightarrow N_2\subseteq B^n \] there exists diffeomorphism \[ f: B^n\rightarrow B^n \] of class $C^k$ such that \[ f_1\circ f=f_2 \] Topological space $M$ is called differential $B$-manifold of class $C^k$ if topological space $M$ is a union of simple $B$-manifolds $M_i$, $i\in I$, and intersection $M_i\cap M_j$ of simple $B$-manifolds $M_i$, $M_j$ is also simple $B$-manifold. Differential $B$-manifold $G$ equipped with group structure such that map \[ (f,g)\rightarrow fg^{-1} \] is differentiable is called Lie group. Module $T_eG$ equipped with product \[ [v,w]^c= R_{Ljm}^c\circ(v^m,w^j) -R_{Lmj}^c\circ(w^j,v^m) \in T_eG \] is Lie algebra $g_L$ of Lie group $G$.</description>

      <title>On admissible pairs of aggregation functions based on quasi-linear means and related families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Admissible orders play a key role in ranking subintervals of the unit interval. In 2013, Bustince et al. proposed constructing such relations by means of admissible pairs of aggregation functions. The only significant example in the literature is a pair of weighted arithmetic means with different weights. In this paper, we present a method for constructing admissible pairs of aggregation functions, which allows us to verify the admissibility of various function classes, including quasi-linear means, Archimedean t-norms (and t-conorms), and certain strictly Schur-convex (or Schur-concave) functions. Furthermore, we examine the relationship between admissible orders generated by admissible pairs of aggregation functions and the ({\alpha}, \b{eta})-order, identifying cases where these two notions do not coincide.</description>

      <title>On higher order Horadam 3-parameter generalized quaternions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Kulo\u{g}lu {\it et al.} \cite{Kul} introduced the higher order Horadam numbers. In this study, novel 3-parameter generalized quaternion sequences of higher order Horadam numbers, which have not been studied before, are defined by investigating the relationship between generalized quaternions, which are important mathematical objects used in physics and mathematics, and higher order Horadam quaternions, which are extensions of the higher order Horadam numbers to quaternion algebra. Also, the recurrence relations of sequences whose members are higher order Horadam 3-parameter generalized quaternions are described. Furthermore, certain properties of these generalized quaternions are presented, such as the generating and exponential function, summation and Binet formula, and some identities resulting from these quaternions are obtained.</description>

      <title>Centralizers, Clifforders, Polynomial Equivalence and $\omega$-equivalence of Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the study of the centralizer and the clifforder of a matrix over a field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic zero, as well as the quasi-commutative relations between matrices over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$. We introduce several new concepts, including polynomial equivalence, odd polynomial equivalence, $q$-polynomial equivalence, the clifforder of a matrix, balanced matrices, and $\omega$-equivalence. The clifforder of a matrix is defined via an anti-commuting relation. We present a new proof establishing that two matrices $A$ and $B$ share the same centralizer if and only if they are in polynomial equivalence. Moreover, we extend this to a broader generalization. For balanced matrices (including nilpotent matrices), we prove that their clifforders coincide if and only if they are odd polynomial equivalence. In addition, we investigate quasi-commutative relations defined using a primitive $q$-th root of unity $\omega$, provide a new and elementary proof of a classical theorem of H. S. A. Potter, and further explore the properties and connections of $\omega$-equivalence.</description>

      <title>On the Maximal Gap between Primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show some results about the gap between a prime number and its consecutive prime number for large enough prime numbers. We show that the gap between a prime number $p_n$ and its consecutive prime number is not larger than $2\log^2{p_n}$. We also show that the result implies the existence of a prime number in a certain type of interval for large enough numbers as a consequence.</description>
