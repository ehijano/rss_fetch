      <title>Ray Theory of Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to deal with the interaction of an electromagnetic wave with large homogeneous objects of arbitrary shape with smooth surface we develop the ray theory of waves (RTW) which is composed of the vectorial complex ray model (VCRM) and VCRM based singularity theory. By introducing the wavefront curvature as an intrinsic property of rays, VCRM permits to predict the amplitude and the phase of field at any point rigorously in the sense of ray model. Its combination with the singularity theory remedies the discontinuity in the ray model. In this letter, the wavefront equation, key physical law of VCRM describing the relation between the wavefront curvatures of the incident wave and the refracted/reflected wave, is derived for the most general case of three dimension scattering. The strategy of the calculation scheme in RTW is described. Typical applications to the prediction of the rainbow patterns of a spheroidal drop are presented. The comparison to a rigorous numerical method, multilevel fast multipole algorithm, shows that RTW can predict very fast and precisely the scattered field even in the vicinity of caustics.</description>

      <title>Polarization-sensitive PHASR Scanner and calibration technique for accurate mapping of the Stokes vectors in terahertz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, handheld and portable terahertz instruments have been in rapid development for various applications ranging from non-destructive testing to biomedical imaging and sensing. For instance, we have deployed our Portable Handheld Spectral Reflection (PHASR) Scanners for in vivo full-spectroscopic imaging of skin burns in large animal models in operating room settings. In this paper, we debut the polarimetric version of the PHASR Scanner, and describe a generalized calibration technique to map the spatial and spectral dependence of the Jones matrix of an imaging scanner across its field of view. Our design is based on placement of two orthogonal photoconductive antenna (PCA) detectors separated by a polarizing beam splitter in the PHASR Scanner housing. We show that at least three independent measurements of a well-characterized polarimetric calibration target are sufficient to determine the polarization state of the incident beam at the sample location, as well as to extract the Jones propagation matrix from the sample location to the detectors. We have tested the accuracy of our scanner by validating polarimetric measurements obtained from a birefringent crystal rotated to various angles, as compared to the theoretically predicted response of the sample. This new version of our PHASR scanner can be used for high-speed imaging and investigation of heterogeneity of polarization-sensitive samples in the field.</description>

      <title>Dynamic motion trajectory control with nanoradian accuracy for multi-element X-ray optical systems via laser interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The past decades have witnessed the development of new X-ray beam sources with brightness growing at a rate surpassing Moore's law. Current and upcoming diffraction limited and fully coherent X-ray beam sources, including multi-bend achromat based synchrotron sources and high repetition rate X-ray free electron lasers, puts increasingly stringent requirements on stability and accuracy of X-ray optics systems. Parasitic motion errors at sub-micro radian scale in beam transport and beam conditioning optics can lead to significant loss of coherence and brightness delivered from source to experiment. To address this challenge, we incorporated optical metrology based on interferometry and differential wavefront sensing as part of the X-ray optics motion control system. A prototype X-ray optics system was constructed following the optical layout of a tunable X-ray cavity. On-line interferometric metrology enabled dynamical feedback to a motion control system to track and compensate for motion errors. The system achieved sub-microradian scale performance, as multiple optical elements are synchronously and continuously adjusted. This first proof of principle measurement demonstrated both the potential and necessity of incorporating optical metrology as part of the motion control architecture for large scale X-ray optical systems such as monochromators, delay lines, and in particular, X-ray cavity systems to enable the next generation cavity-based X-ray free electron lasers.</description>

      <title>Solvent-Free Silsesquioxane Self-Welding for 3D Printing Multi-Refractive Index Glass Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing interest in 3D printing of silica glass has spurred substantial research efforts. Our prior work utilizing a liquid silica resin (LSR) demonstrated high printing accuracy and resolution. However, the resin's sensitivity to moisture posed limitations, restricting the printing environment. On the other hand, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)-based materials offer excellent water stability and sinterless features. Yet, they suffer from relatively high shrinkage due to the presence of additional organic monomers. In this study, we present a polymeric silsesquioxane (PSQ) resin with reduced shrinkage, enhanced moisture stability, and the retention of sinterless features, providing a promising solution for achieving high-resolution 3D printing of glass objects. Leveraging the two-photon polymerization (2PP) method, we realized nanostructures with feature sizes below 80 nm. Moreover, we demonstrate the tunability of the refractive index by incorporating zirconium moieties into the resin, facilitating the fabrication of glass micro-optics with varying refractive indices. Importantly, the self-welding capability observed between two individual components provides a flexible approach for producing micro-optics with multiple components, each possessing distinct refractive indices. This research represents a significant advancement in the field of advanced glass manufacturing, paving the way for future applications in micro- and nano-scale glass objects.</description>

      <title>CMOS-compatible photonic integrated circuits on thin-film ScAlN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scandium aluminum nitride (ScAlN) has recently emerged as an attractive material for integrated photonics due to its favorable nonlinear optical properties and compatibility with CMOS fabrication. Despite the promising and versatile material properties, it is still an outstanding challenge to realize low-loss photonic circuits on thin-film ScAlN-on-insulator wafers. Here, we present a systematic study on the material quality of sputtered thin-film ScAlN produced in a CMOS-compatible 200 mm line, and an optimized fabrication process to yield 400 nm thick, fully etched waveguides. With surface polishing and annealing, we achieve micro-ring resonators with an intrinsic quality factor as high as $1.47\times 10^5$, corresponding to a propagation loss of 2.4 dB/cm. These results serve as a critical step towards developing future large-scale, low-loss photonic integrated circuits based on ScAlN.</description>

      <title>Bessel-beam direct-write of the etch-mask in a nano-film of alumina for high-efficiency Si solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large surface area applications such as high-efficiency &gt; 26% solar cells require surface patterning with 1-10 micrometers periodic patterns at high fidelity over 1-10 cm^2 areas (before up scaling to 1 m^2) to perform at, or exceed, the Lambertian (ray optics) limit of light trapping. Here we show a pathway to high-resolution sub-1 micrometer etch mask patterning by ablation using direct femtosecond laser writing performed at room conditions (without the need for a vacuum-based lithography approach). A Bessel beam was used to alleviate the required high surface tracking tolerance for ablation of 0.3-0.8 micrometer diameter holes in ~40 nm alumina Al2O3-mask at high writing speed, 7.5 cm/s; a patterning rate 1 cm^2 per 20 min. The plasma etching protocol was optimised for a zero-mesa formation of photonic crystal (PhC) trapping structures and smooth surfaces at the nanoscale level. Scaling up in area and throughput of the demonstrated approach is outlined.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Nonlinear Metasurfaces for Sum Frequency Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sum frequency generation (SFG) has multiple applications, from optical sources to imaging, where efficient conversion requires either long interaction distances or large field concentrations in a quadratic nonlinear material. Metasurfaces provide an essential avenue to enhanced SFG due to resonance with extreme field enhancements with an integrated ultrathin platform. In this work, we formulate a general theoretical framework for multi-objective topology optimization of nanopatterned metasurfaces that facilitate high-efficiency SFG and simultaneously select the emitted direction and tailor the metasurface polarization response. Based on this framework, we present novel metasurface designs showcasing ultimate flexibility in transforming the outgoing nonlinearly generated light for applications spanning from imaging to polarimetry. For example, one of our metasurfaces produces highly polarized and directional SFG emission with an efficiency of over 0.2 cm^2/GW in a 10 nm signal operating bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Optical Bias and Cryogenic Laser Readout of a Multipixel Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryogenic opto-electronic interconnects are gaining increasing interest as a means to control and read out cryogenic electronic components. The challenge is to achieve sufficient signal integrity with low heat load processing. In this context, we demonstrate the opto-electronic bias and readout of a commercial four-pixel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector array using a cryogenic photodiode and laser. We show that this approach has a similar system detection efficiency to a conventional bias. Furthermore, multi-pixel detection events are faithfully converted between the optical and electrical domain, which allows reliable extraction of amplitude multiplexed photon statistics. Our device has a passive heat dissipation of 2.6mW, maintains the signal rise time of 3ns, and operates in free-running (self-resetting) mode at a repetition rate of 600kHz. This demonstrates the potential of high-bandwidth, low noise, and low heat load opto-electronic interconnects for scalable cryogenic signal processing and transmission.</description>

      <title>Picotesla-sensitivity microcavity optomechanical magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity optomechanical systems have enabled precision sensing of magnetic fields, by leveraging the optical resonance-enhanced readout and mechanical resonance-enhanced response. Previous studies have successfully achieved scalable and reproducible microcavity optomechanical magnetometry (MCOM) by incorporating Terfenol-D thin films into high-quality ($Q$) factor whispering gallery mode (WGM) microcavities. However, the sensitivity was limited to 585 pT/Hz$^{1/2}$, over 20 times inferior to those using Terfenol-D particles. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a high-sensitivity and scalable MCOM approach by sputtering a FeGaB thin film onto a high-$Q$ SiO$_2$ WGM microdisk. Theoretical studies are conducted to explore the magnetic actuation constant and noise-limited sensitivity by varying the parameters of the FeGaB film and SiO$_2$ microdisk. Multiple magnetometers with different radii are fabricated and characterized. By utilizing a microdisk with a radius of 355 $\mu$m and a thickness of 1 $\mu$m, along with a FeGaB film with a radius of 330 $\mu$m and a thickness of 1.3 $\mu$m, we have achieved a remarkable peak sensitivity of 1.68 pT/Hz$^{1/2}$ at 9.52 MHz. This represents a significant improvement of over two orders of magnitude compared with previous studies employing sputtered Terfenol-D film. Notably, the magnetometer operates without a bias magnetic field, thanks to the remarkable soft magnetic properties of the FeGaB film. Furthermore, as a proof-of-concept, we have demonstrated the real-time measurement of a pulsed magnetic field simulating the corona current in a high-voltage transmission line using our developed magnetometer. These high-sensitivity magnetometers hold great potential for various applications, such as magnetic induction tomography and corona current monitoring.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Processing and Reconstruction of Compromised Biophotonic Image Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of deep learning techniques with biophotonic setups has opened new horizons in bioimaging. A compelling trend in this field involves deliberately compromising certain measurement metrics to engineer better bioimaging tools in terms of cost, speed, and form-factor, followed by compensating for the resulting defects through the utilization of deep learning models trained on a large amount of ideal, superior or alternative data. This strategic approach has found increasing popularity due to its potential to enhance various aspects of biophotonic imaging. One of the primary motivations for employing this strategy is the pursuit of higher temporal resolution or increased imaging speed, critical for capturing fine dynamic biological processes. This approach also offers the prospect of simplifying hardware requirements/complexities, thereby making advanced imaging standards more accessible in terms of cost and/or size. This article provides an in-depth review of the diverse measurement aspects that researchers intentionally impair in their biophotonic setups, including the point spread function, signal-to-noise ratio, sampling density, and pixel resolution. By deliberately compromising these metrics, researchers aim to not only recuperate them through the application of deep learning networks, but also bolster in return other crucial parameters, such as the field-of-view, depth-of-field, and space-bandwidth product. Here, we discuss various biophotonic methods that have successfully employed this strategic approach. These techniques span broad applications and showcase the versatility and effectiveness of deep learning in the context of compromised biophotonic data. Finally, by offering our perspectives on the future possibilities of this rapidly evolving concept, we hope to motivate our readers to explore novel ways of balancing hardware compromises with compensation via AI.</description>

      <title>Versatile, fast and accurate frequency excursions with a semiconductor laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving accurate arbitrary frequency excursions with a laser can be quite a technical challenge, especially when steep slopes (GHz/$\mu$s) are required, due to both deterministic and stochastic frequency fluctuations. In this work we present a multi-stage correction combining four techniques: pre-distorsion of the laser modulation, iterative correction, opto-electronic feedback loop and feed-forward correction. This combination allows not only to compensate for the non-instantaneous response of the laser to an input modulation, but also to correct in real time the stochastic frequency fluctuations. We implement this multi-stage architecture on a commercial DBR laser and verify its efficiency, first with monochromatic operation and second with highly demanding frequency excursions. We demonstrate that our multi-stage correction not only enables a strong reduction of the laser linewidth, but also allows steep frequency excursions with non-linearities well below 1%, and a laser spectral purity consistently better than $100$ kHz even in the midst of GHz-scale frequency excursions.</description>

      <title>Dual-sided transparent display</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, display technology has been reimagined to meet the needs of the virtual world. By mapping information onto a scene through a transparent display, users can simultaneously visualize both the real world and layers of virtual elements. However, advances in augmented reality (AR) technology have primarily focused on wearable gear or personal devices. Here we present a single display capable of delivering visual information to observers positioned on either side of the transparent device. This dual-sided display system employs a polymer stabilized liquid crystal waveguide technology to achieve a transparency window of 65% while offering active-matrix control. An early-stage prototype exhibits full-color information via time-sequential processing of a red-green-blue (RGB) light-emitting diode (LED) strip. The dual-sided display provides a perspective on transparent mediums as display devices for human-centric and service-related experiences that can support both enhanced bi-directional user interactions and new media platforms.</description>

      <title>A quantum picture of light-suppressed photosynthetic charge transfer: Photo-blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a dynamic mechanism for the reversible regulation of photochemistry in plants under varying light environments. We employ a three-level quantum model to take into account the correlations between charge donors and charge acceptors immediately before photoexcitation, and show that under steady and coherent driving of light, the efficiency of charge transfer is inversely proportional to the intensity of incident light, which can be suppressed so severely that it becomes a limiting factor on photosynthetic electron transport. These results are analyzed to gain insight in the light responses of photosynthetic parameters. We discuss the implications of thermal fluctuation in the light source used in photochemical experiments, and argue that in high light conditions, the quantum yields measured with an incandescent lamp may be higher than those measured with a laser, a manifestation of thermal fluctuation in lamp illumination. Our new picture renders a consistent interpretation of a wide range of experiments, including plastocyanin-dependent electron transport in photosystem I, biphasic redox kinetics of P700 and wavelength-dependent quantum yields, and provides a donor-side scheme for the onset of irreversible damage to photosystem II.</description>

      <title>Electricity at the macroscale and its microscopic origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I define the fields that describe electrical macrostructure, and their rates of change, in terms of the microscopic charge density, electric field, electric potential, and their rates of change. To deduce these definitions, I lay some foundations of a general theory of structure homogenization, meaning a theory of how any observable macroscopic field is related to spatial averages of its microscopic counterpart.
  I apply homogenization theory to the fields that appear in the vacuum theory of electromagnetism and deduce that the relationships between macroscopic fields are identical in form to the relationships between their microscopic counterparts. Without invoking quantum mechanics, I derive the expressions for polarization current established by the Modern Theory of Polarization. I prove that the bulk-average electric potential, or mean inner potential, vanishes in a macroscopically-uniform charge-neutral material, and I show that when a crystal lattice lacks inversion symmetry, it does not imply the existence of macroscopic $\vec{E}$ or $\vec{P}$ fields in the crystal's bulk.
  I point out that symmetry is scale-dependent. Therefore, if anisotropy of the microstructure does not manifest as anisotropy of the macrostructure, it cannot be the origin of a macroscopic vector field. The macroscopic charge density is isotropic in the bulks of most materials, because it vanishes at every point. Therefore, regardless of the microstructure, a macroscopic electric field cannot emanate from the bulk. I find that all relationships between observable macroscopic fields can be expressed mathematically without introducing the polarization ($\vec{P}$) and electric displacement ($\vec{D}$) fields, neither of which is observable.

      <title>Unconditional verification of quantum computation with classical light</title>

Abstract: Verification of quantum computation is a task to efficiently check whether an output given from a quantum computer is correct. Existing verification protocols conducted between a quantum computer to be verified and a verifier necessitate quantum communication to unconditionally detect any malicious behavior of the quantum computer solving any promise problem in ${\sf BQP}$. In this paper, we remove the necessity of the communication of qubits by proposing a "physically-classical" verification protocol in which the verifier just sends coherent light to the quantum computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a Bose--Einstein Condensate illuminated by a far off-resonant optical pump field and its retroreflection from a feedback mirror can produce stable, localised structures known as optomechanical droplets. We show that these droplets could be used to measure the acceleration of a BEC via continuous monitoring of the position of the droplet via the optical intensity distribution.</description>

Abstract: Here we show photon pair generation from ring resonator and waveguide structures in a hybrid silicon-BTO on insulator platform with a pulsed pump. Our analysis of single photon and coincidence generation rates show that Spontaneous Four-Wave Mixing is comparable to that expected from SOI devices of similar characteristics and find a $\gamma_{eff}$ of (14.7 $\pm$ 1.3) and (2.0 $\pm$ 0.3) MHz/mW$^{2}$ for ring resonator and waveguide structures respectively.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Virtual Gain and Large Tuning of Particles' Scattering by Complex-Frequency Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active tuning of the scattering of particles and metasurfaces is a highly sought-after property for a host of electromagnetic and photonic applications, but it normally requires challenging-to-control tunable (reconfigurable) or active (gain) media. Here, we introduce the concepts of anisotropic virtual gain and oblique Kerker effect, where a completely lossy anisotropic medium behaves exactly as its anisotropic gain counterpart upon excitation by a synthetic complex-frequency wave. The strategy allows one to largely tune the magnitude and angle of a particle's scattering simply by changing the shape (envelope) of the incoming radiation, rather than by an involved medium-tuning mechanism. The so-attained anisotropic virtual gain enables directional super-scattering at an oblique direction with fine-management of the scattering angle. Our study, opening a unique light-management method, is based on analytical techniques that allow multipolar decomposition of the scattered field, and is found, throughout, to be in excellent agreement with full-wave simulations.</description>

      <title>Fast single pixel modal wavefront sensing using neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic wavefront aberrations negatively impact a wide range of optical applications including astronomy, optical free-space telecommunications and bio-imaging. Wavefront errors can be compensated by an adaptive optics system comprised of a deformable mirror and wavefront sensor connected by a control loop. For satellite optical communications (SatCom), wavefront sensing is particularly challenging due to the rapid wavefront fluctuations induced by strong turbulence and movement of the transmitting satellite across the sky. Existing wavefront sensing techniques require fast cameras (&gt;kHz) that are not widely available at wavelengths suitable for SatCom (e.g., 1550nm and mid-to-long wave infrared). Here, we propose a new wavefront sensing technique that uses a single photodiode and a fast mirror to make phase-diverse intensity measurements of the incoming wavefront. We train neural networks to accurately estimate the input phase given this phase-diverse sub-millisecond intensity trace. Our simulations show that our technique is robust in cases of strong turbulence where previous modal wavefront sensors fail due to modal crosstalk, achieving 99% of the optimal Strehl ratio from a 50-mode correction at a sensing rate of 2kHz. We explore typical cases of turbulence magnitude, sensing speed and noise that might be encountered by such a system.</description>

      <title>Theory of the linewidth-power product of photonic-crystal surface-emitting lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general theory for the intrinsic (Lorentzian) linewidth of photonic-crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSELs) is presented. The effect of spontaneous emission is modeled by a classical Langevin force entering the equation for the slowly varying waves. The solution of the coupled-wave equations, describing the propagation of four basic waves within the plane of the photonic crystal, is expanded in terms of the solutions of the associated spectral problem, i.e. the laser modes. Expressions are given for photon number, rate of spontaneous emission into the laser mode, Petermann factor and effective Henry factor entering the general formula for the linewidth. The theoretical framework is applied to the calculation of the linewidth-power product of air-hole and all-semiconductor PCSELs. For output powers in the Watt range, intrinsic linewidths of a few tens of Hertz are predicted if stable single mode operation is ensured</description>

      <title>Activating non-Hermitian skin modes by parity-time symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry is a cornerstone of non-Hermitian physics as it ensures real energies for stable experimental realization of non-Hermitian phenomena. In this work, we propose $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry as a paradigm for designing rich families of higher-dimensional non-Hermitian states with unique bulk, surface, hinge or corner dynamics. Through systematically breaking or restoring $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry in different sectors of a system, we can selectively activate or manipulate the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in both the bulk and topological boundary states. Some fascinating phenomena include the directional toggling of the NHSE, and the flow of boundary states without chiral or dynamical pumping, developed from selective boundary NHSE. Our results extend richly into 3D or higher, with more sophisticated interplay with selective bulk and boundary NHSE and charge-parity ($\mathcal{CP}$) symmetry. Based on non-interacting lattices, $\mathcal{PT}$-activated NHSEs can be observed in various optical, photonic, electric and quantum platforms that admit gain/loss and non-reciprocity.</description>

      <title>QuATON: Quantization Aware Training of Optical Neurons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical processors, built with "optical neurons", can efficiently perform high-dimensional linear operations at the speed of light. Thus they are a promising avenue to accelerate large-scale linear computations. With the current advances in micro-fabrication, such optical processors can now be 3D fabricated, but with a limited precision. This limitation translates to quantization of learnable parameters in optical neurons, and should be handled during the design of the optical processor in order to avoid a model mismatch. Specifically, optical neurons should be trained or designed within the physical-constraints at a predefined quantized precision level. To address this critical issues we propose a physics-informed quantization-aware training framework. Our approach accounts for physical constraints during the training process, leading to robust designs. We demonstrate that our approach can design state of the art optical processors using diffractive networks for multiple physics based tasks despite quantized learnable parameters. We thus lay the foundation upon which improved optical processors may be 3D fabricated in the future.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Laser-induced Transient Bubble Dynamics within Microchannels</title>

Abstract: Oscillatory flow in confined spaces is central to understanding physiological flows and rational design of synthetic periodic-actuation based micromachines. Using theory and experiments on oscillating flows generated through a laser-induced cavitation bubble, we associate the dynamic bubble size (fluid velocity) and bubble lifetime to the laser energy supplied - a control parameter in experiments. Employing different channel cross-section shapes, sizes and lengths, we demonstrate the characteristic scales for velocity, time and energy to depend solely on the channel geometry. Contrary to the generally assumed absence of instability in low Reynolds number flows (&lt;1000), we report a momentary flow distortion that originates due to the boundary layer separation near channel walls during flow deceleration. The emergence of distorted laminar states is characterized using two stages. First the conditions for the onset of instabilities is analyzed using the Reynolds number and Womersley number for oscillating flows. Second the growth and the ability of an instability to prevail is analyzed using the convective time scale of the flow. Our findings inform rational design of microsystems leveraging pulsatile flows via cavitation-powered microactuation.</description>

Abstract: Optical scattering force is used to reduce the loading time of single atoms to a cavity mode. Releasing a cold atomic ensemble above the resonator, we apply a push beam along the direction of gravity, offering fast atomic transport with narrow velocity distribution. We also observe in real time that, when the push beam is illuminated against gravity, single atoms slow down and even turn around in the mode, through the cavity-transmission measurement. Our method can be employed to make atom-cavity experiments more efficient.</description>

      <title>Topology reconstruction for asymmetric systems by isomorphic mapping or perturbation approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The systems without symmetries, e.g. the internal or spatial symmetry, are generally thought to be improper for topological study and no conventional integral topological invariant can be well defined. In this work, with multi-band asymmetric Rice-Mele-like systems as examples, we show that the topology of all gaps can be reconstructed by two general methods and a new integral topological invariant, i.e. the renormalized real-space winding number, can properly characterise the topology of such systems. For the first method, an isomorphic mapping relationship between a Rice-Mele-like system and its chiral counterpart is constructed, which accounts for the topology reconstruction at half-filling gaps. For the second method, the Hilbert space of asymmetric systems could be reduced into degenerate subspaces by perturbation approximation, so that the topology in subspaces accounts for the topology reconstruction at fractional-filling gaps. The perturbation-based topology exhibits extraordinary robustness since it even exists beyond the weak perturbation limit. We also show that both methods can be widely used for other asymmetric systems, e.g. the two-dimensional (2D) Rice-Mele systems and the superconductor systems. At last, for the asymmetric photonic systems, we predict different topological edge states by our topology-reconstruction theory and experimentally observe them in the laboratory, which agree with each other very well. Our findings open a door for investigating new topological phenomena in asymmetric systems by various topological reconstruction methods which should greatly expand the category of topology study.</description>
