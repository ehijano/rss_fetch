      <title>Heterogeneous Image-based Classification Using Distributional Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnostic imaging has gained prominence as potential biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis in a diverse array of disorders including cancer. However, existing methods routinely face challenges arising from various factors such as image heterogeneity. We develop a novel imaging-based distributional data analysis (DDA) approach that incorporates the probability (quantile) distribution of the pixel-level features as covariates. The proposed approach uses a smoothed quantile distribution (via a suitable basis representation) as functional predictors in a scalar-on-functional quantile regression model. Some distinctive features of the proposed approach include the ability to: (i) account for heterogeneity within the image; (ii) incorporate granular information spanning the entire distribution; and (iii) tackle variability in image sizes for unregistered images in cancer applications. Our primary goal is risk prediction in Hepatocellular carcinoma that is achieved via predicting the change in tumor grades at post-diagnostic visits using pre-diagnostic enhancement pattern mapping (EPM) images of the liver. Along the way, the proposed DDA approach is also used for case versus control diagnosis and risk stratification objectives. Our analysis reveals that when coupled with global structural radiomics features derived from the corresponding T1-MRI scans, the proposed smoothed quantile distributions derived from EPM images showed considerable improvements in sensitivity and comparable specificity in contrast to classification based on routinely used summary measures that do not account for image heterogeneity. Given that there are limited predictive modeling approaches based on heterogeneous images in cancer, the proposed method is expected to provide considerable advantages in image-based early detection and risk prediction.</description>

      <title>Test for high-dimensional linear hypothesis of mean vectors via random integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate hypothesis testing for the linear combination of mean vectors across multiple populations through the method of random integration. We have established the asymptotic distributions of the test statistics under both null and alternative hypotheses. Additionally, we provide a theoretical explanation for the special use of our test statistics in situations when the nonzero signal in the linear combination of the true mean vectors is weakly dense. Moreover, Monte-Carlo simulations are presented to evaluate the suggested test against existing high-dimensional tests. The findings from these simulations reveal that our test not only aligns with the performance of other tests in terms of size but also exhibits superior power.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Learning Approach to Multivariate Time Forecasting in Industrial Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial processes generate a massive amount of monitoring data that can be exploited to uncover hidden time losses in the system, leading to enhanced accuracy of maintenance policies and, consequently, increasing the effectiveness of the equipment. In this work, we propose a method for one-step probabilistic multivariate forecasting of time variables based on a Hidden Markov Model with covariates (IO-HMM). These covariates account for the correlation of the predicted variables with their past values and additional process measurements by means of a discrete model and a continuous model. The probabilities of the former are updated using Bayesian principles, while the parameter estimates for the latter are recursively computed through an adaptive algorithm that also admits a Bayesian interpretation. This approach permits the integration of new samples into the estimation of unknown parameters, computationally improving the efficiency of the process. We evaluate the performance of the method using a real data set obtained from a company of a particular sector; however, it is a versatile technique applicable to any other data set. The results show a consistent improvement over a persistence model, which assumes that future values are the same as current values, and more importantly, over univariate versions of our model.</description>

      <title>Fusing Climate Data Products using a Spatially Varying Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoencoders are powerful machine learning models used to compress information from multiple data sources. However, autoencoders, like all artificial neural networks, are often unidentifiable and uninterpretable. This research focuses on creating an identifiable and interpretable autoencoder that can be used to meld and combine climate data products. The proposed autoencoder utilizes a Bayesian statistical framework, allowing for probabilistic interpretations while also varying spatially to capture useful spatial patterns across the various data products. Constraints are placed on the autoencoder as it learns patterns in the data, creating an interpretable consensus that includes the important features from each input. We demonstrate the utility of the autoencoder by combining information from multiple precipitation products in High Mountain Asia.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Bell regression model for fitting of overdispersed count data with application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bell regression model (BRM) is a statistical model that is often used in the analysis of count data that exhibits overdispersion. In this study, we propose a Bayesian analysis of the BRM and offer a new perspective on its application. Specifically, we introduce a G-prior distribution for Bayesian inference in BRM, in addition to a flat-normal prior distribution. To compare the performance of the proposed prior distributions, we conduct a simulation study and demonstrate that the G-prior distribution provides superior estimation results for the BRM. Furthermore, we apply the methodology to real data and compare the BRM to the Poisson regression model using various model selection criteria. Our results provide valuable insights into the use of Bayesian methods for estimation and inference of the BRM and highlight the importance of considering the choice of prior distribution in the analysis of count data.</description>

      <title>A multi-cohort study on prediction of acute brain dysfunction states using selective state space models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing acute brain dysfunction (ABD), including delirium and coma in the intensive care unit (ICU), is a critical challenge due to its prevalence and severe implications for patient outcomes. Current diagnostic methods rely on infrequent clinical observations, which can only determine a patient's ABD status after onset. Our research attempts to solve these problems by harnessing Electronic Health Records (EHR) data to develop automated methods for ABD prediction for patients in the ICU. Existing models solely predict a single state (e.g., either delirium or coma), require at least 24 hours of observation data to make predictions, do not dynamically predict fluctuating ABD conditions during ICU stay (typically a one-time prediction), and use small sample size, proprietary single-hospital datasets. Our research fills these gaps in the existing literature by dynamically predicting delirium, coma, and mortality for 12-hour intervals throughout an ICU stay and validating on two public datasets. Our research also introduces the concept of dynamically predicting critical transitions from non-ABD to ABD and between different ABD states in real time, which could be clinically more informative for the hospital staff. We compared the predictive performance of two state-of-the-art neural network models, the MAMBA selective state space model and the Longformer Transformer model. Using the MAMBA model, we achieved a mean area under the receiving operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.95 on outcome prediction of ABD for 12-hour intervals. The model achieves a mean AUROC of 0.79 when predicting transitions between ABD states. Our study uses a curated dataset from the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital for internal validation and two publicly available datasets, MIMIC-IV and eICU, for external validation, demonstrating robustness across ICU stays from 203 hospitals and 140,945 patients.</description>

      <title>Scalable Spatiotemporal Prediction with Bayesian Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal datasets, which consist of spatially-referenced time series, are ubiquitous in many scientific and business-intelligence applications, such as air pollution monitoring, disease tracking, and cloud-demand forecasting. As modern datasets continue to increase in size and complexity, there is a growing need for new statistical methods that are flexible enough to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics and scalable enough to handle large prediction problems. This work presents the Bayesian Neural Field (BayesNF), a domain-general statistical model for inferring rich probability distributions over a spatiotemporal domain, which can be used for data-analysis tasks including forecasting, interpolation, and variography. BayesNF integrates a novel deep neural network architecture for high-capacity function estimation with hierarchical Bayesian inference for robust uncertainty quantification. By defining the prior through a sequence of smooth differentiable transforms, posterior inference is conducted on large-scale data using variationally learned surrogates trained via stochastic gradient descent. We evaluate BayesNF against prominent statistical and machine-learning baselines, showing considerable improvements on diverse prediction problems from climate and public health datasets that contain tens to hundreds of thousands of measurements. The paper is accompanied with an open-source software package (https://github.com/google/bayesnf) that is easy-to-use and compatible with modern GPU and TPU accelerators on the JAX machine learning platform.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Modeling of Diffusion MRI Signal in Q-space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14188v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes a novel nonparametric model for modeling diffusion MRI signals in q-space. In q-space, diffusion MRI signal is measured for a sequence of magnetic strengths (b-values) and magnetic gradient directions (b-vectors). We propose a Poly-RBF model, which employs a bidirectional framework with polynomial bases to model the signal along the b-value direction and Gaussian radial bases across the b-vectors. The model can accommodate sparse data on b-values and moderately dense data on b-vectors. The utility of Poly-RBF is inspected for two applications: 1) prediction of the dMRI signal, and 2) harmonization of dMRI data collected under different acquisition protocols with different scanners. Our results indicate that the proposed Poly-RBF model can more accurately predict the unmeasured diffusion signal than its competitors such as the Gaussian process model in {\tt Eddy} of FSL. Applying it to harmonizing the diffusion signal can significantly improve the reproducibility of derived white matter microstructure measures.</description>

      <title>Methodological challenges of scenario generation validation: a rear-end crash-causation model for virtual safety assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety assessment of crash and conflict avoidance systems is important for both the automotive industry and other stakeholders. One type of system that needs such an assessment is a driver monitoring system (DMS) with some intervention (e.g., warning or nudging) when the driver looks off-road for too long. Although using computer simulation to assess safety systems is becoming increasingly common, it is not yet commonly used for systems that affect driver behavior, such as DMSs. Models that generate virtual crashes, taking crash-causation mechanisms into account, are needed to assess these systems. However, few such models exist, and those that do have not been thoroughly validated on real-world data. This study aims to address this research gap by validating a rear-end crash-causation model which is based on four crash-causation mechanisms related to driver behavior: a) off-road glances, b) too-short headway, c) not braking with the maximum deceleration possible, and d) sleepiness (not reacting before the crash). The pre-crash kinematics were obtained from the German GIDAS in-depth crash database. Challenges with the validation process were identified and addressed. Most notably, a process was developed to transform the generated crashes to mimic the crash severity distribution in GIDAS. This step was necessary because GIDAS does not include property-damage-only (PDO) crashes, while the generated crashes cover the full range of severities (including low-severity crashes, of which many are PDOs). Our results indicate that the proposed model is a reasonably good crash generator. We further demonstrated that the model is a valid method for assessing DMSs in virtual simulations; it shows the safety impact of shorter "longest" off-road glances. As expected, cutting away long off-road glances substantially reduces the number of crashes that occur and reduces the average delta-v.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian framework for measuring association and its application to emotional dynamics in Web discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Bayesian framework designed to measure the degree of association between categorical random variables. The method is grounded in the formal definition of variable independence and is implemented using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Unlike commonly employed techniques in Association Rule Learning, this approach enables a clear and precise estimation of confidence intervals and the statistical significance of the measured degree of association. We applied the method to non-exclusive emotions identified by annotators in 4,613 tweets written in Portuguese. This analysis revealed pairs of emotions that exhibit associations and mutually opposed pairs. Moreover, the method identifies hierarchical relations between categories, a feature observed in our data, and is utilized to cluster emotions into basic-level groups.</description>

      <title>Exponential family measurement error models for single-cell CRISPR screens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.01879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CRISPR genome engineering and single-cell RNA sequencing have accelerated biological discovery. Single-cell CRISPR screens unite these two technologies, linking genetic perturbations in individual cells to changes in gene expression and illuminating regulatory networks underlying diseases. Despite their promise, single-cell CRISPR screens present substantial statistical challenges. We demonstrate through theoretical and real data analyses that a standard method for estimation and inference in single-cell CRISPR screens -- "thresholded regression" -- exhibits attenuation bias and a bias-variance tradeoff as a function of an intrinsic, challenging-to-select tuning parameter. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce GLM-EIV ("GLM-based errors-in-variables"), a new method for single-cell CRISPR screen analysis. GLM-EIV extends the classical errors-in-variables model to responses and noisy predictors that are exponential family-distributed and potentially impacted by the same set of confounding variables. We develop a computational infrastructure to deploy GLM-EIV across hundreds of processors on clouds (e.g., Microsoft Azure) and high-performance clusters. Leveraging this infrastructure, we apply GLM-EIV to analyze two recent, large-scale, single-cell CRISPR screen datasets, yielding several novel insights.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Variational Autoencoder for Missing Value Imputation in Untargeted Metabolomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Missing data is a common challenge in mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, which can lead to biased and incomplete analyses. The integration of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data with metabolomics data has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the accuracy of data imputation in metabolomics studies. Method: In this study, we propose a novel method that leverages the information from WGS data and reference metabolites to impute unknown metabolites. Our approach utilizes a multi-view variational autoencoder to jointly model the burden score, polygenetic risk score (PGS), and linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruned single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for feature extraction and missing metabolomics data imputation. By learning the latent representations of both omics data, our method can effectively impute missing metabolomics values based on genomic information. Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on empirical metabolomics datasets with missing values and demonstrate its superiority compared to conventional imputation techniques. Using 35 template metabolites derived burden scores, PGS and LD-pruned SNPs, the proposed methods achieved R^2-scores &gt; 0.01 for 71.55% of metabolites. Conclusion: The integration of WGS data in metabolomics imputation not only improves data completeness but also enhances downstream analyses, paving the way for more comprehensive and accurate investigations of metabolic pathways and disease associations. Our findings offer valuable insights into the potential benefits of utilizing WGS data for metabolomics data imputation and underscore the importance of leveraging multi-modal data integration in precision medicine research.</description>

      <title>Incorporating nonparametric methods for estimating causal excursion effects in mobile health with zero-inflated count outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In mobile health, tailoring interventions for real-time delivery is of paramount importance. Micro-randomized trials have emerged as the "gold-standard" methodology for developing such interventions. Analyzing data from these trials provides insights into the efficacy of interventions and the potential moderation by specific covariates. The "causal excursion effect", a novel class of causal estimand, addresses these inquiries. Yet, existing research mainly focuses on continuous or binary data, leaving count data largely unexplored. The current work is motivated by the Drink Less micro-randomized trial from the UK, which focuses on a zero-inflated proximal outcome, i.e., the number of screen views in the subsequent hour following the intervention decision point. To be specific, we revisit the concept of causal excursion effect, specifically for zero-inflated count outcomes, and introduce novel estimation approaches that incorporate nonparametric techniques. Bidirectional asymptotics are established for the proposed estimators. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. As an illustration, we also implement these methods to the Drink Less trial data.</description>
