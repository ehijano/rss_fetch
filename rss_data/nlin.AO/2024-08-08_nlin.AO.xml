      <title>A ubiquitous transfer function links interacting elements to emerging property of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of complex systems, self-organization magnifies the compounding effects of element interactions by propagating, modifying, and enhancing functionality, ultimately leading to emergent system properties. The intricacies of self-organization make unveiling the elusive link between element interactions and emergent system properties akin to finding the proverbial Holy Grail. In the search for identifying a method to predict system-level properties, we used an inductive approach to bypass the self-organization. By observing drug interactions within biological complex system, system property, efficacy, emerged as a smooth response surface in the multi-dimensional space of drug-system interactions, which can be represented by the Complex System Response (CSR) function. This CSR function has been successfully validated across diverse disease models in cell lines, animals, and clinical trials. Notably, the CSR function reveals that biological complex systems exhibit second-order non-linearity. In this study, we generalized the CSR function to physical complex systems, linking maximum compressive yielding stress to impactful manufacturing parameters of the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process. Remarkably though anticipated, the CSR function reveals the connection between the macroscale system property (compressive yielding stress) and the microstructure during self-organizing process. In addition, the second-order non-linear CSR functions ensure a single global optimum in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Complex Dynamics in Reaction-Phase Separation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of sustained spatio-temporal behaviors in reaction-phase separation systems. We focus on binary systems, in which either one or both species can phase separate, and we discuss the stability of the homogeneous state determining the conditions for the emergence of a Hopf-type bifurcation. We then examine the effects of a specific autocatalytic chemical reaction, and computationally determine the full solutions to the partial differential equations. We find that when both species phase separate, sustained pulsed dynamics arise in one dimension. When considered in two dimensions, the system generates persistent, complex dynamic droplets, which do not generally appear if only one of the species can phase separate. We finally discuss the emergence of dynamics with complex features, which can be understood using the framework of a cellular automata.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion and price impact in the fluid-limit of an order book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06079v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend a Discrete Time Random Walk (DTRW) numerical scheme to simulate the anomalous diffusion of financial market orders in a simulated order book. Here using random walks with Sibuya waiting times to include a time-dependent stochastic forcing function with non-uniformly sampled times between order book events in the setting of fractional diffusion. This models the fluid limit of an order book by modelling the continuous arrival, cancellation and diffusion of orders in the presence of information shocks. We study the impulse response and stylised facts of orders undergoing anomalous diffusion for different forcing functions and model parameters. Concretely, we demonstrate the price impact for flash limit-orders and market orders and show how the numerical method generate kinks in the price impact. We use cubic spline interpolation to generate smoothed price impact curves. The work promotes the use of non-uniform sampling in the presence of diffusive dynamics as the preferred simulation method.</description>

      <title>A Simulation Environment for the Neuroevolution of Ant Colony Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simulation environment to facilitate research into emergent collective behaviour, with a focus on replicating the dynamics of ant colonies. By leveraging real-world data, the environment simulates a target ant trail that a controllable agent must learn to replicate, using sensory data observed by the target ant. This work aims to contribute to the neuroevolution of models for collective behaviour, focusing on evolving neural architectures that encode domain-specific behaviours in the network topology. By evolving models that can be modified and studied in a controlled environment, we can uncover the necessary conditions required for collective behaviours to emerge. We hope this environment will be useful to those studying the role of interactions in emergent behaviour within collective systems.</description>
