      <title>MHINDR - a DSM5 based mental health diagnosis and recommendation framework using LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental health forums offer valuable insights into psychological issues, stressors, and potential solutions. We propose MHINDR, a large language model (LLM) based framework integrated with DSM-5 criteria to analyze user-generated text, dignose mental health conditions, and generate personalized interventions and insights for mental health practitioners. Our approach emphasizes on the extraction of temporal information for accurate diagnosis and symptom progression tracking, together with psychological features to create comprehensive mental health summaries of users. The framework delivers scalable, customizable, and data-driven therapeutic recommendations, adaptable to diverse clinical contexts, patient needs, and workplace well-being programs.</description>

      <title>Basic Cycle Ratio: Cost-Effective Ranking of Influential Spreaders from Local and Global Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spreading processes are fundamental to complex networks. Identifying influential spreaders with dual local and global roles presents a crucial yet challenging task. To address this, our study proposes a novel method, the Basic Cycle Ratio (BCR), for assessing node importance. BCR leverages basic cycles and the cycle ratio to uniquely capture a node's local significance within its immediate neighborhood and its global role in maintaining network cohesion. We evaluated BCR on six diverse real-world social networks. Our method outperformed traditional centrality measures and other cycle-based approaches, proving more effective at selecting powerful spreaders and enhancing information diffusion. Besides, BCR offers a cost-effective and practical solution for social network applications.</description>

      <title>Cold-Start Active Correlation Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study active correlation clustering where pairwise similarities are not provided upfront and must be queried in a cost-efficient manner through active learning. Specifically, we focus on the cold-start scenario, where no true initial pairwise similarities are available for active learning. To address this challenge, we propose a coverage-aware method that encourages diversity early in the process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through several synthetic and real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Toxicity in Online Platforms and AI Systems: A Survey of Needs, Challenges, Mitigations, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of digital communication systems and the designs of online platforms have inadvertently facilitated the subconscious propagation of toxic behavior. Giving rise to reactive responses to toxic behavior. Toxicity in online content and Artificial Intelligence Systems has become a serious challenge to individual and collective well-being around the world. It is more detrimental to society than we realize. Toxicity, expressed in language, image, and video, can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context of usage. Therefore, a comprehensive taxonomy is crucial to detect and mitigate toxicity in online content, Artificial Intelligence systems, and/or Large Language Models in a proactive manner. A comprehensive understanding of toxicity is likely to facilitate the design of practical solutions for toxicity detection and mitigation. The classification in published literature has focused on only a limited number of aspects of this very complex issue, with a pattern of reactive strategies in response to toxicity. This survey attempts to generate a comprehensive taxonomy of toxicity from various perspectives. It presents a holistic approach to explain the toxicity by understanding the context and environment that society is facing in the Artificial Intelligence era. This survey summarizes the toxicity-related datasets and research on toxicity detection and mitigation for Large Language Models, social media platforms, and other online platforms, detailing their attributes in textual mode, focused on the English language. Finally, we suggest the research gaps in toxicity mitigation based on datasets, mitigation strategies, Large Language Models, adaptability, explainability, and evaluation.</description>

      <title>HiFIRec: Towards High-Frequency yet Low-Intention Behaviors for Multi-Behavior Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-behavior recommendation leverages multiple types of user-item interactions to address data sparsity and cold-start issues, providing personalized services in domains such as healthcare and e-commerce. Most existing methods utilize graph neural networks to model user intention in a unified manner, which inadequately considers the heterogeneity across different behaviors. Especially, high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors may implicitly contain noisy signals, and frequent patterns that are plausible while misleading, thereby hindering the learning of user intentions. To this end, this paper proposes a novel multi-behavior recommendation method, HiFIRec, that corrects the effect of high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors by differential behavior modeling. To revise the noisy signals, we hierarchically suppress it across layers by extracting neighborhood information through layer-wise neighborhood aggregation and further capturing user intentions through adaptive cross-layer feature fusion. To correct plausible frequent patterns, we propose an intensity-aware non-sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the weights of negative samples. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show that HiFIRec relatively improves HR@10 by 4.21%-6.81% over several state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>CrediBench: Building Web-Scale Network Datasets for Information Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online misinformation poses an escalating threat, amplified by the Internet's open nature and increasingly capable LLMs that generate persuasive yet deceptive content. Existing misinformation detection methods typically focus on either textual content or network structure in isolation, failing to leverage the rich, dynamic interplay between website content and hyperlink relationships that characterizes real-world misinformation ecosystems. We introduce CrediBench: a large-scale data processing pipeline for constructing temporal web graphs that jointly model textual content and hyperlink structure for misinformation detection. Unlike prior work, our approach captures the dynamic evolution of general misinformation domains, including changes in both content and inter-site references over time. Our processed one-month snapshot extracted from the Common Crawl archive in December 2024 contains 45 million nodes and 1 billion edges, representing the largest web graph dataset made publicly available for misinformation research to date. From our experiments on this graph snapshot, we demonstrate the strength of both structural and webpage content signals for learning credibility scores, which measure source reliability. The pipeline and experimentation code are all available here, and the dataset is in this folder.</description>

      <title>Mining higher-order triadic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14997v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems often involve higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have so far been mostly neglected. In this article, we propose {the Triadic Perceptron Model (TPM)} that demonstrates that triadic interactions can modulate the mutual information between the dynamical state of two linked nodes. Leveraging this result, we formulate the Triadic Interaction Mining (TRIM) algorithm to extract triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data, finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions that are often ignored, yet can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to climate.</description>

      <title>Construct to Commitment: The Effect of Narratives on Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how government-led narratives through mass media evolve from construct, a mechanism for framing expectations, into commitment, a sustainable pillar for growth. We propose the "Narratives-Construct-Commitment (NCC)" framework outlining the mechanism and institutionalization of narratives, and formalize it as a dynamic Bayesian game. Using the Innovation-Driven Development Strategy (2016) as a case study, we identify the narrative shock from high-frequency financial data and trace its impact using local projection method. By shaping expectations, credible narratives institutionalize investment incentives, channel resources into R\&amp;D, and facilitate sustained improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). Our findings strive to provide insights into the New Quality Productive Forces initiative, highlighting the role of narratives in transforming vision into tangible economic growth.</description>
