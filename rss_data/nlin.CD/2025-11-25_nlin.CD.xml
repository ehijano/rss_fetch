      <title>Dynamics of coupled $D$-dimensional Stuart-Landau oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stuart-Landau oscillator generalized to $D &gt; 2$ dimensions has SO($D$) rotational symmetry. We study the collective dynamics of a system of $K$ such oscillators of dimensions $D =$ 3 and 4, with coupling chosen to either preserve or break rotational symmetry. This leads to emergent dynamical phenomena that do not have analogs in the well-studied case of $D=2$. Further, the larger number of internal parameters allows for the exploration of different forms of heterogeneity among the individual oscillators. When rotational symmetry is preserved there can be various forms of synchronization as well as multistability and $partial$ amplitude death, namely, the quenching of oscillations within a subset of variables that asymptote to the same constant value. The oscillatory dynamics in these cases are characterized by phase-locking and phase-drift. When the coupling breaks rotational symmetry we observe $partial$ synchronization (when a subset of the variables coincide and oscillate) and $partial$ oscillation death (when a subset of variables asymptote to different stationary values), as well as the coexistence of these different partial quenching phenomena.</description>

      <title>Weighted Birkhoff Averages Accelerate Data-Driven Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many data-driven algorithms in dynamical systems rely on ergodic averages that converge painfully slowly. One simple idea changes this: taper the ends. Weighted Birkhoff averages can converge much faster (sometimes superpolynomially, even exponentially) and can be incorporated seamlessly into existing methods. We demonstrate this with five weighted algorithms: weighted Dynamic Mode Decomposition (wtDMD), weighted Extended DMD (wtEDMD), weighted Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (wtSINDy), weighted spectral measure estimation, and weighted diffusion forecasting. Across examples ranging from fluid flows to El Ni\~no data, the message is clear: weighting costs nothing, is easy to implement, and often delivers markedly better results from the same data.</description>

      <title>Kicked-Ising Quantum Battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum batteries (QBs) have emerged as promising candidates capable of outperforming classical counterparts by utilizing entangled operators. Spin chains, in particular, exhibit unique {charging} properties across diverse settings. Here, we introduce the kicked-Ising model as a QB and analytically characterize its charging dynamics within the self-dual operator regime, valid for arbitrary system sizes and Floquet cycles. Using Clifford quantum cellular automata and momentum-space Floquet analysis with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we obtain exact expressions for energy injection, uncovering the influence of boundary conditions and spin-chain parity on charging performance. The kicked-Ising QB achieves maximal charging while exhibiting remarkable robustness against disorder. We further propose an intensified protocol within a fixed time window that enables faster and more efficient energy injection, while non-uniform kick schedules enhance experimental flexibility. Spin correlators analysis further shows that low-frequency driving boosts energy injection, highlighting a clear connection between charging, scrambling, and kick-induced delocalization. Our theoretical framework are supported by tensor-network simulations and finally verified on IBM quantum hardware. Accounting for platform-specific constraints, we demonstrate that the kicked-Ising QB offers a scalable, disorder-resilient protocol and testbed to assess quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Open networks in discrete time: Passing vs blocking behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for analyzing the input-output behavior of discrete time complex networks viewed as open systems. Importantly, we focus on systems that are inherently modeled in discrete time-such as opinion dynamics, Markov chains, diffusion on networks, and population models-reflecting their natural formulation in many real-world contexts. By an open network, we mean one that is coupled to its environment, through both external signals that are received by designated input nodes and response signals that are released back into the environment via a separate set of output nodes. We develop a general framework for characterizing whether such networks amplify (pass) or suppress (block) the external inputs. Our approach combines the transfer function of the network with the discrete time controllability Gramian, using the H2-norm to quantify signal amplification. We introduce a computationally efficient network index based on the Gramian trace and eigenvalues, enabling scalable comparisons across network topologies. Application of our method to a broad set of empirical networks, spanning biological, technological, and ecological domains, uncovers consistent structural signatures associated with passing or blocking behavior. These findings shed light on how the network architecture and the particular selection of input and output nodes shape information flow in real-world systems, with broad implications for control, signal processing, and network design.</description>

      <title>Adapting Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Bifurcation Detection in Ecological Migration Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to the analysis of bifurcation phenomena in ecological migration models. By integrating the fundamental principles of diffusion-advection-reaction equations with deep learning techniques, we address the complexities of species migration dynamics, particularly focusing on the detection and analysis of Hopf bifurcations. Traditional numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) often involve intricate calculations and extensive computational resources, which can be restrictive in high-dimensional problems. In contrast, PINNs offer a more flexible and efficient alternative, bypassing the need for grid discretization and allowing for mesh-free solutions. Our approach leverages the DeepXDE framework, which enhances the computational efficiency and applicability of PINNs in solving high-dimensional PDEs. We validate our results against conventional methods and demonstrate that PINNs not only provide accurate bifurcation predictions but also offer deeper insights into the underlying dynamics of diffusion processes. Despite these advantages, the study also identifies challenges such as the high computational costs and the sensitivity of PINN performance to network architecture and hyperparameter settings. Future work will focus on optimizing these algorithms and expanding their application to other complex systems involving bifurcations. The findings from this research have significant implications for the modeling and analysis of ecological systems, providing a powerful tool for predicting and understanding complex dynamical behaviors.</description>
