      <title>NeuroPath: A Neural Pathway Transformer for Joining the Dots of Human Connectomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although modern imaging technologies allow us to study connectivity between two distinct brain regions in-vivo, an in-depth understanding of how anatomical structure supports brain function and how spontaneous functional fluctuations emerge remarkable cognition is still elusive. Meanwhile, tremendous efforts have been made in the realm of machine learning to establish the nonlinear mapping between neuroimaging data and phenotypic traits. However, the absence of neuroscience insight in the current approaches poses significant challenges in understanding cognitive behavior from transient neural activities. To address this challenge, we put the spotlight on the coupling mechanism of structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) by formulating such network neuroscience question into an expressive graph representation learning problem for high-order topology. Specifically, we introduce the concept of topological detour to characterize how a ubiquitous instance of FC (direct link) is supported by neural pathways (detour) physically wired by SC, which forms a cyclic loop interacted by brain structure and function. In the clich\'e of machine learning, the multi-hop detour pathway underlying SC-FC coupling allows us to devise a novel multi-head self-attention mechanism within Transformer to capture multi-modal feature representation from paired graphs of SC and FC. Taken together, we propose a biological-inspired deep model, coined as NeuroPath, to find putative connectomic feature representations from the unprecedented amount of neuroimages, which can be plugged into various downstream applications such as task recognition and disease diagnosis. We have evaluated NeuroPath on large-scale public datasets including HCP and UK Biobank under supervised and zero-shot learning, where the state-of-the-art performance by our NeuroPath indicates great potential in network neuroscience.</description>

      <title>When A Man Says He Is Pregnant: ERP Evidence for A Rational Account of Speaker-contextualized Language Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoken language is often, if not always, understood in a context that includes the identities of speakers. For instance, we can easily make sense of an utterance such as "I'm going to have a manicure this weekend" or "The first time I got pregnant I had a hard time" when the utterance is spoken by a woman, but it would be harder to understand when it is spoken by a man. Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies have shown mixed results regarding the neurophysiological responses to such speaker-mismatched utterances, with some reporting an N400 effect and others a P600 effect. In an experiment involving 64 participants, we showed that these different ERP effects reflect distinct cognitive processes employed to resolve the speaker-message mismatch. When possible, the message is integrated with the speaker context to arrive at an interpretation, as in the case of violations of social stereotypes (e.g., men getting a manicure), resulting in an N400 effect. However, when such integration is impossible due to violations of biological knowledge (e.g., men getting pregnant), listeners engage in an error correction process to revise either the perceived utterance or the speaker context, resulting in a P600 effect. Additionally, we found that the social N400 effect decreased as a function of the listener's personality trait of openness, while the biological P600 effect remained robust. Our findings help to reconcile the empirical inconsistencies in the literature and provide a rational account of speaker-contextualized language comprehension.</description>

      <title>Information thermodynamics: from physics to neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a perspective on applying the concepts of information thermodynamics, developed recently in non-equilibrium statistical physics, to problems in theoretical neuroscience. Historically, information and energy in neuroscience have been treated separately, in contrast to physics approaches, where the relationship of entropy production with heat is a central idea. It is argued here that also in neural systems information and energy can be considered within the same theoretical framework. Starting from basic ideas of thermodynamics and information theory on a classic Brownian particle, it is shown how noisy neural networks can infer its probabilistic motion. The decoding of the particle motion by neurons is performed with some accuracy and it has some energy cost, and both can be determined using information thermodynamics. In a similar fashion, we also discuss how neural networks in the brain can learn the particle velocity, and maintain that information in the weights of plastic synapses from a physical point of view. Generally, it is shown how the framework of stochastic and information thermodynamics can be used practically to study neural inference, learning, and information storing.</description>

      <title>Functional Classification of Spiking Signal Data Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human brain neuron activities are incredibly significant nowadays. Neuronal behavior is assessed by analyzing signal data such as electroencephalography (EEG), which can offer scientists valuable information about diseases and human-computer interaction. One of the difficulties researchers confront while evaluating these signals is the existence of large volumes of spike data. Spikes are some considerable parts of signal data that can happen as a consequence of vital biomarkers or physical issues such as electrode movements. Hence, distinguishing types of spikes is important. From this spot, the spike classification concept commences. Previously, researchers classified spikes manually. The manual classification was not precise enough as it involves extensive analysis. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was introduced into neuroscience to assist clinicians in classifying spikes correctly. This review discusses the importance and use of AI in spike classification, focusing on the recognition of neural activity noises. The task is divided into three main components: preprocessing, classification, and evaluation. Existing methods are introduced and their importance is determined. The review also highlights the need for more efficient algorithms. The primary goal is to provide a perspective on spike classification for future research and provide a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and issues involved. The review organizes materials in the spike classification field for future studies. In this work, numerous studies were extracted from different databases. The PRISMA-related research guidelines were then used to choose papers. Then, research studies based on spike classification using machine learning and deep learning approaches with effective preprocessing were selected.</description>

      <title>A Fuzzy-based Approach to Predict Human Interaction by Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces a Fuzzy-based Attention (Fuzzy Attention Layer) mechanism, a novel computational approach to enhance the interpretability and efficacy of neural models in psychological research. The proposed Fuzzy Attention Layer mechanism is integrated as a neural network layer within the Transformer Encoder model to facilitate the analysis of complex psychological phenomena through neural signals, such as those captured by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). By leveraging fuzzy logic, the Fuzzy Attention Layer is capable of learning and identifying interpretable patterns of neural activity. This capability addresses a significant challenge when using Transformer: the lack of transparency in determining which specific brain activities most contribute to particular predictions. Our experimental results demonstrated on fNIRS data from subjects engaged in social interactions involving handholding reveal that the Fuzzy Attention Layer not only learns interpretable patterns of neural activity but also enhances model performance. Additionally, the learned patterns provide deeper insights into the neural correlates of interpersonal touch and emotional exchange. The application of our model shows promising potential in deciphering the subtle complexities of human social behaviors, thereby contributing significantly to the fields of social neuroscience and psychological AI.</description>

      <title>Spatial embedding promotes a specific form of modularity with low entropy and heterogeneous spectral dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how biological constraints shape neural computation is a central goal of computational neuroscience. Spatially embedded recurrent neural networks provide a promising avenue to study how modelled constraints shape the combined structural and functional organisation of networks over learning. Prior work has shown that spatially embedded systems like this can combine structure and function into single artificial models during learning. But it remains unclear precisely how, in general, structural constraints bound the range of attainable configurations. In this work, we show that it is possible to study these restrictions through entropic measures of the neural weights and eigenspectrum, across both rate and spiking neural networks. Spatial embedding, in contrast to baseline models, leads to networks with a highly specific low entropy modularity where connectivity is readily interpretable given the known spatial and communication constraints acting on them. Crucially, these networks also demonstrate systematically modulated spectral dynamics, revealing how they exploit heterogeneity in their function to overcome the constraints imposed on their structure. This work deepens our understanding of constrained learning in neural networks, across coding schemes and tasks, where solutions to simultaneous structural and functional objectives must be accomplished in tandem.</description>

      <title>Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented displays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance was compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption that the information from the different potential target locations is statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than optimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These findings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Spiking Neural Networks for Low-Power Intra-Cortical Brain-Machine Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intra-cortical brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) have the potential to dramatically improve the lives of people with paraplegia by restoring their ability to perform daily activities. However, current iBMIs suffer from scalability and mobility limitations due to bulky hardware and wiring. Wireless iBMIs offer a solution but are constrained by a limited data rate. To overcome this challenge, we are investigating hybrid spiking neural networks for embedded neural decoding in wireless iBMIs. The networks consist of a temporal convolution-based compression followed by recurrent processing and a final interpolation back to the original sequence length. As recurrent units, we explore gated recurrent units (GRUs), leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, and a combination of both - spiking GRUs (sGRUs) and analyze their differences in terms of accuracy, footprint, and activation sparsity. To that end, we train decoders on the "Nonhuman Primate Reaching with Multichannel Sensorimotor Cortex Electrophysiology" dataset and evaluate it using the NeuroBench framework, targeting both tracks of the IEEE BioCAS Grand Challenge on Neural Decoding. Our approach achieves high accuracy in predicting velocities of primate reaching movements from multichannel primary motor cortex recordings while maintaining a low number of synaptic operations, surpassing the current baseline models in the NeuroBench framework. This work highlights the potential of hybrid neural networks to facilitate wireless iBMIs with high decoding precision and a substantial increase in the number of monitored neurons, paving the way toward more advanced neuroprosthetic technologies.</description>
