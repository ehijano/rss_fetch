      <title>Differentially Private Boxplots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20415</link>

Abstract: Despite the potential of differentially private data visualization to harmonize data analysis and privacy, research in this area remains relatively underdeveloped. Boxplots are a widely popular visualization used for summarizing a dataset and for comparison of multiple datasets. Consequentially, we introduce a differentially private boxplot. We evaluate its effectiveness for displaying location, scale, skewness and tails of a given empirical distribution. In our theoretical exposition, we show that the location and scale of the boxplot are estimated with optimal sample complexity, and the skewness and tails are estimated consistently. In simulations, we show that this boxplot performs similarly to a non-private boxplot, and it outperforms a boxplot naively constructed from existing differentially private quantile algorithms. Additionally, we conduct a real data analysis of Airbnb listings, which shows that comparable analysis can be achieved through differentially private boxplot visualization.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Nonparametric Quasi Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent trend in Bayesian research has been revisiting generalizations of the likelihood that enable Bayesian inference without requiring the specification of a model for the data generating mechanism. This paper focuses on a Bayesian nonparametric extension of Wedderburn's quasi-likelihood, using Bayesian additive regression trees to model the mean function. Here, the analyst posits only a structural relationship between the mean and variance of the outcome. We show that this approach provides a unified, computationally efficient, framework for extending Bayesian decision tree ensembles to many new settings, including simplex-valued and heavily heteroskedastic data. We also introduce Bayesian strategies for inferring the dispersion parameter of the quasi-likelihood, a task which is complicated by the fact that the quasi-likelihood itself does not contain information about this parameter; despite these challenges, we are able to inject updates for the dispersion parameter into a Markov chain Monte Carlo inference scheme in a way that, in the parametric setting, leads to a Bernstein-von Mises result for the stationary distribution of the resulting Markov chain. We illustrate the utility of our approach on a variety of both synthetic and non-synthetic datasets.</description>
