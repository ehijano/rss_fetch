      <title>Imaging orbital Rashba induced charge transport anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying orbital textures and their effects on the electronic properties of quantum materials is a critical element in developing orbitronic devices. However, orbital effects are often entangled with the spin degree of freedom, making it difficult to uniquely identify them in charge transport phenomena. Here, we present a combination of scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) current imaging, global transport measurements, and theoretical analysis, that reveals a direct contribution of orbital textures to the linear charge transport of 2D systems. Specifically, we show that in the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, which lacks both rotation and inversion symmetries, an anisotropic orbital Rashba coupling leads to conductivity anisotropy in zero magnetic field. We experimentally demonstrate this result by locally measuring the conductivity anisotropy, and correlating its appearance to the non-linear Hall effect, showing that the two phenomena have a common origin. Our results lay the foundations for an all--electrical probing of orbital currents in two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion-Skyrmionium Phase Separation and Laning Transitions via Spin-Orbit Torque Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many driven binary systems can exhibit laning transitions when the two species have different mobilities, such as colloidal particles with opposite charges in electric fields. Another example is pedestrian or active matter systems, where particles moving in opposite directions form a phase-separated state that enhances the overall mobility. In this work, we use atomistic simulations to demonstrate that mixtures of skyrmions and skyrmioniums also exhibit pattern formation and laning transitions. Skyrmions move more slowly and at a finite Hall angle compared to skyrmioniums, which move faster and without a Hall effect. At low drives, the system forms a partially jammed phase where the skyrmionium is dragged by the surrounding skyrmions, resulting in a finite angle of motion for the skyrmionium. At higher drives, the system transitions into a laned state, but unlike colloidal systems, the lanes in the skyrmion skyrmionium mixture are tilted relative to the driving direction due to the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle. In the laned state, the skyrmionium angle of motion is reversed when it aligns with the tilted lane structure. At even higher drives, the skyrmioniums collapse into skyrmions. Below a critical skyrmion density, both textures can move independently with few collisions, but above this density, the laning state disappears entirely, and the system transitions to a skyrmion-only state. We map out the velocity and Hall responses of the different textures and identify three distinct phases: partially jammed, laned, and skyrmion-only moving crystal states. We compare our results to recent observations of tilted laning phases in pedestrian flows, where chiral symmetry breaking in the particle interactions leads to similar behavior.</description>

      <title>Effect of hole-strain coupling on the eigenmodes of semiconductor-based nanomechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling can strongly affect the eigenmodes of nano- and micromechanical resonators. We study the effect of the coupling for $p$-doped semiconductor resonators. We show that the backaction from the strain-induced redistribution of the holes between and within the energy bands can lead to a nonmonotonic dependence of the modes' eigenfrequencies on temperature and to a strong mode nonlinearity that also nonmonotonically depends on temperature. Unexpectedly, we find that the nonlinearity can nonmonotonically depend on the hole density. We also briefly discuss the effect of the coupling to holes on the modes' decay rates. The results are compared with the experiment.</description>

      <title>Bound states in the continuum in cuprous oxide quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a realistic semiconductor system containing bound states in the continuum (BICs) which allows for a practical realization. By varying the confinement strength of excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells, we show that long-lived Rydberg states of the confined electron-hole pairs appear in the continuum background. The accuracy of calculations of the linewidths based on the coupled-channel Schr\"odinger equation with three channels and only few basis states is confirmed by a numerically exact solution employing a B-spline basis and the complex coordinate-rotation method. We argue that finite-sized cuprous oxide crystals, due to their large exciton binding energies, are a convenient platform for experimental identification of BICs.</description>

      <title>Spin separation and filtering assisted by topological corner states in the Kekul\'{e} lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order topological corner states have been realized in two-dimensional Kekul\'{e} lattice, which can be further coupled with spin polarization through the implementation of local magnetization. In this work, we numerically investigate the spin-dependent transport properties assisted by topological corner states in the Kekul\'{e} lattice. By applying local magnetization and electric potential, the topological corner states are spin polarized with opposite spins localized at different corners, thereby demonstrating a spin-corner state locking mechanism. Transport characteristics, including transmission, local density of states, and local current density, are calculated for a two-terminal setup consisting of a diamond-shaped Kekul\'{e} lattice connected to two leads. When opposite local magnetization is applied to the corners, spin-up and spin-down electrons are perfectly separated, forming two spin-polarized conducting channels and leading to spin spatial separation. In the presence of identical local magnetization on both corners and an electric potential at one corner, the spin-polarized corner states can facilitate selective filtering of different spins and generate spin-polarized currents by tuning the energy. Furthermore, spin-resolved transmission diagrams as functions of both the Fermi energy and electric potential are presented, illustrating the global distribution of spin filtering through topological corner states.</description>

      <title>General method for calculating transport properties of disordered mesoscopic systems based on the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder scattering plays important roles in quantum transport as well as various Hall effects, including the second-order nonlinear Hall effect induced by Berry curvature dipole. Calculation of disorder-averaged transport properties usually requires substantial computational resources, especially for higher-order effects. Existing methods are either limited by approximation conditions or constrained by numerical stability, making it difficult to conveniently obtain average physical quantities over a wide range of disorder strength. In this work, we develop a general method for noninteracting system to obtain analytical expressions of disorder averages in finite orders of disorder strength. This method utilizes the Dyson equation to expand physical quantities expressed in terms of the Green's functions into series of disorder-averaged matrices, and the only approximation involved is the truncation of the Dyson equation. Therefore, this method not only avoids the brute force calculation of disorder samples, but also widely applies to different model systems, types of disorder, and the number of Green's functions in the expressions. We demonstrate the applicability of this general method by calculating averages of the linear conductance of a two-terminal system, the spin Hall conductance and the second-order nonlinear conductance of four-terminal Hall setups. It is found that truncation at the fourth order of disorder strength provides a reasonable accuracy and a convenient Pad\'{e} treatment effectively extends its applicable range. Numerical results also confirms disorder enhancement of the second-order nonlinear Hall current in four-terminal systems. Moreover, more accurate predictions for a broader range of disorder strength can be achieved by including higher-order terms in a similar manner.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Vibrational Evolution in Jahn-Teller Effect by Raman Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jahn-Teller effect (JTE) reduces the geometrical symmetry of a system with degenerate electronic states via vibronic coupling, playing a pivotal role in molecular and condensed systems. In this Letter, we propose that vibrational resolved tip-enhanced Raman scattering images can visualize the vibrational evolutions in JTE in real space. Taking an experimentally viable single zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecule as a proof-of-principle example, not only the degenerate vibrational splitting but also the overlooked vibration mixing caused by the JTE in its anionic form can be straightforwardly characterized by Raman images. Leveraging Raman images, the controllable configuration of JTE distortion with partial isotopic substitution could be further identified. These findings establish a practical protocol to monitor the detailed vibrational evolutions when a single molecule experiences JTE, opening a door for visualization of spontaneous symmetry breaking in molecular and solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Softened Spin Waves in Films with Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy: Sombrero-Like Dispersion, Negative Reflection, Bi-, and Trireflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the effect of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) on spin wave (SW) dynamics at low magnetic fields. PMA exerts an in-plane torque on magnetization, counteracting exchange, dipolar, and Zeeman torques, thereby significantly transforming SW dynamics. In ultrathin films, sombrero-like dispersion relation facilitates bireflection and negative reflection of SWs, while in thicker films we demonstrate anti-Larmor precession, cowboy-hat-like dispersion relation, and trireflection of SWs. These results open up new opportunities to explore wave phenomena beyond magnonics.</description>

      <title>Single-molecule phosphorescence and intersystem crossing in a coupled exciton-plasmon system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning the sharp metal tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) over a molecule allows tuning the coupling between the tip plasmon and a molecular fluorescence emitter. This allows access to local variations of fluorescence field enhancement and wavelength shifts, which are central parameters for characterizing the plasmon-exciton coupling. Performing the same for phosphorescence with molecular scale resolution remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present the first investigation of phosphorescence from isolated Pt-Phthalocyanine molecules by analyzing tip-enhanced emission spectra in both current-induced and laser-induced phosphorescence. The latter directly monitors singlet-to-triplet state intersystem crossing of a molecule below the tip. The study paves the way to a detailed understanding of triplet excitation pathways and their potential control at sub-molecular length scales. Additionally, the coupling of organic phosphors to plasmonic structures is a promising route for the improving light-emitting diodes.</description>

      <title>Light-induced dissipationless states in magnetic topological insulators with hexagonal warping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities in topological insulators (TIs) induce backscattering via magnetic torque, unlike pristine TIs where spin-orbit locking promotes dissipationless surface states. Here we reveal that one can suppress that unwanted backscattering and dissipation in magnetic TIs using high-frequency linearly polarized light (LPL). By carefully considering the hexagonal warping of the Fermi surface of the TI, we demonstrate how the coupling between Dirac surface states and LPL can effectively reduce backscattering on magnetic dopants, enhance carrier mobility and suppress resistance, even entirely. These findings open up avenues for designing ultra low-power sensing and spintronic technology.</description>

      <title>Superballistic paradox in electron fluids: Evidence of tomographic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10265v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron hydrodynamics encompasses the exotic fluid-like behavior of electrons in two-dimensional materials such as graphene. It accounts for superballistic conduction, also known as the Gurzhi effect, where increasing temperature reduces the electrical resistance. In analogy with conventional fluids, the Gurzhi effect is only expected in the hydrodynamic regime, with the decrease in the resistance occurring at intermediate temperatures. Nonetheless, experiments on electron fluids consistently show that superballistic conduction starts at close-to-zero temperatures. To address this paradox, we study hydrodynamic flow, and we find that replacing the classical dynamics with tomographic dynamics, where only head-on collisions are allowed between electrons, solves the dilemma. The latter strengthens superballistic conduction, with potential applications in low-dissipation devices, and explains its differences with the Molenkamp effect and conventional fluids dynamics. Our study reveals that the superballistic paradox is resolved by considering the electrons not as classical particles but as fermions.</description>

Abstract: We report a combined electrical transport and optical study of the superconductivity in atomically thin NbSe$_2$. When subjected to an out-of-plane magnetic field, an anomalous metallic state emerges, characterized by a finite longitudinal resistance and a vanishing Hall resistance, suggesting the presence of particle-hole symmetry. We establish a superconducting Higgs mode in atomically thin samples, which reveals enduring superconducting fluctuations that withstand unexpectedly high reduced magnetic fields. These findings provide evidence of robust locally paired electrons in the anomalous metallic state, affirming its bosonic nature.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and a van Hove singularity confined to the surface of a topological semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between electronic topology and superconductivity is the subject of great current interest in condensed matter physics. For example, superconductivity induced on the surface of topological insulators is predicted to be triplet in nature, while the interplay between electronic correlations and topology may lead to unconventional superconductivity as in twisted bilayer graphene. Here, we unveil an unconventional two-dimensional superconducting state in the recently discovered Dirac nodal line semimetal ZrAs2 which is exclusively confined to the top and bottom surfaces within the crystal's ab plane. As a remarkable consequence of this emergent state, we observe a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, the hallmark of two-dimensional superconductivity. Notably, this is the first observation of a BKT transition on the surface of a three-dimensional system. Furthermore, employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we find that these same surfaces also host a two-dimensional van Hove singularity near the Fermi energy. The proximity of van Hove singularity to the Fermi level leads to enhanced electronic correlations contributing to the stabilization of superconductivity at the surface of ZrAs2, a unique phenomenon among topological semimetals. The surface-confined nature of the van Hove singularity, and associated superconductivity, realized for the first time, opens new avenues to explore the interplay between low-dimensional quantum topology, correlations, and superconductivity in a bulk material without resorting to the superconducting proximity effect.</description>

      <title>Ultraconfined THz Phonon Polaritons in Hafnium Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The confinement of electromagnetic radiation to subwavelength scales relies on strong light-matter interactions. In the infrared (IR) and terahertz (THz) spectral ranges, phonon polaritons are commonly employed to achieve extremely subdiffractional light confinement, with much lower losses as compared to plasmon polaritons. Among these, hyperbolic phonon polaritons in anisotropic materials offer a highly promising platform for light confinement, which, however, typically plateaus at values of {\lambda}0/100, with {\lambda}0 being the free-space incident wavelength. In this study, we report on ultraconfined phonon polaritons in hafnium-based dichalcogenides with confinement factors exceeding {\lambda}0/250 in the terahertz spectral range. This extreme light compression within deeply sub-wavelength thin films is enabled by the unprecedented magnitude of the light-matter coupling strength in these compounds, and the natural hyperbolicity of HfSe2 in particular. Our findings emphasize the critical role of light-matter coupling for polariton confinement, which for phonon polaritons in polar dielectrics is dictated by the transverse-longitudinal optic phonon energy splitting. Our results demonstrate transition metal dichalcogenides as an enabling platform for THz nanophotonic applications that push the limits of light control.</description>

      <title>Energy diffusion in the long-range interacting spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate energy diffusion in long-range interacting spin systems, where the interaction decays algebraically as $V(r) \propto r^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $r$ between the sites. We consider prototypical spin systems, the transverse Ising model, and the XYZ model in the $D$-dimensional lattice with finite $\alpha &gt;D$ which guarantees the thermodynamic extensivity. In one dimension, both normal and anomalous diffusion are observed, where the anomalous diffusion is attributed to anomalous enhancement of the amplitude of the equilibrium current correlation. We prove the power-law clustering property of arbitrary orders of joint cumulants in general dimensions. Applying this theorem to equal-time current correlations, we further prove several theorems leading to the statement that the sufficient condition for normal diffusion in one dimension is $\alpha &gt; 3/2$ regardless of the models. The fluctuating hydrodynamics approach consistently explains L\'{e}vy diffusion for $\alpha &lt; 3/2$, which implies the condition is optimal. In higher dimensions of $D \geq 2$, normal diffusion is indicated as long as $\alpha &gt; D$. Pecular behavior for $\alpha &lt;D$ is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Agentic End-to-End De Novo Protein Design for Tailored Dynamics Using a Language Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins are dynamic molecular machines whose biological functions, spanning enzymatic catalysis, signal transduction, and structural adaptation, are intrinsically linked to their motions. Designing proteins with targeted dynamic properties, however, remains a challenge due to the complex, degenerate relationships between sequence, structure, and molecular motion. Here, we introduce VibeGen, a generative AI framework that enables end-to-end de novo protein design conditioned on normal mode vibrations. VibeGen employs an agentic dual-model architecture, comprising a protein designer that generates sequence candidates based on specified vibrational modes and a protein predictor that evaluates their dynamic accuracy. This approach synergizes diversity, accuracy, and novelty during the design process. Via full-atom molecular simulations as direct validation, we demonstrate that the designed proteins accurately reproduce the prescribed normal mode amplitudes across the backbone while adopting various stable, functionally relevant structures. Notably, generated sequences are de novo, exhibiting no significant similarity to natural proteins, thereby expanding the accessible protein space beyond evolutionary constraints. Our work integrates protein dynamics into generative protein design, and establishes a direct, bidirectional link between sequence and vibrational behavior, unlocking new pathways for engineering biomolecules with tailored dynamical and functional properties. This framework holds broad implications for the rational design of flexible enzymes, dynamic scaffolds, and biomaterials, paving the way toward dynamics-informed AI-driven protein engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital teleportation protocols make use of entanglement, local measurements and a classical communication channel to transfer quantum states between remote parties. We consider analog teleportation protocols, where classical communication is replaced by transmission through a noisy quantum channel. We show that analog teleportation protocols outperform digital protocols if and only if Alice and Bob are linked by a channel that does not reduce the entanglement of its input state. We first derive general analytical results in the broader context of Gaussian-channel simulation. Then, we apply it to the quantum teleportation of a uniformly distributed codebook of coherent states, showing that an analog protocol is optimal for a wide range of communication channel transmissivities. Our result is relevant in the intermediate case when the communication channel is far from being ideal but is not too lossy, as is the case of cryogenic links in microwave superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Revealing the fuel of a quantum continuous measurement-based refrigerator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While quantum measurements have been shown to constitute a resource for operating quantum thermal machines, the nature of the energy exchanges involved in the interaction between system and measurement apparatus is still under debate. In this work, we show that a microscopic model of the apparatus is necessary to unambiguously determine whether quantum measurements provide energy in the form of heat or work. We illustrate this result by considering a measurement-based refrigerator, made of a double quantum dot embedded in a two-terminal device, with the charge of one of the dots being continuously monitored. Tuning the parameters of the measurement device interpolates between a heat- and a work-fueled regimes with very different thermodynamic efficiency. Notably, we demonstrate a trade-off between a maximal thermodynamic efficiency when the measurement-based refrigerator is fueled by heat and a maximal measurement efficiency quantified by the signal-to-noise ratio in the work-fueled regime. Our analysis offers a new perspective on the nature of the energy exchanges occurring during a quantum measurement, paving the way for energy optimization in quantum protocols and quantum machines.</description>

      <title>Bounds and anomalies of inhomogeneous anomalous Hall effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well recognized that interpreting transport experiment results can be challenging when the samples being measured are spatially nonuniform. However, quantitative understanding on the differences between measured and actual transport coefficients, especially the Hall effects, in inhomogeneous systems is lacking. In this work we use homogenization theory to find exact bounds of the measured or homogenized anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in inhomogeneous conductors under minimal assumptions. In particular, we prove that the homogenized AHC cannot exceed the bounds of the local AHC. However, in common experimental setups, anomalies that appear to violate the above bounds can occur, with a popular example being the "humps" or "dips" of the Hall hysteresis curves usually ascribed to the topological Hall effect (THE). We give two examples showing how such apparent anomalies could be caused by different types of inhomogeneities and discuss their relevance in experiments.</description>

      <title>Exceptional topology in non-Hermitian twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has extraordinary electronic properties at the magic angle along with an isolated flat band at the magic angle. However, the non-Hermitian phenomena in twisted bilayer graphene remain unexplored. In this work, we study a non-Hermitian TBG formed by one-layer graphene twisted relative to another layer with gain and loss. Using a non-Hermitian generalization of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model, we find Dirac cones centered at only the $K_M$ ($K'_M$) corner of the moir\'e Brillouin zone at the $K'$ ($K$) valley deform into rings of exceptional points in the presence of non-Hermiticity, which is different from single-layer graphene with gain and loss, where exceptional rings appear in both $K$ and $K'$ corners of the Brillouin zone. We show that the exceptional rings are protected by non-Hermitian chiral symmetry. More interestingly, at an ``exceptional magic angle" larger than the Hermitian magic angle, the exceptional rings coincide and form non-Hermitian flat bands with zero energy and a finite lifetime. These non-Hermitian flat bands in the moir\'e system, which are isolated from dispersive bands, are distinguished from those in non-Hermitian frustrated lattices. In addition, we find that the non-Hermitian flat band has topological charge conserved in the moir\'e Brillouin zone, which is allowed for analogs of non-Hermitian fractional quantum Hall states.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the topological regime in elongated Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study topological superconductivity in elongated planar Josephson junctions. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling and an in-plane magnetic field, the Josephson junction can enter the topological phase and host zero-energy Majorana bound states over a range of the superconducting phase difference centered around $\pi$, with the span of this range determined by the strength of the magnetic field. We demonstrate that the topological superconducting phase range can be greatly increased by elongation of the junction, which causes an amplification of the Zeeman-induced phase shift of Andreev bound states. We show that the appearance of trivial in-gap states that occurs in elongated junctions can prohibit the creation of Majorana modes, but it can be mitigated by further proximitization of the junction with additional superconducting contacts. The topological transition in this system can be probed by measurements of the critical current and we show that the elongation of the junction leads to a linear decrease of the transition critical magnetic field beneficial for experimental studies.</description>

Abstract: Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits are analog quantum simulators able to emulate a wide range of tight-binding models in parameter regimes that are difficult to access or adjust in natural materials. In this work, we use a superconducting qubit array to emulate a tight-binding model on the rhombic lattice, which features flat bands. Enabled by broad adjustability of the dispersion of the energy bands and of on-site disorder, we examine regimes where flat-band localization and Anderson localization compete. We observe disorder-induced localization for dispersive bands and disorder-induced delocalization for flat bands. Remarkably, we find a sudden transition between the two regimes and, in its vicinity, the semblance of quantum critical scaling.</description>

      <title>Variational Scarring in Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum eigenstate of a classically chaotic system is referred as scarred by an unstable periodic orbit if its probability density is concentrated in the vicinity of that orbit. Recently, a new class of scarring - variational scarring - was discovered in numerical studies of disordered quantum dots, arising from near-degeneracies in the quantum spectrum associated with classical resonances of the unperturbed system. Despite the increasing body of theoretical evidence on variational scarring, its experimental observation has remained out of reach. Motivated by this dearth, we argue and demonstrate that variational scarring can occur in an elliptical quantum dot fabricated on monolayer graphene, and locally perturbed by a nanotip. Then, we further show that the fingerprint of these variational scars can potentially be detected via scanning tunneling microscopy, thus offering an attractive experimental pathway for the first validation of this puzzling quantum-chaotic phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene with a strong displacement field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RnG) in the presence of a strong applied displacement field. We first introduce the interacting model of RnG, which includes the noninteracting continuum model and the many-body Coulomb interaction. We then discuss the integer quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH) effect in RnG and the role of the Hartree-Fock approach in understanding its appearance. Next, we explore the FQAH effect in RnG for $n=3$--$6$ using a combination of constrained Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization methods. We characterize the stability of the FQAH phase by the size of the FQAH gap and find that RnG generally has a stable FQAH phase, although the required displacement field varies significantly among different $n$ values. Our work establishes the theoretical universality of both IQAH and FQAH in RnG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the monitored quantum dynamics of Gaussian mixed states and derive the universal Fokker-Planck equations that govern the stochastic time evolution of entire density-matrix spectra, obtaining their exact solutions. From these equations, we reveal an even-odd effect in purification dynamics: whereas entropy exhibits exponential decay for an even number $N$ of complex fermions, algebraic decay with divergent purification time occurs for odd $N$ as a manifestation of dynamical criticality. Additionally, we identify the universal fluctuations of entropy in the chaotic regime, serving as a non-unitary counterpart of the universal conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic electronic transport phenomena. Furthermore, we elucidate and classify the universality classes of non-unitary quantum dynamics based on fundamental symmetry. We also validate the universality of these analytical results through extensive numerical simulations across different types of models.</description>

      <title>Majorana flat bands and anomalous proximity effects in $p$-wave magnet--superconductor hybrid systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat-band Majorana bound states of nodal $p$-wave superconductors give rise to striking electromagnetic anomalies, reflecting their high degree of degeneracy at the Fermi level. However, experimental investigations of these states have been limited because of the scarcity of materials exhibiting intrinsic $p$-wave superconductivity. In this Letter, we demonstrate that Majorana flat bands can emerge in a hybrid system consisting of a conventional superconductor and a $p$-wave magnet, a recently proposed class of unconventional magnets that possess a unique composite symmetry, the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry. The degeneracy of the flat-band Majorana bound states is protected by chiral symmetry from the BDI symmetry class, which originates from the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry of the $p$-wave magnet. In addition, we predict the robust appearance of a zero-bias conductance peak in a dirty normal-metal--superconductor junction containing a $p$-wave magnet, which serves as an unambiguous signature of anomalous proximity effects associated with the Majorana flat bands.</description>

      <title>Flexible radio-frequency transistors exceeding 100 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of 6G communication demands seamlessly integrated terminals operating above 100 GHz with low power consumption for human-centric applications. In this work, we report high-performance, flexible radio-frequency (RF) transistors based on aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays, achieving, for the first time, as-measured current gain cutoff frequency ($f_{\mathrm{T}}$) and power gain cutoff frequency ($f_{\mathrm{max}}$) both exceeding 100 GHz. Electro-thermal co-design improves both heat dissipation and RF performance, despite the low thermal conductivity of the flexible substrate. The transistors deliver 0.947 mA/ $\mathrm{\mu}$m on-state current and 0.728 mS/ $\mathrm{\mu}$m transconductance. Peak extrinsic $f_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $f_{\mathrm{max}}$ reach 152 GHz and 102 GHz, with low power consumption of 199 mW/mm and 147 mW/mm, respectively, setting new performance records for flexible CNT-based RF transistors by nearly 100$\times$, outperforming all other flexible RF devices. Additionally, flexible RF amplifiers achieve output power of 64 mW/mm and power gain of 11 dB in the K-band (18 GHz), marking a significant milestone in the development of flexible RF technologies for next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>
