      <title>Assessing SPARQL capabilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offers significant synergistic potential for knowledge-driven applications. One possible integration is the interpretation and generation of formal languages, such as those used in the Semantic Web, with SPARQL being a core technology for accessing KGs. In this paper, we focus on measuring out-of-the box capabilities of LLMs to work with SPARQL and more specifically with SPARQL SELECT queries applying a quantitative approach.
  We implemented various benchmarking tasks in the LLM-KG-Bench framework for automated execution and evaluation with several LLMs. The tasks assess capabilities along the dimensions of syntax, semantic read, semantic create, and the role of knowledge graph prompt inclusion.
  With this new benchmarking tasks, we evaluated a selection of GPT, Gemini, and Claude models. Our findings indicate that working with SPARQL SELECT queries is still challenging for LLMs and heavily depends on the specific LLM as well as the complexity of the task. While fixing basic syntax errors seems to pose no problems for the best of the current LLMs evaluated, creating semantically correct SPARQL SELECT queries is difficult in several cases.</description>

      <title>High Throughput Shortest Distance Query Processing on Large Dynamic Road Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shortest path (SP) computation is the building block for many location-based services, and achieving high throughput SP query processing is an essential goal for the real-time response of those services. However, the large number of queries submitted in large-scale dynamic road networks still poses challenges to this goal. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel framework aiming to process SP queries with high throughput in large and dynamic road networks, by leveraging the Partitioned Shortest Path (PSP) index. Specifically, we first put forward a cross-boundary strategy to accelerate the query processing of PSP index and analyze its efficiency upper-bound by discovering the curse of PSP index query efficiency. After that, we propose a non-trivial Partitioned Multi-stage Hub Labeling (PMHL) that utilizes multiple PSP strategies and thread parallelization to achieve consecutive query efficiency improvement and fast index maintenance. Finally, to further increase query throughput, we design tree decomposition-based graph partitioning and propose Post-partitioned Multi-stage Hub Labeling (PostMHL) with faster query processing and index update than PMHL. Experiments on real-world road networks show that our methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines in query throughput, yielding up to 1-4 orders of magnitude improvement.</description>

      <title>HybridFC: A Hybrid Fact-Checking Approach for Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider fact-checking approaches that aim to predict the veracity of assertions in knowledge graphs. Five main categories of fact-checking approaches for knowledge graphs have been proposed in the recent literature, of which each is subject to partially overlapping limitations. In particular, current text-based approaches are limited by manual feature engineering. Path-based and rule-based approaches are limited by their exclusive use of knowledge graphs as background knowledge, and embedding-based approaches suffer from low accuracy scores on current fact-checking tasks. We propose a hybrid approach -- dubbed HybridFC -- that exploits the diversity of existing categories of fact-checking approaches within an ensemble learning setting to achieve a significantly better prediction performance. In particular, our approach outperforms the state of the art by 0.14 to 0.27 in terms of Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve on the FactBench dataset. Our code is open-source and can be found at https://github.com/dice-group/HybridFC.</description>
