      <title>Spinor formulation of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with geometric algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for magnetization dynamics is recast into spinor form using the real-valued Clifford algebra (geometric algebra) of three-space. We show how the undamped case can be explicitly solved to obtain component-wise solutions, with clear geometrical meaning. Generalizations of the approach to include damping are formulated. The implications of the axial property of the magnetization vector are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Zeno Freezing and Anti-Zeno Acceleration of the Dynamic Evolution of Acoustic Topological Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurements severely disrupt the dynamic evolution of a quantum system by collapsing the probabilistic wavefunction. This principle can be leveraged to control quantum states by effectively freezing the system's dynamics or enhancing transitions between states. These are known as the quantum Zeno effect (ZE) and anti-Zeno effect (AZE), respectively. However, it remains elusive how quantum measurements affect topological states, which are famous for their robustness against disorder and perturbations. Here, we theoretically and experimentally show that the dynamic evolution of topological boundary states (TBSs) can be controlled by quantum-like measurement (QLM). Our work is based on spatially modulated topological acoustic waveguide systems with varying parameters that adiabatically pump the TBS across the bulk to the opposite boundary. Therein, the QLM is emulated using a perturbation to the Hamiltonian known as the Zeno subspace. With the help of quantum metrics, we identify the general conditions for ZE and AZE, and experimentally demonstrate their effects in freezing and accelerating the tunneling of the TBS. Furthermore, we discover a tunneling mechanism by varying the strength of the QLM. These results highlight QLM as a versatile tool for manipulating topological states and wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic pressure and mechanical pressure for electromagnetic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By the mechanical pressure we mean that the pressure in the fundamental thermodynamic equation with the naive form of the electromagnetic work used, while the thermodynamic one we mean that in the equation with proper thermodynamic form of the electromagnetic work instead. Both pressures differ from a magnetic mutual field pressure which results from the electromagnetic stress tensor for the linear and uniform media in static electromagnetic field. Both pressures are in essence tensors, but a quasi-scalar theory is sufficient for the simple media.</description>
