      <title>Phase Transitions, Non-Extremality (Reconstruction), and Markov Entropy Rate for the Mixed Spin-$(s,\tfrac12)$ Ising Model on a Cayley Tree of Order Three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mixed spin-$(s,\tfrac12)$ Ising model on a Cayley tree of order three ($k=3$), extending the approach of \cite{Akin2024}. For the representative case $s=5$, the associated recursion leads to an 11-dimensional dynamical system, and phase-transition regions are examined via the local stability of the disordered (symmetric) fixed point, detected through the condition $|\lambda_{\max}|\ge 1$ for the Jacobian matrix. To study extremality (non-reconstruction) of the disordered phase, we represent translation-invariant splitting Gibbs measures by tree-indexed Markov chains and compute the relevant Dobrushin coefficients. At the symmetric fixed point we obtain explicit transition kernels and the induced two-step kernel on the spin-$\tfrac12$ layer; its second eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ yields a spectral reconstruction test consistent with the Kesten--Stigum condition $3|\lambda_2|^2&gt;1$. In addition, we introduce the Markov entropy rate as a computable thermodynamic/information-theoretic observable and derive closed-form expressions for this entropy rate at the symmetric fixed point for an arbitrary spin $s$. Numerical illustrations for $s=1,2,\ldots,5$ are provided to compare the entropy-rate behavior with the spectral criteria. Our results connect naturally to themes in information theory and statistical physics and are also relevant to reconstruction problems on trees that appear in biology/phylogenetics.</description>

      <title>Classification of (frustrated) 2D Ising models in genus 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a complete classification of all 2D Ising models, frustrated or not, whose underlying spectral curve has genus 1. As a specific case, we recover Baxter's $Z$-invariant Ising model, thus extending his class of models to \emph{real} coupling constants. We identify two additional families of models, both having \emph{non}-Harnack spectral curves. We show that in all cases the spectral curve is maximal. Moreover, each family undergoes an algebraic phase transition as the genus of the curve tends to 0, explaining the different behaviors observed in the physics literature. In our proof, we use properties of the spectral curve, and Fock's approach. This yields a natural framework for a further systematic study of the frustrated Ising model, in particular for proving local formulas. As an example of application, we prove a full classification of the frustrated Ising model on the triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>An Operator Approach to the Integration of Linear Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an operator approach to the integration of linear differential equations based on intertwining relations between differential operators. Conditions for the existence of intertwining operators are obtained, and it is shown that, in low-order cases, the problem reduces to Riccati-type equations. The method is applied to linear partial differential equations, which makes it possible to construct their solutions. The linear Klein--Gordon equation is presented as an illustrative example.</description>

      <title>Anomalies in quantum spin systems and Nielsen-Ninomiya type Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an algebraic perspective on Nielsen--Ninomiya-type no-go theorems arising from group cohomological anomalies, revisiting in particular the version proved by Kapustin and Sopenko. Departing from their analytic proof, our approach emphasizes the algebraic structure of symmetry actions and the local computability of anomaly indices. We demonstrate that this no-go theorem is due to a fundamental algebraic incompatibility between anomaly data and the dimension of local Hilbert spaces. Specifically, when an anomaly index is locally computable via quasi-local unitary operators, a suitable gauge fixing trivializes their (generalized) determinants, imposing unexpected and nontrivial constraints on lattice regularizations.</description>

      <title>Timescale for macroscopic equilibration in isolated quantum systems: a rigorous derivation for free fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of translation-invariant free-fermion systems (including those with uniform nearest neighbor hopping) on a $d$-dimensional $L \times \cdots \times L$ hypercubic lattice, we prove that, starting from an arbitrary pure initial state, the system equilibrates with respect to the coarse-grained density within a timescale of order $L$. This scaling is optimal, since there exist initial states whose equilibration requires time of order $L$. Our result establishes $O(L)$ as the equilibration timescale, as is expected in normal macroscopic systems with a conserved quantity, such as total number of particles.</description>

      <title>Vertex operators, infinite wedge representations, and correlation functions of the t-Schur measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $t$-Schur measure on partitions, defined by $ \mathbb{P}(\lambda)=Z^{-1}S_\lambda(x;t)s_\lambda(y) $, where $S_\lambda(x;t)$ denotes the $t$-Schur symmetric functions and $s_\lambda(y)$ the ordinary Schur functions, and $Z$ is the normalising constant. Using vertex operator calculus, we realise $S_\lambda(x;t)$ in the charged free-fermion Fock space, yielding a $t$-deformation of the classical boson-fermion correspondence. These realisations give vertex-algebraic proofs of the $t$-Cauchy identities and $t$-Gessel identity. Building on this framework, we compute the correlation functions of the $t$-Schur measure and show that the associated point process is determinantal, with an explicit correlation kernel. The Poissonised $t$-Plancherel measure appears as a specialisation of our construction, so its correlation functions follow as a corollary. As an application, we derive the limiting distribution for the length of the longest ascent pair in a random permutation. Our results interpolate the Schur case at $t=0$, connect to the Schur-$Q$ theory at $t=-1$, and provide a probabilistic interpretation of a natural $t$-refinement of increasing subsequences via a generalised RSK correspondence.</description>

      <title>Actions of Lie 2-algebras and comomentum maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the notion of a 2-action of a Lie 2-algebra on an arbitrary manifold M. Furthermore, in [Rog12], given a n-plectic manifold (M, $\omega$), the authors consider a Lie Infinity-algebra L$\infty$ (M, $\omega$), which is a higher analogue of the Poisson algebra of observables associated to a symplectic manifold. This Lie Infinity-algebra reduces to a Lie 2-algebra L^2 (M, $\omega$) when (M, $\omega$) is 2-plectic. Following ideas of N.L. Delgado [Del18], we introduce the Lie 2-algebra D^2 (M, $\omega$), which generalises the Lie 2-algebra L^2 (M, $\omega$) and its extension containing Hamiltonian pairs. Given a two-plectic manifold (M, $\omega$) and a Lie 2-algebra g_1 $\oplus$ g_0 acting on M we define a comomentum map as a lift of the action, i.e., as a Lie 2-algebra morphism from g_1 $\oplus$ g_0 to the extension of the Lie 2-algebra D^2 (M, $\omega$). In an appendix, we discuss very explicitly numerous examples, classified according to their algebraic properties.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Cattaneo-Vernotte equation connection to the noisy voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a heterogeneous diffusion equation and its corresponding generalization to the Cattaneo-Vernotte equation. It is derived by a combination of the continuity equation and the constitutive relation in various stochastic interpretations of the heterogeneous diffusion process. The heterogeneity in the system is introduced by considering a position-dependent diffusion coefficient. Exact results for the probability density function and the mean squared displacement are provided. The limiting case of heterogeneous diffusion is analyzed in detail, and the corresponding time-averaged mean-squared displacement is calculated. From the obtained results, an ergodicity breaking is observed.</description>

      <title>Strong Hyperbolicity of Second-Order PDEs via Matrix Pencils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a definition of strong hyperbolicity for second order partial differential equations using second order pencils. We show that this definition is equivalent to the standard one, derived by reducing the equations to first order form, but with the benefit of simplifying the calculations necessary to check hyperbolicity. In addition, we observe an interesting property, namely that when a system is strongly hyperbolic, its second order pencil can be factorized as a product of two diagonalizable first order pencils. Finally, we present an application to a vector potential for of Maxwell's equations, with a general extension and gauge fixing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M',g')$ be a genus $m'$ surface with boundary $\Gamma$ and the DN map $\Lambda'$. Introduce the Schottky double $X'$ of $(M',g')$ and denote by $\mathscr{L}(X')$ the length of the shortest closed geodesics in the hyperbolic metrics on $X'$. We prove that $\mathscr{L}(X')$ is small if $\Lambda'$ is close {\rm(}in $B(H^1(\Gamma;\mathbb{R});L_2(\Gamma;\mathbb{R}))${\rm)} to the DN map $\Lambda$ of some surface $(M,g)$ of lower genus $m&lt;m'$ with the same boundary $\Gamma$: $$\Lambda'\to\Lambda\,\Longrightarrow \ \mathscr{L}(X')\to 0.$$</description>

      <title>Entanglement in quantum spin chains is strictly finite at any temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is the hallmark of quantum physics, yet its characterization in interacting many-body systems at thermal equilibrium remains one of the most important challenges in quantum statistical physics. We prove that the Gibbs state of any quantum spin chain can be exactly decomposed into a mixture of matrix product states with a bond dimension that is independent of the system size, at any finite temperature. As a consequence, the Schmidt number, arguably the most stringent measure of bipartite entanglement, is strictly finite for thermal states, even in the thermodynamic limit. Our decomposition is explicit and is accompanied by an efficient classical algorithm to sample the resulting matrix product states.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic interpretation for interpolation Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous work of Ayyer, Martin, and Williams gave a probabilistic interpretation of the Macdonald polynomials $P_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n;1,t)$ at $q=1$ in terms of a Markov chain called the multispecies $t$-Push TASEP, a Markov chain involving particles of types $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n$ hopping around a ring. In particular, they showed that for each composition $\eta$ obtained by permuting the parts of $\lambda$, the stationary probability of being in state $\eta$ is proportional to the ASEP polynomial $F_{\eta}(x_1,\dots,x_n; 1,t)$, and the normalizing constant (or partition function) is $P_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n; 1,t)$. There is an inhomogeneous generalization of Macdonald polynomials due to Knop and Sahi called interpolation Macdonald polynomials $P^*_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n;q,t)$, as well as an inhomogeneous generalization of ASEP polynomials called interpolation ASEP polynomials $F^*_{\eta}(x_1,\dots,x_n;q,t)$ that we introduced in previous work. In this article we introduce a new Markov chain called the interpolation $t$-Push TASEP, and show that its steady state probabilities and partition function are given by the interpolation ASEP polynomials and the interpolation Macdonald polynomial, evaluated at $q=1$. This generalizes the previous result of Ayyer, Martin, and Williams.</description>

      <title>Painlev\'{e} XXXIV asymptotics for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a finite-genus algebro-geometric background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem for the defocusing nonlinear Schr$\ddot{\text{o}}$dinger equation with a finite genus algebro-geometric background. Long-time asymptotics of the solution are derived in four space-time regions. It comes out that the leading-order term in the expansion is, up to a constant, given by the background solution with a shift of the parameter. The subleading term, however, decays at different rates for different regions. We particularly highlight that in the two transition regions, they are of order $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/3})$ and the coefficients involve an integral of the Painlev\'e XXXIV transcendent. We establish our results by applying a nonlinear steepest descent analysis to the associated Riemann-Hilbert problems.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to periodic orbits in the $e^{-}Z^{2+}e^{-}$ Helium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we use variational approaches to describe generalized solutions $(q_1,q_2)$ and critical points $(z_1,z_2)$ of the action functional $\mathscr{B}_{av}$ for the Helium atom in the $e^{-}Z^{2+}e^{-}$ configuration with mean interaction, where $(q_1,q_2)$ and $(z_1,z_2)$ are related by a non-local Levi-Civita regularization introduced by Barutello, Ortega and Verzini. Additionally, we give the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formulations of the generalized solutions $(q_1,q_2)$ following the framework constructed by Cieliebak, Frauenfelder and Volkov. Finally, we count the number of periodic orbits $(z_1,z_2)\in \mathscr{C}_{\mathscr{B}_{av}}$ and find the 1-to-1 correspondence between them and positive rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}_{+}$. \rm</description>

      <title>A group structure arising from Grover walks on complete graphs with self-loops and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a group-theoretic framework to analyze the algebraic structure of the Grover walk on a complete graph with self-loops. We construct a group generated by the Grover matrix and a diagonal matrix whose entries are powers of a complex root of unity. We then characterize the resulting quotient group, which is defined using a subgroup formed by commutators involving these matrices. We show that this quotient group is isomorphic to a finite cyclic group whose structure depends on the parity of the number of vertices. This group-theoretic characterization reveals underlying symmetries in the time evolution of the Grover walk and provides an algebraic framework for understanding its periodic behavior.</description>

      <title>Stability in the anisotropic Calder\'{o}n problem for Painlev\'e-Liouville Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the question of stability of the global and partial anisotropic Calder\'on inverse problems for the class of Painlev\'e-Liouville Riemannian manifolds, that is compact $n$-dimensional manifolds with boundary $(M,g)$, where $M=[0,1]\times K\,$, $K$ is any smooth closed connected orientable manifold of dimension $n-1$ endowed with a Riemannian metric $g_K$, and $g=\alpha^4 g_{0}$ is any conformal deformation of the product metric $g_{0}=dx^2+g_{K}$ on $M$ which is compatible with the Painlev\'e block-separability of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta_{g_0}$. Given a pair of Painlev\'e-Liouville Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ and $(M,\tilde{g})$ satisfying some technical hypothesis, denoting the corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps by $\Lambda_{g}$ and $\Lambda_{\tilde{g}}$, and assuming that $\lVert \Lambda_{g}-\Lambda_{\tilde{g}}\rVert_{\mathcal{B}(H^{1/2}(\partial M), H^{-1/2}(\partial M))}\ = \epsilon $, we show a logarithmic stability result for the global anisotropic Calder\'on problem which says that there exists constants $C$ and $0&lt;\theta&lt;1$ such that $\| \alpha - \tilde{\alpha} \|_{C^{0,r}(M)} \leq C \left( \ln \frac{1}{\epsilon} \right)^{-\theta}$ for some $0&lt;r&lt;1$. Similar results are obtained for the partial anisotropic Calder\'on problem, corresponding to the case where the data are measured on only one connected component of the boundary.</description>

      <title>Defect relative entropy in symmetric orbifold CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we compute the defect relative entropy between topological defects in the symmetric product orbifold CFT $\mathrm{Sym}^N(M) = M^{\otimes N}/S_N$. Our analysis covers two distinct classes of defects: universal defects, which realize the $\mathrm{Rep}(S_N)$ non-invertible symmetry, and non-universal defects.
  We show that the defect relative entropy reduces to a Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence. The resulting expression decomposes naturally into two contributions: one governed by characters of the symmetric group $S_N$, and the other controlled by modular $S$-matrix elements of the seed RCFT. Remarkably, both sets of data appear as probability distributions, yielding an information-theoretic interpretation of permutation group data and modular data within the symmetric orbifold.
  The structure of the divergence depends sensitively on the defect class. For universal defects, only the permutation group data contributes; for maximally fractional defects, both permutation and modular data enter and together define the relevant probability distributions. This feature suggests that the maximally fractional defect can be understood as a kind of product of the RCFT defect and the symmetric orbifold defect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes introduce quantum computation and quantum error correction, emphasising the importance of stabilisers and the mathematical foundations in basic Lie theory. We begin by using the double cover map $\mathrm{SU}_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{R})$ to illustrate the distinction between states and measurements for a single qubit. We then discuss entanglement and CNOT gates, the Deutsch--Jozsa Problem, and finally quantum error correction, using the Steane $[[7,1,3]]$-code as the main example. The necessary background physics of unitary evolution and Born rule measurements is developed as needed. The circuit model is used throughout.</description>

      <title>Bulk-boundary correspondence in topological two-dimensional non-Hermitian systems: Toeplitz operators and singular values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to eigenvalue-based approaches, we formulate the bulk-boundary correspondence for two-dimensional non-Hermitian quadratic lattice Hamiltonians in terms of Toeplitz operators and singular values, which correctly capture the stability, localization, and scaling of edge and corner modes. We show that singular values, rather than eigenvalues, provide the only stable foundation for topological protection in non-Hermitian systems because they remain robust under translational-symmetry-breaking perturbations that destabilize the eigenvalue spectrum, rendering it unsuitable for topological classification. Building on Toeplitz operator theory, we establish general results for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians defined on half and quarter planes, relating the topological indices of the associated Toeplitz operators to the number of finite-size singular values that are separated from the bulk singular-value spectrum and vanish in the thermodynamic limit. This yields a precise bulk-boundary correspondence for edge and corner modes, including higher-order topological phases, without requiring crystalline symmetries. We illustrate our general results with detailed examples exhibiting topologically protected families of edge states, coexisting edge and corner modes, and phases with both gapped bulk and edges supporting only stable corner modes. The latter is exemplified by a non-Hermitian generalization of the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model.</description>

      <title>Torsion-Induced Quantum Fluctuations in Metric-Affine Gravity using the Stochastic Variational Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review paper comprehensively examines the influence of spatial torsion on quantum fluctuations from the perspectives of Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG) and the Stochastic Variational Method (SVM). We first outline the fundamental framework of MAG, a generalized theory that includes both torsion and non-metricity, and discuss the geometrical significance of torsion within this context. Subsequently, we summarize SVM, a powerful technique that facilitates quantization while effectively incorporating geometrical effects. By integrating these frameworks, we evaluate how the geometrical structures originating from torsion affect quantum fluctuations, demonstrating that they induce non-linearity in quantum mechanics. Notably, torsion, traditionally believed to influence only spin degrees of freedom, can also affect spinless degrees of freedom via quantum fluctuations. Furthermore, extending beyond the results of previous work [Koide and van de Venn, Phys. Rev. A112, 052217 (2025)], we investigate the competitive interplay between the Levi-Civita curvature and torsion within the non-linearity of the Schr\"odinger equation. Finally, we discuss the structural parallelism between SVM and information geometry, highlighting that the splitting of time derivatives in stochastic processes corresponds to the dual connections in statistical manifolds. These insights pave the way for future extensions to gravity theories involving non-metricity and are expected to deepen our understanding of unresolved cosmological problems.</description>

      <title>Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity from Holonomies: Discrete BF Formulation and Boundary Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a fully discrete and non-perturbative formulation of two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity within the BF framework. Using group-valued holonomies and Lie-algebra--valued dilatons, the bulk theory is shown to be purely topological, with all physical information encoded at the boundary. We analyze admissible discrete boundary conditions and derive the corresponding asymptotic symmetry algebras directly at the lattice level, including an affine Kac-Moody symmetry and its Brown-Henneaux reduction to a Virasoro algebra, together with the associated Virasoro-dilaton structure. A precise operator product expansion (OPE) dictionary is established by taking the controlled continuum limit of the discrete Poisson brackets. Beyond asymptotic symmetries, we provide an effective boundary description and a representation-theoretic quantization organized by monodromy sectors. Within this discrete framework, black hole entropy follows from gauge-invariant holonomy data and is expressed in terms of the dilaton Casimir, reproducing the Bekenstein--Hawking result without invoking a fundamental Schwarzian action.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Quantum Mechanics of Open Quantum Systems: Revisiting The One-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review analyses of open quantum systems. We show how non-Hermiticity arises in an open quantum system with an infinite environment, focusing on the one-body problem. One of the reasons for taking the present approach is that we can solve the problem completely, making it easier to see the structures of problems involving open quantum systems. We show that this results in the discovery of a new complete set, which is one of the main topics of the present article. Another reason for focusing on the one-body problem is that the theory permits the strong coupling between the system and the environment. In the current research landscape, it is valuable to revisit the one-body problem for open quantum systems, which can be solved accurately for arbitrary strengths of the system-environment couplings. A rigorous understanding of the problem structures in the present approach will be helpful when we tackle problems with many-body interactions. First, we consider potential scattering and directly define the resonant state as an eigenstate of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation under the Siegert outgoing boundary condition. We show that the resonant eigenstate can have a complex energy eigenvalue, even though the Hamiltonian is seemingly Hermitian. Second, we introduce the Feshbach formalism, which eliminates the infinite degrees of freedom of the environment and represents its effect as a complex potential. The resulting effective Hamiltonian is explicitly non-Hermitian. By unifying these two ways of defining resonant states, we obtain a new complete set of bases for the scattering problem that contains all discrete eigenstates, including resonant states. We finally mention the non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems. We emphasize the time-reversal symmetry of the dynamics that continuously connects the past and the future. We can capture it using the new complete set that we develop here.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Gannon-Lee incompleteness theorem for globally hyperbolic spacetimes. We assume the synthetic null energy condition of Ketterer and a trappedness condition we call "synthetically asymptotically regular". Our result generalizes this classical result to the weighted case. It also motivates and indicates extensions to low regularity, which are deferred to future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometry design is a crucial and challenging strategy for improving the performance of type-II superconductors. Topology optimization is one of the most powerful approaches used to determine structural geometries. Therefore, a topology optimization approach is presented to inversely design structural geometries of both low- and high-temperature type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces. In the presented approach, the magnetic response of type-II superconductors is modeled using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the temporal evolution of the order parameter and vector potential is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under the Weyl gauge.</description>

      <title>Observability and Semiclassical Control for Schr\"odinger Equations on Non-compact Hyperbolic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the observability of the Schr\"odinger equation on $X$, a non-compact covering space of a compact hyperbolic surface $M$. Using a generalized Bloch theory, functions on $X$ are identified as sections of flat Hilbert bundles over $M$. We develop a semiclassical analysis framework for such bundles and generalize the result of semiclassical control estimates in [Dyatlov and Jin, Acta Math., 220 (2018), pp. 297-339] to all flat Hilbert bundles over $M$, with uniform constants with respect to the choice of bundle. Furthermore, when the Riemannian cover $X \to M$ is a normal cover with a virtually Abelian deck transformation group $\Gamma$, we combine the uniform semiclassical control estimates on flat Hilbert bundles with the generalized Bloch theory to derive observability from any $\Gamma$-periodic open subsets of $X$. We also discuss applications of the uniform semiclassical control estimates in spectral geometry.</description>

      <title>Holographic Subregion Complexity and Fidelity Susceptibility in Noncommutative Yang--Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of holographic subregion complexity (HSC) and holographic fidelity susceptibility (HFS) in noncommutative Yang--Mills theory. The emergence of a minimum length scale, dictated by the degree of noncommutativity, induces a behavioral transition in the HSC and establishes a lower bound. In the large noncommutativity regime, the qualitative features of the complexity deviate significantly from the commutative case. The HFS is shown to provide an effective measure of the degree of noncommutativity. Although the HSC generally satisfies strong subadditivity, this property fails abruptly when the subregion size approaches the minimum length scale. At finite temperature, the long-range behavior of the HSC is modified, and its lower bound scales positively with temperature. Furthermore, temperature enhances the sensitivity of the fidelity susceptibility to the degree of noncommutativity. Within the AdS soliton background, a competition between connected and disconnected configurations arises in the HSC, signaling a phase-transition-like behavior. Finally, the compactification scale is found to diminish the sensitivity of the HFS to the degree of noncommutativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transversal Pauli Z rotations provide a natural route to fault-tolerant logical diagonal gates in quantum CSS codes, yet their capability is fundamentally constrained. In this work, we formulate the refinement problem of realizing a logical diagonal gate by a transversal implementation with a finer discrete rotation angle and show that its solvability is completely characterized by the Bockstein homomorphism in homology theory. Furthermore, we prove that the linear independence of the X-stabilizer generators together with the commutativity condition modulo a power of two ensures the existence of transversal implementations of all logical Pauli Z rotations with discrete angles in general CSS codes. Our results identify a canonical homological obstruction governing transversal implementability and provide a conceptual foundation for a formal theory of transversal structures in quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Finitary coding and Gaussian concentration for random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Gaussian concentration inequalities for random fields obtained as finitary codings of i.i.d.\ processes, establishing a natural bridge between finitary codings and concentration inequalities. A finitary coding formalizes how a random field with nontrivial dependence, such as the Ising model, can be generated from an i.i.d.\ source by a shift-equivariant map that determines each output spin from a finite, configuration-dependent window of the input. Gaussian concentration yields uniform sub-Gaussian fluctuation bounds for all local observables.
  Our main abstract result shows that Gaussian concentration is preserved under finitary codings of i.i.d.\ fields provided the coding volume has finite second moment. The proof relies on a refinement of the classical worst-case bounded-differences inequality of Talagrand and Marton, allowing us to exploit configuration-dependent bounds. Under an additional structural condition that we call the short-range factorization property, satisfied in particular by codings constructed via coupling-from-the-past algorithms, finite first moment of the coding volume already suffices. These moment conditions are sharp.
  Applications include Gibbs measures and Markov random fields on $\mathbb Z^d$, probabilistic cellular automata, and one-dimensional stochastic processes. For classical lattice models such as the Ising, Potts, and random-cluster models, we obtain sharp criteria for Gaussian concentration coinciding with uniqueness regimes. For countable-state Markov chains, we derive equivalent characterizations, including geometric ergodicity, exponential return-time tails, and the existence of finitary i.i.d.\ codings with exponential tails.</description>

      <title>Identification of random material properties as stochastic inversion problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneity of many building materials complicates numerical modelling of structural behaviour. The material randomicity can be manifested by different values of material parameters of each material specimen. To capture inherent variability of heterogeneous materials, the model parameters describing the material properties are considered as random variables and their identification consists in solving a~stochastic inversion problem. The stochastic inversion is based on searching for probabilistic description of model parameters which provides the distribution of the model response corresponding to the distribution of the observed data. The paper presents two different formulations of the stochastic inversion problem. The first formulation arises from the Bayesian inference of uncertain statistical moments of a prescribed parameters' distribution while the main idea of the second one utilizes nonlinear transformation of random model parameters from distribution of the observed data.</description>

      <title>Enhanced multiparameter quantum estimation in cavity magnomechanics via a coherent feedback loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiparameter quantum metrology plays a fundamental role in uncovering and exploiting the distinctive features of quantum systems. In this work, we propose an effective and experimentally feasible scheme to significantly enhance the simultaneous quantum estimation of the photon magnon and magnon mechanical coupling strengths in a hybrid cavity magnon mechanical platform. Our approach relies on the assistance of a coherent feedback loop combined with the injection of a coherent driving field. We show that an appropriate tuning of the system and feedback parameters leads to a substantial reduction of the estimation errors associated with both coupling strengths. To quantify the metrological performance of the proposed scheme, we employ the quantum Cramer Rao bound (QCRB) as a fundamental benchmark for multiparameter estimation. We explicitly compute and compare the QCRBs derived from the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) formalisms. Our results demonstrate that the RLD based QCRB is systematically lower than the SLD based bound, indicating superior estimation precision in the considered noncommutative estimation scenario. We further analyze the performance of heterodyne detection and show that, in suitable parameter regimes, the corresponding classical estimation precision closely approaches the ultimate quantum limit predicted by our scheme. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed setup within currently available cavity magnon mechanical platforms. Owing to its general character, the framework developed here can be readily extended to the high precision estimation of other physical parameters in hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>$L_\infty$-morphisms between twisted Courant $r$-Lie algebras and untwisted Courant $(r{+}1)$-Lie algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In "Lie infinity algebras and higher analogues of Dirac structures and Courant algebroids" [arXiv:1003.1004], Marco Zambon constructs an $L_\infty$-algebra associated with any higher standard or twisted Courant algebroid (also known as a Vinogradov algebroid), and exhibits an explicit $L_\infty$-morphism from the Lie algebra associated with a standard Lie algebroid twisted by a closed 2-form to the Lie-2 algebra of the standard Courant algebroid. He poses the question of whether analogous canonical $L_\infty$-morphisms exist in higher degrees -- namely, for any standard higher Courant algebroid twisted by a closed $(r+1)$-form. We adfirmatively answer this question, presenting a general framework that naturally yields such canonical $L_\infty$-morphisms for arbitrary $r$, while at the same time clarifying the geometrical and homotopical structures underlying the construction. We also show how this framework accommodates the canonical morphism between Roger's observable $L_\infty$-algebra of a pre-$r$-plectic manifold and the higher Courant algebra described by Zambon and one of the authors in "Observables on multisymplectic manifolds and higher Courant algebroids" [arXiv:2209.05836].</description>

      <title>Hua-Pickrell diffusions and differential equations related with pseudo-Jacobi polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following Assiotis (2020), we study general $\beta$-Hua-Pickrell diffusions of $N$ particles on $\mathbb R$ as solutions of the stochastic differential equations (SDEs) $$dX_{j,t}=\sqrt{2(1+X_{j,t}^2)}\,dB_{j,t}+\beta\left[b-a X_{j,t}+\sum_{l=1,\ldots, N; \&gt; l\neq j}\frac{X_{j,t}X_{l,t}+1}{X_{j,t}-X_{l,t}}\right]dt\,,\;\; (j=1,\ldots,N)$$ with $\beta\ge 1,\&gt; a,b\in\mathbb R$. These processes form a subclass of the Pearson diffusions which are defined as solutions of algebraic SDEs where the moments of the empirical distributions $\mu_t^N:=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \delta_{X_{j,t}}$ can be computed inductively. This Pearson class also contains other well known diffusions like Dyson Brownian motions, and multivariate Laguerre and Jacobi processes After the time normalization $t\mapsto t/\beta$, the SDEs above degenerate in the frozen case for $\beta=\infty$ into ordinary differential equations which are related to pseudo-Jacobi polynomials. For $N\to\infty$ and under suitable initial conditions, the empirical distributions $\mu_t^N$ converge weakly almost surely for $t&gt;0$ to some limit which is independent from $\beta\in[1,\infty]$. For $a=-N, b=0$, we describe the limit explicitly via free convolutions. Moreover, if $a=cN$ for some $c&gt;0$, the solutions of our SDEs converge for $t\to\infty$ to stationary distributions, which are Hua-Pickrell (or Cauchy) measures. We thus obtain connections between known results for the empirical distributions of these ensembles and the zeros of the pseudo-Jacobi polynomials. Furthermore, we derive a freezing central limit theorem for $\beta\to\infty$ for the Hua-Pickrell ensembles which is related to these zeros.</description>

      <title>Exact Multi-Valley Envelope Function Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Valley splitting in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells is a central parameter for silicon spin qubits and is commonly described with envelope-function and effective-mass theories. These models provide a computationally efficient continuum description and have been shown to agree well with atomistic approaches when the confinement potential is slowly varying on the lattice scale. In modern Si/SiGe heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and engineered Ge concentration profiles, however, the slowly varying potential approximation underlying conventional (local) envelope-function theory is challenged. We formulate an exact multi-valley envelope-function model by combining Burt-Foreman-type envelope-function theory, which does not rely on the assumption of a slowly varying potential, with a valley-sector decomposition of the Brillouin zone. This construction enforces band-limited envelopes, which satisfy a set of coupled integro-differential equations with a non-local potential energy operator. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we derive the intervalley coupling matrix element within this non-local model and prove that it is strictly invariant under global shifts of the confinement potential (choice of reference energy). We then show that the conventional local envelope model generically violates this invariance due to spectral leakage between valley sectors, leading to an unphysical energy-reference dependence of the intervalley coupling. The resulting ambiguity is quantified by numerical simulations of various engineered Si/SiGe heterostructures. Finally, we propose a simple spectrally filtered local approximation that restores the energy-reference invariance exactly and provides a good approximation to the exact non-local theory.</description>

      <title>Fluidic Shaping over arbitrary domains: theory and high order finite-elements solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluidic Shaping is a novel method for fabrication of optical components based on the equilibrium state of liquid volumes in neutral buoyancy, subjected to geometrical constraints. The underlying physics of this method is described by a highly nonlinear partial differential equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions and an integral constraint. To date, useful solutions for such optical liquid surfaces could be obtained analytically only for the linearized equations and only on circular or elliptical domains. A numerical solution for the non-linear equation was suggested, but only for the axi-symmetric case. Such solutions are, however, insufficient as they do not capture the full range of optical surfaces. Arbitrary domains offer an important degree of freedom for creating complex optical surfaces, and the nonlinear terms are essential for high quality solutions. Moreover, in the context of optics, it is not sufficient to resolve the shape of the surface, and it is essential to obtain accurate solutions for its curvature, which governs its optical properties. We here present the theoretical foundation for the Fluidic Shaping method over arbitrary domains, and the development of a high order (quintic) finite element numerical solver, capable of accurately resolving the topography and curvature of liquid interfaces on arbitrary domains. The code is based on reduced quintic finite elements, which we have modified to capture curved boundaries. We compare the results against low order finite elements and non-deformed high order elements, demonstrating the importance of high order approximations of both the solution and the domain. We also show the usability of the code for the prediction of optical surfaces derived from complex boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>On the Geometry of Complete Spacelike LW-Submanifolds in Locally Symmetric Semi-Riemannian Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M^{n}$ be an $n$-dimensional complete spacelike linear Weingarten submanifold immersed in a locally symmetric semi-Riemannian space $\mathbb{L}_{q}^{n+p}$ of index $q$, with parallel normalized mean curvature vector field and flat normal bundle. Assuming that $M^{n}$ satisfies suitable curvature constraints, we investigate rigidity results for such submanifolds. By combining a Simons-type formula for spacelike submanifolds with analytic techniques involving the Cheng-Yau modified operator $\mathcal{L}$, we establish sharp inequalities relating the traceless second fundamental form and the gradient of the mean curvature. As applications, we obtain several characterization results showing that $M^{n}$ must be either totally umbilical or isoparametric. More precisely, we derive rigidity results under three distinct frameworks: via the Omori-Yau maximum principle, via the $\mathcal{L}$-parabolicity of the underlying manifold, and under an integrability condition on the gradient of the mean curvature. These results generalize and unify known classification theorems for spacelike submanifolds satisfying linear Weingarten relations in semi-Riemannian ambient spaces.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and linear stability for the mean-field Kuramoto-Daido model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the mean-field noisy Kuramoto-Daido model, which is a McKean-Vlasov equation on the circle with bimodal interaction $W(\theta)=\cos\theta+m\cos2\theta$ for $m\ge 0$ and interaction strength $K$, generalizing the celebrated noisy Kuramoto model corresponding to $m=0$.
  Our first contribution is to characterize the phase transition threshold $K_{c}$ by comparing it to the linear stability threshold $K_\# = \min (1, m^{-1})$ of the uniform distribution. When $m \leq 1/2,$ $K_{c}=1$, coinciding with that of the Kuramoto model. On the other hand, for $m \geq 2$, we show $K_c= m^{-1}$. We also classify the regimes in which the phase transition is continuous or discontinuous.
  Our second contribution is to analyze the linear stability of a global minimizer $q$ (the ``ordered phase'') of the mean-field free energy in the supercritical regime $K&gt;1$. This stationary solution of the Kuramoto-Daido equation is unique up to translation invariance and distinct from the uniform distribution (the ``disordered phase''). Our approach extends the Dirichlet form method of Bertini et al. from the unimodal to bimodal setting. In particular, for $m \leq 1.590 \times 10^{-4}$ and $K&gt;1$, we show an explicit lower bound on the spectral gap of the linearized McKean-Vlasov operator at $q$. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous stability analysis for this class of models with bimodal interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic defocusing sinh-Gordon model with parameter $\beta^2&gt;0$ and its associated Gibbs dynamics on the two-dimensional torus. We establish global well-posedness of the model for a certain range of parameters $\beta^2&gt;0$ with the corresponding Gibbs measure initial data and prove invariance of the Gibbs measure under the flow, thereby resolving a question posed by Oh, Robert, and Wang (2019). Our physical space approach hinges on developing a novel $L^\infty$-based well-posedness theory for wave equations with exponential-type nonlinearities, going beyond the classical $L^2$-based framework. This refinement allows us to fully leverage structural properties of Gaussian multiplicative chaos. As a by-product of our method, we also obtain an improved well-posedness theory for the hyperbolic Liouville model.</description>

Abstract: This work shows that the interiors of perturbed zero-helicity vortices display simply connected topology with a crescent-shaped boundary. Flux surfaces in fluid and magnetic vortices were explored analytically, while particle trajectories in the context of plasma confinement were examined numerically, demonstrating the existence of both toroidal and simply connected topologies. This new topology appears for perturbations in a broad class, with amplitudes and spatial variance allowed to be arbitrarily small. A corollary of this work proves the closedness of field lines under odd-parity perturbations of zero-helicity vortices in full three dimensional context.</description>

Abstract: We study an attractive Hubbard model on bipartite lattices. In the grand canonical formalism,we prove the existence of superconducting long-range order in the ground state on Lieb lattices with the chemical potential corresponding to half filling. We also study the low-energy excitations above several ground states for the translationally invariant Hamiltonian. We prove the following: (i) The pairing excitations are gapless above the ground states when the number of fermions deviates from that of the half filling by the order of the volume. (ii) A certain class of single-fermion excitations shows a non-vanishing spectral gap above the ground state with an even number of fermions in a strong coupling and low-density regime.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the simplest example of the landscape of conformal field theories: one-dimensional CFTs with finite-dimensional state space. Following the definition of quantum field theory given by G. Segal, we formulate the condition under which a one-dimensional QFT (quantum mechanics) possesses conformal symmetry, and we give a complete classification of conformal Hamiltonians with finite rank. It turns out that correlation functions in such theories are polynomial functions of the underlying geometric data. Moreover, the one-dimensional conformal Ward identities determine their scaling behavior, so that the correlators of the conformal observables are, in fact, homogeneous polynomials.</description>

      <title>Massless Representations in Conformal Space and Their de Sitter (dS) Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The monograph develops a self-contained, mathematically rigorous framework for massless representations of the conformal group U(2,2) and their restriction to the de Sitter group Sp(2,2). It systematically constructs ladder (massless) representations, computes invariant bilinear forms and Casimir operators, and provides explicit constructions of vertex operators and two-point functions for low-helicity fields. The monograph employs a novel Clifford-split-octonion approach, embedding 8-component Majorana spinors within an alternative composition algebra, which allows for fully explicit algebraic, spinorial, and geometric constructions. The text bridges foundational representation theory, explicit computational methods, and physical applications in quantum field theory and cosmology. While targeted at researchers in mathematical physics, quantum cosmology, and quantum field theory, the exposition is pedagogically structured to guide advanced graduate students through subtle algebraic and representation-theoretic ideas, making complex constructions accessible without sacrificing rigor.</description>

      <title>Exact solvability of Hamiltonian systems via Poisson cinf-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for the exact integration of Hamiltonian systems based on an ordered family of functions whose Poisson brackets close in a triangular way. In contrast with Liouville--Arnold integrability and noncommutative variants, the functions entering this closure need not be first integrals. The triangular Poisson relations instead generate a \cinf-structure on phase space, given by the Hamiltonian vector fields of the family, and this structure can be exploited algorithmically. We show that the equations of motion can be reduced to and solved by a finite sequence of completely integrable Pfaffian equations. We call the resulting geometric object a Poisson \cinf-structure and provide a systematic Pfaffian integration procedure that applies even when a complete set of conserved quantities is unavailable. The construction is illustrated on two models of physical interest: the two-particle non-periodic Toda lattice and the multi-waterbag reduction of the Vlasov equation. Also, we discuss how the theory extends to time-dependent Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>The quantum pigeonhole effect as a new form of Bell's theorem without inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10699</link>
      <description>arXiv:1806.10699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum pigeonhole effect (QPE) appears to contradict the classical pigeonhole principle by allowing three quantum particles distributed between two boxes to exhibit no pairwise coincidence. We show that this effect does not signal a breakdown of classical counting, but instead arises from quantum contextuality. By deriving Bell-type inequalities directly from the pigeonhole principle and reformulating the weak-measurement protocol within a bipartite density-operator framework, we demonstrate that the QPE is a form of Bell's theorem without inequalities. The apparent paradox reflects the impossibility of non-contextual eigenvalue assignments rather than a violation of classical combinatorial logic.</description>

      <title>Perturbation analysis of triadic resonance in columnar vortices: selection rules and the roles of external forcing and critical layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable robustness of isolated columnar vortices suggests the existence of fundamental constraints that prevent spontaneous disintegration. In this work, we investigate the weakly nonlinear stability of such flows, demonstrating that the triadic resonance of wave modes is governed by a set of hydrodynamic ``selection rules''. By employing a multi-scale perturbation analysis, we prove that resonant interactions between smooth neutral modes, specifically regular Kelvin waves and discrete critical layer modes with passive singularities, are strictly conservative and confined to the Manley--Rowe relations. Using wave pseudoenergy within a large-$k$ WKBJ framework, we show that these rules topologically prohibit intrinsic instability, analogous to the forbidden transitions of quantum mechanics. Consequently, the breakdown of a columnar vortex requires a specific symmetry-breaking mechanism to overcome this barrier. We identify and analyse two distinct pathways for this violation: (1) \textit{Parametric instability}, where external forcing acts as an active energy pump; using a robust tuning method based on non-degenerate perturbation theory, we generalize classical elliptical instability to arbitrary driving frequencies and identify new instability configurations involving dicrete critical layer modes. (2) \textit{Active critical layers}, where an embedded singularity breaks the Hermitian symmetry of the operator, enabling the extraction of mean-flow energy via a wave-mean resonance. These findings provide a theoretical guidance for flow control, suggesting that the mitigation of aircraft wake vortices requires either tuned external forcing or the ``engineering'' of critical layers (e.g., via thermal stratification) to trigger the forbidden transitions.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport on Bethe lattices with non-Hermitian sources and a drain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum transport in a tight-binding model on the Bethe lattice of finite generation, which we expect to be the first step toward analyzing electronic transport in a light-harvesting molecule. We seek conditions under which the electronic current from the peripheral sites to the central site reaches its maximum. As a new feature, we add complex potentials for sources at peripheral sites and a drain at the central site, and solve a non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem, instead of simulating an initial-value problem. Solving the eigenvalue problem clearly reveals which electronic channels contribute most to the quantum transport. We find that the number of eigenstates that can penetrate from the peripheral sites to the central site is limited among the total number of eigenstates. All the other eigenstates are localized around the peripheral sites and cannot reach the central site. The former eigenstates can carry current, reducing the problem to quantum transport on a parity-time symmetric tight-binding chain. We find that the current has a maximum with respect to the strengths of the sources and the drain. Counterintuitively, the current decreases as we increase the strengths beyond the maximum and vanishes in the limit of infinite strength. Moreover, we find that the current maximum is given by a zero mode. When the number of links is common to all generations, the current takes the maximum value at the exceptional point where two eigenstates coalesce to a zero mode, which emerges because of the non-Hermiticity due to the PT-symmetric complex potentials. By introducing randomness either into the hopping amplitude or the number of links in each generation of the tree, we obtain a random-hopping tight-binding model, and find that the current reaches its maximum not exactly, but approximately, for a zero mode, although it is no longer located at an exceptional point in general.</description>

      <title>On minimizing curves in a Brownian potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12471v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a $(1+1)$-dimensional semi-discrete random variational problem that can be interpreted as the geometrically linearized version of the critical $2$-dimensional random field Ising model. The scaling of the correlation length of the latter was recently characterized in [12] and [13, Section 5]; our analysis is reminiscent of the multi-scale approach of the latter work and of [20]. We show that at every dyadic scale from the system size down to the lattice spacing the minimizer contains at most order-one Dirichlet energy per unit length. We also establish a quenched homogenization result in the sense that the leading order of the minimal energy becomes deterministic as the ratio system size / lattice spacing diverges. To this purpose we adapt arguments from [9] on the $(d+1)$-dimensional version our the model, with a Brownian replacing the white noise potential, to obtain the initial large-scale bounds. Based on our estimate of the $(p=3)$-Dirichlet energy, we give an informal justification of the geometric linearization. Our bounds, which are oblivious to the microscopic cut-off scale provided by the lattice spacing, yield tightness of the law of minimizers in the space of continuous functions as the lattice spacing is sent to zero.</description>

      <title>Small-Mass Asymptotics of Massive Point Vortex Dynamics in Bose--Einstein Condensates I: Averaging and Normal Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform an asymptotic analysis of massive point-vortex dynamics in Bose--Einstein condensates in the small-mass limit $\varepsilon \to 0$. We define two distinguished manifolds in the phase space of the dynamics. We call the first the kinematic subspace $\mathcal{K}$, whereas the second is an almost-invariant set $\mathcal{S}$ called a ``slow manifold.'' The orthogonal projection of the massive dynamics to $\mathcal{K}$ yields the standard massless vortex dynamics or the Kirchhoff equations -- also the 0th-order approximation to the massive equation as $\varepsilon \to 0$. Our first main result proves that the massive dynamics starting $O(\varepsilon)$-close to $\mathcal{K}$ remains $O(\varepsilon)$-close to the massless dynamics for short times. The second main result is the derivation of a normal form for the system's Hamiltonian for the two-vortex case; it describes the coupling between motion within $\mathcal{S}$ and that transverse to it. Specifically, we use the Lie transformation perturbation method to derive the first few terms in a formal expansion for $\mathcal{S}$ and demonstrate numerically that fast oscillations due to the vortices' mass are suppressed, given initial conditions sufficiently close to $\mathcal{S}$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate normalized solutions for doubly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on the real line with a defocusing standard nonlinearity and a focusing nonlinear point interaction of $\delta$-type at the origin. We provide a complete characterization of existence and uniqueness for normalized solutions and for energy ground states for every value of the nonlinearity powers. We show that the interplay between a defocusing standard and a focusing point nonlinearity gives rise to new phenomena with respect to those observed with single nonlinearities, standard combined nonlinearities, and combined focusing standard and pointwise nonlinearities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of functions that behave like classical Eisenstein series in many ways, but with a key distinction: only their non-holomorphic completions transform like (quasi)modular forms. We show how the partition rank generating function can be expressed in terms of partition traces of these functions. A key feature of our construction is that the completions satisfy a holomorphic anomaly equation - a phenomenon typically seen in the context of quantum field theory and string theory. We also show that the Fourier coefficients of these Eisenstein-type series are integral.</description>

      <title>Form factors of composite branch-point twist operators in the sinh-Gordon model on a multi-sheeted Riemann surface: semiclassical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sinh-Gordon model in 1+1 dimensions is one of the simplest and best-studied massive integrable relativistic quantum field theories. We consider this theory on a multi-sheeted Riemann surfaces with a flat metric, which can be seen as a pile of planes connected to each other along cut lines. The cut lines end at branch points, which are represented by a twist operator ${\cal T}_n.$ Operators of such kind are interesting in the framework of the problem of computing von Neumann and Renyi entanglement entropies in the original model on the plane. The composite branch-point twist operators (CTO) are a natural generalization of the twist operators, obtained by placing a local operator to a branch point by means of a certain limiting procedure. Correlation function in quantum field theory can be, in principle, found by means of the spectral decomposition. It allows one to express them in terms of form factors of local operators, i.e. their matrix elements in the basis of stationary states. In integrable models complete sets of exact form factors of all operators can be found exactly as solutions of a system of bootstrap equations. Nevertheless, identification of these solution to the operators in terms of the basic fields remains problematic. In this work, we develop a technique of computing form factors of a class of CTO determined in terms of the basic field in the semiclassical approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16099v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry under a particular class of non-strictly canonical transformation may be used to identify, and subsequently excise degrees of freedom which do not contribute to the closure of the algebra of dynamical observables. Such redundant degrees of freedom may physically be identified with empirically-inaccessible measures of global scale. In this article, we present a mathematical framework which extends the symmetry reduction procedure to theories of classical fields, in both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian settings. In order to maintain Lorentz covariance, while simultaneously working with a finite-dimensional phase space, we employ the De-Donder Weyl formalism, for which the natural description is formulated in terms of the fibered manifolds of multisymplectic geometry. We subsequently analyse a number of simple examples, and provide a discussion of the broader implications of our construction.</description>

      <title>Baker-Akhiezer specialisation of joint eigenfunctions for hyperbolic relativistic Calogero-Moser Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In earlier joint work with Ruijsenaars, we constructed and studied symmetric joint eigenfunctions $J_N$ for quantum Hamiltonians of the hyperbolic relativistic $N$-particle Calogero--Moser system. For generic coupling values, they are non-elementary functions that in the $N=2$ case essentially amount to a `relativistic' generalisation of the conical function specialisation of the Gauss hypergeometric function ${}_2F_1$. In this paper, we consider a discrete set of coupling values for which the solution to the joint eigenvalue problem is known to be given by functions $\psi_N$ of Baker--Akhiezer type, which are elementary, but highly nontrivial, functions. Specifically, we show that $J_N$ essentially amounts to the antisymmetrisation of $\psi_N$ and, as a byproduct, we obtain a recursive construction of $\psi_N$ in terms of an iterated residue formula.</description>

      <title>Form-preserving transformations of wave and Wigner functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation are mapped to other solutions for a (possibly) different potential by so-called form-preserving transformations. These time-dependent transformations of the space and time coordinates can produce remarkable solutions with surprising properties. A classic example is the force-free accelerating Airy beam found by Berry and Balazs. We review the 1-dimensional form-preserving transformations and show that they also yield Senitzky coherent excited states and the free dispersion of any harmonic-oscillator stationary state. Form preservation of the $D$- and 3-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation with both a scalar and a vector potential is then considered. Time-dependent rotations may be included when a vector potential is present; we find a general transformation formula for this case. Quantum form-preserving maps are also considered in phase space. First, the wave-function transformation is shown to produce a simple result for Wigner functions: they transform as a true phase-space probability would. The explicit transformation formula explains and generalizes the rigid evolution of curves in phase space that characterize the Airy beam and the coherent excited states. Then we recover the known form-preserving transformations from the Moyal equation obeyed by Wigner functions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the theory of Va\u{i}nberg--Br\`{e}gman relative entropies and quasinonexpansive operators on reflexive Banach spaces, and obtain several new results. We also develop an extension of this theory to nonreflexive Banach spaces, which is a joint generalisation of the reflexive Banach space approach and the finite-dimensional information geometric approach. In the reflexive case, we study generalised pythagorean inequality, as well as norm-to-norm, uniform, and Lipschitz--H\"{o}lder continuity, of (left and right) entropic projections, proximal maps, and resolvents. We also provide a detailed study of a special (`gauge') family of Va\u{i}nberg--Br\`{e}gman geometries and operators that is tightly related with the geometric properties of the underlying Banach space norm. The extended theory belongs to the intersection of convex theoretic and homeomorphic approaches to nonlinear analysis. Its models are constructed, using integration theory on order unit spaces, via nonlinear embeddings into reflexive rearrangement invariant spaces. E.g., we compute the exponent parameters of Lipschitz--H\"{o}lder continuity of the extended entropic projections and resolvents, and establish composability of a suitable class of nonlinear quasinonexpansive operators, over normal state spaces of JBW- and W*-algebras, determined by `gauge' Va\u{i}nberg--Br\`{e}gman geometries over, respectively, nonassociative and noncommutative L$_p$ spaces, and extended via Mazur embeddings. Other examples of extended Va\u{i}nberg--Br\`{e}gman geometries feature the (commutative and noncommutative) Lozanovski\u{i} factorisation map, generalised spin factors, finite dimensional base normed spaces, and convex spectral functions on unitarily invariant ideals of compact operators. We also discuss several categories of entropic projections and quasinonexpansive operators naturally appearing in this framework.</description>

      <title>Generalizing fusion rules by shuffle: Symmetry-based classifications of nonlocal systems constructed from similarity transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study fusion rings, or symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs), which lie outside the non-negative integer matrix representation (NIM-rep), by combining knowledge from generalized symmetry and that from pseudo-Hermitian systems. By applying the Galois shuffle operation to the SymTFTs, we reconstruct fusion rings that correspond to nonlocal CFTs constructed from the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs by applying the similarity transformations. The resultant SymTFTs are outside of NIM-rep, whereas they are ring isomorphic to the NIM-rep of the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs. We study the consequences of this correspondence between the nonlocal unitary model and local nonunitary models. We demonstrate the correspondence between their classifications of massive or massless renormalization group flows and the discrepancies between their boundary or domain wall phenomena. Our work reveals a new connection between ring isomorphism and similarity transformations, providing the fundamental implications of ring-theoretic ideas in the context of symmetry in physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for viscosity solutions to nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations based on an entropy penalisation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for efficient extraction of the viscosity solutions of nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations with convex Hamiltonians. These viscosity solutions play a central role in areas such as front propagation, mean-field games, optimal control, machine learning, and a direct application to the forced Burgers' equation. Our method is based on an entropy penalisation method proposed by Gomes and Valdinoci, which generalises the Cole-Hopf transform from quadratic to general convex Hamiltonians, allowing a reformulation of viscous Hamilton-Jacobi dynamics by a discrete-time linear dynamics which approximates a linear heat-like parabolic equation, and can also extend to continuous-time dynamics. This makes the method suitable for quantum simulation. The validity of these results hold for arbitrary nonlinearity that correspond to convex Hamiltonians, and for arbitrarily long times, thus obviating a chief obstacle in most quantum algorithms for nonlinear partial differential equations. We provide quantum algorithms, both analog and digital, for extracting pointwise values, gradients, minima, and function evaluations at the minimiser of the viscosity solution, without requiring nonlinear updates or full state reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Four collapsing one-dimensional particles: a dynamical system approach of the spherical billiard reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of four one-dimensional inelastic hard spheres evolving on the real line $\mathbb{R}$, and colliding according to a scattering law characterized by a fixed restitution coefficient $r$. We study the possible orders of collisions when the inelastic collapse occurs, relying on the so-called $\mathfrak{b}$-to-$\mathfrak{b}$ mapping, a two-dimensional dynamical system associated to the original particle system which encodes all the possible collision orders. We prove that the $\mathfrak{b}$-to-$\mathfrak{b}$ mapping is a piecewise projective transformation, which allows one to perform efficient numerical simulations of its orbits. We recover previously known results concerning the one-dimensional four-particle inelastic hard sphere system and we support the conjectures stated in the literature concerning particular periodic orbits. We discover three new families of periodic orbits that coexist depending on the restitution coefficient, we prove rigorously that there exist stable periodic orbits for the $\mathfrak{b}$-to-$\mathfrak{b}$ mapping for restitution coefficients larger than the upper bounds previously known, and we prove the existence of quasi-periodic orbits for this mapping.</description>

      <title>Planar Site Percolation, End Structure, and the Benjamini-Schramm Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite, connected, locally finite planar graph and consider i.i.d.\ Bernoulli$(p)$ site percolation. Write $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ and $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ for the critical and uniqueness thresholds. Using a well--separated Freudenthal embedding $G\hookrightarrow\mathbb S^2$, we introduce a cycle--separation equivalence on ends and associated ``directional'' thresholds $p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c,F}(G)$.
  When the set of end--equivalence classes is countable, we show that $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)=\inf_F p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c,F}(G)$ and that for every $p\in\bigl(\tfrac12,\,1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\bigr)$ there are almost surely infinitely many infinite open clusters. Combined with the $0/\infty$ theorem of Glazman--Harel--Zelesko for $p\le \tfrac12$, this yields non--uniqueness throughout the full coexistence interval $\bigl(p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G),\,1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\bigr)$, and hence $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\ge 1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ in this setting. This resolves the extension problem posed by Glazman--Harel--Zelesko for the upper half of the coexistence regime under a natural countability hypothesis.
  In contrast, for graphs with uncountably many end--equivalence classes we give criteria guaranteeing infinitely many infinite clusters above criticality, and we construct an explicit locally finite planar graph of minimum degree at least $7$ for which $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)&lt;1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$. Consequently, the Benjamini--Schramm conjecture (Conjecture 7 in \cite{bs96}) that planarity together with minimal vertex degree at least 7 forces infinitely many infinite clusters for all $p\in(p_c,1-p_c)$ does not hold in full generality.
  Our proofs combine a cutset characterization of $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}$ with a planar alternating--arm exploration organized by an end--adapted boundary decomposition.</description>

      <title>Self-avoiding walks on cubic graphs and local transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite its elementary definition, the self-avoiding walk (SAW) poses notoriously hard enumerative problems: exact connective constants are known for only a handful of infinite graphs, notably the honeycomb lattice \cite{ds}. We establish a general substitution principle for SAWs on infinite connected quasi-transitive cubic graphs under port-transitive vertex replacements, where each degree-$3$ vertex is replaced by a fixed finite three-port gadget. Writing $g(x)$ for the associated two-port SAW series, we prove that for $G_1=\phi(G)$, \[ \mu(G)^{-1}=g\bigl(\mu(G_1)^{-1}\bigr), \] equivalently $\mu(G_1)^{-1}$ is the unique solution $x\in(0,1)$ of $g(x)=\mu(G)^{-1}$, thereby extending the Fisher-triangle relation of Grimmett--Li to arbitrary symmetric three-port gadgets. We also obtain the corresponding identity for bipartite graphs when one or both colour classes are transformed, and show that the critical exponents $\gamma$ and $\eta$ (and $\nu$ under a standard regularity hypothesis) are invariant. For explicit gadget families, including complete-graph gadgets $K_N$ and Fisher-type constructions, these identities turn base graphs with known $\mu$ into infinite families of new quasi-transitive graphs whose connective constants are determined exactly as the unique roots of explicit algebraic equations.</description>

      <title>On the Numerical Treatment of an Abstract Nonlinear System of Coupled Hyperbolic Equations Associated with the Timoshenko Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work addresses the Cauchy problem for an abstract nonlinear system of coupled hyperbolic equations associated with the Timoshenko model in a real Hilbert space. Our purpose is to develop and delve into a temporal discretization scheme for approximating a solution to this problem. To this end, we propose a symmetric three-layer semi-discrete time-stepping scheme in which the nonlinear term is evaluated at the temporal midpoint. As a result, at each time step, this approach reduces the original nonlinear problem to a linear one and enables parallel computation of its solution. Convergence is proved, and second-order accuracy with respect to the time-step size is established on a local temporal interval. The proposed scheme is then applied to a spatially one-dimensional nonlinear dynamic Timoshenko beam system, and the results obtained for the abstract nonlinear system are extended to this setting. A Legendre-Galerkin spectral approximation is employed for the spatial discretization. By taking differences of Legendre polynomials within the Galerkin framework, the resulting linear system is sparse and can be efficiently decoupled. The convergence of the method is also investigated. Finally, several numerical experiments on carefully chosen benchmark problems are conducted to validate the proposed approach and to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Painleve solitons of AKNS system and irrational algebraic solitons of NLS equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel symmetry decomposition approach is introduced to derive the so-called ``Painlev\'e solitons'' of the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) system. These Painlev\'e solitons propagate against a background governed by a Painlev\'e transcendent, establishing a fundamental generalization of the well-known elliptic solitons concept. We demonstrate that while elliptic solitons arise from the combination of translation invariance and square eigenfunction symmetry, a \textit{different} symmetry combination-scaling invariance, Galilean invariance, and square eigenfunction symmetry-generates ``Painlev\'e IV solitons'' for the AKNS system. This discovery represents a significant theoretical advance in integrable systems theory. By selecting special solutions of the Painlev\'e IV equation, we obtain explicit forms of several previously unknown classes of solutions for the AKNS system and the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation: irrational algebraic solitons, rational algebraic solitons, and parabolic cylindrical function solitons. These results dramatically expand the known solution landscape of one of the most important integrable models in mathematical physics, with broad implications for nonlinear wave phenomena across multiple physical disciplines including optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Lorentz Mirror Model: Normal Transport and a Universal $2/3$ Mean--Variance Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lorentz mirror model provides a clean setting to study macroscopic transport generated solely by quenched environmental randomness. We introduce a hierarchical version whose distribution of left--right crossings satisfies an exact recursion. In dimensions $d\geq 3$, we prove normal transport: the mean conductance scales as (cross-section)/(length) on all length scales. A Gaussian closure, supported by numerics, predicts that the variance-to-mean ratio of the conductance converges to the universal value $2/3$ for all $d\geq 2$ (the ``$2/3$ law''). We provide numerical evidence for the $2/3$ law in the original (non-hierarchical) Lorentz mirror model in $d=3$, and conjecture that it is a universal signature of normal transport induced by random current matching. In the marginal case $d=2$, our hierarchical recursion reproduces the known scaling of the mean conductance and its variance.

      <description>arXiv:2602.08143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the classical elliptic Toda chain introduced by Krichever and the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Toda chain introduced by Adler, Shabat and Suris. It is shown that these models can be obtained as particular cases of the elliptic Ruijsenaars chain. We explain how the classical $r$-matrix structures are derived for these chains. Also, as a by-product, we prove that the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Toda chain is gauge equivalent to discrete Landau-Lifshitz model of XYZ type. The elliptic Toda chain is also gauge equivalent to XYZ chain with special values of the Casimir functions at each site.</description>

      <title>$k$-Positivity and high-dimensional bound entanglement under symplectic group symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of $k$-positivity and Schmidt numbers for classes of linear maps and bipartite quantum states exhibiting symplectic group symmetry. Specifically, we consider (1) linear maps on $M_d(\mathbb{C})$ which are covariant under conjugation by unitary symplectic matrices $S$, and (2) $d\otimes d$ bipartite states which are invariant under $S\otimes S$ or $S\otimes \overline{S}$ actions, each parametrized by two real variables. We provide a complete characterization of all $k$-positivity and decomposability conditions for these maps and explicitly compute the Schmidt numbers for the corresponding bipartite states. In particular, our analysis yields a broad class of PPT states with Schmidt number $d/2$ and the first explicit constructions of (optimal) $k$-positive indecomposable linear maps for arbitrary $k=1,\ldots, d/2-1$, achieving the best-known bounds. Overall, our results offer a natural and analytically tractable framework in which both strong forms of positive indecomposability and high degrees of PPT entanglement can be studied systematically.
  We present two further applications of symplectic group symmetry. First, we show that the PPT-squared conjecture holds within the class of PPT linear maps that are either symplectic-covariant or conjugate-symplectic-covariant. Second, we resolve a conjecture of Pal and Vertesi concerning the optimal lower bound of the Sindici-Piani semidefinite program for PPT entanglement.</description>

      <title>Permanents of matrix ensembles: computation, distribution, and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a computational and experimental study of permanents. On the computational side, we use the GPU to greaatly accelerate the computation of permanents over $\mathbb{C},$ $\mathbb{R},$ $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Q}.$ First, for Haar-distributed unitary matrices~$U$, the permanent $\perm(U)$ follows a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma^2)$ -- we confirm this via a number of tests for $n$ up to~23 with $50{,}000$ samples. The DFT matrix permanent is an extreme outlier for every prime $n\ge 7$. In contrast, for Haar-random \emph{orthogonal} matrices~$O$, the permanent $\perm(O)$ is approximately real Gaussian but with positive excess kurtosis that decays as~$O(1/n)$, indicating slower convergence. For matrices with Gaussian entries (GUE, GOE, Ginibre), the permanent follows an $\alpha$-stable distribution with stability index $\alpha\approx 1.0$--$1.4$, well below the Gaussian value $\alpha=2$. We test Aaronson's conjecture that $|\perm(X)|^2$ is asymptotically lognormal for Gaussian~$X$: it is plausible for the complex Ginibre and GOE ensembles, but appears to fail for GUE and real Ginibre, where the $\alpha$-stable tails prevent convergence. Anti-concentration, however, holds for all Gaussian ensembles and is more robust than for Haar unitaries.
  Secondly, we study the permanent along geodesics on the unitary group. For the geodesic from the identity to the $n$-cycle permutation matrix, we find a universal scaling function $f(t)=\frac{1}{n}\ln|\perm(\gamma(t))|$ that is independent of~$n$ in the large-$n$ limit, with a midpoint value \[
  \perm(\gamma({\textstyle\frac12}))
  = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\cdot 2e^{-n}\bigl(1+\tfrac{1}{3n}+O(n^{-2})\bigr) \] for odd~$n$ and zero for even~$n$. We also study the geodesic forom the identity to the DFT matrix.</description>

      <title>Bicovariant Codifferential Calculi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a technique for studying first-order codifferential calculi initiated by Doi and Quillen in the context of cyclic cohomology. Introducing the concept of first-order codifferential calculi (FOCCs) for a given coalgebra, we can show that their classification can be reduced to the classification of subbicomodules in the universal bicomodule. For completing this task, the role of one-dimensional generating spaces (a.k.a. singletons) is found to be useful. We are particularly interested in classifying bicovariant codifferential calculi, which we define over Hopf algebras. This, in turn, can be reduced to classifying Yetter-Drinfeld submodules. We argue that such codifferential calculi are better suited to Drinfeld-type quantized enveloping algebras, as they are dual to Woronowicz calculi for matrix quantum groups. Some classification results are presented in numerous examples.</description>
