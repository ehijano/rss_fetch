      <title>Girth and groomed radius of jets recoiling against isolated photons in lead-lead and proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Letter presents the first measurements of the groomed jet radius $R_\mathrm{g}$ and the jet girth $g$ in events with an isolated photon recoiling against a jet in lead-lead (PbPb) and proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The observables $R_\mathrm{g}$ and $g$ provide a quantitative measure of how narrow or broad a jet is. The analysis uses PbPb and pp data samples with integrated luminosities of 1.7 nb$^{-1}$ and 301 pb$^{-1}$, respectively, collected with the CMS experiment in 2018 and 2017. Events are required to have a photon with transverse momentum $p_\mathrm{T}^\gamma$ 100 GeV and at least one jet back-to-back in azimuth with respect to the photon and with transverse momentum $p_\mathrm{T}^\text{jet}$ such that $p_\mathrm{T}^\text{jet}/p_\mathrm{T}^\gamma$ $&gt;$ 0.4. The measured $R_\mathrm{g}$ and $g$ distributions are unfolded to the particle level, which facilitates the comparison between the PbPb and pp results and with theoretical predictions. It is found that jets with $p_\mathrm{T}^\text{jet}/p_\mathrm{T}^\gamma$ $&gt;$ 0.8, i.e., those that closely balance the photon $p_\mathrm{T}^\gamma$, are narrower in PbPb than in pp collisions. Relaxing the selection to include jets with $p_\mathrm{T}^\text{jet}/p_\mathrm{T}^\gamma$ $&gt;$ 0.4 reduces the narrowing of the angular structure of jets in PbPb relative to the pp reference. This shows that selection bias effects associated with jet energy loss play an important role in the interpretation of jet substructure measurements.</description>

      <title>Analog-antianalog isospin mixing in $^{47}$K $\beta^-$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have measured the isospin mixing of the I$^\pi$= 1/2$^+$ E$_x$=2.599 MeV state in nearly-doubly-magic $^{47}$Ca with the isobaric analog 1/2$^+$ state of $^{47}$K. Using the TRIUMF atom trap for $\beta$ decay, we have measured a nonzero asymmetry of the progeny $^{47}$Ca with respect to the initial $^{47}$K spin polarization, which together with the $\beta$ asymmetry implies a nonzero ratio of Fermi to Gamow-Teller matrix elements $y$= 0.098$\pm$0.037 for the $1/2^+ \rightarrow 1/2^+$ transition. Interpreting $y$ as mixing between this state and the isobaric analog state implies a Coulomb matrix element magnitude 101 $\pm$ 37 keV. This relatively large matrix element supports a model from the literature of analog-antianalog isospin mixing, which predicts large matrix elements in cases involving excess neutrons over protons occupying more than one major shell. The result supports pursuing a search for time-reversal odd, parity-even, isovector interactions using a correlation in $^{47}$K $\beta$ decay.</description>

      <title>Study of the $^7$Be($d$,$^3$He)$^6$Li* reaction at 5 MeV/u</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of the $^7$Be($d$,$^3$He)$^6$Li* transfer cross section at 5 MeV/u is carried out. The population of the 2.186 MeV excited state of $^6$Li in this reaction channel is observed for the first time. The experimental angular distributions have been analyzed in the finite range DWBA and coupled-channel frameworks. The effect of the $^7$Be($d$,$^3$He)$^6$Li reaction on both the $^6$Li and $^7$Li abundances are investigated at the relevant big-bang nucleosynthesis energies. The excitation function is calculated by TALYS and normalized to the experimental data. The $S$ factor of the ($d$,$^3$He) channel from the present work is about 50$\%$ lower than existing data at nearby energies. At big-bang energies, the $S$ factor is about three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the ($d,p$) channel. The ($d$,$^3$He) reaction rate is found to have a less than 0.1$\%$ effect on the $^{6,7}$Li abundances.</description>

      <title>K+K- photoproduction in ultra$-$peripheral Pb$--$Pb collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) of relativistic heavy ions, photoproduction occurs when a photon emitted from one nucleus interacts with the other nucleus from the opposing beam, producing particles in the final state. Measurements of \KK photoproduction probe interactions and couplings between the $\phi (1020)$ and charged kaons with photons and nuclear targets. We report exclusive \KK photoproduction cross section at midrapidity in \PbPb collisions at \snn = 5.02 TeV, which is measured for the first time in UPCs.</description>

      <title>YAP:Ce scintillator as an absolute ultracold neutron detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming UCNProBe experiment at Los Alamos National Laboratory will measure the $\beta$-decay rate of free neutrons with different systematic uncertainties than previous beam-based neutron lifetime experiments. We have developed a new $^{10}$B-coated YAP:Ce scintillator whose properties are presented. The advantage of the YAP:Ce scintillator is its high Fermi potential, which reduces the probability for upscattering of ultracold neutrons, and its short decay time, which is important at high counting rates. Birks' coefficient of YAP:Ce was measured to be ($5.56^{+0.05}_{-0.30})\times 10^{-4}$ cm/MeV and light losses due to 120 nm of $^{10}$B-coating to be about 60%. The loss of light from YAP:Ce due to transmission through deuterated polystyrene scintillator was about 50%. The efficiency for counting neutrons that are captured on the $^{10}$B coating is (86.82 $\pm$ 2.61)%. Measurement with ultracold neutrons showed that YAP:Ce crystal counted 8% to 28% more UCNs compared to ZnS screen. This may be due to an uneven coating of $^{10}$B on the rough surface.</description>

      <title>Wobbling motion in triaxial nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental evidence for the collective wobbling motion of triaxial nuclei is reviewed. The classification into transverse and longitudinal in the presence of quasiparticle excitations is discussed. The description by means of the quasiparticle+triaxial rotor model is discussed in detail.
  The structure of the states is analyzed using the spin-coherent-state and spin-squeezed-state representations of the reduced density matrices of the total and particle angular momenta, which distill the corresponding classical precessional motions. Various approximate solutions of the quasiparticle+triaxial rotor model are evaluated.
  The microscopic studies of wobbling in the small-amplitude random phase approximation are discussed. Selected studies of wobbling by means of the triaxial projected shell model are presented, which focus on how this microscopic approach removes certain deficiencies of the semi-microscopic quasiparticle+triaxial rotor model.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian mixture model approach to quantifying the empirical nuclear saturation point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EOS) in the limit of infinite symmetric nuclear matter exhibits an equilibrium density, $n_0 \approx 0.16 \, \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$, at which the pressure vanishes and the energy per particle attains its minimum, $E_0 \approx -16 \, \mathrm{MeV}$. Although not directly measurable, the nuclear saturation point $(n_0,E_0)$ can be extrapolated by density functional theory (DFT), providing tight constraints for microscopic interactions derived from chiral effective field theory (EFT). However, when considering several DFT predictions for $(n_0,E_0)$ together, a discrepancy between model classes emerges at high confidence levels that each model prediction's uncertainty cannot explain. How can we leverage these DFT constraints to rigorously benchmark nuclear saturation properties of chiral interactions? To address this question, we present a Bayesian mixture model that combines multiple DFT predictions for $(n_0,E_0)$ using an efficient conjugate prior approach. The inferred posterior distribution for the saturation point's mean and covariance matrix follows a Normal-inverse-Wishart class, resulting in posterior predictives in the form of correlated, bivariate $t$-distributions. The DFT uncertainty reports are then used to mix these posteriors using an ordinary Monte Carlo approach. At the 95% credibility level, we estimate $n_0 \approx 0.157 \pm 0.010 \, \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ and $E_0 \approx -15.97 \pm 0.40 \, \mathrm{MeV}$ for the marginal (univariate) $t$-distributions. Combined with chiral EFT calculations of the pure neutron matter EOS, we obtain bivariate normal distributions for the nuclear symmetry energy and its slope parameter evaluated at $n_0$: $S_v \approx 32.0 \pm 1.1 \, \mathrm{MeV}$ and $L\approx 52.6\pm 8.1 \, \mathrm{MeV}$ (95%), respectively. Our Bayesian framework is publicly available, so practitioners can readily use and extend our results.</description>

      <title>Observation of Universal Expansion Anisotropy from Cold Atoms to Hot Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy has been ubiquitously observed in high-energy proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus (heavy-ion) collisions, shaking the early belief that those anisotropies must stem from utterly strong interactions. This work reports a study of anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in an anisotropic potential, as a function of the interaction strength that can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. It is found that the expansion anisotropy builds up quickly at small interaction strength, without the need of utterly strong interactions. A universal behavior of the expansion anisotropy is quantitatively observed between cold-atom and heavy-ion systems, despite their vast differences in physics. This universality will potentially unify a variety of disciplines in nature, from the weakly interacting dilute systems of gases to the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Polarized fragmenting jet functions in Inclusive and Exclusive Jet Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a complete theoretical framework for analyzing the distribution of polarized hadrons within jets, with and without measuring the transverse momentum relative to the standard jet axis. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we derive the factorization and provide the theoretical calculation of both semi-inclusive and exclusive fragmenting jet functions (FJFs) under longitudinal and transverse polarization. With the polarized FJFs, one gains access to a variety of new observables that can be used for extracting both collinear and transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs). As examples, we provide numerical results for the spin asymmetry $A_{TU,T}^{\cos(\phi _S - \hat{\phi}_{S_h})}$ from polarized semi-inclusive hadron-in-jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions at RHIC kinematics, where a transversely polarized quark would lead to the transverse spin of the final-state hadron inside the jet and is thus sensitive to the transversity fragmentation functions. Similarly, another spin asymmetry, $A_{TU, L}^{\cos(\phi _q - \phi _{S})}$ from polarized exclusive hadron-in-jet production in polarized $ep$ collisions at EIC kinematics would allow us to access the helicity fragmentation functions. These observables demonstrate promising potential in investigating transverse momentum dependent PDFs and FFs and are worthwhile for further measurements.</description>

      <title>A Ramsey Neutron-Beam Experiment to Search for Ultralight Axion Dark Matter at the ESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-intensity neutron beams, such as those available at the European Spallation Source (ESS), provide new opportunities for fundamental discoveries. Here we discuss a novel Ramsey neutron-beam experiment to search for ultralight axion dark matter through its coupling to neutron spins, which would cause the neutron spins to rotate about the velocity of the neutrons relative to the dark matter halo. We estimate that experiments at the HIBEAM beamline at the ESS can improve the sensitivity to the axion-neutron coupling compared to the current best laboratory limits by up to $2-3$ orders of magnitude over the axion mass range $10^{-22} \, \textrm{eV} - 10^{-16}$ eV.</description>
