      <title>Asymptotic and stability analysis of kinetic models for opinion formation on networks: an Allen-Cahn approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of the stationary equilibria and their stability in case of an opinion formation process in presence of binary opposite opinions evolving according to majority-like rules on social networks. The starting point is a kinetic Boltzmann-type model derived from microscopic interactions rules for the opinion exchange among individuals holding a certain degree of connectivity. The key idea is to derive from the kinetic model an Allen-Cahn type equation for the fraction of individuals holding one of the two opinions. The latter can be studied by means of a linear stability analysis and by exploiting integral operator analysis. While this is true for ternary interactions, for binary interactions the derived equation of interest is a linear scattering equation, that can be studied by means of General Relative Entropy tools and integral operators.</description>

      <title>The Complex Interplay Between Risk Tolerance and the Spread of Infectious Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risk-driven behavior provides a feedback mechanism through which individuals both shape and are collectively affected by an epidemic. We introduce a general and flexible compartmental model to study the effect of heterogeneity in the population with regards to risk tolerance. The interplay between behavior and epidemiology leads to a rich set of possible epidemic dynamics. Depending on the behavioral composition of the population, we find that increasing heterogeneity in risk tolerance can either increase or decrease the epidemic size. We find that multiple waves of infection can arise due to the interplay between transmission and behavior, even without the replenishment of susceptibles. We find that increasing protective mechanisms such as the effectiveness of interventions, the number of risk-averse people in the population, and the duration of intervention usage reduces the epidemic overshoot. When the protection is pushed past a critical threshold, the epidemic dynamics enter an underdamped regime where the epidemic size exactly equals the herd immunity threshold. Lastly, we can find regimes where epidemic size does not monotonically decrease with a population that becomes increasingly risk-averse.</description>

      <title>Passenger Route and Departure Time Guidance under Disruptions in Oversaturated Urban Rail Transit Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The urban rail transit (URT) system attracts many commuters with its punctuality and convenience. However, it is vulnerable to disruptions caused by factors like extreme weather and temporary equipment failures, which greatly impact passengers' journeys and diminish the system's service quality. In this study, we propose targeted travel guidance for passengers at different space-time locations by devising passenger rescheduling strategies during disruptions. This guidance not only offers insights into route changes but also provides practical recommendations for delaying departure times when required. We present a novel three-feature four-group passenger classification principle, integrating temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal features to classify passengers in disrupted URT networks. This approach results in the creation of four distinct solution spaces based on passenger groups. A mixed integer programming model is built based on individual level considering the First-in-First-out (FIFO) rule in oversaturated networks. Additionally, we present a two-stage solution approach for handling the complex issues in large-scale networks. Experimental results from both small-scale artificial networks and the real-world Beijing URT network validate the efficacy of our proposed passenger rescheduling strategies in mitigating disruptions. Specifically, when compared to scenarios with no travel guidance during disruptions, our strategies achieve a substantial reduction in total passenger travel time by 29.7% and 50.9% respectively, underscoring the effectiveness in managing unexpected disruptions.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma on BA Scale-Free Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, individuals often cooperate for mutual benefit. However, differences in wealth can lead to varying outcomes for similar actions. In complex social networks, individuals' choices are also influenced by their neighbors. To explore the evolution of strategies in realistic settings, we conducted repeated asymmetric prisoners dilemma experiments on a weighted BA scale-free network. Our analysis highlighted how the four components of memory-one strategies affect win rates, found two special strategies in the evolutionary process, and increased the cooperation levels among individuals. These findings offer practical insights for addressing real-world problems.</description>

      <title>When LLMs Play the Telephone Game: Cumulative Changes and Attractors in Iterated Cultural Transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) start interacting with each other and generating an increasing amount of text online, it becomes crucial to better understand how information is transformed as it passes from one LLM to the next. While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors, existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases, negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor states. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission chain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents iteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next agent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity, difficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of biases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the instructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more open-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more constrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display different sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger attractors than length. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for multi-step transmission dynamics and represent a first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of LLM cultural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Decoding Political Polarization in Social Media Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms significantly influence ideological divisions by enabling users to select information that aligns with their beliefs and avoid opposing viewpoints. Analyzing approximately 47 million Facebook posts, this study investigates the interactions of around 170 million users with news pages, revealing distinct patterns based on political orientations. While users generally prefer content that reflects their political biases, the extent of engagement varies even among individuals with similar ideological leanings. Specifically, political biases heavily influence commenting behaviors, particularly among users leaning towards the center-left and the right. Conversely, the 'likes' from center-left and centrist users are more indicative of their political affiliations. This research illuminates the complex relationship between social media behavior and political polarization, offering new insights into the manifestation of ideological divisions online.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Faced with a dangerous epidemic humans will spontaneously social distance to reduce their risk of infection at a socio-economic cost. Compartmentalised epidemic models have been extended to include this endogenous decision making: Individuals choose their behaviour to optimise a utility function, self-consistently giving rise to population behaviour. Here we study the properties of the resulting Nash equilibria, in which no member of the population can gain an advantage by unilaterally adopting different behaviour. We leverage a new analytic solution to obtain, (1) a simple relationship between rational social distancing behaviour and the current number of infections; (2) new scaling results for how the infection peak and number of total cases depend on the cost of contracting the disease; (3) characteristic infection costs that divide regimes of strong and weak behavioural response and depend only on the basic reproduction number of the disease; (4) a closed form expression for the value of the utility. We discuss how these analytic results provide a deep and intuitive understanding into the disease dynamics, useful for both individuals and policymakers. In particular the relationship between social distancing and infections represents a heuristic that could be communicated to the population to encourage, or "bootstrap", rational behaviour.</description>

      <title>Strength and weakness of disease-induced herd immunity in networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a fraction of a population becomes immune to an infectious disease, the population-wide infection risk decreases nonlinearly due to collective protection known as herd immunity. Studies based on mean-field models suggest that natural infection in a heterogeneous population may induce herd immunity more efficiently than homogeneous immunization. Here, we use network epidemic models to show that the opposite can also be the case. We identify two competing mechanisms driving disease-induced herd immunity in networks: the high density of immunity among socially active individuals enhances the herd immunity effect, while the topological localization of immune individuals weakens it. The effect of localization is stronger in networks embedded in low-dimensional space, which can make disease-induced immunity less effective than random immunization. Our results highlight the role of networks in shaping herd immunity and call for careful examination of model predictions that inform public health policies.</description>

      <title>Phosphorus recycling from human excreta in French agroecosystems and potential for food self-sufficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phosphorus (P) is an essential constituent of life but large P losses from agroecosystems and sanitation systems are a major source of eutrophication in water bodies.These losses are doubly detrimental as P in human excretions can be used for crop fertilization.Through a unique dataset of 20,000 French WasteWater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) operational measurements over two decades and a P mass balance, we assess the fate of human excretions and their agricultural potential.Despite 75% of French WWTPs sludge being spread on crops, only 50% of the excreted P makes it back to agroecosystems. This is among the highest rate in Western countries where assessments have been made.Meanwhile, another 35% of the excreted P ends up in surface waters or the environment through WWTP discharge, individual autonomous systems diffuse losses, and sewers leaks.The remaining 15% is incinerated or sent to landfills.Moreover, while WWTP removal efficiency increased in the 2000s, reaching an 80% national average, it has been followed by a decade of stagnation in every French basin.The final removal efficiency for each basin, from 65% to 85%, closely matches whether the area was defined as P-sensitive in the European directive.Our results suggest that recycling all P in excretions could help supply 7 to 34% of French food supply without changing the current food system.Reshaping agricultural systems (shifting to more plant-based diets, decreasing P losses and food waste) would enable to go even further on the road to food sufficiency.</description>

      <title>Characterizing pedestrian contact interaction trajectories to understand spreading risk in human crowds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spreading process can be observed when particular information, substances, or diseases spread through a population over time in social and biological systems. It is widely believed that contact interactions among individual entities play an essential role in the spreading process. Although contact interactions are often influenced by geometrical conditions, little attention has been paid to understand their effects, especially on contact duration among pedestrians. To examine how the pedestrian flow setups affect contact duration distribution, we have analyzed trajectories of pedestrians in contact interactions collected from pedestrian flow experiments of uni-, bi- and multi-directional setups. Based on turning angle entropy and efficiency, we have classified the type of motion observed in the contact interactions. We have found that the majority of contact interactions in the unidirectional flow setup can be categorized as confined motion, hinting at the possibility of long-lived contact duration. However, ballistic motion is more frequently observed in the other flow conditions, yielding frequent, brief contact interactions. Our results demonstrate that observing more confined motions is likely associated with the increase of parallel contact interactions regardless of pedestrian flow setups. This study highlights that the confined motions tend to yield longer contact duration, suggesting that the infectious disease transmission risk would be considerable even for low transmissibility. These results have important implications for crowd management in the context of minimizing spreading risk. This work is an extended version of Kwak et al. (2023) presented at the 2023 International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS).</description>

      <title>The CHEPA model: assessing the impact of HEPA filter units in classrooms using a fast-running coupled indoor air quality and dynamic thermal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quality of the classroom environment, including ventilation, air quality and thermal conditions, has an important impact on children's health and academic achievements. The use of portable HEPA filter air cleaners is widely suggested as a strategy to mitigate exposure to particulate matter and airborne viruses. However, there is a need to quantify the relative benefits of such devices including the impacts on energy use. We present a simple coupled dynamic thermal and air quality model and apply it to naturally ventilated classrooms, representative of modern and Victorian era construction. We consider the addition of HEPA filters with, and without, reduced opening of windows, and explore concentrations of carbon dioxide (\co), \PM, airborne viral RNA, classroom temperature and energy use. Results indicate the addition of HEPA filters was predicted to reduce \PM~ by 40--60\% and viral RNA by 30--50\% depending on the classroom design and window opening behaviour. The energy cost of running HEPA filters is likely to be only 1\%--2\% of the classroom heating costs. In scenarios when HEPA filters were on and window opening was reduced (to account for the additional clean air delivery rate of the filters), the heating cost was predicted to be reduced by as much as -13\%, and these maximum reductions grew to -46\% in wintertime simulations. In these scenarios the HEPA filters result in a notable reduction in \PM~and viral RNA, but the \co\ concentration is significantly higher. The model provides a mechanism for exploring the relative impact of ventilation and air cleaning strategies on both exposures and energy costs, enabling an understanding of where trade-offs lie.</description>

      <title>Edge Importance in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex networks are made up of vertices and edges. The latter connect the vertices. There are several ways to measure the importance of the vertices, e.g., by counting the number of edges that start or end at each vertex, or by using the subgraph centrality of the vertices. It is more difficult to assess the importance of the edges. One approach is to consider the line graph associated with the given network and determine the importance of the vertices of the line graph, but this is fairly complicated except for small networks. This paper compares two approaches to estimate the importance of edges of medium-sized to large networks. One approach computes partial derivatives of the total communicability of the weights of the edges, where a partial derivative of large magnitude indicates that the corresponding edge may be important. Our second approach computes the Perron sensitivity of the edges. A high sensitivity signals that the edge may be important. The performance of these methods and some computational aspects are discussed. Applications of interest include to determine whether a network can be replaced by a network with fewer edges with about the same communicability.</description>

      <title>Indirect social influence and diffusion of innovations: An experimental approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental feature for understanding the diffusion of innovations through a social group is the manner in which we are influenced by our own social interactions. It is usually assumed that only direct interactions, those that form our social network, determine the dynamics of adopting innovations. Here, we put this assumption to the test by experimentally and theoretically studying the role of direct and indirect influences in the adoption of innovations. We perform experiments specifically designed to capture the influence that an individual receives from their direct social ties as well as from those socially close to them, as a function of the separation they have in their social network. The results of 21 experimental sessions with more than 590 participants show that the rate of adoption of an innovation is significantly influenced not only by our nearest neighbors but also by the second and third levels of influences an adopter has. Using a mathematical model that accounts for both direct and indirect interactions in a network, we fit the experimental results and determine the way in which influences decay with social distance. The results indicate that the strength of peer pressure on an adopter coming from its second and third circles of influence is approximately 2/3 and 1/3, respectively, relative to their closest neighbors. Our results strongly suggest that innovation adoption is a complex process in which an individual feels significant pressure not only from their direct ties but also by those socially close to them.</description>

Abstract: Data show that the presence of women in quantum science is affected by a number of detriments and their percentage decreases even further for higher positions. Beyond data, from our shared personal experiences as female tenured quantum physics professors, we believe that the current model of scientific leadership, funding, and authority fails to represent many of us. It is time for a real change that calls for a different kind of force and for the participation of everyone. Women for quantum calls for a joint effort and aims with this initiative to contribute to such a transformation.</description>

Abstract: We report here a series of detailed statistical analyses on the sea level variations in the Port of Trieste using one of the largest existing catalogues that covers more than a century of measurements. We show that the distribution of waiting times, which are defined here akin to econophysics, namely the series of shortest time spans between a given sea level L and the next sea level of at least L + {\delta} in the catalogue, exhibits a distinct scale-free character for small values of {\delta}, while for larger values of {\delta} the distribution is very similar to the exponential distribution. The distribution of waiting times for small values of {\delta} is typical for complex systems exhibiting criticality and is reported abundantly in the literature, while the exponential-like distribution observed for large values of {\delta} has been observed in contexts as diverse as magnetic systems and light sleep duration.</description>
