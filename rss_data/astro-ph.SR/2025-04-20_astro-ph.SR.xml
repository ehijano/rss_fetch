      <title>Quantifying the Limits of TESS Stellar Rotation Measurements with the K2-TESS Overlap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has provided stellar rotation periods across much of the sky through high-precision light curves, but the reliability and completeness of these measurements require careful evaluation. We assess the accuracy of TESS-derived rotation periods by leveraging a cross-matched sample of ~23,000 stars observed by both TESS and the K2 mission, treating K2 periods as a benchmark. Using causal pixel models to extract light curves and the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram to identify rotation signals, we quantify the empirical uncertainties, reliability, and completeness of TESS rotation period measurements. We find that uncertainties on TESS-derived rotation periods are typically below 3% for stars with periods &lt; 10 days. Rotation periods are generally reliable out to 10 days, with &gt;80% of measurements matching the K2 benchmark. Completeness and reliability drop dramatically for periods beyond ~12 days due to the 27-day sector limitation. Stricter cuts on TESS magnitude and LS power improve reliability; the highest LS power tested (&gt;0.2) ensures &gt;90% reliability below 10 days but removes over half of potential detections. Stitching consecutive-sector light curves reduces period uncertainties but does not improve overall reliability or completeness due to persistent systematics. Our findings and code provide a framework for interpreting TESS-derived rotation periods and inform the selection of quality cuts to optimize studies of stellar rotation, young associations, and gyrochronology.</description>

      <title>Formation of Magnetic Switchbacks via expanding Alfv\'en Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Large-amplitude inversions of the solar wind's interplanetary magnetic field have long been documented; however, observations from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission have renewed interest in this phenomenon as such features, often termed switchbacks, may constrain both the sources of the solar wind as well as in-situ nonlinear dynamics and turbulent heating. Aims. We aim to show that magnetic field fluctuations in the solar wind are consistent with Alfv\'enic fluctuations that naturally form switchback inversions in the magnetic field through expansion effects. Methods. We examine PSP observations of the evolution of a single stream of solar wind in a radial scan from PSP's tenth perihelion encounter from approximately 15-50 solar radii. We study the growth and radial scaling of normalized fluctuation amplitudes in the magnetic field, $\delta B/B$, within the framework of spherical polarization. We compare heating rates computed via outer-scale decay from consideration of wave-action to proton heating rates empirically observed through considering adiabatic expansion. Results. We find that the magnetic field fluctuations are largely spherically polarized and that the normalized amplitudes of the magnetic field, $\delta B/B$, increases with amplitude. The growth of the magnetic field amplitude leads to switchback inversions in the magnetic field. While the amplitudes do not grow as fast as predicted by the conservation of wave action, the deviation from the expected scaling yields an effective heating rate, which is close to the empirically observed proton heating rate. Conclusions. The observed scaling of fluctuation amplitudes is largely consistent with a picture of expanding Alfv\'en waves that seed turbulence leading to dissipation. The expansion of the waves leads to the growth of wave-amplitudes, resulting in the formation of switchbacks.</description>

      <title>Surface brightness-colour relations of Cepheids calibrated by optical interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface brightness-colour relations (SBCRs) are widely used to determine the angular diameters of stars. They are in particular used in the Baade-Wesselink (BW) method of distance determination of Cepheids. However, the impact of the SBCR on the BW distance of Cepheids is about 8%, depending on the choice of SBCR considered in the literature. We aim to calibrate a precise SBCR dedicated to Cepheids using the best quality interferometric measurements available as well as different photometric bands, including the Gaia bands. We selected interferometric and photometric data in the literature for seven Cepheids covering different pulsation periods. From the phased photometry in the different bands (VJHKG$\mathrm{G_{BP}G_{RP}}$) corrected from extinction and the interferometric limb-darkened angular diameters, we calculated the SBCR associated with each combination of colours. We first find that the seven Cepheids have consistent SBCRs as long as the two magnitudes considered are not too close in wavelengths. For the SBCR ($\mathrm{F_{V},V-K}$): $\mathrm{F_{V} = -0.1336_{\pm 0.0009}(V-K)_{0}+3.9572_{\pm 0.0015}}$, we obtain a root mean square (RMS) of 0.0040 mag, which is three times lower than the latest estimate from 2004. Also, for the first time, we present an SBCR dedicated to Cepheids based on Gaia bands only: $\mathrm{F_{G_{BP}} = -0.3001_{\pm 0.0030}(G_{BP}-G_{RP})_{0}+3.9977_{\pm 0.0029}}$, with an excellent RMS of 0.0061 mag. However, using theoretical models, we show that this SBCR is highly sensitive to metallicity. From this empirical multi-wavelength approach, we also show that the impact of the CircumStellar Environment (CSE) of Cepheids emission is not negligible and should be taken into account in the future.</description>

      <title>Study of Solar Energetic Particles: their Source Regions, Flares and CMEs during Solar Cycles 23-24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the association between solar active regions and 152 solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and solar energetic particle (SEP) events over solar cycles 23-24 (1997-2017). The CDAW center's GOES data in the energy channel &gt;10 MeV (Major SEPs; solar proton events) with flux &gt;= 10 pfu was used for our investigation. For the associated activities, we have analyzed the data from space born satellites namely: SOHO/LASCO and SDO/AIA. We found a moderate correlation (55 %) between SXR flux and sunspot area i.e., active regions with larger sunspot areas generally generate larger flares. We found that most of the SEPs are originated from the magnetically complex active regions i.e., hale class beta-gamma-delta and beta. Very few events were associated with unipolar active regions. Stronger GOES X-ray is linked to more impulsive events, as evidenced by the negative correlation (-0.40) between X-ray flux and SEP duration. In the active region beta-gamma-delta, the highest average SEP intensity (2051 pfu) was detected. In the data set used, only 10 % SEPs are found impulsive in nature, while the remaining 90 % are gradual in nature. All the impulsive events had SEP intensity less than 100 pfu and most of the CMEs associated with these events were decelerated CMEs. We discovered that the majority of faster CMEs are linked to the most complex magnetic active regions. This indicates that high speed CMEs are produced by magnetically complex active regions. We discovered that 58 SEP events in our data set are linked to accelerated CMEs, while 82 are linked to decelerated CMEs. The highest average CME width is found corresponding to magnetically most complex active regions beta-delta, gamma-delta, alpha-gamma-delta and beta-gamma-delta, which shows that large CMEs are the consequences of magnetically complex active regions.</description>

      <title>The impact of new ($\alpha$, n) reaction rates on the weak s-process in metal-poor massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars are significant sites for the weak s-process (ws-process). $^{22}$Ne and $^{16}$O are, respectively, the main neutron source and poison for the ws-process. In the metal-poor stars, the abundance of $^{22}$Ne is limited by the metallicity, so that the contribution of $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg reaction on the s-process is small. Conversely, the $^{17}$O($\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne reaction is more evident in more metal-poor stars due to the most abundant $^{16}$O in all metallicities. In this work, we calculate the evolution of four metal-poor models ($Z=10^{-3}$) for the Zero-Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS) masses of $M ({\rm ZAMS})=$ 15, 20, 25, and 30 M$_{\odot}$ to investigate the effect of reaction rates on the ws-process. We adopt the new $^{17}$O($\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne and $^{17}$O($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{21}$Ne reaction rates suggested by Wiescher et al. (2023) and $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg and $^{22}$Ne($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{26}$Mg from Best et al. (2013). The yields of the s-process isotope with updated reaction rates are compared with the results using default reaction rates from JINA REACLIB. We find that the effects of new $^{17}$O+$\alpha$ are much more significant than those of new $^{22}$Ne+$\alpha$ reaction rates in the non-rotation stars.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Effects of Temperature, Clouds, and Gravity on K I doublet in L dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of surface gravity, effective temperature, and cloudiness on the potassium doublet (\ion{K}{1}) at 1.17 {\mu}m in brown dwarf spectra. Using pseudo-Voigt profiles to fit the \ion{K}{1} doublet in Sonora Diamondback atmospheric model spectra, we find that gravity and cloudiness affect the spectra differently in mid to late-L dwarfs. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) is strongly correlated with surface gravity, while the maximum depth strongly correlates with cloudiness. This method allows us to separate the effects of clouds and surface gravity on the \ion{K}{1} 1.17 {\mu}m doublet. We also find that the FWHM and maximum depth of the doublet can help to estimate the effective temperature and surface gravity in early to mid-L dwarfs.</description>

      <title>JWST's sharper view of EX Lup: cold water from ice sublimation during accretion outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unstable accretion phases during pre-main-sequence evolution of T Tauri stars produce variable irradiation and heating of planet-forming regions. A strong accretion outburst was observed with Spitzer-IRS in 2008 in EX Lup, the prototype of EXor variables, and found to increase the mid-infrared water and OH emission and decrease organic emission, suggesting large chemical changes. We present here two JWST-MIRI epochs of quiescent EX Lup in 2022 and 2023 obtained over a decade after the 2008 outburst and several months after a moderate burst in 2022. With JWST's sharper spectral view, we can now analyze water emission as a function of temperature in the two MIRI epochs and, approximately, also in the previous Spitzer epochs. This new analysis shows a strong cold water vapor ``burst" in low-energy lines during the 2008 outburst, which we consider clear evidence for enhanced ice sublimation due to a recession of the snowline, as found in protostellar envelopes. JWST shows that EX Lup still has an unusually strong emission from cold water in comparison to other T Tauri disks, suggesting &gt; 10-yr-long freeze-out timescales in the inner disk surface. EX Lup demonstrates that outbursts can significantly change the observed organic-to-water ratios and increase the cold water reservoir, providing chemical signatures to study the recent accretion history of disks. This study provides an unprecedented demonstration of the chemical evolution triggered by accretion outbursts in the Class II phase and of the high potential of time-domain experiments to reveal processes that may have fundamental implications on planet-forming bodies near the snowline.</description>

      <title>SolarZip: An Efficient and Adaptive Compression Framework for solar EUV imaging data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: With the advancement of solar physics research, next-generation solar space missions and ground-based telescopes face significant challenges in efficiently transmitting and/or storing large-scale observational data. Aims: We develop an efficient compression and evaluation framework for solar EUV data, specifically optimized for Solar Orbiter Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) data, significantly reducing data volume while preserving scientific usability. Methods: We systematically evaluated four error-bounded lossy compressors across two EUI datasets. However, the existing methods cannot perfectly handle the EUI datasets (with continuously changing distance and significant resolution differences). Motivated by this, we develop an adaptive hybrid compression strategy with optimized interpolation predictors. Moreover, we designed a two-stage evaluation framework integrating distortion analysis with downstream scientific workflows, ensuring that observational analysis is not affected at high compression ratios. Results: Our framework SolarZip achieved up to 800x reduction for Full Sun Imager (FSI) data and 500x for High Resolution Imager (HRI$_{\text{EUV}}$) data. It significantly outperformed both traditional and advanced algorithms, achieving 3-50x higher compression ratios than traditional algorithms, surpassing the second-best algorithm by up to 30%. Simulation experiments verified that SolarZip can reduce data transmission time by up to 270x while ensuring the preservation of scientific usability. Conclusions: The SolarZip framework significantly enhances solar observational data compression efficiency while preserving scientific usability by dynamically selecting optimal compression methods based on observational scenarios and user requirements. This provides a promising data management solution for deep space missions like Solar Orbiter.</description>

      <title>The chaotic history of the retrograde multi-planet system in K2-290A driven by distant stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.03586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equator of star K2-290A was recently found to be inclined by 124+/-6 degrees relative to the orbits of both its known transiting planets. The presence of a companion star B at ~100 au suggested that the birth protoplanetary disk could have tilted, thus providing an explanation for the peculiar retrograde state of this multi-planet system. In this work, we show that a primordial misalignment is not required and that the observed retrograde state is a natural consequence of the chaotic stellar obliquity evolution driven by a wider-orbit companion C at ~2000 au long after the disk disperses. The star C drives eccentricity and/or inclination oscillations on the inner binary orbit, leading to widespread chaos from the periodic resonance passages between the stellar spin and planetary secular modes. Based on a population synthesis study, we find that the observed stellar obliquity is reached in ~40-70% of the systems, making this mechanism a robust outcome of the secular dynamics,regardless of the spin-down history of the central star. This work highlights the unusual role that very distant companions can have on the orbits of close-in planets and the host star's spin evolution, connecting four orders of magnitude in distance scale over billions of orbits. We finally comment on the application to other exoplanet systems, including multi-planet systems in wide binaries.</description>
