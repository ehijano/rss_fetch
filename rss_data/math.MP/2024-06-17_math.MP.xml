      <title>Kac-Moody and Virasoro algebras on the two-sphere and the two-torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We particularise the construction of generalised Kac-Moody algebras associated to compact real manifolds to the case of the two-torus $\mathbb T_2$ and the two-sphere ${\mathbb S}^2$. It is shown that these algebras, as well as a Virasoro algebra associated to the two-torus and the two-sphere, can also be derived considering the usual Kac-Moody and Virasoro algebras.</description>

      <title>Determination of the Hamiltonian from the Equations of Motion with Illustration from Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the determination of Hamiltonian from a given equations of motion. It can be cast into a problem of matrix factorization after reinterpretation of the system as first order evolutionary equations in the phase space coordinates. We state the criterion on the evolution matrix for a Hamiltonian to exist. In addition, the proof is constructive and an explicit Hamiltonian with accompanied symplectic structure can be obtained. As an application, we will study a class of PT-symmetric systems for illustration.</description>

      <title>Quantum interpretation of lattice paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1980s, Viennot developed a combinatorial approach to studying mixed moments of orthogonal polynomials using Motzkin paths. Recently, an alternative combinatorial model for these mixed moments based on lecture hall paths was introduced in arXiv:2311.12761. For sequences of orthogonal polynomials, we establish here a bijection between the Motzin paths and the lecture hall paths via a novel symmetric lecture hall graph. We use this connection to calculate the moments of the position operator in various separable quantum systems, such as the quantum harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom, showing that they may be expressed as generating functions of Motzkin paths and symmetric lecture hall paths, thereby providing a quantum interpretation for these paths. Our approach can be extended to other quantum systems where the wavefunctions are expressed in terms of orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Generating QES potentials supporting zero energy normalizable states for an extended class of truncated Calogero Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is commonly held that quantum states with energy $E = 0$ would belong to the continuum. However, several situations have been reported when a zero-energy state becomes bound subject to certain restrictions on the coupling constants defining the potential. In the present work, we present another evidence of the existence of regular zero-energy normalizable solutions for a system of QES potentials that correspond to rationally extended many-body truncated Calogero-Sutherland model. Our procedure is based upon the potential group approach with an underlying so$(2, 1)$ structure that utilizes the three cases guided by it on profitably carrying out a point canonical transformation. We deal with each case separately by suitably restricting the coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>A spin chain with non-Hermitian $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetric boundary couplings: exact solution, dissipative Kondo effect, and phase transitions on the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an exactly solvable $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetric non-Hermitian model where a spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ isotropic quantum Heisenberg spin chain is coupled to two spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ Kondo impurities at its boundaries with coupling strengths that are complex conjugates of each other. Solving the model by means of a combination of the Bethe Ansatz and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques, we show that the model exhibits three distinct boundary phases: a $\mathscr{PT}$ symmetric phase with a dissipative Kondo effect, a phase with bound modes and spontaneously broken $\mathscr{PT}$ symmetry, and a phase with an effectively unscreened spin (i.e. a free local moment). In the Kondo and the unscreened phases, the $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetry is unbroken, and hence all states have real energies, whereas in the bound mode phases, in addition to the states with real energies, there exist states with complex energy eigenvalues that appear in complex conjugate pairs, signaling spontaneous breaking of the $\mathscr{PT}-$symmetry. The exact solution is used to provide an accessible benchmark for DMRG with a non-Hermitian matrix product operator representation that demonstrates an accuracy comparable to its Hermitian limit thus showing the power of DMRG to handle non-Hermitian many body calculations.</description>

      <title>Flux-balance laws for spinning bodies under the gravitational self-force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion of an extended, but still weakly gravitating body in general relativity can often be determined by a set of conserved quantities. If they are sufficient in number, this allows for a complete solution to the equations of motion, much like for geodesic motion. Under the gravitational self-force (relaxing the "weakly gravitating" assumption), these "conserved quantities" evolve with time. This evolution can be calculated using the (local) self-force on the body, but such an approach is computationally intensive. To avoid this, one often instead uses flux-balance laws: relationships between the average evolution (capturing the dissipative dynamics) and the values of the field far away from the body, which are far easier to compute. In the absence of spin, such a flux-balance law has been proven in [Isoyama et al., 2019] for any of the conserved action variables appearing in a Hamiltonian formulation of geodesic motion in the Kerr spacetime. In this paper, we attempt to extend this flux-balance law to linear order in spin, in the context of an arbitrary black hole spacetime, and in a way that directly relates the average rates of change to the flux of a conserved current through the horizon and to infinity. In the absence of spin, we reproduce results consistent with those in [Isoyama et al., 2019]. To linear order in spin we show that most, but not all, constants of motion at linear order in spin appear to possess flux-balance laws.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem with explicit Lyapunov exponent and variance for products of $2\times2$ random non-invertible matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of products of random matrices and Lyapunov exponents have been widely studied and applied in the fields of biology, dynamical systems, economics, engineering and statistical physics. We consider the product of an i.i.d. sequence of $2\times 2$ random non-invertible matrices with real entries. Given some mild moment assumptions we prove an explicit formula for the Lyapunov exponent and prove a central limit theorem with an explicit formula for the variance in terms of the entries of the matrices. We also give examples where exact values for the Lyapunov exponent and variance are computed. An important example where non-invertible matrices are essential is the random Hill's equation, which has numerous physical applications, including the astrophysical orbit problem.</description>

      <title>Two-time second-order correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Derivation of two-time second-order correlation function by following approaches such as stochastic differential equation, coherent-state propagator, and quasi-statistical distribution function is presented. In the process, the time dependence of the operators is transferred to the density operator by making use of trace operation in which the coherent state propagator and $Q$-function that represent the quantum system under consideration are expressed in terms of different time parameters. Even though the number of resulting integrations are found to be large, the accompanying implementation turns out to be straightforward in view that the associated $c$-number functions are Gaussian by nature. In relation to the asserted possibility of rewriting the result of one of the approaches in terms of the other, the presented derivation is expected to lay a strong foundation for viable technique of calculating correlations of various moments at different times that can be deployed in revealing quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Modularity of admissible-level $\mathfrak{sl}_{3}$ minimal models with denominator $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the newly developed technique of inverse quantum hamiltonian reduction to investigate the representation theory of the simple affine vertex algebra $\mathsf{A}_{2}(\mathsf{u},2)$ associated to $\mathfrak{sl}_{3}$ at level $\mathsf{k} = -3+\frac{\mathsf{u}}{2}$, for $\mathsf{u}\ge3$ odd. Starting from the irreducible modules of the corresponding simple Bershadsky-Polyakov vertex operator algebras, we show that inverse reduction constructs all irreducible lower-bounded weight $\mathsf{A}_{2}(\mathsf{u},2)$-modules. This proceeds by first constructing a complete set of coherent families of fully relaxed highest-weight $\mathsf{A}_{2}(\mathsf{u},2)$-modules and then noting that the reducible members of these families degenerate to give all remaining irreducibles. Using this fully relaxed construction and the degenerations, we deduce modular S-transforms for certain natural generalised characters of these irreducibles and their spectral flows. With this modular data in hand, we verify that the (conjectural) standard Verlinde formula predicts Grothendieck fusion rules with nonnegative-integer multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions of higher-dimensional coupled system of nonlinear time-fractional diffusion-convection-wave equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article develops how to generalize the invariant subspace method for deriving the analytical solutions of the multi-component (N+1)-dimensional coupled nonlinear time-fractional PDEs (NTFPDEs) in the sense of Caputo fractional-order derivative for the first time. Specifically, we describe how to systematically find different invariant product linear spaces with various dimensions for the considered system. Also, we observe that the obtained invariant product linear spaces help to reduce the multi-component (N+1)-dimensional coupled NTFPDEs into a system of fractional-order ODEs, which can then be solved using the well-known analytical methods. More precisely, we illustrate the effectiveness and importance of this developed method for obtaining a long list of invariant product linear spaces for the multi-component (2+1)-dimensional coupled nonlinear time-fractional diffusion-convection-wave equations. In addition, we have shown how to find different kinds of generalized separable analytical solutions for a multi-component (2 + 1)-dimensional coupled nonlinear time-fractional diffusion-convection-wave equations along with the initial and boundary conditions using invariant product linear spaces obtained. Finally, we provide appropriate graphical representations of some of the derived generalized separable analytical solutions with various fractional-order values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin glass models with quadratic-type Hamiltonians are disordered statistical physics systems with competing ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic spin interactions. The corresponding Gibbs measures belong to the exponential family parametrized by (inverse) temperature $\beta&gt;0$ and external field $h\in\mathbb{R}$. Given a sample from these Gibbs measures, a statistically fundamental question is to infer the temperature and external field parameters. In 2007, Chatterjee (Ann. Statist. 35 (2007), no.5, 1931-1946) first proved that in the absence of external field $h=0$, the maximum pseudolikelihood estimator for $\beta$ is $\sqrt{N}$-consistent under some mild assumptions on the disorder matrices. It was left open whether the same method can be used to estimate the temperature and external field simultaneously. In this paper, under some easily verifiable conditions, we prove that the bivariate maximum pseudolikelihood estimator is indeed jointly $\sqrt{N}$-consistent for the temperature and external field parameters. The examples cover the classical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and its diluted variants.</description>

      <title>On the refined analyticity radius of 3-D generalized Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the instantaneous growth of analyticity radius for three dimensional generalized Navier-Stokes equations. For the subcritical $H^{\gamma}(\mathbb R^3)$ case with $\gamma&gt;\frac12,$ we prove that there exists a positive time $t_0$ so that for any $t\in]0, t_0]$, the radius of analyticity of the solution $u$ satisfies the pointwise-in-time lower bound $${\mathrm{rad}}(u)(t)\ge \sqrt{(2\gamma-1)t\bigl(|\ln t|+\ln|\ln t|+K_t\bigr)},$$ where $K_t \to \infty$ as $t\to 0^+$. This in particular gives a nontrivial improvement of the previous result by Herbst and Skibsted in \cite{HS} for the case $\gamma\in ]1/2,3/2[$ and also settles the decade-long open question in \cite{HS}, namely, whether or not
  $\liminf_{t\to 0^+}\frac {{\mathrm{ rad}}(u)(t)}{\sqrt{t|\ln t|}}\ge \sqrt{2\gamma-1}$ for all $\gamma\ge \frac32$. For the critical case $H^{\frac 12}(\mathbb R^3)$, we prove that there exists $t_1&gt;0$ so that for any $t\in ]0, t_1],$ ${\mathrm {rad}}(u)(t)\ge \lambda(t)\sqrt{t}$ with $\lambda(t)$ satisfying $\lim_{t\to 0^+}\lambda(t)=\infty.$</description>

      <title>Embedding formalism for AdS superspaces in five dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard geometric description of $d$-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space is a quadric in ${\mathbb R}^{d-1,2}$ defined by $(X^0)^2 - (X^1)^2 - \dots - (X^{d-1})^2 + (X^d)^2 = \ell^2 = \text{const}$. In this paper we provide a supersymmetric generalisation of this embedding construction in the $d=5$ case. Specifically, a bi-supertwistor realisation is given for the ${\cal N}$-extended AdS superspace $\text{AdS}^{5|8\cal N}$, with ${\cal N}\geq 1$. The proposed formalism offers a simple construction of AdS super-invariants. As an example, we present a model for a massive superparticle in $\text{AdS}^{5|8\cal N}$ which is manifestly invariant under the AdS isometry supergroup $\mathsf{SU}(2,2|{\cal N})$.</description>

      <title>Internally heated convection with rotation: bounds and scaling laws for heat transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates heat transport in rotating internally heated convection, for a horizontally periodic fluid between parallel plates under no-slip and isothermal boundary conditions. The main results are the proof of bounds on the mean temperature, $\overline{\langle T \rangle }$, and the heat flux out of the bottom boundary, $\mathcal{F}_B$ at infinite Prandtl numbers where the Prandtl number is the nondimensional ratio of viscous to thermal diffusion. The lower bounds are functions of a Rayleigh number quantifying the ratio of internal heating to diffusion and the Ekman number, $E$, which quantifies the ratio of viscous diffusion to rotation. We utilise two different estimates on the vertical velocity, $w$, one pointwise in the domain (Yan 2004, J. Math. Phys., vol. 45(7), pp. 2718-2743) and the other an integral estimate over the domain (Constantin et al . 1999, Phys. D: Non. Phen., vol. 125, pp. 275-284), resulting in bounds valid for different regions of buoyancy-to-rotation dominated convection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that similar to rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, for small $E$, the critical Rayleigh number for the onset of convection asymptotically scales as $E^{-4/3}$.This result is combined with heuristic arguments for internally heated and rotating convection to arrive at scaling laws for $\overline{\langle T \rangle }$ and $\mathcal{F}_B$ valid for arbitrary Prandtl numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the time evolution of an open quantum system subject to a sequence of random quantum channels with a stationary distribution. This incorporates disorder into the repeated interactions (or, quantum collision models) approach to understanding open quantum dynamics. In the literature, various specific models of disorder in repeated interaction models have been considered, including the cases where the sequence of quantum channels form either i.i.d. or Markovian stochastic processes. In the present paper we consider the general structure of such models without any specific assumptions on the probability distribution, aside from stationarity (i.e., time-translation invariance). In particular, arbitrarily strong correlations between time steps are allowed. In 2021, Movassagh and Schenker (MS) introduced a unified framework in which one may study such randomized quantum dynamics, and, under a key strong decoherence assumption proved an ergodic theorem for a large class of physically relevant examples. Here, we recognize the decoherence assumption of MS as a kind of irreducibility and develop a reducibility theory for general stationary random repeated interaction models without this condition. Within this framework, we establish ergodic theorems extending of those obtained by MS to the general stationary setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of research started in [7] devoted to explicit asymptotic formulas for standing coastal-trapped waves. Our main goal is to construct formal asymptotic eigenfunctions of the wave operator $\langle \nabla, D(x)\nabla\rangle$ (the spatial part of the wave operator) corresponding to the eigenvalue $\omega\to\infty$ in a nearly integrable case.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in $(1+1)$-dimensional Free Scalar Field Theory: Tiptoeing between Continuum and Discrete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review some classic works on ground state entanglement entropy in $(1+1)$-dimensional free scalar field theory. We point out identifications between the methods for the calculation of entanglement entropy and we show how the formalism developed for the discretized theory can be utilized in order to obtain results in the continuous theory. We specify the entanglement spectrum and we calculate the entanglement entropy for the theory defined on an interval of finite length $L$. Finally, we derive the modular Hamiltonian directly, without using the modular flow, via the continuous limit of the expressions obtained in the discretized theory. In a specific coordinate system, the modular Hamiltonian assumes the form of a free field Hamiltonian on the Rindler wedge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study solutions of $\tfrac12 (-i\nabla - A(x))^2f=\lambda f$ on domains $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions and prove exponential decay estimates in terms of an Agmon type distance to a classically allowed region. This metric depends only on the eigenvalue and associated magnetic field. In fact the main quantity in the weight for this distance function can be interpreted as an `average magnetic flux' of the magnetic field along all domains whose boundary is the closed curved formed by joing the `minimal path' to another random path. Our estimates are based on an analysis of the associated heat kernel using the Feynman-Kac-It\'o formula.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on M5-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The M5-brane has been argued to potentially provide much-needed theoretical underpinning for various non-perturbative phenomena in strongly-coupled quantum systems and yet the primary non-perturbative effect already in its classical on-shell formulation has received little attention: The flux-quantization of the higher gauge field on its worldvolume.
  This problem appears subtle because of (1a.) the notorious self-duality of the 3-form flux density in the small field limit, combined with (1b.) its highly non-linear self-duality for strong fields, and (2a.) the twisting of its Bianchi identity by the pullback of the 11d SuGra C-field flux density, which (2b.) is subject to its own subtle flux quantization law on the ambient spacetime.
  These subtleties call into question the tacit assumption that the M5 brane's 3-flux is quantized in ordinary cohomology and hence leaves open the rather fundamental question of what the M5-brane's worldvolume higher gauge field really is.
  Here we characterize the valid quantization laws of the M5-brane's 3-flux in (non-abelian) generalized twisted cohomology. The key step is to pass to super-spacetime and there to combine the character map with the "super-embedding"-construction of the on-shell M5-brane fields, of which we give a rigorous and streamlined re-rederivation.
  We show that one admissible quantization law of the 3-flux on M5-branes is by 4-Cohomotopy-twisted 3-Cohomotopy, as predicted by "Hypothesis H". Besides quantizing the bulk fluxes (G4,G7) and the brane's H3-flux themselves, this law also implies the (level-)quantization of the induced Page-charge/Hopf-WZ term on the M5-brane, necessary for its action functional to be globally well-defined.
  Finally, we demonstrate how with this flux quantization imposed, there generically appear skyrmionic solitons on M5-branes and anyonic topological quantum states on open M5-branes.</description>

      <title>A modified Cayley transform for SU(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a modification to the Cayley transform that defines a suitable local parameterization for the special unitary group $\mathrm{SU(3)}$. The new mapping is used to construct splitting methods for separable Hamiltonian systems whose phase space is the cotangent bundle of $\mathrm{SU(3)}$ or, more general, $\mathrm{SU(3)}^N$, $N \in \mathbb{N}$. Special attention is given to the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm for gauge field generation in lattice quantum chromodynamics. We show that the use of the modified Cayley transform instead of the matrix exponential neither affects the time-reversibility nor the volume-preservation of the splitting method. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of the Cayley-based algorithms are discussed and illustrated in pure gauge field simulations.</description>

      <title>On existence of Sadovskii vortex patch: A touching pair of symmetric counter-rotating uniform vortex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sadovskii vortex patch is a traveling wave for the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations consisting of an odd symmetric pair of vortex patches touching the symmetry axis. Its existence was first suggested by numerical computations of Sadovskii in [J. Appl. Math. Mech., 1971], and has gained significant interest due to its relevance in inviscid limit of planar flows via Prandtl--Batchelor theory and as the asymptotic state for vortex ring dynamics. In this work, we prove the existence of a Sadovskii vortex patch, by solving the energy maximization problem under the exact impulse condition and an upper bound on the circulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the hydrodynamic limit for a one-dimensional harmonic chain of interacting atoms with a random flip of the momentum sign. The system is open: at the left boundary it is attached to a heat bath at temperature $T_-$, while at the right endpoint it is subject to an action of a force which reads as $\bar F + \frac 1{\sqrt n} \widetilde{\mathcal F} (n^2 t)$, where $\bar F \ge0$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal F}(t)$ is a periodic function. Here $n$ is the size of the microscopic system. Under a diffusive scaling of space-time, we prove that the empirical profiles of the two locally conserved quantities - the volume stretch and the energy - converge, as $n\to+\infty$, to the solution of a non-linear diffusive system of conservative partial differential equations with a Dirichlet type and Neumann boundary conditions on the left and the right endpoints, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we classify linear categorified open topological field theories in dimension two by pivotal Grothendieck-Verdier categories. In combination with recently developed string-net techniques, this leads to a new description of the spaces of conformal blocks of Drinfeld centers $Z(\mathcal{C})$ of pivotal finite tensor categories $\mathcal{C}$ in terms of the modular envelope of the cyclic associative operad. If $\mathcal{C}$ is unimodular, we prove that the space of conformal blocks inherits the structure of a module over the algebra of class functions of $\mathcal{C}$ for every free boundary component. As a further application, we prove that the sewing along a boundary circle for the modular functor for $Z(\mathcal{C})$ can be decomposed into a sewing procedure along an interval and the application of the partial trace. Finally, we construct mapping class group representations from Grothendieck-Verdier categories that are not necessarily rigid and make precise how these generalize existing constructions.</description>

      <title>An approach to non-equilibrium statistical physics using variational Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the 'explicit' dynamics of the object with an 'implicit' flow on free energy gradients - a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</description>

      <title>Critical Fermions are Universal Embezzlers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal embezzlers are bipartite quantum systems from which any entangled state may be extracted to arbitrary precision using local operations while perturbing the state of the system arbitrarily little. Here, we show that universal embezzlers are ubiquitous in many-body physics: The ground state sector of every local, translation-invariant, and critical free-fermionic many-body system on a one-dimensional lattice is a universal embezzler if bi-partitioned into two half-chains. The same property holds in locally-interacting, dual spin chains via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Universal embezzlement manifests already for finite system sizes, not only in the thermodynamic limit: For any finite error and any targeted entangled state, a finite length of the chain is sufficient to embezzle said state within the given error. On a technical level, our main result establishes that the half-chain observable algebras associated with ground state sectors of the given models are type III$_1$ factors.</description>

      <title>A sparse approximation of the Lieb functional with moment constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present new sparsity results about the so-called Lieb functional, which is a key quantity in Density Functional Theory for electronic structure calculations of molecules. The Lieb functional was actually shown by Lieb to be a convexification of the so-called L\'evy-Lieb functional. Given an electronic density for a system of $N$ electrons, which may be seen as a probability density on $\mathbb{R}^3$, the value of the Lieb functional for this density is defined as the solution of a quantum multi-marginal optimal transport problem, which reads as a minimization problem defined on the set of trace-class operators acting on the space of electronic wave-functions that are anti-symmetric $L^2$ functions of $\mathbb{R}^{3N}$, with partial trace equal to the prescribed electronic density. We introduce a relaxation of this quantum optimal transport problem where the full partial trace constraint is replaced by a finite number of moment constraints on the partial trace of the set of operators. We show that, under mild assumptions on the electronic density, there exist sparse minimizers to the resulting moment constrained approximation of the Lieb (MCAL) functional that read as operators with rank at most equal to the number of moment constraints. We also prove under appropriate assumptions on the set of moment functions that the value of the MCAL functional converges to the value of the exact Lieb functional as the number of moments go to infinity. We also prove some rates of convergence on the associated approximation of the ground state energy. We finally study the mathematical properties of the associated dual problem and introduce a suitable numerical algorithm in order to solve some simple toy models.</description>

Abstract: We consider the dimer model on a bipartite graph embedded into a locally flat Riemann surface with conical singularities and satisfying certain geometric conditions in the spirit of the work of Chelkak, Laslier and Russkikh, see arXiv:2001.11871. Following the approach developed by Dub\'edat in his work ["Dimers and families of Cauchy-Riemann operators I". In: J. Amer. Math. Soc. 28 (2015), pp. 1063-1167] we establish the convergence of dimer height fluctuations to the compactified free field in the small mesh size limit. This work is inspired by the series of works of Berestycki, Laslier, and Ray (see arXiv:1908.00832 and arXiv:2207.09875), where a similar problem is addressed, and the convergence to a conformally invariant limit is established in the Temperlian setup, but the identification of the limit as the compactified free field is missing. This identification is the main result of our paper.</description>

We prove that these systems admit non-trivial symplectic-Haantjes manifolds, which are symplectic manifolds endowed with an algebra of Haantjes (1,1)-tensors. These geometric structures allow us to determine separation variables for known systems algorithmically; besides, the underlying St\"ackel geometry is used to construct new families of integrable Hamiltonian models immersed in a magnetic field.</description>

We also prove the star-star relation for the Boltzmann weights of the Ising-type model, conjectured by Bazhanov and Sergeev, and use it to verify certain properties of the solutions obtained.</description>

Abstract: We give a description of the Halln\"as--Ruijsenaars eigenfunctions of the 2-particle hyperbolic Ruijsenaars system as matrix coefficients for the order 4 element $S\in SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ acting on the Hilbert space of $GL(2)$ quantum Teichm\"uller theory on the punctured torus. The $GL(2)$ Macdonald polynomials are then obtained as special values of the analytic continuation of these matrix coefficients. The main tool used in the proof is the cluster structure on the moduli space of framed $GL(2)$-local systems on the punctured torus, and an $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-equivariant embedding of the $GL(2)$ spherical DAHA into the quantized coordinate ring of the corresponding cluster Poisson variety.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop the framework for quantum integrable systems on an integrable classical background. We call them hybrid quantum integrable systems (hybrid integrable systems), and we show that they occur naturally in the semiclassical limit of quantum integrable systems. We start with an outline of the concept of hybrid dynamical systems. Then we give several examples of hybrid integrable systems. The first series of examples is a class of hybrid integrable systems that appear in the semiclassical limit of quantum spin chains. Then we look at the semiclassical limit of the quantum spin Calogero--Moser system. The result is a hybrid integrable system driven by usual classical Calogero--Moser (CM) dynamics. This system at the fixed point of the multi-time classical dynamics CM system gives commuting spin Hamiltonians of Haldane--Shastry model.</description>

      <title>An integral-free representation of the Dyson series using divided differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.09888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dyson series is an infinite sum of multi-dimensional time-ordered integrals, which serves as a formal representation of the quantum time-evolution operator in the interaction-picture. Using the mathematical tool of divided differences, we introduce an alternative representation for the series that is entirely free from both time ordering and integrals. In this new formalism, the Dyson expansion is given as a sum of efficiently-computable divided differences of the exponential function, considerably simplifying the calculation of the Dyson expansion terms, while also allowing for time-dependent perturbation calculations to be performed directly in the Schr{\"o}dinger-picture. We showcase the utility of this novel representation by studying a number of use cases. We also discuss several immediate applications.</description>

      <title>On positive Lyapunov exponents along $E^{cu}$ and non-uniformly expanding for partially hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.11149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider $C^{1}$ diffeomorphisms on compact Riemannian manifolds of any dimension that admit a dominated splitting $E^{cs} \oplus E^{cu}.$ We prove that if the Lyapunov exponents along $E^{cu}$ are positive for Lebesgue almost every point, then a map $f$ is non-uniformly expanding along $E^{cu}$ under the assumption that the cocycle $Df_{|E^{cu}(f)}^{-1}$ has a dominated splitting with index 1 on the support of an ergodic Lyapunov maximizing observable measure. As a result, there exists a physical SRB measure for a $C^{1+\alpha}$ diffeomorphism map $f$ that admits a dominated splitting $E^{s} \oplus E^{cu}$ under assumptions that $f$ has non-zero Lyapunov exponents for Lebesgue almost every point and that the cocycle $Df_{|E^{cu}(f)}^{-1}$ has a dominated splitting with index 1 on the support of an ergodic Lyapunov maximizing observable measure.</description>

      <title>Brownian Motion in the Hilbert Space of Quantum States along with the Ricci Flow and Stochastically Emergent Einstein-Hilbert Action: Formulating a Well-Defined Feynman Path-Integral Measure for Quantum Fields in the Presence of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.09860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to interpret the background gravitational effects appearing in quantum field theory on curved space-time by studying the Brownian motion of quantum states along with the Hamilton-Perelman Ricci flow. It has been shown that the Wiener measure automatically contains the Einstein-Hilbert action and the path-integral formulation of the scalar quantum field theory on curved space-time at the first order of local approximations. This provides a well-defined formulation of the path-integral measure for quantum field theory in the presence of gravity. However, we establish that the emergence of Einstein-Hilbert action is independent of the matter field interactions and is a merely entropic/geometric effect stemming from the nature of the Ricci flow of the universe geometry. We also extract an explicit formula for the cosmological constant in terms of the Ricci flow and the Hamilton theorem for 3-manifolds. Then, we discuss the cosmological features of the FLRW solution in the LambdaCDM Model via the derived equations of the Ricci flow. We also argue the correlation between our formulations and the entropic aspects of gravity. Finally, we provide some theoretical evidence that proves the second law of thermodynamics is the basic source of gravity and probably a more fundamental concept.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.00058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a variational treatment of confined magnetic skyrmions in a minimal micromagnetic model of ultrathin ferromagnetic films with interfacial Dzylashinksii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in competition with the exchange energy, with a possible addition of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Under Dirichlet boundary conditions that are motivated by the asymptotic treatment of the stray field energy in the thin film limit we prove existence of topologically non-trivial energy minimizers that concentrate on points in the domain as the DMI strength parameter tends to zero. Furthermore, we derive the leading order non-trivial term in the $\Gamma$-expansion of the energy in the limit of vanishing DMI strength that allows us to completely characterize the limiting magnetization profiles and interpret them as particle-like states whose radius and position are determined by minimizing a renormalized energy functional. In particular, we show that in our setting the skyrmions are strongly repelled from the domain boundaries, which imparts them with stability that is highly desirable for applications. We provide explicit calculations of the renormalized energy for a number of basic domain geometries.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the disordered generalized Poland--Scheraga model for DNA denaturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Poland--Scheraga model, introduced in the 1970's, is a reference model to describe the denaturation transition of DNA. More recently, it has been generalized in order to allow for asymmetry in the strands lengths and in the formation of loops: the mathematical representation is based on a bivariate renewal process, that describes the pairs of bases that bond together. In this paper, we consider a disordered version of the model, in which the two strands interact via a potential $\beta V(\hat\omega_i,\bar\omega_j)+h$ when the $i$-th monomer of the first strand and the $j$-th monomer of the second strand meet. Here, $h\in\mathbb R$ is a homogeneous pinning parameter, $(\hat\omega_i)_{i\geq 1}$ and $(\bar\omega_j)_{j\geq 1}$ are two sequences of i.i.d.~random variables attached to each DNA strand, $V(\cdot,\cdot)$ is an interaction function and $\beta&gt;0$ is the disorder intensity. Our main result finds some condition on the underlying bivariate renewal so that, if one takes $\beta,h\downarrow0$ at some appropriate (explicit) rate as the length of the strands go to infinity, the partition function of the model admits a non-trivial, i.e. disordered, scaling limit. This is known as an \textit{intermediate disorder} regime and is linked to the question of disorder relevance for the denaturation transition. Interestingly and surprisingly, the rate at which one has to take $\beta\downarrow0$ depends on the interaction function $V(\cdot,\cdot)$ and on the distribution of $(\hat\omega_i)_{i\geq 1}$, $(\bar\omega_j)_{j\geq 1}$. On the other hand, the intermediate disorder limit of the partition function, when it exists, is universal: it is expressed as a chaos expansion of iterated integrals against a Gaussian process~$\mathcal{M}$, which arises as the scaling limit of the field $(e^{\beta V(\hat\omega_i,\bar\omega_j)})_{i,j\geq 0}$ and exhibits strong correlations on lines and columns.</description>

      <title>Continuous-variable quantum state designs: theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of quantum state designs to infinite-dimensional spaces. We first prove that, under the definition of continuous-variable (CV) state $t$-designs from Comm. Math. Phys. 326, 755 (2014), no state designs exist for $t\geq2$. Similarly, we prove that no CV unitary $t$-designs exist for $t\geq 2$. We propose an alternative definition for CV state designs, which we call rigged $t$-designs, and provide explicit constructions for $t=2$. As an application of rigged designs, we develop a design-based shadow-tomography protocol for CV states. Using energy-constrained versions of rigged designs, we define an average fidelity for CV quantum channels and relate this fidelity to the CV entanglement fidelity. As an additional result of independent interest, we establish a connection between torus $2$-designs and complete sets of mutually unbiased bases.</description>

      <title>A variational model of charged drops in dielectrically matched binary fluids: the effect of charge discreteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the ill-posedness of the classical Rayleigh variational model of conducting charged liquid drops by incorporating the discreteness of the elementary charges. Introducing the model that describes two immiscible fluids with the same dielectric constant, with a drop of one fluid containing a fixed number of elementary charges together with their solvation spheres, we interpret the equilibrium shape of the drop as a global minimizer of the sum of its surface energy and the electrostatic repulsive energy between the charges under fixed drop volume. For all model parameters, we establish existence of generalized minimizers that consist of at most a finite number of components ``at infinity''. We also give several existence and non-existence results for classical minimizers consisting of only a single component. In particular, we identify an asymptotically sharp threshold for the number of charges to yield existence of minimizers in a regime corresponding to macroscopically large drops containing a large number of charges. The obtained non-trivial threshold is significantly below the corresponding threshold for the Rayleigh model, consistently with the ill-posedness of the latter and demonstrating a particular regularizing effect of the charge discreteness. However, when a minimizer does exist in this regime, it approaches a ball with the charge uniformly distributed on the surface as the number of charges goes to infinity, just as in the Rayleigh model. Finally, we provide an explicit solution for the problem with two charges and a macroscopically large drop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the teleportation and superdense coding protocols for a family of anyon theories coming from Tambara-Yamagami categories, of which the lowest rank theories describe Ising anyons. In contrast to the usual approach to anyonic computation, we relax the requirement that we should be able to braid anyons. This is motivated by the goal of designing basic protocols that require less control over quasiparticles, and which may therefore be amenable to realisation in near-term systems. Since these implementations are braid-free, they are also compatible with Majorana modes on a 1d quantum wire.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the set of real and complex Hadamard matrices with additional symmetry constrains. In particular, we link the problem of existence of maximally entangled multipartite states of $2k$ subsystems with $d$ levels each to the set of complex Hadamard matrices of order $N=d^k$. To this end, we investigate possible subsets of such matrices which are, dual, strongly dual ($H=H^{\rm R}$ or $H=H^{\rm\Gamma}$), two-unitary ($H^R$ and $H^{\Gamma}$ are unitary), or $k$-unitary. Here $X^{\rm R}$ denotes reshuffling of a matrix $X$ describing a bipartite system, and $X^{\rm \Gamma}$ its partial transpose. Such matrices find several applications in quantum many-body theory, tensor networks and classification of multipartite quantum entanglement and imply a broad class of analytically solvable quantum models in $1+1$ dimensions.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides a variational treatment of the effect of external charges on the free charges in an infinite free-standing graphene sheet within the Thomas-Fermi theory. We establish existence, uniqueness and regularity of the energy minimizers corresponding to the free charge densities that screen the effect of an external electrostatic potential at the neutrality point. For the potential due to one or several off-layer point charges, we also prove positivity and a precise universal asymptotic decay rate for the screening charge density, as well as an exact charge cancellation by the graphene sheet. We also treat a simpler case of the non-zero background charge density and establish similar results in that case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the stationary measures for the free-energy increment process for the geometric last passage percolation (LPP) and log-gamma polymer model on a diagonal strip is given by a marginal of a two-layer Gibbs measure with a simple and explicit description. This result is shown subject to certain restrictions on the parameters controlling the weights on the boundary of the strip. However, from this description and an analytic continuation argument we are able to access the stationary measure for all boundary parameters. Taking an intermediate disorder limit of the log-gamma polymer stationary measure in a strip we readily recover (modulo convergence of the polymer to the open KPZ equation, Conjecture 4.2) the conjectural description from arXiv:2105.15178 of the open KPZ stationary measure for all choices of boundary parameters $u,v\in \mathbb{R}$ (thus going beyond the restriction $u+v\geq 0$ from arXiv:2103.12253).</description>

      <title>Reduced energies for thin ferromagnetic films with perpendicular anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive four reduced two-dimensional models that describe, at different spatial scales, the micromagnetics of ultrathin ferromagnetic materials of finite spatial extent featuring perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Starting with a microscopic model that regularizes the stray field near the material's lateral edges, we carry out an asymptotic analysis of the energy by means of $\Gamma$-convergence. Depending on the scaling assumptions on the size of the material domain vs. the strength of dipolar interaction, we obtain a hierarchy of the limit energies that exhibit progressively stronger stray field effects of the material edges. These limit energies feature, respectively, a renormalization of the out-of-plane anisotropy, an additional local boundary penalty term forcing out-of-plane alignment of the magnetization at the edge, a pinned magnetization at the edge, and, finally, a pinned magnetization and an additional field-like term that blows up at the edge, as the sample's lateral size is increased. The pinning of the magnetization at the edge restores the topological protection and enables the existence of magnetic skyrmions in bounded samples.</description>

      <title>Gelation in cluster coagulation processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of gelation in the cluster coagulation model introduced by Norris [$\textit{Comm. Math. Phys.}$, 209(2):407-435 (2000)], where pairs of clusters of types $(x,y)$ taking values in a measure space $E$, merge to form a new particle of type $z\in E$ according to a transition kernel $K(x,y, \mathrm{d} z)$.This model possesses enough generality to accommodate inhomogenieties in the evolution of clusters, including variations in their shape or spatial distribution. We derive general, sufficient criteria for stochastic gelation and strong gelation in this model. As particular cases, we extend results related to the classical Marcus--Lushnikov coagulation process, showing that reasonable `homogenous' coagulation processes with exponent $\gamma&gt;1$ yield gelation; and also, coagulation processes with kernel $\bar{K}(m,n)~\geq~(m \wedge n) \log{(m \wedge n)}^{3 +\epsilon}$ for $\epsilon&gt;0$. Finally, we use coupling arguments with inhomogeneous random graphs to deduce sufficient criterion for strong gelation (the emergence of a particle of size $O(N)$).</description>

      <title>Non-stationary difference equation and affine Laumon space II: Quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Shakirov's non-stationary difference equation, when it is truncated, implies the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov ($q$-KZ) equation for $U_{\mathsf v}(A_1^{(1)})$ with generic spins. Namely we can tune mass parameters so that the Hamiltonian acts on the space of finite Laurent polynomials. Then the representation matrix of the Hamiltonian agrees with the $R$-matrix, or the quantum $6j$ symbols. On the other hand, we prove that the $K$ theoretic Nekrasov partition function from the affine Laumon space is identified with the well-studied Jackson integral solution to the $q$-KZ equation. Combining these results, we establish that the affine Laumon partition function gives a solution to Shakirov's equation, which was a conjecture in our previous paper. We also work out the base-fiber duality and four dimensional limit in relation with the $q$-KZ equation.</description>

Abstract: Leibniz algebras can be seen as a ``non-commutative" analogue of Lie algebras. Nijenhuis operators on Leibniz algebras introduced by Cari\~{n}ena, Grabowski, and Marmo in [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 37(2004)] are (1, 1)-tensors with vanishing Nijenhuis torsion. Recently triangular Leibniz bialgebras were introduced by Tang and Sheng in [J. Noncommut. Geom. 16(2022)] via the twisting theory of twilled Leibniz algebras. In this paper we find that Leibniz algebras are very closely related to Nijenhuis operators, and prove that a triangular symplectic Leibniz bialgebra together with a dual triangular structure must possess Nijenhuis operators, which makes it possible to study the applications of Nijehhuis operators from the perspective of Leibniz algebras. At the same time, we regain the classical Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation by using the tensor form of classical $r$-matrics. At last we give the classification of triangular Leibniz bialgebras of low dimensions.</description>

      <title>Koopmon trajectories in nonadiabatic quantum-classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to alleviate the computational costs of fully quantum nonadiabatic dynamics, we present a mixed quantum-classical (MQC) particle method based on the theory of Koopman wavefunctions. Although conventional MQC models often suffer from consistency issues such as the violation of Heisenberg's principle, we overcame these difficulties by blending Koopman's classical mechanics on Hilbert spaces with methods in symplectic geometry. The resulting continuum model enjoys both a variational and a Hamiltonian structure, while its nonlinear character calls for suitable closures. Benefiting from the underlying action principle, here we apply a regularization technique previously developed within our team. This step allows for a singular solution ansatz which introduces the trajectories of computational particles - the koopmons - sampling the Lagrangian classical paths in phase space. In the case of Tully's nonadiabatic problems, the method reproduces the results of fully quantum simulations with levels of accuracy that are not achieved by standard MQC Ehrenfest simulations. In addition, the koopmon method is computationally advantageous over similar fully quantum approaches, which are also considered in our study. As a further step, we probe the limits of the method by considering the Rabi problem in both the ultrastrong and the deep strong coupling regimes, where MQC treatments appear hardly applicable. In this case, the method succeeds in reproducing parts of the fully quantum results.</description>

      <title>Accelerated boundary integral analysis of energy eigenvalues for confined electron states in quantum semiconductor heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel and efficient approach for the computation of energy eigenvalues in quantum semiconductor heterostructures. Accurate determination of the electronic states in these heterostructures is crucial for understanding their optical and electronic properties, making it a key challenge in semiconductor physics. The proposed method is based on utilizing series expansions of zero-order Bessel functions to numerically solve the Schr\"odinger equation using boundary integral method for bound electron states in a computationally efficient manner. To validate the proposed technique, we applied it to address previously explored issues by other research groups. The results clearly demonstrate the computational efficiency and high precision of our approach. Notably, the proposed technique significantly reduces the computational time compared to the conventional method for searching the energy eigenvalues in quantum structures.</description>

      <title>Cluster structure on genus 2 spherical DAHA: seven-colored flower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an embedding of the Arthamonov-Shakirov algebra of genus 2 knot operators into the quantized coordinate ring of the cluster Poisson variety of exceptional finite mutation type $X_7$. The embedding is equivariant with respect to the action of the mapping class group of the closed surface of genus 2. The cluster realization of the mapping class group action leads to a formula for the coefficient of each monomial in the genus 2 Macdonald polynomial of type $A_1$ as sum over lattice points in a convex polyhedron in 7-dimensional space.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect of a rough membrane in an Aether-like Lorentz-violating scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the Casimir effect of a rough membrane within the framework of theories that break Lorentz symmetry. We consider two constant Aether vectors: one timelike and other spacelike, simultaneously. We employ an appropriate change of coordinates such that the membrane assumes a completely flat border and the remaining terms associated with the roughness are considered as part of the potential. Quantum fluctuations are induced by a scalar quantum field subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. The spectrum is obtained through perturbation theory and regularized using the $\zeta$--function method. We provide an explicit example of a membrane with periodic boundaries. The presence of Aether vectors has a significant impact on the dominant term of the Casimir effect, while roughness only affects the secondary terms. Additionally, we examine the finite-temperature case.</description>

      <title>Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge with Quadratic State Cost is Exactly Solvable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger bridge is a diffusion process that steers a given distribution to another in a prescribed time while minimizing the effort to do so. It can be seen as the stochastic dynamical version of the optimal mass transport, and has growing applications in generative diffusion models and stochastic optimal control. In this work, we propose a regularized variant of the Schr\"odinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go that incentivizes the optimal sample paths to stay close to a nominal level. Unlike the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge, the regularization induces a state-dependent rate of killing and creation of probability mass, and its solution requires determining the Markov kernel of a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation. We derive this Markov kernel in closed form. Our solution recovers the heat kernel in the vanishing regularization (i.e., diffusion without reaction) limit, thereby recovering the solution of the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge. Our results enable the use of dynamic Sinkhorn recursion for computing the Schr\"odinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go, which would otherwise be challenging to use in this setting. We deduce properties of the new kernel and explain its connections with certain exactly solvable models in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Collapse of the Gibbs measure for the dynamical $\Phi^3_2$-models on the infinite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $\Phi^3_2$-measure in the infinite volume limit. This is the invariant measure for several stochastic partial differential equations including the parabolic and hyperbolic $\Phi^3_2$-models. In the large torus limit, we observe a concentration phenomenon of the $\Phi^3_2$-measure around zero, which is the single minimizer of the corresponding Hamiltonian for any fixed torus size. From our sharp estimates for the partition function, we obtain a triviality result for the $\Phi^3_2$-measure on infinite volume: the ensemble collapses onto a delta function on the zero field.</description>

      <title>Nonstandard derivation of the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation of a quantum dynamical semigroup from the Kraus representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new nonstandard proof of the well-known theorem that the generator $L$ of a quantum dynamical semigroup $\exp(tL)$ on a finite-dimensional quantum system has a specific form called a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) generator (also known as a Lindbladian) and vice versa. The proof starts from the Kraus representation of the quantum channel $\exp (\delta t L)$ for an infinitesimal hyperreal number $\delta t&gt;0$ and then estimates the orders of the traceless components of the Kraus operators. The jump operators naturally arise as the standard parts of the traceless components of the Kraus operators divided by $\sqrt{\delta t}$. We also give a nonstandard proof of a related fact that close completely positive maps have close Kraus operators.</description>
