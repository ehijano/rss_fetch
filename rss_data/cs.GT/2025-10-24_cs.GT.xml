      <title>Optimized Distortion in Linear Social Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social choice theory offers a wealth of approaches for selecting a candidate on behalf of voters based on their reported preference rankings over options. When voters have underlying utilities for these options, however, using preference rankings may lead to suboptimal outcomes vis-\`a-vis utilitarian social welfare. Distortion is a measure of this suboptimality, and provides a worst-case approach for developing and analyzing voting rules when utilities have minimal structure. However in many settings, such as common paradigms for value alignment, alternatives admit a vector representation, and it is natural to suppose that utilities are parametric functions thereof. We undertake the first study of distortion for linear utility functions. Specifically, we investigate the distortion of linear social choice for deterministic and randomized voting rules. We obtain bounds that depend only on the dimension of the candidate embedding, and are independent of the numbers of candidates or voters. Additionally, we introduce poly-time instance-optimal algorithms for minimizing distortion given a collection of candidates and votes. We empirically evaluate these in two real-world domains: recommendation systems using collaborative filtering embeddings, and opinion surveys utilizing language model embeddings, benchmarking several standard rules against our instance-optimal algorithms.</description>

      <title>Strategic Costs of Perceived Bias in Fair Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meritocratic systems, from admissions to hiring, aim to impartially reward skill and effort. Yet persistent disparities across race, gender, and class challenge this ideal. Some attribute these gaps to structural inequality; others to individual choice. We develop a game-theoretic model in which candidates from different socioeconomic groups differ in their perceived post-selection value--shaped by social context and, increasingly, by AI-powered tools offering personalized career or salary guidance. Each candidate strategically chooses effort, balancing its cost against expected reward; effort translates into observable merit, and selection is based solely on merit. We characterize the unique Nash equilibrium in the large-agent limit and derive explicit formulas showing how valuation disparities and institutional selectivity jointly determine effort, representation, social welfare, and utility. We further propose a cost-sensitive optimization framework that quantifies how modifying selectivity or perceived value can reduce disparities without compromising institutional goals. Our analysis reveals a perception-driven bias: when perceptions of post-selection value differ across groups, these differences translate into rational differences in effort, propagating disparities backward through otherwise "fair" selection processes. While the model is static, it captures one stage of a broader feedback cycle linking perceptions, incentives, and outcome--bridging rational-choice and structural explanations of inequality by showing how techno-social environments shape individual incentives in meritocratic systems.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Unambiguous Problems in $\Sigma^P_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity class $\bf{\Sigma^P_2}$ comprises problems based on polynomial-time checkable binary relations $\phi(x,y)$ in which we ask whether there exists $x$ such that for all $y$, $\phi(x,y)$ holds. We let $\bf{U\Sigma^P_2}$ denote the subclass of unambiguous problems in $\bf{\Sigma^P_2}$, namely those whose yes-instances correspond with a unique choice of $x$. $\bf{U\Sigma^P_2}$ is unlikely to have complete problems, but we identify various syntactic subclasses associated with general properties of $\phi$ that guarantee uniqueness. We use these to classify the complexity of problems arising in social choice and game theory, such as existence of (1) a dominating strategy in a game, (2) a Condorcet winner, (3) a strongly popular partition in hedonic games, and (4) a winner (source) in a tournament. We classify these problems, showing the first is $\bf{\Delta^P_2}$-complete, the second and third are complete for a class we term $\bf{PCW}$ (Polynomial Condorcet Winner), and the fourth for a class we term $\bf{PTW}$ (Polynomial Tournament Winner). We define another unambiguous class, $\bf{PMA}$ (Polynomial Majority Argument), seemingly incomparable to $\bf{PTW}$ and $\bf{PCW}$. We show that with randomization, $\bf{PCW}$ and $\bf{PTW}$ coincide with $\bf{\Delta^P_2}$, and $\bf{PMA}$ is contained in $\bf{\Delta^P_2}$. Specifically, we prove: $\bf{\Delta^P_2} \subseteq \bf{PCW} \subseteq \bf{PTW} \subseteq \bf{S^P_2}$, and $\bf{coNP} \subseteq \bf{PMA} \subseteq \bf{S^P_2}$ (and it is known that $\bf{S^P_2}\subseteq \bf{ZPP^{NP}} \subseteq \bf{\Sigma^P_2} \cap \bf{\Pi^P_2}$). We demonstrate that unambiguity can substantially reduce computational complexity by considering ambiguous variants of our problems, and showing they are $\bf{\Sigma^P_2}$-complete. Finally, we study the unambiguous problem of finding a weakly dominant strategy in a game, which seems not to lie in $\bf{\Sigma^P_2}$.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Exchange that Mitigate a Bribery Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the popularity of Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) because of their use in wide areas of applications such as payment channels, atomic swaps, etc, their use in exchange is still questionable. This is because of its incentive incompatibility and susceptibility to bribery attacks.
  State-of-the-art solutions such as MAD-HTLC (Oakland'21) and He-HTLC (NDSS'23) address this by leveraging miners' profit-driven behaviour to mitigate such attacks. The former is the mitigation against passive miners; however, the latter works against both active and passive miners. However, they consider only two bribing scenarios where either of the parties involved in the transfer collude with the miner.
  In this paper, we expose vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art solutions by presenting a miner-collusion bribery attack with implementation and game-theoretic analysis. Additionally, we propose a stronger attack on MAD-HTLC than He-HTLC, allowing the attacker to earn profits equivalent to attacking naive HTLC.
  Leveraging our insights, we propose \prot, a game-theoretically secure HTLC protocol resistant to all bribery scenarios. \prot\ employs a two-phase approach, preventing unauthorized token confiscation by third parties, such as miners. In Phase 1, parties commit to the transfer; in Phase 2, the transfer is executed without manipulation. We demonstrate \prot's efficiency in transaction cost and latency via implementations on Bitcoin and Ethereum.</description>

      <title>The Price of Opportunity Fairness in Matroid Allocation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider matroid allocation problems under opportunity fairness constraints: resources need to be allocated to a set of agents under matroid constraints (which include classical problems such as bipartite matching). Agents are divided into $C$ groups according to a sensitive attribute, and an allocation is opportunity-fair if each group receives the same share proportional to the maximum feasible allocation it could achieve in isolation. We study the Price of Fairness (PoF), i.e., the ratio between maximum size allocations and maximum size opportunity-fair allocations. We first provide a characterization of the PoF leveraging the underlying polymatroid structure of the allocation problem. Based on this characterization, we prove bounds on the PoF in various settings from fully adversarial (worst-case) to fully random. Notably, one of our main results considers an arbitrary matroid structure with agents randomly divided into groups. In this setting, we prove a PoF bound as a function of the (relative) size of the largest group. Our result implies that, as long as there is no dominant group (i.e., the largest group is not too large), opportunity fairness constraints do not induce any loss of social welfare (defined as the allocation size). Overall, our results give insights into which aspects of the problem's structure affect the trade-off between opportunity fairness and social welfare.</description>

      <title>Selfish, Local and Online Scheduling via Vector Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a dual fitting technique on a semidefinite program yielding simple proofs of tight bounds for the robust price of anarchy of several congestion and scheduling games under the sum of weighted completion times objective. The same approach also allows to bound the approximation ratio of local search algorithms and the competitive ratio of online algorithms for the scheduling problem $R || \sum w_j C_j$. All of our results are obtained through a simple unified dual fitting argument on the same semidefinite programming relaxation, which can essentially be obtained through the first round of the Lasserre/Sum of Squares hierarchy.
  As our main application, we show that the known coordination ratio bounds of respectively $4, (3 + \sqrt{5})/2 \approx 2.618,$ and $32/15 \approx 2.133$ for the scheduling game $R || \sum w_j C_j$ under the coordination mechanisms Smith's Rule, Proportional Sharing and Rand (STOC 2011) can be extended to congestion games and obtained through this approach. For the natural restriction where the weight of each player is proportional to its processing time on every resource, we show that the last bound can be improved from 2.133 to 2. This improvement can also be made for general instances when considering the price of anarchy of the game, rather than the coordination ratio. As a further application of this technique, we show that it recovers the tight bound of $(3 + \sqrt{5})/2$ for the price of anarchy of weighted affine congestion games and the Kawaguchi-Kyan bound of $(1+ \sqrt{2})/2$ for the pure price of anarchy of $P || \sum w_j C_j$. Moreover, this approach can analyze a simple local search algorithm for $R || \sum w_j C_j$, the best currently known combinatorial approximation algorithm for this problem achieving an approximation ratio of $(5 + \sqrt{5})/4 + \varepsilon$ and an online greedy algorithm which is $4$-competitive.</description>

      <title>MVP-Shapley: Feature-based Modeling for Evaluating the Most Valuable Player in Basketball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The burgeoning growth of the esports and multiplayer online gaming community has highlighted the critical importance of evaluating the Most Valuable Player (MVP). The establishment of an explainable and practical MVP evaluation method is very challenging. In our study, we specifically focus on play-by-play data, which records related events during the game, such as assists and points. We aim to address the challenges by introducing a new MVP evaluation framework, denoted as \oursys, which leverages Shapley values. This approach encompasses feature processing, win-loss model training, Shapley value allocation, and MVP ranking determination based on players' contributions. Additionally, we optimize our algorithm to align with expert voting results from the perspective of causality. Finally, we substantiated the efficacy of our method through validation using the NBA dataset and the Dunk City Dynasty dataset and implemented online deployment in the industry.</description>

      <title>Extreme Points in Multi-Dimensional Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the extreme points of the set of incentive-compatible mechanisms for screening problems with linear utility. Our framework subsumes problems with and without transfers, such as monopoly pricing, principal-optimal bilateral trade and barter exchange, delegation and veto bargaining, or belief elicitation via proper scoring rules. In every problem with one-dimensional types, extreme points admit a tractable description. In every problem with multi-dimensional types, extreme points are dense in a rich subset of incentive-compatible mechanisms, which we call exhaustive mechanisms. Building on these characterizations, we derive parallel conclusions for mechanisms that can be rationalized as (uniquely) optimal under a fixed objective. For example, in the multi-good monopoly problem, mechanisms that uniquely maximize revenue for some type distribution are dense among all incentive-compatible and individually rational mechanisms. The proofs exploit a novel connection between menus of extreme points and indecomposable convex bodies, first studied by Gale (1954).</description>

      <title>Marketplace Operators Can Induce Competitive Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As e-commerce marketplaces continue to grow in popularity, it has become increasingly important to understand the role and impact of marketplace operators on competition and social welfare. We model a marketplace operator as an entity that not only facilitates third-party sales but can also choose to directly participate in the market as a competing seller. We formalize this market structure as a price-quantity Stackelberg duopoly in which the leader is a marketplace operator and the follower is an independent seller who shares a fraction of their revenue with the marketplace operator for the privilege of selling on the platform. The objective of the marketplace operator is to maximize a weighted sum of profit and a term capturing positive customer experience, whereas the independent seller seeks solely to maximize their own profit. We derive the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium and find that it is often optimal for the marketplace operator to induce competition by offering the product at a low price to incentivize the independent seller to match their price.</description>

      <title>GTAlign: Game-Theoretic Alignment of LLM Assistants for Mutual Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning, yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice: models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to baselines across diverse tasks.
