      <title>Nonlinear Instabilities in Computer Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies two types of computer networking models. The primary focus is to understand the different dynamical phenomena observed in practice due to the presence of severe nonlinearities, delays and widely varying operating conditions. The first models considered are of senders running TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and traffic passing through RED (Random Early Detection) gateways. Building on earlier work, a first order nonlinear discrete-time model is developed for the interaction scenario between transport protocols like TCP and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and Active Queuing Management schemes like RED. It is shown that the dynamics resulting from the interaction with TCP is consistent with various dynamical behaviors and parameter sensitivities observed in practice. Using bifurcation-theoretic ideas it is shown that TCP-RED type networks may lose their stability through a period doubling bifurcation followed by border collision bifurcations. The nonlinear dependence of the throughput function of TCP-type flows on drop probability is found to be responsible for the period doubling bifurcation, whereas limited buffer space and lack of sufficient damping results in border collision bifurcations. A second class of models studied in this work deals with optimal rate control in networks and are based on the rate-control framework proposed by Kelly. Using the results on delay-differential equation stability, the stability and its lack thereof is studied through an underlying map which arises naturally in time delay systems. An invariance property of this map is used to prove delay-independent stability and to compute bounds on periodic oscillations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tunnelling Across Hydrogen Bonds: Proton--Deuteron Isotope Effects from a Cornell-Type Potential Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen bonds play a pivotal role in chemistry, biology, and condensed-matter physics, where quantum tunnelling can strongly influence structure and dynamics. Isotope substitution (H $\rightarrow$ D) provides a sensitive probe of such tunnelling, but theoretical descriptions often rely on purely numerical models or simplified potentials that obscure physical interpretation. Here we employ a Cornell-type potential combined with a double-well Schr\"odinger approach to investigate proton and deuteron tunnelling across hydrogen bonds. The model yields semi-analytical wavefunctions and tunnelling splittings that transparently capture isotope-dependent quantum effects. We present scaling behaviour of tunnelling splittings with isotope mass, discuss the influence of barrier width and curvature, and compare model trends with representative experimental and computational results. Beyond hydrogen bonding, the framework provides a general methodology for modelling tunnelling in double-well systems relevant to spectroscopy, enzymatic catalysis, and materials applications.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Proton Tunneling Splittings with a Wavefunction-Based Double-Well Model: Application to the Formic Acid Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton tunneling across hydrogen bonds is a fundamental quantum effect with implications for spectroscopy, catalysis, and biomolecular stability. While state-of-the-art instanton and path-integral methods provide accurate multidimensional tunneling splittings, simplified one-dimensional models remain valuable as conceptual and benchmarking tools. Here we develop a wavefunction-based framework for tunneling splittings using a Cornell-type double-well potential and apply it as a benchmark for hydrogen-bond tunneling. Analytical WKB estimates and numerical finite-difference solutions are compared across a range of barrier parameters, showing consistent agreement. As a test case, we map the formic acid dimer (FAD) barrier onto a quartic double-well model parameterized to reproduce the reported barrier height of $V_b \\approx 2848~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The resulting tunneling splitting of about $0.037~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ matches the reduced-dimensional calculations of Qu and Bowman. The close agreement between numerical and semiclassical results highlights the pedagogical and diagnostic value of one-dimensional models, while comparison with molecular benchmarks clarifies their limitations relative to full multidimensional quantum treatments.</description>

      <title>Coherence and Transients in Nonlocally Coupled Dissipative Kicked Rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of nonlocally coupled dissipative kicked rotors is rich and complex. In this study, we consider a network of rotors where each interacts equally with a certain range of its neighbors. We focus on the influence of the coupling strength and the coupling range, and show both analytically and numerically the critical transitions in the phase diagram, which include bifurcations of simple spatiotemporal patterns and changes in basin sizes of coherent states with different wavenumbers. We highlight that this diagram is fundamentally different from those found in other coupled systems such as in coupled logistic maps or Lorenz systems. Finally, we show an interesting domain-wall phenomenon in the coupled chaotic rotors, where a super-long transient interface state (partially regular and partially chaotic) is observed and can persist exponentially long as the coupling range increases up to a critical threshold.</description>

      <title>Chaotic advection in a steady three-dimensional MHD flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20021v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the 3D stationary flow of a weakly conducting fluid in a cubic cavity, driven by the Lorentz force created by two permanent magnets and a weak constant current. Our goal is to determine the conditions leading to efficient mixing within the cavity. The flow is composed of a large recirculation cell created by one side magnet, superposed to two recirculation cells created by a central magnet perpendicular to the first one. The overall structure of this flow, obtained here by solving the Stokes equations with Lorentz forcing, is similar to the tri-cellular model flow studied by Toussaint et. al. (Phys. Fluids. 7, 1995). Chaotic advection in this flow is analyzed by means of Poincar\'e sections, Lyapunov exponents and expansion entropies. In addition, we quantify the quality of mixing by computing contamination rates, homogeneity, as well as mixing times. Though individual vortices have poor mixing properties, the superposition of both flows creates chaotic streamlines and efficient mixing.</description>

      <title>Controlling quantum chaos via Parrondo strategies on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing are steadily pushing these systems toward outperforming classical supercomputers on specific, well-defined computational tasks. In this work, we explore and control quantum chaos in NISQ systems using discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) on cyclic graphs. To efficiently implement quantum walks on NISQ hardware, we employ the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) to diagonalize the conditional shift operator, optimizing circuit depth and fidelity. We experimentally realize the transition from quantum chaos to order via DTQW dynamics on both odd and even cyclic graphs, specifically 3- and 4-cycle graphs, using the counterintuitive Parrondo's paradox strategy across three different NISQ devices. While the 4-cycle graphs exhibit high-fidelity quantum evolution, the 3-cycle implementation shows significant fidelity improvement when augmented with dynamical decoupling pulses. Our results demonstrate a practical approach to probing and harnessing controlled chaotic dynamics on real quantum hardware, laying the groundwork for future quantum algorithms and cryptographic protocols based on quantum walks.</description>
