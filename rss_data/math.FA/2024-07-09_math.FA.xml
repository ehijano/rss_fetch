      <title>Generalized Multivariate Hypercomplex Function Inequalities and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends the Mond-Pecaric method to functions with multiple operators as arguments by providing arbitrarily close approximations of the original functions. Instead of using linear functions to establish lower and upper bounds for multivariate functions as in prior work, we apply sigmoid functions to achieve these bounds with any specified error threshold based on the multivariate function approximation method proposed by Cybenko. This approach allows us to derive fundamental inequalities for multivariate hypercomplex functions, leading to new inequalities based on ratio and difference kinds. For applications about these new derived inequalities for multivariate hypercomplex functions, we first introduce a new concept called W-boundedness for hypercomplex functions by applying ratio kind multivariate hypercomplex inequalities. W-boundedness generalizes R-boundedness for norm mappings with input from Banach space. Additionally, we develop an approximation theory for multivariate hypercomplex functions and establish bounds algebra, including operator bounds and tail bounds algebra for multivariate random tensors.</description>

      <title>Spectrality of a class of infinite convolutions with and without compact supports in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing a result given by Li, Miao and Wang in 2022, we study the spectrality of a class of infinite convolutions in $\mathbb{R}^d$ generated by sequences of nearly $d$-th power lattices. This allows us to easily construct spectral measures with and without compact supports in $\mathbb{R}^d$. According to a result on the relation between supports of infinite convolutions and sets of infinite sums, we systematically study the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of infinite sums of finite sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. As an application, we give concrete formulae for the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of the supports of a class of spectral measures in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with the form of infinite convolutions generated by specific sequences of nearly $d$-th power lattices, and finally we deduce that there are spectral measures with and without compact supports of arbitrary Hausdorff and packing dimensions in $\mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <title>Dimension dependence of factorization problems: Haar system Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $n\in \mathbb{N}$, let $Y_n$ denote the linear span of the first $n+1$ levels of the Haar system in a Haar system Hardy space $Y$ (this class contains all separable rearrangement-invariant function spaces and also related spaces such as dyadic $H^1$). Let $I_{Y_n}$ denote the identity operator on $Y_n$. We prove the following quantitative factorization result: Fix $\Gamma,\delta,\varepsilon &gt; 0$, and let $n,N \in \mathbb{N}$ be chosen such that $N \ge Cn^2$, where $C = C(\Gamma,\delta,\varepsilon) &gt; 0$ (this amounts to a quasi-polynomial dependence between $\dim Y_N$ and $\dim Y_n$). Then for every linear operator $T\colon Y_N\to Y_N$ with $\|T\|\le \Gamma$, there exist operators $A,B$ with $\|A\|\|B\|\le 2(1+\varepsilon)$ such that either $I_{Y_n} = ATB$ or $I_{Y_n} = A(I_{Y_N} - T)B$. Moreover, if $T$ has $\delta$-large positive diagonal with respect to the Haar system, then we have $I_{Y_n} = ATB$ for some $A,B$ with $\|A\|\|B\|\le (1+\varepsilon)/\delta$. If the Haar system is unconditional in $Y$, then an inequality of the form $N \ge Cn$ is sufficient for the above statements to hold (hence, $\dim Y_N$ depends polynomially on $\dim Y_n$). Finally, we prove an analogous result in the case where $T$ has large but not necessarily positive diagonal entries.</description>

      <title>Manifolds of continuous functions of bounded variation and vector measure regularity of Banach-Lie groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a smooth Banach manifold BV([a,b],M) whose elements are suitably-defined functions f : [a,b] -&gt; M of bounded variation with values in a smooth Banach manifold M which admits a local addition. If the target manifold is a Banach-Lie group G, with Lie algebra g, we obtain a Banach-Lie group BV([a,b],G) with Lie algebra BV([a,b],g). Strengthening known regularity properties of Banach-Lie groups, we construct a smooth evolution map from a Banach space of g-valued vector measures on [0,1] to BV([0,1],G).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate some fixed-point properties of the Mordukhovich differential operator of set valued mappings (or, single valued mappings) on Banach spaces. In particular, we study the fixed-point properties of the Mordukhovich differential operator for the metric projection operator onto some closed and convex subsets in Banach spaces, such as, closed balls in Banach spaces, positive cones in real spaces l2 and l1 and sets of polynomials in C[0, 1].</description>

      <title>Extended zeta-function residues on principal ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study extended zeta-function residues on principal ideals of compact operators and their connections with Dixmier traces. We establish a Lidskii-type formula for continuous singular traces on these ideals. Using this formula, we obtain a necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary operator being Dixmier measurable. These conditions are expressed in terms of eigenvalues of an operator and an asymptotic of its zeta-function.</description>

      <title>Multiwindow Gabor frames on discrete periodic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study multiwindow discrete Gabor $(M-D-G)$ systems \\$\mathcal{G}(g,L,M,N)$ on discrete periodic sets $\mathbb{S}$ and give some necessary and/or sufficient matrix-conditions for a $M-D-G$ system in $\ell^2(\mathbb{S})$ to be a frame. We characterize, also, which $M-D-G$ frames are Riesz bases by the parameters $L$, $M$ and $N$. Matrix-characterizations of Parseval $M-D-G$ frames and $M-D-G$ orthonormal bases are also given. Then, we characterize the existence of $M-D-G$ frames, $M-D-G$ Parseval frames, $M-D-G$ Riesz bases and $M-D-G$ orthonormal bases for $\ell^2(\mathbb{S})$ by the parameters $M$, $N$ and $L$. We prseent, also, a matrix-characterization of dual $M-D-G$ frames in $\ell^2(\mathbb{S})$. A perturbation matrix-condition of $M-D-G$ frames is also prsented. We, then, show that a pair of $M-D-G$ Bessel systems can generate pairs of M-D-G dual frames. By the Zak-transform, characterizations of complete M-D-G systems and M-D-G frames in $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$ are given in the case of $M=N$ and necssary conditions for a M-D-G system to be a Riesz basis/ orthonormal basis for $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$ are also given. We, also, study K-M-D-G frames in $\ell^2(\mathbb{S})$, where $K\in B(\ell^2(\mathbb{S})\,)$, and presente some sufficient matrix-conditions for a M-D-G system to form a K-frame and give a construction method of $K$-M-D-G frames which are not M-D-G frames and some examples.</description>

      <title>On T-orthogonality in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{X}$ be a Banach space and let $\mathbb{X}^*$ be the dual space of $\mathbb{X}.$ For $x,y \in \mathbb{X},$ $ x$ is said to be $T$-orthogonal to $y$ if $Tx(y) =0,$ where $T$ is a bounded linear operator from $\mathbb{X}$ to $\mathbb{X}^*.$
  We study the notion of $T$-orthogonality in a Banach space and investigate its relation with the various geometric properties, like strict convexity, smoothness, reflexivity of the space. We explore the notions of left and right symmetric elements w.r.t. the notion of $T$-orthogonality. We characterize bounded linear operators on $\mathbb{X}$ preserving $T$-orthogonality. Finally we characterize Hilbert spaces among all Banach spaces using $T$-orthogonality. \end{abstract}</description>

      <title>Extreme contractions on finite-dimensional Banach spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study extreme contractions in the setting of finite-dimensional polyhedral Banach spaces. Motivated by the famous Krein-Milman Theorem, we prove that a \emph{rank one} norm one linear operator between such spaces can be expressed as a convex combination of \emph{rank one} extreme contractions, whenever the domain is two-dimensional. We establish that the same result holds true in the space of all linear operators from $\ell_{\infty}^n(\mathbb{C}) $ to $ \ell_1^n (\mathbb{C}). $ Furthermore, we present a geometric characterization of extreme contractions between finite-dimensional polyhedral Banach spaces.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct a function which confirms the proper inclusion property of Morrey spaces, by using a relation between a class of functions in Morrey spaces and discrete Morrey spaces. Our particular function is simpler than those constructed by Gunawan \textit{et al.} in \cite{gunawan1, gunawan2}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study inclusion relations between Gelfand-Shilov type spaces defined via a weight (multi-)sequence system, a weight function system, and a translation-invariant Banach function space. We characterize when such spaces are included into one another in terms of growth relations for the defining weight sequence and function systems. Our general framework allows for a unified treatment of the Gelfand-Shilov spaces $\mathcal{S}^{[M]}_{[A]}$ (defined via weight sequences $M$ and $A$) and the Beurling-Bj\"orck spaces $\mathcal{S}^{[\omega]}_{[\eta]}$ (defined via weight functions $\omega$ and $\eta$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine the classical Cauchy--Schwartz inequality $\|X\|_{1} \leq \|X\|_{2}$ by demonstrating that for any $p$ and $q$ with $q&gt;p&gt;2$, there exists a constant $C=C(p,q)$ such that $\|X\|_1 \leq 1 - C \Big{(}\|X\|_p^p - 1\Big{)}^{\frac{q-2}{q-p}}\Big{(}\|X\|_q^q - 1\Big{)}^{\frac{2-p}{q-p}}$ holds true for all Borel measurable random variables $X$ with $\|X\|_{2}=1$ and $\|X\|_{p}&lt;\infty$. We illustrate two applications of this result: one for biased Rademacher sums and another for exponential sums.</description>

Abstract: This paper is focused on the modified Zakharov-Kusnetsov equation. We prove the associated Cauchy problem is locally (in time) well-posed in $H^s(\R \times \T)$ for $s &gt;1$. The new ingredient in this work is a trilinear estimate in the context of Bourgain spaces which controls the cubic non-linearity of the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation in the contraction argument.</description>

      <title>On the Higuchi fractal dimension of invariant measures for countable idempotent iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the set of invariant idempotent probabilities for countable idempotent iterated function systems (IFS) defined in compact metric spaces. We demonstrate that, with constant weights, there exists a unique invariant idempotent probability. Utilizing Secelean's approach to countable IFSs, we introduce partially finite idempotent IFSs and prove that the sequence of invariant idempotent measures for these systems converges to the invariant measure of the original countable IFS. We then apply these results to approximate such measures with discrete systems, producing, in the one-dimensional case, data series whose Higuchi fractal dimension can be calculated. Finally, we provide numerical approximations for two-dimensional cases and discuss the application of generalized Higuchi dimensions in these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Michael's selection theorem and applications to the Mar\'echal topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mar\'echal topology, also called the Effros-Mar\'echal topology, is a natural topology one can put on the space of all von Neumann subalgebras of a given von Neumann algebra. It is a result of Mar\'echal from 1973 that this topology is Polish as soon as the ambient algebra has separable predual, but the sketch of proof in her research announcement appears to have a small gap. Our main goal in this paper is to fill this gap by a careful look at the topologies one can put on the space of weak-$*$ closed subspaces of a dual space. We also indicate how Michael's selection theorem can be used as a step towards Mar\'echal's theorem, and how it simplifies the proof of an important selection result of Haagerup and Winsl{\o}w for the Mar\'echal topology. As an application, we show that the space of finite von Neumann algebras is $\mathbf\Pi^0_3$-complete.</description>

      <title>Probability graphons: the right convergence point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of probability graphons, continuum representations of edge-decorated graphs arising in graph limits theory, to the 'right convergence' point of view. First of all, we generalise the notions of overlay functionals and quotient sets to the case of probability graphons. Furthermore, we characterise the convergence of probability graphons in terms of these global quantities. In particular, we show the equivalence of these two notions of convergence with the unlabelled cut-metric convergence (and thus also with the homomorphism densities convergence and the subgraph sampling convergence). In other words, we prove the equivalence of the 'left convergence' and the 'right convergence' views on probability graphons convergence, generalising the corresponding result for (real-valued) graphons (the classical continuum representation for simple graphs).</description>

Abstract: The cone of nonnegative polynomials is of fundamental importance in real algebraic geometry, but its facial structure is understood in very few cases. We initiate a systematic study of the facial structure of the cone of nonnegative polynomials $\pos$ on a smooth real projective curve $X$. We show that there is a duality between its faces and totally real effective divisors on $X$. This allows us to fully describe the face lattice in case $X$ has genus $1$. The dual cone $\pos^\vee$ is known as the moment cone, and it plays an important role in real analysis. We compute the Carath\'{e}odory number of $\pos^\vee$ for an elliptic normal curve $X$, which measures the complexity of quadrature rules of measures supported on $X$. This number can also be interpreted as a maximal typical Waring rank with nonnegative coefficients. Interestingly, the topology of the real locus of $X$ influences the Carath\'{e}odory number of $\pos^\vee$. We apply our results to truncated moment problems on affine cubic curves, where we deduce sharp bounds on the flat extension degree.</description>

      <title>Fractional divergence-measure fields, Leibniz rule and Gauss-Green formula</title>

Abstract: Given $\alpha\in(0,1]$ and $p\in[1,+\infty]$, we define the space $\mathscr{DM}^{\alpha,p}(\mathbb R^n)$ of $L^p$ vector fields whose $\alpha$-divergence is a finite Radon measure, extending the theory of divergence-measure vector fields to the distributional fractional setting. Our main results concern the absolute continuity properties of the $\alpha$-divergence-measure with respect to the Hausdorff measure and fractional analogues of the Leibniz rule and the Gauss-Green formula. The sharpness of our results is discussed via some explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Bohnenblust--Hille inequality for cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10560v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $K&gt;2$ and the multiplicative cyclic group $\Omega_K$ of order $K$, consider any function $f:\Omega_K^n\to\mathbf{C}$ and its Fourier expansion $f(z)=\sum_{\alpha\in\{0,1,\ldots,K-1\}^n}a_\alpha z^\alpha$, with $d:=\text{deg}(f)$ denoting its degree as a multivariate polynomial.
  We prove a Bohnenblust--Hille (BH) inequality in this setting: the $\ell_{2d/(d+1)}$ norm of the Fourier coefficients of $f$ is bounded by $C(d,K)\|f\|_\infty$ with $C(d,K)$ independent of $n$.
  This is the interpolating case between the now well-understood BH inequalities for functions on the poly-torus ($K =\infty$) and the hypercube ($K=2$) but those extreme cases of $K$ have special properties whose absence for intermediate $K$ prevent a proof by the standard BH framework.
  New techniques are developed exploiting the group structure of $\Omega_K^n$.
  By known reductions, the cyclic group BH inequality also entails a noncommutative BH inequality for tensor products of the $K \times K$ complex matrix algebra (or in the language of quantum mechanics, systems of $K$-level qudits). These new BH inequalities generalize several applications in harmonic analysis and statistical learning theory to broader classes of functions and operators.</description>

      <title>Beyond $BV$: new pairings and Gauss-Green formulas for measure fields with divergence measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new notion of pairing between measure vector fields with divergence measure and scalar functions, which are not required to be weakly differentiable, is introduced. In particular, in the case of essentially bounded divergence-measure fields, the functions may not be of bounded variation. This naturally leads to the definition of $BV$-like function classes on which these pairings are well defined. Despite the lack of fine properties for such functions, our pairings surprisingly preserve many features of the recently introduced $\lambda$-pairings (Crasta, De Cicco, Malusa 2022, arXiv:1902.06052), as coarea formula, lower semicontinuity, Leibniz rules, and Gauss-Green formulas. Moreover, in a natural way new anisotropic "degenerate" perimeters are defined, possibly allowing for sets with fractal boundary.</description>

      <title>Interpolation theorems for conjugations and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a separable complex Hilbert space. A conjugate-linear map $C:H\to H$ is a conjugation if it is an involutive isometry. In this paper, we consider the following interpolation problems: Let $\{x_i\}_{i\in I}$ and $\{y_i\}_{i\in I}$ be two orthogonal sets of vectors in $H$, and let $N$ and $\{N_k\}_{k\in K}$ be normal operators such that the $N_k$'s mutually commute. Then, under which conditions does there exist a conjugation $C$ on $H$ such that
  (a) $Cx_i=y_i$ and $CN_kC=N_k^*$ for all $i\in I$ and $k\in K$; or
  (b) $Cx_i=y_i$, for every $i\in I$, and $CNC=-N^*$.
  Using the spectral projections of normal operators, we provide complete answers to problems (a) and (b). As an application, we characterize hyperinvariant subspaces of normal operators using conjugations. Additionally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to certain equations in $L^{\infty}(\mu)$.</description>

      <title>Schatten $p$-norm and numerical radius inequalities with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new refinement of the Kato's inequality and using this refinement we obtain several upper bounds for the numerical radius of a bounded linear operator as well as the product of operators, which improve the well known existing bounds. Further, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the positivity of $2\times 2$ certain block matrices and using this condition we deduce an upper bound for the numerical radius involving a contraction operator. Furthermore, we study the Schatten $p$-norm inequalities for the sum of two $n\times n$ complex matrices via singular values and from the inequalities we obtain the $p$-numerical radius and the classical numerical radius bounds. We show that for every $p&gt;0$, the $p$-numerical radius $w_p(\cdot): \mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb C)\to \mathbb R$ satisfies $ w_p(T) \leq \frac12 \sqrt{\left\| |T|^{2(1-t)}+|T^*|^{2(1-t)} \right\|^{} \, \big \||T|^{2t}+|T^*|^{2t} \big\|_{p/2}^{} } $ for all $t\in [0,1]$. Considering $p\to \infty$, we get a nice refinement of the well known classical numerical radius bound $w(T) \leq \sqrt{\frac12 \left\| T^*T+TT^* \right \|}.$
  As an application of the Schatten $p$-norm inequalities we develop a bound for the energy of graph. We show that
  $ \mathcal{E}(G) \geq \frac{2m}{ \sqrt{ \max_{1\leq i \leq n} \left\{ \sum_{j, v_i \sim v_j}d_j\right\}} },$ where $\mathcal{E}(G)$ is the energy of a simple graph $G$ with $m$ edges and $n$ vertices $v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n$ such that degree of $v_i$ is $d_i$ for each $i=1,2,\ldots,n.$</description>

      <title>Friction mediated by transient elastic linkages : asymptotic expansions and fat tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several results in previous works, strongly depend on the exponential tail of the linkages' distribution in our adhesive models. The purpose of this paper is to weaken this hypothesis and to allow more fat tails for large ages. From the biological point of view this means that we allow adhesions to be stronger, because linkages break less often. Moreover, in our previous articles, the asymptotic expansion of adhesion site's position and the corresponding error estimates also used some fast decay properties of the kernel, we show, when the kernel is a given function of age but constant in time, how to overcome this problem and construct asymptotic expansions in a systematic way at any order with respect to a small parameter $\epsilon$ representing the linkages' turnover.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new generalization of neural network parameter spaces with noncommutative $C^*$-algebra, which possesses a rich noncommutative structure of products. We show that this noncommutative structure induces powerful effects in learning neural networks. Our framework has a wide range of applications, such as learning multiple related neural networks simultaneously with interactions and learning equivariant features with respect to group actions. Numerical experiments illustrate the validity of our framework and its potential power.</description>

      <title>Local times of deterministic paths and self-similar processes with stationary increments as normalized numbers of interval crossings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a general result on a relationship between a limit of normalized numbers of interval crossings by a c\`adl\`ag path and an occupation measure associated with this path.
  Using this result we define local times of fractional Brownian motions (classically defined as densities of relevant occupation measure) as weak limits of properly normalized numbers of interval crossings.
  We also discuss a similar result for c\`adl\`ag semimartingales, in particular for alpha-stable processes, and for Rosenblatt processes, and provide natural examples of deterministic paths which possess quadratic or higher order variation but no local times.</description>

      <title>Failure of almost uniformly convergence for noncommutative martingales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a counterexample to show that in sharp contrast to the classical case, the almost uniform convergence may not happen for truly noncommutative $L_p$-martingales when $1\leq p&lt;2$. The same happens to ergodic averages. The proof consists of some sharp estimates of the distributional function of a sequence of matrices and some non standard transference techniques, which might admit further applications.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space-Valued LQ Mean Field Games: An Infinite-Dimensional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games (MFGs) in Hilbert spaces, generalizing the classic LQ MFG theory to scenarios involving $N$ agents with dynamics governed by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, both state and control processes of each agent take values in separable Hilbert spaces. All agents are coupled through the average state of the population which appears in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. Specifically, the dynamics of each agent incorporates an infinite-dimensional noise, namely a $Q$-Wiener process, and an unbounded operator. The diffusion coefficient of each agent is stochastic involving the state, control, and average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of $N$ coupled semilinear infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations establishing the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. We then specialize to $N$-player LQ games described above and study the asymptotic behaviour as the number of agents, $N$, approaches infinity. We develop an infinite-dimensional variant of the Nash Certainty Equivalence principle and characterize a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting MFG. Finally, we study the connections between the $N$-player game and the limiting MFG, demonstrating that the empirical average state converges to the mean field and that the resulting limiting best-response strategies form an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the $N$-player game in Hilbert spaces.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that if a function $f$ satisfies $$\|f(x) e^{\pi \alpha |x|^2}\|_p + \| \widehat{f}(\xi) e^{\pi \alpha |\xi|^2} \|_q&lt;\infty \qquad\qquad\qquad(*)$$
  with $\alpha=1$ and $1\le p,q&lt;\infty$, then $f\equiv 0.$
  We prove that if $f$ satisfies $(*)$ with some $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and $1\le p,q\leq \infty$, then $$ |f(y)|\le C
  (1+|y|)^{\frac{d}{p}}
  e^{- \pi \alpha |y|^2}, \quad y\in \mathbb{R}^d, $$ with $ C=C(\alpha,d,p,q)$ and this bound is sharp for $p\neq 1$. We also study a related uncertainty principle for functions satisfying $\;\;\displaystyle\|f(x)|x|^m\|_p+ \|\widehat{f}(\xi)|\xi|^n\|_q &lt;\infty.$</description>

      <title>On the Ground State Energies of Discrete and Semiclassical Schr\"odinger Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the infimum of the spectrum, or ground state energy (g.s.e.), of a discrete Schr\"odinger operator on $\theta\mathbb{Z}^d$ parameterized by a potential $V:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ and a frequency parameter $\theta\in (0,1)$. We relate this g.s.e. to that of a corresponding continuous semiclassical Schr\"odinger operator on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with parameter $\theta$, arising from the same choice of potential. We show that: the discrete g.s.e. is at most the continuous one for continuous periodic $V$ and irrational $\theta$; the opposite inequality holds up to a factor of $1-o(1)$ as $\theta\rightarrow 0$ for sufficiently regular smooth periodic $V$; and the opposite inequality holds up to a constant factor for every bounded $V$ and $\theta$ with the property that discrete and continuous averages of $V$ on fundamental domains of $\theta \mathbb{Z}^d$ are comparable. Our proofs are elementary and rely on sampling and interpolation to map low-energy functions for the discrete operator on $\theta \mathbb{Z}^d$ to low-energy functions for the continuous operator on $\mathbb{R}^d$, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of an Extremal Function for the Delsarte Extremal Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the general setting of a locally compact Abelian group $G$, the Delsarte extremal problem asks for the supremum of integrals over the collection of continuous positive definite functions $f: G \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(0) = 1$ and having $\mathrm{supp} f_{+} \subset \Omega$ for some measurable subset $\Omega$ of finite measure. In this paper, we consider the question of the existence of an extremal function for the Delsarte extremal problem. In particular, we show that there exists an extremal function for the Delsarte problem when $\Omega$ is closed, extending previously known existence results to a larger class of functions.</description>
