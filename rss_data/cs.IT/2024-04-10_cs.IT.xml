      <title>Near-Tight Bounds for 3-Query Locally Correctable Binary Linear Codes via Rainbow Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a binary linear code of block length $n$ that is locally correctable with $3$ queries against a fraction $\delta &gt; 0$ of adversarial errors must have dimension at most $O_{\delta}(\log^2 n \cdot \log \log n)$. This is almost tight in view of quadratic Reed-Muller codes being a $3$-query locally correctable code (LCC) with dimension $\Theta(\log^2 n)$. Our result improves, for the binary field case, the $O_{\delta}(\log^8 n)$ bound obtained in the recent breakthrough of (Kothari and Manohar, 2023) (arXiv:2311.00558) (and the more recent improvement to $O_{\delta}(\log^4 n)$ for binary linear codes announced in (Yankovitz, 2024)).
  Previous bounds for $3$-query linear LCCs proceed by constructing a $2$-query locally decodable code (LDC) from the $3$-query linear LCC/LDC and applying the strong bounds known for the former. Our approach is more direct and proceeds by bounding the covering radius of the dual code, borrowing inspiration from (Iceland and Samorodnitsky, 2018) (arXiv:1802.01184). That is, we show that if $x \mapsto (v_1 \cdot x, v_2 \cdot x, \ldots, v_n \cdot x)$ is an arbitrary encoding map $\mathbb{F}_2^k \to \mathbb{F}_2^n$ for the $3$-query LCC, then all vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^k$ can be written as a $\widetilde{O}_{\delta}(\log n)$-sparse linear combination of the $v_i$'s, which immediately implies $k \le \widetilde{O}_{\delta}((\log n)^2)$. The proof of this fact proceeds by iteratively reducing the size of any arbitrary linear combination of at least $\widetilde{\Omega}_{\delta}(\log n)$ of the $v_i$'s. We achieve this using the recent breakthrough result of (Alon, Buci\'c, Sauermann, Zakharov, and Zamir, 2023) (arXiv:2309.04460) on the existence of rainbow cycles in properly edge-colored graphs, applied to graphs capturing the linear dependencies underlying the local correction property.</description>

      <title>Interference Reduction Design for Improved Multitarget Detection in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of wireless communication systems toward 5G and beyond is spurred by the demand for high data rates, exceedingly dependable low-latency communication, and extensive connectivity that aligns with sensing requisites such as advanced high-resolution sensing and target detection. Consequently, embedding sensing into communication has gained considerable attention. In this work, we propose an alternative approach for optimizing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) waveform for target detection by concurrently maximizing the power of the communication signal at an intended user and minimizing the multi-user and sensing interference. We formulate the problem as a non-disciplined convex programming (NDCP) optimization and we use a distribution-based approach for interference cancellation. Precisely, we establish the distribution of the communication signal and the multi-user communication interference received by the intended user, and thereafter, we establish that the sensing interference can be distributed as a centralized Chi-squared if the sensing covariance matrix is idempotent. We design such a matrix based on the symmetrical idempotent property. Additionally, we propose a disciplined convex programming (DCP) form of the problem, and using successive convex approximation (SCA), we show that the solutions can reach a stable waveform for efficient target detection. Furthermore, we compare the proposed waveform with state of the art radar-communication waveform designs and demonstrate its superior performance by computer simulations.</description>

      <title>On Achievable Covert Communication Performance under CSI Estimation Error and Feedback Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covert communication's effectiveness critically depends on precise channel state information (CSI). This paper investigates the impact of imperfect CSI on achievable covert communication performance in a two-hop relay system. Firstly, we introduce a two-hop covert transmission scheme utilizing channel inversion power control (CIPC) to manage opportunistic interference, eliminating the receiver's self-interference. Given that CSI estimation error (CEE) and feedback delay (FD) are the two primary factors leading to imperfect CSI, we construct a comprehensive theoretical model to accurately characterize their effects on CSI quality. With the aid of this model, we then derive closed-form solutions for detection error probability (DEP) and covert rate (CR), establishing an analytical framework to delineate the inherent relationship between CEE, FD, and covert performance. Furthermore, to mitigate the adverse effects of imperfect CSI on achievable covert performance, we investigate the joint optimization of channel inversion power and data symbol length to maximize CR under DEP constraints and propose an iterative alternating algorithm to solve the bi-dimensional non-convex optimization problem. Finally, extensive experimental results validate our theoretical framework and illustrate the impact of imperfect CSI on achievable covert performance.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Edge AI Inference over Cloud-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a cloud radio access network (Cloud-RAN) based collaborative edge AI inference architecture is proposed. Specifically, geographically distributed devices capture real-time noise-corrupted sensory data samples and extract the noisy local feature vectors, which are then aggregated at each remote radio head (RRH) to suppress sensing noise. To realize efficient uplink feature aggregation, we allow each RRH receives local feature vectors from all devices over the same resource blocks simultaneously by leveraging an over-the-air computation (AirComp) technique. Thereafter, these aggregated feature vectors are quantized and transmitted to a central processor (CP) for further aggregation and downstream inference tasks. Our aim in this work is to maximize the inference accuracy via a surrogate accuracy metric called discriminant gain, which measures the discernibility of different classes in the feature space. The key challenges lie on simultaneously suppressing the coupled sensing noise, AirComp distortion caused by hostile wireless channels, and the quantization error resulting from the limited capacity of fronthaul links. To address these challenges, this work proposes a joint transmit precoding, receive beamforming, and quantization error control scheme to enhance the inference accuracy. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed optimization algorithm compared to various baselines.</description>

      <title>Distributed Massive MIMO System with Dynamic Clustering in LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed massive multiple-input multiple output (mMIMO) system for low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks is introduced as a promising technique to provide broadband connectivity. Nevertheless, several challenges persist in implementing distributed mMIMO systems for LEO satellite networks. These challenges include providing scalable massive access implementation as the system complexity increases with network size. Another challenging issue is the asynchronous arrival of signals at the user terminals due to the different propagation delays among distributed antennas in space, which destroys the coherent transmission, and consequently degrades the system performance. In this paper, we propose a scalable distributed mMIMO system for LEO satellite networks based on dynamic user-centric clustering. Aiming to obtain scalable implementation, new algorithms for initial cooperative access, cluster selection, and cluster handover are provided. In addition, phase shift-aware precoding is implemented to compensate for the propagation delay phase shifts. The performance of the proposed user-centric distributed mMIMO is compared with two baseline configurations: the non-cooperative transmission systems, where each user connects to only a single satellite, and the full-cooperative distributed mMIMO systems, where all satellites contribute serving each user. The numerical results show the potential of the proposed distributed mMIMO system to enhance system spectral efficiency when compared to noncooperative transmission systems. Additionally, it demonstrates the ability to minimize the serving cluster size for each user, thereby reducing the overall system complexity in comparison to the full-cooperative distributed mMIMO systems.</description>

      <title>NR-V2X Quality of Service Prediction Through Machine Learning with Nested Cross-Validation Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of connected vehicles and the advent of New Radio (NR) technologies have ushered in a new era of intelligent transportation systems. Ensuring reliable and lowlatency communication between vehicles and their surrounding environment is of utmost importance for the success of these systems. This paper presents a novel approach to predict Quality of Service (QoS) in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications through nested cross-validation. Our methodology employs several machine learning (ML) methods to predict some QoS metrics, such as packet delivery ratio (PDR), and throughput, in NR-based V2X scenarios. In ML employment, nested cross-validation approach, unlike conventional cross-validation approach, prevents information leakage from parameter selection into hyperparameter selection, and this results in getting more robust results in terms of overfitting. The study utilizes real-world NR-V2X datasets to train and validate the proposed ML methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in accurately predicting QoS parameters, even in dynamic and challenging vehicular environments. In summary, our research contributes to the advancement of NR-based V2X communication systems by introducing employment of ML methods with a novel approach for QoS prediction. The combination of accurate predictions through nested cross-validation not only enhances the reliability of communication in connected vehicles' landscape but also has a supportive role for stakeholders to make informed decisions for the optimization and management of vehicular networks.</description>

      <title>Radon-Hurwitz Grassmannian codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every equi-isoclinic tight fusion frame (EITFF) is a type of optimal code in a Grassmannian, consisting of subspaces of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space for which the smallest principal angle between any pair of them is as large as possible. EITFFs yield dictionaries with minimal block coherence and so are ideal for certain types of compressed sensing. By refining classical arguments of Lemmens and Seidel that rely upon Radon-Hurwitz theory, we fully characterize EITFFs in the special case where the dimension of the subspaces is exactly one-half of that of the ambient space. We moreover show that each such "Radon-Hurwitz EITFF" is highly symmetric.</description>

      <title>A New Hotplug Coded Caching Scheme Using PDAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the original coded caching model introduced by Maddah-Ali and Niesen in 2014, the server starts broadcasting only after it receives demands from all the users. So, all the users must be active during the delivery phase. In this work, we consider a coded caching model called hotplug coded caching in which some of the users are offline during the delivery phase. This model was first introduced by Ma and Tuninetti (``On Coded Caching Systems with Offline Users," 2022 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory). The concept of Hotplug Placement Delivery Arrays (HpPDAs) for the hotplug coded caching systems was introduced in (``Improved Hotplug Caching Schemes Using PDAs and $t$-Designs," \emph{arXiv:2311.02856}, 2024), in which the authors have constructed HpPDAs from $t$-designs. This work provides a new hotplug coded caching scheme from the existing HpPDAs. The performance comparison of the proposed scheme with the existing schemes is presented. When applied for HpPDAs from $t$-designs, our scheme outperforms the baseline scheme by Ma and Tuninetti, and the Improved $t$-scheme by Rajput and Rajan in some memory regimes.</description>

      <title>On easily computable indecomposable dimension group algebras, and group codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An easily computable dimension (or ECD) group code in the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_{q}G$ is an ideal of dimension less than or equal to $p=char(\mathbb{F}_{q})$ that is generated by an idempotent. This paper introduces an easily computable indecomposable dimension (or ECID) group algebra as a finite group algebra for which all group codes generated by primitive idempotents are ECD. Several characterizations are given for these algebras. In addition, some arithmetic conditions to determine whether a group algebra is ECID are presented, in the case it is semisimple. In the non-semisimple case, these algebras have finite representation type where the Sylow $p$-subgroups of the underlying group are simple. The dimension and some lower bounds for the minimum Hamming distance of group codes in these algebras are given together with some arithmetical tests of primitivity of idempotents. Examples illustrating the main results are presented.</description>

      <title>Just Wing It: Optimal Estimation of Missing Mass in a Markovian Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the stationary mass -- also called the unigram mass -- that is missing from a single trajectory of a discrete-time, ergodic Markov chain. This problem has several applications -- for example, estimating the stationary missing mass is critical for accurately smoothing probability estimates in sequence models. While the classical Good--Turing estimator from the 1950s has appealing properties for i.i.d. data, it is known to be biased in the Markov setting, and other heuristic estimators do not come equipped with guarantees. Operating in the general setting in which the size of the state space may be much larger than the length $n$ of the trajectory, we develop a linear-runtime estimator called \emph{Windowed Good--Turing} (\textsc{WingIt}) and show that its risk decays as $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathsf{T_{mix}}/n)$, where $\mathsf{T_{mix}}$ denotes the mixing time of the chain in total variation distance. Notably, this rate is independent of the size of the state space and minimax-optimal up to a logarithmic factor in $n / \mathsf{T_{mix}}$. We also present a bound on the variance of the missing mass random variable, which may be of independent interest. We extend our estimator to approximate the stationary mass placed on elements occurring with small frequency in $X^n$. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our estimators both in simulations on canonical chains and on sequences constructed from a popular natural language corpus.</description>

      <title>A feature-based information-theoretic approach for detecting interpretable, long-timescale pairwise interactions from time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying relationships between components of a complex system is critical to understanding the rich network of interactions that characterize the behavior of the system. Traditional methods for detecting pairwise dependence of time series, such as Pearson correlation, Granger causality, and mutual information, are computed directly in the space of measured time-series values. But for systems in which interactions are mediated by statistical properties of the time series (`time-series features') over longer timescales, this approach can fail to capture the underlying dependence from limited and noisy time-series data, and can be challenging to interpret. Addressing these issues, here we introduce an information-theoretic method for detecting dependence between time series mediated by time-series features that provides interpretable insights into the nature of the interactions. Our method extracts a candidate set of time-series features from sliding windows of the source time series and assesses their role in mediating a relationship to values of the target process. Across simulations of three different generative processes, we demonstrate that our feature-based approach can outperform a traditional inference approach based on raw time-series values, especially in challenging scenarios characterized by short time-series lengths, high noise levels, and long interaction timescales. Our work introduces a new tool for inferring and interpreting feature-mediated interactions from time-series data, contributing to the broader landscape of quantitative analysis in complex systems research, with potential applications in various domains including but not limited to neuroscience, finance, climate science, and engineering.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Dependent Graph Attention Network for Collaborative Filtering with Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborative filtering (CF) is an essential technique in recommender systems that provides personalized recommendations by only leveraging user-item interactions. However, most CF methods represent users and items as fixed points in the latent space, lacking the ability to capture uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called the Wasserstein dependent Graph ATtention network (W-GAT), for collaborative filtering with uncertainty. We utilize graph attention network and Wasserstein distance to address the limitations of LightGCN and Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) divergence to learn Gaussian embedding for each user and item. Additionally, our method incorporates Wasserstein-dependent mutual information further to increase the similarity between positive pairs and to tackle the challenges induced by KL divergence. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show the superiority of W-GAT compared to several representative baselines. Extensive experimental analysis validates the effectiveness of W-GAT in capturing uncertainty by modeling the range of user preferences and categories associated with items.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we study a discrete optimization problem, namely, the maximization of channel capacity in fluid multiple-input multiple-output (fluid-MIMO) systems through the selection of antenna ports/positions at the transmitter and the receiver. First, we present a new joint convex relaxation (JCR) problem by using an upper bound on the channel capacity and exploiting the binary nature of optimization variables. Then, we develop and analyze two optimization algorithms with different performance-complexity tradeoffs: the first is based on JCR and reduced exhaustive search (JCR&amp;RES), while the second on JCR and alternating optimization (JCR&amp;AO). Finally, numerical results show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform two baseline schemes, the random port selection and the conventional MIMO setup.</description>

      <title>Simple algorithms to test and learn local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problems of testing and learning an $n$-qubit $k$-local Hamiltonian from queries to its evolution operator with respect the 2-norm of the Pauli spectrum, or equivalently, the normalized Frobenius norm. For testing whether a Hamiltonian is $\epsilon_1$-close to $k$-local or $\epsilon_2$-far from $k$-local, we show that $O(1/(\epsilon_2-\epsilon_1)^{8})$ queries suffice. This solves two questions posed in a recent work by Bluhm, Caro and Oufkir. For learning up to error $\epsilon$, we show that $\exp(O(k^2+k\log(1/\epsilon)))$ queries suffice. Our proofs are simple, concise and based on Pauli-analytic techniques.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Density of Massive MIMO Systems over Rayleigh-Product Channels</title>

Abstract: The Rayleigh-product channel model is utilized to characterize the rank deficiency caused by keyhole effects. However, the finite blocklength analysis for Rayleigh product channels is not available in the literature. In this paper, we will characterize the mutual information density (MID) and perform the FBL analysis to reveal the impact of rank-deficiency in Rayleigh-product channels. To this end, we first set up a central limit theorem for the MID over Rayleigh-product MIMO channels in the asymptotic regime where the number of scatterers, number of antennas, and blocklength go to infinity at the same pace. Then, we utilize the CLT to obtain the upper and lower bounds for the packet error probability, whose approximations in the high and low signal to noise ratio regimes are then derived to illustrate the impact of rank deficiency. One interesting observation is that rank-deficiency degrades the performance of MIMO systems with FBL and the fundamental limits of Rayleigh-product channels degenerate to those of the Rayleigh case when the number of scatterers approaches infinity.</description>

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been widely studied in recent years, it has emerged as a new technology which can reflect the incident signal by intelligently configuring the reflection elements, thus changing the signal propagation environment, enhancing the signals users desire and suppressing the interference between users. In this paper, we study an IRS aided multi-users wireless communication where the base station (BS) sends a variety of signals, each user receives desired signals. In order to guarantee the fairness of wireless communications, we need to maximize the minimum rates of users, subject to the power constraint of BS and the phase constraint of IRS. Prior works on IRS mainly consider optimizing BS beamforming and IRS passive beamforming, this paper also aims to optimize the IRS location. The considered problem is shown to be non-convex, we decompose the problem into two subproblems, transforming the two subproblems into a lower bound problem and using alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) to solve them, respectively. Finally, the two subproblems are optimized alternately to make the objective function value converge in an acceptable range. Simulation results verify the convergence results of our proposed algorithm, and the performance improvement compared with the benchmark scheme in wireless communication system.</description>

      <title>Fairness Scheduling in User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a user-centric cell-free massive MIMO wireless network with $L$ remote radio units, each with $M$ antennas, serving $K_{\rm tot}$ user equipments (UEs). Most of the literature considers the regime $LM \gg K_{\rm tot}$, where the $K$ UEs are active on each time-frequency slot, and evaluates the system performance in terms of ergodic rates. In this paper, we take a quite different viewpoint. We observe that the regime of $LM \gg K_{\rm tot}$ corresponds to a lightly loaded system with low sum spectral efficiency (SE). In contrast, in most relevant scenarios, the number of UEs is much larger than the total number of antennas, but users are not all active at the same time. To achieve high sum SE and handle $K_{\rm tot} \gg ML$, users must be scheduled over the time-frequency resource. The number of active users $K_{\rm act} \leq K_{\rm tot}$ must be chosen such that: 1) the network operates close to its maximum SE; 2) the active user set must be chosen dynamically over time in order to enforce fairness in terms of per-user time-averaged throughput rates. The fairness scheduling problem is formulated as the maximization of a concave componentwise non-decreasing network utility function of the per-user rates. Intermittent user activity imposes slot-by-slot coding/decoding which prevents the achievability of ergodic rates. Hence, we model the per-slot service rates using information outage probability. To obtain a tractable problem, we make a decoupling assumption on the CDF of the instantaneous mutual information seen at each UE $k$ receiver. We approximately enforce this condition with a conflict graph that prevents the simultaneous scheduling of users with large pilot contamination and propose an adaptive scheme for instantaneous service rate scheduling. Overall, the proposed dynamic scheduling is robust to system model uncertainties and can be easily implemented in practice.</description>

      <title>Simplicity bias, algorithmic probability, and the random logistic map</title>

Abstract: Simplicity bias is an intriguing phenomenon prevalent in various input-output maps, characterized by a preference for simpler, more regular, or symmetric outputs. Notably, these maps typically feature high-probability outputs with simple patterns, whereas complex patterns are exponentially less probable. This bias has been extensively examined and attributed to principles derived from algorithmic information theory and algorithmic probability. In a significant advancement, it has been demonstrated that the renowned logistic map and other one-dimensional maps exhibit simplicity bias when conceptualized as input-output systems. Building upon this work, our research delves into the manifestations of simplicity bias within the random logistic map, specifically focusing on scenarios involving additive noise.
  We discover that simplicity bias is observable in the random logistic map for specific ranges of $\mu$ and noise magnitudes. Additionally, we find that this bias persists even with the introduction of small measurement noise, though it diminishes as noise levels increase. Our studies also revisit the phenomenon of noise-induced chaos, particularly when $\mu=3.83$, revealing its characteristics through complexity-probability plots. Intriguingly, we employ the logistic map to illustrate a paradoxical aspect of data analysis: more data adhering to a consistent trend can occasionally lead to \emph{reduced} confidence in extrapolation predictions, challenging conventional wisdom.
  We propose that adopting a probability-complexity perspective in analyzing dynamical systems could significantly enrich statistical learning theories related to series prediction and analysis. This approach not only facilitates a deeper understanding of simplicity bias and its implications but also paves the way for novel methodologies in forecasting complex systems behavior.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Geometry Analysis for Distributed RISs-Assisted mmWave Communications</title>

Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) has attracted considerable attention due to its wide bandwidth and high frequency. However, it is highly susceptible to blockages, resulting in significant degradation of the coverage and the sum rate. A promising approach is deploying distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which can establish extra communication links. In this paper, we investigate the impact of distributed RISs on the coverage probability and the sum rate in mmWave wireless communication systems. Specifically, we first introduce the system model, which includes the blockage, the RIS and the user distribution models, leveraging the Poisson point process. Then, we define the association criterion and derive the conditional coverage probabilities for the two cases of direct association and reflective association through RISs. Finally, we combine the two cases using Campbell's theorem and the total probability theorem to obtain the closed-form expressions for the ergodic coverage probability and the sum rate. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical approach, demonstrating that the deployment of distributed RISs significantly improves the ergodic coverage probability by 45.4% and the sum rate by over 1.5 times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the millimeter-wave (mmWave) near-field beam training problem to find the correct beam direction. In order to address the high complexity and low identification accuracy of existing beam training techniques, we propose an efficient hashing multi-arm beam (HMB) training scheme for the near-field scenario. Specifically, we first design a set of sparse bases based on the polar domain sparsity of the near-field channel. Then, the random hash functions are chosen to construct the near-field multi-arm beam training codebook. Each multi-arm beam codeword is scanned in a time slot until all the predefined codewords are traversed. Finally, the soft decision and voting methods are applied to distinguish the signal from different base stations and obtain correctly aligned beams. Simulation results show that our proposed near-field HMB training method can reduce the beam training overhead to the logarithmic level, and achieve 96.4% identification accuracy of exhaustive beam training. Moreover, we also verify applicability under the far-field scenario.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Beam Training for Multi-RIS-Assisted Multi-User Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the beam training problem in the multi-user millimeter wave (mmWave) communication system, where multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are deployed to improve the coverage and the achievable rate. However, existing beam training techniques in mmWave systems suffer from the high complexity (i.e., exponential order) and low identification accuracy. To address these problems, we propose a novel hashing multi-arm beam (HMB) training scheme that reduces the training complexity to the logarithmic order with the high accuracy. Specifically, we first design a generation mechanism for HMB codebooks. Then, we propose a demultiplexing algorithm based on the soft decision to distinguish signals from different RIS reflective links. Finally, we utilize a multi-round voting mechanism to align the beams. Simulation results show that the proposed HMB training scheme enables simultaneous training for multiple RISs and multiple users, and reduces the beam training overhead to the logarithmic level. Moreover, it also shows that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the identification accuracy by at least 20% compared to existing beam training techniques.</description>

      <title>Computation and Critical Transitions of Rate-Distortion-Perception Functions With Wasserstein Barycenter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The information rate-distortion-perception (RDP) function characterizes the three-way trade-off between description rate, average distortion, and perceptual quality measured by discrepancy between probability distributions. We study several variants of the RDP functions through the lens of optimal transport. By transforming the information RDP function into a Wasserstein Barycenter problem, we identify the critical transitions when one of the constraints becomes inactive and demonstrate several critical transition properties of the RDP variants. Further, the non-strictly convexity brought by the perceptual constraint can be regularized by an entropy regularization term. We prove that the entropy regularized model converges to the original problem and propose an alternating iteration method based on the Sinkhorn algorithm to numerically solve the regularized optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithms. As a practical application of our theory, we incorporate our numerical method into a reverse data hiding problem, where a secret message is imperceptibly embedded into the image with guarantees of the perceptual fidelity.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communications for mmWave Channels</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system operating at the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band. Specifically, the ISAC system combines communication and radar operations and performs, detecting and communicating simultaneously with multiple targets and users. The IRS dynamically controls the amplitude or phase of the radio signal via reflecting elements to reconfigure the radio propagation environment and enhance the transmission rate of the ISAC system. By jointly designing the radar signal covariance (RSC) matrix, the beamforming vector of the communication system, and the IRS phase shift, the ISAC system transmission rate can be improved while matching the desired waveform for radar. The problem is non-convex due to multivariate coupling, and thus we decompose it into two separate subproblems. First, a closed-form solution of the RSC matrix is derived from the desired radar waveform. Next, the quadratic transformation (QT) technique is applied to the subproblem, and then alternating optimization (AO) is employed to determine the communication beamforming vector and the IRS phase shift. For computing the IRS phase shift, we adopt both the majorization minimization (MM) and the manifold optimization (MO). Also, we derive a closed-form solution for the formulated problem, effectively decreasing computational complexity. Furthermore, a trade-off factor is introduced to balance the performance of communication and sensing. Finally, the simulations verify the effectiveness of the algorithm and demonstrate that the IRS can improve the performance of the ISAC system.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the multiple-exposure fusion approach in computational photography, recently, several practitioners have explored the idea of high dynamic range (HDR) X-ray imaging and tomography. While establishing promising results, these approaches inherit the limitations of multiple-exposure fusion strategy. To overcome these disadvantages, the modulo Radon transform (MRT) has been proposed. The MRT is based on a co-design of hardware and algorithms. In the hardware step, Radon transform projections are folded using modulo non-linearities. Thereon, recovery is performed by algorithmically inverting the folding, thus enabling a single-shot, HDR approach to tomography. The first steps in this topic established rigorous mathematical treatment to the problem of reconstruction from folded projections. This paper takes a step forward by proposing a new, Fourier domain recovery algorithm that is backed by mathematical guarantees. The advantages include recovery at lower sampling rates while being agnostic to modulo threshold, lower computational complexity and empirical robustness to system noise. Beyond numerical simulations, we use prototype modulo ADC based hardware experiments to validate our claims. In particular, we report image recovery based on hardware measurements up to 10 times larger than the sensor's dynamic range while benefiting with lower quantization noise ($\sim$12 dB).</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Property Testing</title>

Abstract: Locality is a fundamental feature of many physical time evolutions. Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also underlie recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian from access to the induced time evolution. However, no protocols to rigorously test whether an unknown Hamiltonian is local were known. We investigate Hamiltonian locality testing as a property testing problem, where the task is to determine whether an unknown $n$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ is $k$-local or $\varepsilon$-far from all $k$-local Hamiltonians, given access to the time evolution along $H$. First, we emphasize the importance of the chosen distance measure: With respect to the operator norm, a worst-case distance measure, incoherent quantum locality testers require $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n)$ many time evolution queries and an expected total evolution time of $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n / \varepsilon)$, and even coherent testers need $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries and $\Omega(2^{n/2}/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time. In contrast, when distances are measured according to the normalized Frobenius norm, corresponding to an average-case distance, we give a sample-, time-, and computationally efficient incoherent Hamiltonian locality testing algorithm based on randomized measurements. In fact, our procedure can be used to simultaneously test a wide class of Hamiltonian properties beyond locality. Finally, we prove that learning a general Hamiltonian remains exponentially hard with this average-case distance, thereby establishing an exponential separation between Hamiltonian testing and learning. Our work initiates the study of property testing for quantum Hamiltonians, demonstrating that a broad class of Hamiltonian properties is efficiently testable even with limited quantum capabilities, and positioning Hamiltonian testing as an independent area of research alongside Hamiltonian learning.</description>
