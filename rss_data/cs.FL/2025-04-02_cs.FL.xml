      <title>GOL in GOL in HOL: Verified Circuits in Conway's Game of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conway's Game of Life (GOL) is a cellular automaton that has captured the interest of hobbyists and mathematicians alike for more than 50 years. The Game of Life is Turing complete, and people have been building increasingly sophisticated constructions within GOL, such as 8-bit displays, Turing machines, and even an implementation of GOL itself. In this paper, we report on a project to build an implementation of GOL within GOL, via logic circuits, fully formally verified within the HOL4 theorem prover. This required a combination of interactive tactic proving, symbolic simulation, and semi-automated forward proof to assemble the components into an infinite circuit which can calculate the next step of the simulation while respecting signal propagation delays. The result is a verified "GOL in GOL compiler" which takes an initial GOL state and returns a mega-cell version of it that can be passed to off-the-shelf GOL simulators, such as Golly. We believe these techniques are also applicable to other cellular automata, as well as for hardware verification which takes into account both the physical configuration of components and wire delays.</description>

      <title>New Insights into the Decidability of Opacity in Timed Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the decidability of opacity in timed automata (TA), a property that has been proven to be undecidable in general. First, we address a theoretical gap in recent work by J. An et al. (FM 2024) by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the decidability of location-based opacity in TA. Based on these conditions, we identify a new decidable subclass of TA, called timed automata with integer resets (IRTA), where clock resets are restricted to occurring at integer time points. We also present a verification algorithm for opacity in IRTA. On the other hand, we consider achieving decidable timed opacity by weakening the capabilities of intruders. Specifically, we show that opacity in general TA becomes decidable under the assumption that intruders can only observe time in discrete units. These results establish theoretical foundations for modeling timed systems and intruders in security analysis, enabling an effective balance between expressiveness and decidability.</description>

      <title>Complex event recognition under time constraints: towards a formal framework for efficient query evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies Complex Event Recognition (CER) under time constraints regarding its query language, computational models, and streaming evaluation algorithms. We start by introducing an extension of Complex Event Logic (CEL), called timed CEL, with simple time operators. We show that timed CEL aids in modeling CER query languages in practice, serving as a proxy to study the expressive power of such languages under time constraints. For this purpose, we introduce an automata model for studying timed CEL, called timed Complex Event Automata (timed CEA). This model extends the existing CEA model with clocks, combining CEA and timed automata in a single model. We show that timed CEL and timed CEA are equally expressive, giving the first characterization of CER query languages under time constraints. Then, we move towards understanding the efficient evaluation of timed CEA over streams concerning its determinization and efficient algorithms. We present a class of timed CEA that are closed under determinization; furthermore, we show that this class contains swg-queries, an expressive class of CER queries recently introduced by Kleest-Meissner et al. Finally, we present a streaming evaluation algorithm with constant update time and output-linear delay for evaluating deterministic monotonic timed CEA with a single clock, which have only less equal or greater equal comparisons.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Safety Verification using Barrier Certificates and Matrix Zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is a critical challenge, especially when system models are difficult to obtain or cannot be fully trusted due to uncertainty, modeling errors, or environmental disturbances. Traditional model-based approaches rely on precise system dynamics, which may not be available in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a data-driven safety verification framework that leverages matrix zonotopes and barrier certificates to verify system safety directly from noisy data. Instead of trusting a single unreliable model, we construct a set of models that capture all possible system dynamics that align with the observed data, ensuring that the true system model is always contained within this set. This model set is compactly represented using matrix zonotopes, enabling efficient computation and propagation of uncertainty. By integrating this representation into a barrier certificate framework, we establish rigorous safety guarantees without requiring an explicit system model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in verifying safety for dynamical systems with unknown models, showcasing its potential for real-world CPS applications.</description>
