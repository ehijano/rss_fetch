      <title>Hamiltonian Information Geometric Regularization of the Compressible Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed information geometric regularization (IGR) was the first inviscid regularization of the multi-dimensional compressible Euler equations, which enabled the simulation of realistic compressible fluid models at an unprecedented scale. However, the thermodynamic effects of this regularization have not yet been understood in a principled manner. To achieve a proper understanding of the thermodynamic aspects of the IGR, we decompose the regularization into its conservative dynamics, framed as a Hamiltonian subsystem, and its dissipative dynamics. In so doing, we further introduce two more models to compare to IGR, the Hamiltonian regularized Euler (HRE) model, which is the first multi-dimensional, non-dispersive Hamiltonian regularization of the compressible Euler equations with energy, as well as the Hamiltonian IGR (HIGR) model, which modifies the dissipation used in the IGR model to instead utilize a metriplectic dissipative force. Despite having many attractive features, the HRE and HIGR models exhibit notable defects in numerical tests on colliding shock problems, which preclude their use as computational tools without further study of dissipative weak solutions to these models. Additionally, our analysis presents new results on the IGR model itself, including its ability to conserve acoustic waves, as well as local energy transport laws and entropy production rates. By separating the conservative and dissipative dynamics of the IGR, our hope is that subsequent of analysis of the IGR model can benefit from this natural decomposition, such as, for example, rigorous proofs of strong solutions for multi-dimensional IGR for the compressible Euler system with thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a string field Hamiltonian formalism that associates a class of spectral curves and provides their quantization through the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion. As illustrative examples, we present Hamiltonians for the $(2,2m-1)$ minimal discrete and continuum dynamical triangulation (DT) models, the supersymmetric analogue of minimal continuum DT models, the Penner model, and 4D $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(2)$ gauge theories in the self-dual $\Omega$-background.</description>

      <title>An integrable hierarchy associated with loop extension of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hierarchy of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded integrable equations is constructed using the loop extension of the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$. This hierarchy includes $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded extensions of the Liouville, sinh-Gordon, cosh-Gordon, and, in particular, the mKdV equations. The $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded KdV equation is also derived from the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-mKdV equation via the Miura transformation. We present explicit formulas for the conserved charges of the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-KdV and $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-mKdV equations. A distinctive feature of these $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded integrable systems is the existence of conserved charges with nontrivial grading.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we summarize the main ideas of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory, which is a rigorous framework combining some of the Haag-Kastler axioms with perturbative methods involving formal power series. It allows for the construction of interacting QFT models in four spacetime dimensions and works on arbitrary globally hyperbolic manifolds. This approach has also led to the development of a non-perturbative construction of local nets of C*-algebras for interacting theories, which will also be discussed at the end of this review.</description>

      <title>Power counting in the spectral action matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive power counting formulas for ribbon graph amplitudes that were recently independently discovered in two contexts, namely as a generalization of the Kontsevich model, and as corresponding to a matrix model approach to the spectral action. The Feynman rules are based on divided difference functions of eigenvalues of an abstract Dirac operator. We obtain formulas for the order of divergence, depending on the spectral dimension $d$, the order of decay of the test function $f$ of the spectral action, and the graph properties. Several consequences are discussed, such as the fact that all graphs with maximal order of divergence (at a given loop order and number of external vertices) are planar. To derive our main results we establish two-sided bounds for divided differences, and in particular generalize Hunter's positivity theorem to a larger class of functions.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic transformations over polyadic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel cryptographic paradigm based on nonderived polyadic algebraic structures. Traditional cryptosystems rely on binary operations within groups, rings, or fields, whose well-understood properties can be exploited in cryptanalysis. To overcome these vulnerabilities, we propose a shift to polyadic rings, which generalize classical rings by allowing operations of higher arity: an $m$-ary addition and an $n$-ary multiplication. The foundation of our approach is the construction of polyadic integers -- congruence classes of ordinary integers endowed with such $m$-ary and $n$-ary operations. A key innovation is the parameter-to-arity mapping $\Phi(a,b)=(m,n)$, which links the parameters $(a,b)$ defining a congruence class to the specific arities required for algebraic closure. This mapping is mathematically intricate: it is non-injective, non-surjective, and multivalued. This complex, non-unique relationship forms the core of the proposed cryptosystem's security. We present two concrete encryption procedures that leverage this structure by encoding plaintext within the parameters of polyadic rings and transmitting information via polyadically quantized analog signals. In one method, plaintext is linked to the additive arity $m_{i}$ and secured using the summation of such signals; in the other, it is linked to a ring parameter $a_{i}$ and secured using their multiplication. In both cases, the "quantized" nature of polyadic operations generates systems of equations that are straightforward for a legitimate recipient with the correct key but exceptionally difficult for an attacker without it. The resulting framework promises a substantial increase in cryptographic security. This work establishes the theoretical foundation for this new class of encryption schemes and highlights their potential for constructing robust, next-generation cryptographic protocols.</description>

      <title>Transversal Clifford-Hierarchy Gates via Non-Abelian Surface Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a purely 2D transversal realization of phase gates at any level of the Clifford hierarchy, and beyond, using non-Abelian surface codes. Our construction encodes a logical qubit in the quantum double $D(G)$ of a non-Abelian group $G$ on a triangular spatial patch. The logical gate is implemented transversally by stacking on the spatial region a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase specified by a group 2-cocycle. The Bravyi--K\"onig theorem limits the unitary gates implementable by constant-depth quantum circuits on Pauli stabilizer codes in $D$ dimensions to the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. We bypass this, by constructing transversal unitary gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy purely in 2D, without sacrificing locality or fault tolerance, however at the cost of using the quantum double of a non-Abelian group $G$. Specifically, for $G = D_{4N}$, the dihedral group of order $8N$, we realize the phase gate $T^{1/N} = \mathrm{diag}(1, e^{i\pi/(4N)})$ in the logical $\overline{Z}$ basis. For $8N = 2^n$, this gate lies at the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and, importantly, has a qubit-only realization: we show that it can be constructed in terms of Clifford-hierarchy stabilizers for a code with $n$ physical qubits on each edge of the lattice. We also discuss code-switching to the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric codes, which can be utilized for the quantum error correction in this setup.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Cohen-Macaulay One-Loop Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized hypergeometric systems, in the sense of Gel'fand, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky, associated with one-loop Feynman integrals, and determine when their rank is independent of space-time dimension and propagator powers. This is equivalent to classifying when the associated affine semigroup ring is Cohen-Macaulay. For massive one-loop integrals, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for Cohen-Macaulayness, generalizing previous results on normality for these rings. We show that for Feynman integrals, the Cohen-Macaulay property is fully determined by an integer linear program built from the Newton polytope of the integrand and find a graphical description of its solutions. Furthermore, we provide a sufficient condition for Cohen-Macaulayness of general one-loop integrals.</description>

      <title>Upper Bound for Permanent Saturation of Metric Graphs using Interval Exchange Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine upper bounds on the permanent saturation time of metric graphs using interval exchange transformations (IETs). Earlier results gave bounds under incommensurable edge lengths, we improve and generalize them by using the ergodic and minimal properties of IETs. By associating an IET to a metric graph, we show that the induced interval dynamics are ergodic and minimal, which ensures uniform coverage over time. Our main theorem gives a sharper upper bound for the saturation time in terms of edge lengths and structural constants of the graph. We also define the Lyapunov spectrum of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle for these maps and relate it to the system's dynamics. We validate our theoretical findings through simulations on specific graph configurations, such as the complete graph $K_4$ and star graphs, confirming the accuracy of our estimates. These results strengthen existing estimates and provide tools for studying connectivity at the interface of graph theory and dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Coherence-Sensitive Readout Models for Quantum Devices: Beyond the Classical Assignment Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Readout error models for noisy quantum devices almost universally assume that measurement noise is classical: the measurement statistics are obtained from the ideal computational-basis populations by a column-stochastic assignment matrix $A$. This description is equivalent to assuming that the effective positive-operator-valued measurement (POVM) is diagonal in the measurement basis, and therefore completely insensitive to quantum coherences. We relax this assumption and derive a fully general expression for the observed measurement probabilities under arbitrary completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) noise preceding a computational-basis measurement. Writing the ideal post-circuit stat $\tilde{\rho}$ in terms of its populations $x$ and coherences $y$, we show that the observed probability vector $z$ satisfies $z = A x + C y$, where $A$ is the familiar classical assignment matrix and $C$ is a coherence-response matrix constructed from the off-diagonal matrix elements of the effective POVM in the computational basis. The classical model $z = A x$ arises if and only if all POVM elements are diagonal; in this sense $C$ quantifies accessible information about coherent readout distortions and interference between computational-basis states, all of which are invisible to models that retain only $A$. This work therefore provides a natural, fully general framework for coherence-sensitive readout modeling on current and future quantum devices.</description>

      <title>The influence of surface tension in thin-film hydrodynamics: gravity free planar hydraulic jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydraulic jumps in thin films are traditionally explained through gravity-driven shallow-water theory, with surface tension assumed to play only a secondary role via Laplace pressure. Recent experiments, however, suggest that surface tension can be the primary mechanism. In this work we develop a theoretical framework for surface tension driven hydraulic jumps in planar thin-film flows. Starting from the full interfacial stress conditions, we show that the deviatoric component of the normal stress enters at leading order and fundamentally alters the balance. A dominant-balance analysis in the zero-gravity limit yields parameter-free governing equations, which admit a similarity solution for the velocity profile. Depth-averaged momentum conservation then reveals a singularity at unit Weber number, interpreted as the criterion for hydraulic control. This singularity is regularised by a non-trivial pressure gradient at the jump. This work establishes the theoretical basis for surface-tension-driven hydraulic jumps, providing analytical predictions for the jump location and structure.</description>

      <title>Integrable variant Blaszak-Szum lattice equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a novel variant of the Blaszak-Szum lattice equation by introducing a new class of trigonometric-type bilinear operators. By employing Hirota's bilinear method, we obtain the Gram-type determinant solution of the variant Blaszak-Szum lattice equation. One-soliton and two-soliton solutions are constructed, with a detailed analysis of the asymptotic behaviors of the two-soliton solution. A B\"acklund transformation for the variant Blaszak-Szum lattice equation is established. By virtue of this B\"acklund transformation, multi-lump solutions of the equation are further constructed. Rational solutions are derived by introducing two differential operators applied to the determinant elements; in particular, lump solutions derived via these differential operators can be formulated in terms of Schur polynomials. Through parameter variation, three types of breather solutions are obtained, including the Akhmediev breather, Kuznetsov-Ma breather, and a general breather that propagates along arbitrary oblique trajectories. Finally, numerical three-periodic wave solutions to the variant Blaszak-Szum lattice equation are computed using the Gauss-Newton method.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Approach to Bifurcations in Kerr Ring and Fabry-Perot Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality Kerr resonators are a key platform for studying nonlinear optical phenomena, where bifurcations such as optical bistability and spontaneous symmetry breaking are both of theoretical and practical significance. In this work, we present an analytical framework, which allows finding the stationary states and their bifurcations for the propagating fields in Kerr ring and Fabry-Perot resonators. Using tools from nonlinear algebra, namely, polynomial resultants and Groebner bases, we derive compact polynomial expressions describing the system full solution in both intensity and amplitude representations. The bifurcations are derived from these expressions, and are additionally characterized as exceptional points of an auxiliary linear non-Hermitian system. This work unifies key phenomena in Kerr resonators under the broader framework of nonlinear algebra and offers better control of nonlinear optical systems and the design of photonic devices, enabled by full analytic control.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal Moran dynamics in continuous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how natural selection unfolds across space and time is a central problem in evolutionary biology. Classic models such as the Moran process capture stochastic birth-death dynamics in structured populations, while reaction-diffusion equations like the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) equation describe deterministic wave-like spread. In this work, we bridge these perspectives by deriving partial differential equations for the spatiotemporal limit of Moran dynamics in continuous media. Our model incorporates two distinct fitness components: fecundity (birth rate) and viability (death rate). We demonstrate that the resulting selective wave speeds differ substantially in spatial Moran Birth-death (Bd), Moran Death-birth (Db), and FKPP dynamics. When fecundity drives the dynamics, we observe that the selective waves decelerate for the Bd process, whereas in the Db process the wave propagates with a higher, constant speed. In contrast, when viability drives the process, the Db wave accelerates, while the Bd and FKPP waves maintain comparable constant speeds. We extend the framework to heterogeneous media, represented as weighted lattice graphs in one or two dimensions. We derive a continuous space analog of isothermal graphs and establish that the isothermality condition corresponds to the conservation of a local current.</description>

      <title>Existence, scaling, and spectral gap for traveling fronts in the 2D renormalized Allen--Cahn equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the deterministic skeleton of the renormalized stochastic Allen--Cahn equation in spatial dimension $2$. For all sufficiently small regularization parameters $\delta&gt;0$, we construct monotone traveling wave front solutions connecting the renormalized equilibria, derive a small-$\delta$ asymptotic description of their profile and speed, and identify the leading-order contributions. Linearizing about the wave and working in a naturally chosen weighted space, we show that there exists a spectral gap between the symmetry induced eigenvalue $0$ and the rest of the spectrum. The spectral gap grows linearly in the renormalization constant as $\delta\downarrow 0$.</description>

      <title>Age-structured hydrodynamics of ensembles of anomalously diffusing particles with renewal resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an age-structured hydrodynamic (HD) theory which describes the collective behavior of $N\gg 1$ anomalously diffusing particles under stochastic renewal resetting. The theory treats the age of a particle -- the time since its last reset -- as an explicit dynamical variable and allows for resetting rules which introduce global inter-particle correlations. The anomalous diffusion is modeled by the scaled Brownian motion (sBm): a Gaussian process with independent increments, characterized by a power-law time dependence of the diffusion coefficient, $D(t)\sim t^{2H-1}$, where $H&gt;0$. We apply this theory to three different resetting protocols: independent resetting to the origin (model~A), resetting to the origin of the particle farthest from it (model~B), and a scaled-diffusion extension of the ``Brownian bees" model of Berestycki et al, Ann. Probab. \textbf{50}, 2133 (2022). In all these models non-equilibrium steady states are reached at long times, and we determine the steady-state densities. For model A the (normalized to unity) steady-state density coincides with the steady-state probability density of a single particle undergoing sBM with resetting to the origin. For model B, and for the scaled Brownian bees, the HD steady-state densities are markedly different: in particular, they have compact supports for all $H&gt;0$. The age-structured HD formalism can be extended to other anomalous diffusion processes with renewal resetting protocols which introduce global inter-particle correlations.</description>

      <title>Anti-de Sitter flag superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to develop a global formulation for ${\cal N}=2$ harmonic/projective anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspace $\text{AdS}^{4|8}\times S^2 \simeq \text{AdS}^{4|8}\times {\mathbb C}P^1$ that allows for a simple action of superconformal (and hence AdS isometry) transformations. First of all, we provide an alternative supertwistor description of the ${\cal N}$-extended AdS superspace in four dimensions, AdS$^{4|4\cal N}$, which corresponds to a realisation of the connected component $\mathsf{OSp}_0({\cal N}|4; {\mathbb R})$ of the AdS isometry supergroup as $\mathsf{SU}(2,2 |{\cal N}) \bigcap \mathsf{OSp} ({\cal N}| 4; {\mathbb C})$. The proposed realisation yields the following properties: (i) AdS$^{4|4\cal N}$ is an open domain of the compactified ${\cal N}$-extended Minkowski superspace, $\overline{\mathbb M}^{4|4\cal N}$; (ii) the infinitesimal ${\cal N}$-extended superconformal transformations naturally act on AdS$^{4|4\cal N}$; and (iii) the isometry transformations of AdS$^{4|4\cal N}$ are described by those superconformal transformations which obey a certain constraint. The obtained results for AdS$^{4|4\cal N}$ are then applied to develop a supertwistor formulation for an AdS flag superspace $ \text{AdS}^{4|8} \times {\mathbb F}_1(2)$ that we identify with the ${\cal N}=2$ harmonic/projective AdS superspace. This construction makes it possible to read off the superconformal and AdS isometry transformations acting on the analytic subspace of the harmonic superspace.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic liquid crystal models for lipid bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse-grained continuous descriptions for lipid bilayers are typically based on minimizing the Helfrich energy. Such models consider the fluid properties of these structures only implicitly and have been shown to nicely reproduce equilibrium properties. Model extensions that also address the dynamics of these structures are surface (Navier--)Stokes--Helfrich models. They explicitly account for membrane viscosity. However, these models also usually treat the lipid bilayer as a homogeneous continuum, neglecting the molecular degrees of freedom of the lipids. Here, we derive refined models which consider in addition a scalar order parameter representing the molecular alignment of the lipids along the surface normal. Starting from hydrodynamic surface liquid crystal models, we obtain a hydrodynamic surface Landau--Helfrich model for asymmetric lipid bilayers and a surface Beris--Edwards model for symmetric lipid bilayers. The fully ordered case for both models leads to the known surface (Navier--)Stokes--Helfrich models. Besides more detailed continuous models for lipid bilayers, we therefore also provide an alternative derivation of surface (Navier--)Stokes--Helfrich models.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue asymptotics for strong $\delta$-interactions supported on curves with corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ be a piecewise smooth closed curve with corners. We discuss the asymptotic behavior of the individual eigenvalues of the two-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta-\alpha\delta_\Gamma$ for $\alpha\to\infty$, where $\delta_\Gamma$ is the Dirac $\delta$-distribution supported by $\Gamma$. It is shown that the asymptotics of several first eigenvalues is determined by the corner opening only, while the main term in the asymptotic expansion for the other eigenvalues is the same as for smooth curves. Under an additional assumption on the corners of $\Gamma$ (which is satisfied, in particular, if $\Gamma$ has no acute corners), a more detailed eigenvalue asymptotics is established in terms of a one-dimensional effective operator on the boundary.</description>

      <title>A Compact Formula for Conserved Three-Point Tensor Structures in 4D CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a compact analytic formula for a complete basis of conformally invariant tensor structures for three-point functions of conserved operators in arbitrary 4D Lorentz representations. The construction follows directly from a novel constraint equivalent to applying conservation conditions at each point: the leading terms in all OPE limits appear as symmetric traceless tensors. We derive this by lifting to a unified $\mathrm{SU}(m,m|2n)$ analytic superspace framework, where the conservation conditions are automatically solved and then reducing back to 4D CFT. The same method is also used for cases involving one non-conserved operator. This formalism further reveals a map of the counting of CFT tensor structures to that of finite-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(2n)$ representations, solved by Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. All results can be directly re-interpreted as three-point $\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal tensor structures via the unified analytic superspace.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Similarity in Higher-Order Classical Symplectic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many theories of physical interest, which admit a Hamiltonian description, exhibit symmetries under a particular class of non - strictly canonical transformation, known as dynamical similarities. The presence of such symmetries allows a reduction process to be carried out, eliminating a single degree of freedom from the system, which we associate with an overall scale. This process of `contact reduction' leads to theories of a frictional nature, in which the physically-observable quantities form an autonomous subsystem, that evolves in a predictable manner. We demonstrate that this procedure has a natural generalisation to theories of higher order; detailed examples are provided, and physical implications discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Onsager reciprocal relations model physical irreversible processes from complex systems. Recently, it has been shown that Onsager principles for master equations on finite states introduce a class of Riemannian metrics in a probability simplex, named probability manifolds. We call these manifolds finite-state generalized Wasserstein-$2$ spaces. In this paper, we study geometric calculations on probability manifolds, in which we derive the Levi-Civita connection, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport, and compute the Riemannian and sectional curvatures. We present two examples of geometric quantities in probability manifolds. These include Levi-Civita connections from the chemical monomolecular triangle reaction and sectional, Ricci, and scalar curvatures in Wasserstein space on a three-point lattice.</description>

      <title>Interpolations for a quantum Parisi formula in transverse field mean-field spin glass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum Parisi formula for the transverse field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model is proven with an elementary mathematical method. First, a self-overlap corrected quantum model of the transverse field SK model is represented in terms of the Hamiltonian with annealed random interactions. The interpolation given by Guerra and Toninelli is extended to the self-overlap corrected quantum model. It is proven that the infinite-volume limit of the free energy density exists in the operator formalism. Next, another interpolation developed by Guerra and Talagrand is applied to obtain a finite step replica-symmetry breaking (RSB) bound on the free energy density in the transverse field SK model. The interpolation enables us to show that the deviation of the RSB solution from the exact solution vanishes in the self-overlap corrected quantum model in a functional representation of the quantum spin operators. Finally, the corrected terms are removed by the Hopf-Lax formula for a nonlinear partial differential equation to show the quantum Parisi formula for the original transverse field SK model. The formula is extended to that for the transverse field mean-field $p$-spin glass model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Gibbs equilibrium of a classical 2D Coulomb gas in the determinantal case = 2. The external potential is the sum of a quadratic term and the potential generated by individual charges pinned in several extended groups. This leads to an equilibrium measure (droplet) with flat density and macroscopic holes. We consider ''correlation energy'' (free energy minus its mean-field approximation) expansions, for large particle number . Under the assumptions that the holes are sufficiently small, separated, and far from the droplet's outer boundary, we prove that (i) the correlation energy up to order 1 is independent of the holes' locations and orientations, and (ii) the difference between the correlation energies of systems differing by their number of holes essentially consists of ``topological'' $O(\log N)$ and $O(1)$ terms.</description>

Abstract: A one-parameter family of self-adjoint operators interpolating between the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian and its rotating-wave approximation is studied. A mathematically rigorous treatment of such interpolations has been lacking. Motivated by the physical claim that counter-rotating terms dominate at strong coupling, we analyze the limit in which the coupling constant of the anisotropic Rabi model tends to infinity. Our results provide an operator-theoretic description of this limit and clarify the spectral evolution from the rotating-wave approximation to the full Rabi model.</description>

      <title>Effective models for generalized Newtonian fluids through a thin porous medium following the Carreau law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the flow of a generalized Newtonian fluid through a thin porous medium of thickness $\epsilon$, perforated by periodically distributed solid cylinders of size $\epsilon$. We assume that the fluid is described by the 3D incompressible Stokes system, with a non-linear viscosity following the Carreau law of flow index $1&lt;r&lt;+\infty$, and scaled by a factor $\epsilon^{\gamma}$, where $\gamma\in \mathbb{R}$. Generalizing (Anguiano et al., Q. J. Mech. Math., 75(1), 2022, 1-27), where the particular case $r&lt;2$ and $\gamma=1$ was addressed, we perform a new and complete study on the asymptotic behaviour of the fluid as $\epsilon$ goes to zero. Depending on $\gamma$ and the flow index $r$, using homogenization techniques, we derive and rigorously justify different effective linear and non-linear lower-dimensional Darcy's laws. Finally, using a finite element method, we study numerically the influence of the rheological parameters of the fluid and of the shape of the solid obstacles on the behaviour of the effective systems.</description>

Abstract: Sharma and Bhosale [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.014412}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{109}, 014412 (2024)}; \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.064313}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}] recently introduced an $N$-spin Floquet model with infinite-range Ising interactions. There, we have shown that the model exhibits the signatures of quantum integrability for specific parameter values $J=1,1/2$ and $\tau=\pi/4$. We have found analytically the eigensystem and the time evolution of the unitary operator for finite values of $N$ up to $12$ qubits. We have calculated the reduced density matrix, its eigensystem, time-evolved linear entropy, and the time-evolved concurrence for the initial states $\ket{0,0}$ and $\ket{\pi/2,-\pi/2}$. For the general case $N&gt;12$, we have provided sufficient numerical evidences for the signatures of quantum integrability, such as the degenerate spectrum, the exact periodic nature of entanglement dynamics, and the time-evolved unitary operator. In this paper, we have extended these calculations to arbitrary initial state $\ket{\theta_0,\phi_0}$, such that $\theta_0 \in [0,\pi]$ and $\phi_0 \in [-\pi,\pi]$. Along with that, we have analytically calculated the expression for the average linear entropy for arbitrary initial states. We numerically find that the average value of time-evolved concurrence for arbitrary initial states decreases with $N$, implying the multipartite nature of entanglement. We numerically show that the values $\langle S\rangle/S_{Max} \rightarrow 1$ for Ising strength ($J\neq1,1/2$), while for $J=1$ and $1/2$, it deviates from $1$ for arbitrary initial states even though the thermodynamic limit does not exist in our model. This deviation is shown to be a signature of integrability in earlier studies where the thermodynamic limit exist.</description>

Abstract: We develop a higher-dimensional extension of multifractal analysis for typical fiber-bunched linear cocycles. Our main result is a relative variational principle, which shows that the topological entropy of Lyapunov exponent level sets can be approximated by the metric entropy of ergodic measures fully concentrated on those level sets, addressing a question posed by Breuillard and Sert. We also establish a variational principle for the generalized singular value function. As an application to dynamically defined linear cocycles, we obtain a multifractal formalism for open sets of $C^{1+\alpha}$ repellers and Anosov diffeomorphisms.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{T}$ be the two-dimensional triangular lattice, and $\mathbb{Z}$ the one-dimensional integer lattice. Let $\mathbb{T}\times \mathbb{Z}$ denote the Cartesian product graph. Consider the Ising model defined on this graph with inverse temperature $\beta$ and external field $h$, and let $\beta_c$ be the critical inverse temperature when $h=0$. We prove that for each $\beta\in[0,\beta_c)$, there exists $h_c(\beta)&gt;0$ such that both a unique infinite $+$cluster and a unique infinite $-$cluster coexist whenever $|h|&lt;h_c(\beta)$. The same coexistence result also holds for the three-dimensional triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the temporal law in KPZ random growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies the temporal law of the KPZ fixed point. For the stationary geometry, we find the two-time law, which extends the single time law due to Baik-Rains and Ferrari-Spohn. For the droplet geometry, we find a relatively simpler formula for the multi-time law compared to a previous formula of Johansson and the author. These formulas are derived as the scaling limit of corresponding multi-time formulas for geometric last passage percolation.</description>

      <title>Beyond symmetry protection: Robust feedback-enforced edge states in non-Hermitian stacked quantum spin Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that, in the simplest time-reversal-symmetric setting, strongly coupling two QSH layers yields a trivial $\mathbb Z_2$ phase and no protected topological edge states. We demonstrate that, in a regime with intermediate inter-layer coupling (neither in the strong or weak coupling regimes) and competitive non-Hermitian directed amplification, bulk modes are rendered with negligible gain while arbitrary bulk excitations inevitably accumulate into robust helical edge transport modes -- without relying on any symmetry protection. Our feedback-enforced mechanism persists over broad parameter ranges and remains robust even on fractal or irregular boundaries. These findings challenge the traditional view of stacked QSH insulators as inevitably trivial, and open up new avenues for designing helical topological devices that exploit feedback-enforced non-Hermitian engineering, instead of symmetry-enforced robustness.</description>

      <title>Universality for fluctuations of counting statistics of random normal matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04386v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the fluctuations of the number of eigenvalues of $n\times n$ random normal matrices depending on a potential $Q$ in a given set $A$. These eigenvalues are known to form a determinantal point process, and are known to accumulate on a compact set called the droplet under mild conditions on $Q$. When $A$ is a Borel set strictly inside the droplet, we show that the variance of the number of eigenvalues $N_A^{(n)}$ in $A$ has a limiting behavior given by
  \begin{align*} \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac1{\sqrt n}\operatorname{Var } N_A^{(n)} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt\pi}\int_{\partial_* A} \sqrt{\Delta Q(z)} \, d\mathcal H^1(z), \end{align*} where $\partial_* A$ is the measure theoretic boundary of $A$, $d\mathcal H^1(z)$ denotes the one-dimensional Hausdorff measure, and $\Delta = \partial_z \overline{\partial_z}$. We also consider the case where $A$ is a microscopic dilation of the droplet and fully generalize a result by Akemann, Byun and Ebke for arbitrary potentials. In this result $d\mathcal H^1(z)$ is replaced by the harmonic measure at $\infty$ associated with the exterior of the droplet. This second result is proved by strengthening results due to Hedenmalm-Wennman and Ameur-Cronvall on the asymptotic behavior of the associated correlation kernel near the droplet boundary.</description>

      <title>On the point spectrum of electromagnetic Dirac operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop the method of multipliers for electromagnetic Dirac operators and establish sufficient conditions on the magnetic and electric fields that guarantee the absence of point spectrum. In the massless case, our approach covers Coulomb-type potentials of the form $V(x) = \frac{1}{|x|} \big(\nu \mathbb{I} + \mu \beta + i \delta \beta \big(\boldsymbol{\alpha}\cdot \frac{x}{|x|} \big) \big).$ We also adapt the method to show absence of embedded eigenvalues above a threshold which depends on the asymptotic behaviour of the magnetic and electric fields.</description>

      <title>One-arm exponents of the high-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the probability that the origin is connected to the boundary of the box of size $n$ (the one-arm probability) in several percolation models related to the Ising model. We prove that different universality classes emerge at criticality.
  - For the FK-Ising measure in a box of size $n$ with wired boundary conditions, we prove that this probability decays as $1/n$ in dimensions $d&gt;4$, and as $1/n^{1+o(1)}$ when $d=4$.
  - For the infinite volume FK-Ising measure, we prove that this probability decays as $1/n^2$ in dimensions $d&gt;6$, and as $1/n^{2+o(1)}$ when $d=6$.
  - For the sourceless double random current measure, we prove that this probability decays as $1/n^{d-2}$ in dimensions $d&gt;4$, and as $1/n^{2+o(1)}$ when $d=4$.
  Additionally, for the infinite volume FK-Ising measure, we show that the one-arm probability is $1/n^{1+o(1)}$ in dimension $d=4$, and at least $1/n^{3/2}$ in dimension $d=5$. This establishes that the FK-Ising model has upper-critical dimension equal to $6$, in contrast to the Ising model, where it is known to be less or equal to $4$, thus solving a conjecture of Chayes, Coniglio, Machta, and Shtengel.</description>

      <title>Generalisations of the Russo-Townsend formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a generalisation of the recent construction by Russo and Townsend, we propose a new approach to generate $\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant models for nonlinear electrodynamics. It is based on the use of two building blocks: (i) a fixed (but otherwise arbitrary) model for self-dual nonlinear electrodynamics with Lagrangian $L(F_{\mu\nu};g)$ depending on a duality-invariant parameter $g$; and (ii) an arbitrary potential $W(\psi)$, with $\psi$ an auxiliary scalar field. It turns out that the model $\mathfrak{L}(F_{\mu\nu};\psi) = L(F_{\mu\nu};\psi) + W(\psi)$ leads to a self-dual theory for nonlinear electrodynamics upon elimination of $\psi$. As an illustration, we work out an example in which the seed Lagrangian $L(F_{\mu\nu};g)$ corresponds to the Born-Infeld model and a particular potential $W(\psi)$ is chosen such that integrating $\psi$ out gives the ModMaxBorn theory. We also briefly discuss supersymmetric generalisations of the proposed formulation.</description>

      <title>Quantum resource degradation theory within the framework of observational entropy decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22350v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of quantum resource degradation grounded in a decomposition of observational entropy, which partitions the total resource into inter-block coherence ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{rel}}$) and intra-block noise ($\mathcal{D}_{\text{rel}}$). Under free operations, the total quantum resource is transformed into classical noise while its overall quantity remains conserved. We demonstrate that the metric $\eta$ functions as a diagnostic indicator, providing a new lens on optimization stagnation, particularly the barren plateau phenomenon in variational quantum algorithms. We substantiate this framework through rigorous mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, and we explore how these channels can be physically implemented in real quantum systems. Our approach offers a unified viewpoint on quantum thermalization, measurement-induced disturbance, and the degradation of quantum advantage in practical devices, while also improving optimization strategies for current and near-term noisy quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Axial Symmetric Navier Stokes Equations and the Beltrami /anti Beltrami spectrum in view of Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I further continue an investigation on Beltrami Flows began in 2015 with A. Sorin and amply revised and developed in 2022 with M. Trigiante. Instead of a compact $3$-torus $T^3=\mathbb{R}^3/\Lambda$ where $\Lambda$ is a crystallographic lattice, as done in previous work, here I considered flows confined in a cylinder with identified opposite bases. In this topology I considered axial symmetric flows and found a complete basis of axial symmetric harmonic $1$-forms that, for each energy level, decomposes into six components: two Beltrami, two anti-Beltrami and two closed forms. These objects, that are written in terms of trigonometric and Bessel functions, constitute a function basis for an $L^2$ space of axial symmetric flows. I have presented a general scheme for the search of axial symmetric solutions of Navier Stokes equation by reducing the latter to an hierachy of quadratic relations on the development coefficients of the flow in the above described functional basis. It is proposed that the coefficients can be determined by means of a Physics Informed like Neural Network optimization recursive algorithm. Indeed the present paper provides the theoretical foundations for such a algorithmic construction that is planned for a future publication.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Decoherence from Imaginary-Order Spectral Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mechanism of spontaneous decoherence is examined in which the generator of quantum dynamics is replaced by the imaginary-order (which is fundamentally different from real-order fractional calculus) spectral deformation $H^{1+i\beta}$ for a positive self-adjoint Hamiltonian $H$. The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{i\beta}=e^{i\beta\log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates: oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $\mathcal{O}(1/|\beta|)$. The kinematical structure of quantum mechanics -- the Hilbert-space inner product, projection operators, and the Born rule -- remains unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical and acts only through spectral phases.
  Physical motivations for the deformation arise from clock imperfections, renormalization-group and effective-action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{i\beta}$. The mechanism is illustrated in examples relevant to quantum-gravity-inspired quantum mechanics.
  A detailed related-work analysis contrasts the present mechanism with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Di\'osi-Penrose gravitational collapse, GRW/CSL models, clock-induced decoherence, and energy-conserving collapse models, as well as environmental frameworks such as Lindblad master equations, Caldeira-Leggett baths, and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian deformations. This positions $H^{1+i\beta}$ dynamics as a compact, testable, and genuinely novel phenomenological encapsulation of logarithmic spectral corrections arising in quantum-gravity-motivated effective theories, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum kinematics.</description>
