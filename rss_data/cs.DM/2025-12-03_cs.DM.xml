      <title>Localizing Preference Aggregation Conflicts: A Graph-Theoretic Approach Using Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a graph-theoretic framework based on discrete sheaves to diagnose and localize inconsistencies in preference aggregation. Unlike traditional linearization methods (e.g., HodgeRank), this approach preserves the discrete structure of ordinal preferences, identifying which specific voter interactions cause aggregation failure -- information that global methods cannot provide -- via the Obstruction Locus. We formalize the Incompatibility Index to quantify these local conflicts and examine their behavior under stochastic variations using the Mallows model. Additionally, we develop a rigorous sheaf-theoretic pushforward operation to model voter merging, implemented via a polynomial-time constraint DAG algorithm. We demonstrate that graph quotients transform distributed edge conflicts into local impossibilities (empty stalks), providing a topological characterization of how aggregation paradoxes persist across scales.</description>

      <title>The Richness of CSP Non-redundancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), a clause is called redundant if its satisfaction is implied by satisfying all other clauses. An instance of CSP$(P)$ is called non-redundant if it does not contain any redundant clause. The non-redundancy (NRD) of a predicate $P$ is the maximum number of clauses in a non-redundant instance of CSP$(P)$, as a function of the number of variables $n$. Recent progress has shown that non-redundancy is crucially linked to many other important questions in computer science and mathematics including sparsification, kernelization, query complexity, universal algebra, and extremal combinatorics. Given that non-redundancy is a nexus for many of these important problems, the central goal of this paper is to more deeply understand non-redundancy.
  Our first main result shows that for every rational number $r \ge 1$, there exists a finite CSP predicate $P$ such that the non-redundancy of $P$ is $\Theta(n^r)$. Our second main result explores the concept of conditional non-redundancy first coined by Brakensiek and Guruswami [STOC 2025]. We completely classify the conditional non-redundancy of all binary predicates (i.e., constraints on two variables) by connecting these non-redundancy problems to the structure of high-girth graphs in extremal combinatorics.
  Inspired by these concrete results, we build off the work of Carbonnel [CP 2022] to develop an algebraic theory of conditional non-redundancy. As an application of this algebraic theory, we revisit the notion of Mal'tsev embeddings, which is the most general technique known to date for establishing that a predicate has linear non-redundancy. For example, we provide the first example of predicate with a Mal'tsev embedding that cannot be attributed to the structure of an Abelian group, but rather to the structure of the quantum Pauli group.</description>

      <title>Semi-Random Graphs, Robust Asymmetry, and Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Graph Reconstruction Conjecture famously posits that any undirected graph on at least three vertices is determined up to isomorphism by its family of (unlabeled) induced subgraphs. At present, the conjecture admits partial resolutions of two types: 1) casework-based demonstrations of reconstructibility for families of graphs satisfying certain structural properties, and 2) probabilistic arguments establishing reconstructibility of random graphs by leveraging average-case phenomena. While results in the first category capture the worst-case nature of the conjecture, they play a limited role in understanding the general case. Results in the second category address much larger graph families, but it remains unclear how heavily the necessary arguments rely on optimistic distributional properties. Drawing on the perspectives of smoothed and semi-random analysis, we study the robustness of what are arguably the two most fundamental properties in this latter line of work: asymmetry and uniqueness of subgraphs. Notably, we find that various semi-random graph distributions exhibit these properties asymptotically, much like their Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi counterparts. In particular, Bollob\'as (1990) demonstrated that almost all Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs $G = (V, E) \sim \mathscr{G}(n, p)$ enjoy the property that their induced subgraphs on $n - \Theta(1)$ vertices are asymmetric and mutually non-isomorphic, for $1 - p, p = \Omega(\log(n) / n)$. We show that this property is robust against perturbation -- even when an adversary is permitted to add/remove each vertex pair in $V^{(2)}$ with (independent) arbitrarily large constant probability. Exploiting this result, we derive asymptotic characterizations of asymmetry in random graphs with planted structure and bounded adversarial corruptions, along with improved bounds on the probability mass of nonreconstructible graphs in $\mathscr{G}(n, p)$.</description>

      <title>How to Learn a Star: Binary Classification with Starshaped Polyhedral Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider binary classification restricted to a class of continuous piecewise linear functions whose decision boundaries are (possibly nonconvex) starshaped polyhedral sets, supported on a fixed polyhedral simplicial fan. We investigate the expressivity of these function classes and describe the combinatorial and geometric structure of the loss landscape, most prominently the sublevel sets, for two loss-functions: the 0/1-loss (discrete loss) and a log-likelihood loss function. In particular, we give explicit bounds on the VC dimension of this model, and concretely describe the sublevel sets of the discrete loss as chambers in a hyperplane arrangement. For the log-likelihood loss, we give sufficient conditions for the optimum to be unique, and describe the geometry of the optimum when varying the rate parameter of the underlying exponential probability distribution.</description>
