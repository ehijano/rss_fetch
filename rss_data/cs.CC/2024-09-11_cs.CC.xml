      <title>How to Verify Any (Reasonable) Distribution Property: Computationally Sound Argument Systems for Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As statistical analyses become more central to science, industry and society, there is a growing need to ensure correctness of their results. Approximate correctness can be verified by replicating the entire analysis, but can we verify without replication? Building on a recent line of work, we study proof-systems that allow a probabilistic verifier to ascertain that the results of an analysis are approximately correct, while drawing fewer samples and using less computational resources than would be needed to replicate the analysis. We focus on distribution testing problems: verifying that an unknown distribution is close to having a claimed property.
  Our main contribution is a interactive protocol between a verifier and an untrusted prover, which can be used to verify any distribution property that can be decided in polynomial time given a full and explicit description of the distribution. If the distribution is at statistical distance $\varepsilon$ from having the property, then the verifier rejects with high probability. This soundness property holds against any polynomial-time strategy that a cheating prover might follow, assuming the existence of collision-resistant hash functions (a standard assumption in cryptography). For distributions over a domain of size $N$, the protocol consists of $4$ messages and the communication complexity and verifier runtime are roughly $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{N} / \varepsilon^2 \right)$. The verifier's sample complexity is $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{N} / \varepsilon^2 \right)$, and this is optimal up to $\polylog(N)$ factors (for any protocol, regardless of its communication complexity). Even for simple properties, approximately deciding whether an unknown distribution has the property can require quasi-linear sample complexity and running time. For any such property, our protocol provides a quadratic speedup over replicating the analysis.</description>

      <title>Classification and degenerations of small minimal border rank tensors via modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a self-contained classification of $1_*$-generic minimal border rank tensors in $C^m \otimes C^m \otimes C^m$ for $m \leq 5$. Together with previous results, this gives a classification of all minimal border rank tensors in $C^m \otimes C^m \otimes C^m$ for $m \leq 5$: there are $37$ isomorphism classes. We fully describe possible degenerations among the tensors. We prove that there are no $1$-degenerate minimal border rank tensors in $C^m \otimes C^m \otimes C^m $ for $m \leq 4$.</description>

      <title>Proceedings 14th International Workshop on Non-Classical Models of Automata and Applications (NCMA 2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fourteenth International Workshop on Non-Classical Models of Automata and Applications (NCMA 2024) was held in G\"ottingen, Germany, on August 12 and 13, 2024, at the historic Georg-Augustus-Universit\"at, organized by the Theoretical Computer Science research group of the respective university. The NCMA workshop series was established in 2009 as an annual event for researchers working on non-classical and classical models of automata, grammars or related devices. Such models are investigated both as theoretical models and as formal models for applications from various points of view. The goal of the NCMA workshop series is to exchange and develop novel ideas in order to gain deeper and interdisciplinary coverage of this particular area that may foster new insights and substantial progress.</description>

      <title>On the power of counting the total number of computation paths of NPTMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11614v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we define and study variants of several complexity classes of decision problems that are defined via some criteria on the number of accepting paths of an NPTM. In these variants, we modify the acceptance criteria so that they concern the total number of computation paths instead of the number of accepting ones. This direction reflects the relationship between the counting classes #P and TotP, which are the classes of functions that count the number of accepting paths and the total number of paths of NPTMs, respectively. The former is the well-studied class of counting versions of NP problems introduced by Valiant (1979). The latter contains all self-reducible counting problems in #P whose decision version is in P, among them prominent #P-complete problems such as Non-negative Permanent, #PerfMatch, and #DNF-Sat, thus playing a significant role in the study of approximable counting problems. We show that almost all classes introduced in this work coincide with their `#accepting paths'-definable counterparts, thus providing an alternative model of computation for them. Moreover, for each of these classes, we present a novel family of complete problems, which are defined via TotP-complete problems. This way, we show that all the aforementioned classes have complete problems that are defined via counting problems whose existence version is in P, in contrast to the standard way of obtaining completeness results via counting versions of NP-complete problems. To the best of our knowledge, prior to this work, such results were known only for parity-P and C=P.</description>
