      <title>Adaptive optical signal-to-noise ratio recovery for long-distance optical fiber transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In long-distance fiber optic transmission, the optic fiber link and erbium-doped fiber amplifiers can introduce excessive noise, which reduces the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). The narrow-band optical filters can be used to eliminate noise and thereby improve OSNR. However, there is a relative frequency drift between the signal and the narrow-band filter, which leads to filtered signal instability. This paper proposes an adaptive OSNR recovery scheme based on a Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity with mode width of 6 MHz. Utilizing the comb filtering of F-P cavity, the noise around the carrier and sidebands of the signal is filtered out simultaneously. To avoid frequency mismatch, we propose a double-servo scheme to suppress relative frequency drift between the signal and the F-P cavity. We constructed a stable radio frequency transfer system based on passive phase compensation and compared our scheme with other OSNR recovery schemes based on optical filters. Compared to the schemes based on dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) and Waveshaper, our scheme demonstrates an improvement in OSNR of carrier by at least 12 dB and sidebands by at least 23.5 dB. The short-term transfer stability (1 s) is improved by one order of magnitude compared to DWDM and half an order of magnitude compared to Waveshper. This scheme can be applied to the recovery of signals with low OSNR in long-distance fiber optic transmission, improving signal quaility and extending the transmission distance limit.</description>

      <title>Computing Riemann zeros with light scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding hidden order within disorder is a common interest in material science, wave physics, and mathematics. The Riemann hypothesis, stating the locations of nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, tentatively characterizes statistical order in the seemingly random distribution of prime numbers. This famous conjecture has inspired various connections with different branches of physics, recently with non-Hermitian physics, quantum field theory, trapped-ion qubits, and hyperuniformity. Here we develop the computing platform for the Riemann zeta function by employing classical scattering of light. We show that the Riemann hypothesis suggests the landscape of semi-infinite optical scatterers for the perfect reflectionless condition under the Born approximation. To examine the validity of the scattering-based computation, we investigate the asymptotic behaviours of suppressed reflections with the increasing number of scatterers and the emergence of multiple scattering. The result provides another bridge between classical physics and the Riemann zeros, exhibiting the design of wave devices inspired by number theory.</description>

      <title>Frame-filtered ghost imaging with a SPAD array used both as a multiple "bucket" detector and an imaging camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An approach to ghost imaging with a single SPAD array used simultaneously as a several-pixel "bucket" detector and an imaging camera is described. The key points of the approach are filtering data frames used for ghost-image reconstruction by the number of per-frame counts and superposing correlation images obtained for different "bucket" pixels. The imaging is performed in an experiment with a pseudo-thermal light source where the light intensity is so low that the dark counts have a noticeable effect on imaging. We demonstrate that the approach is capable to significantly reduce the destructive effect of dark counts on the ghost image and improve image contrast, spatial resolution, and image similarity to a reference image.</description>

      <title>Discriminative Addressing of Versatile Nanodiamonds via Physically-Enabled Classifier in Complex Bio-Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers show great potentials for nanoscale bio-sensing and bio-imaging. Nevertheless, their envisioned bio-applications suffer from intrinsic background noise due to unavoidable light scattering and autofluorescence in cells and tissues. Herein, we develop a novel all-optical modulated imaging method via physically-enabled classifier, for on-demand and direct access to NV fluorescence at pixel resolution while effectively filtering out background noise. Specifically, NV fluorescence can be modulated optically to exhibit sinusoid-like variations, providing basis for classification. We validate our method in various complex biological scenarios with fluorescence interference, ranging from cells to organisms. Notably, our classification-based approach achieves almost 10^6 times enhancement of signal-to-background ratio (SBR) for fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) in neural protein imaging. We also demonstrate 4-fold contrast improvement in optically-detected magnetic resonance measurements (ODMR) of FNDs inside stained cells. Our technique offers a generic, explainable and robust solution, applicable for realistic high-fidelity imaging and sensing in challenging noise-laden scenarios.</description>

      <title>Observation of spatiotemporal stabilizer in a multi-mode fibre laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal mode-locking (STML) has become an emerging approach to realize organized wavepackets in high-dimensional nonlinear photonic systems. Mode-locking in one dimensional systems employs a saturable absorber to resist fluctuations in the temporal domain. Analogous suppression of fluctuations in the space-time domains to retain a consistent output should also exist for STML. However, experimental evidence of such a resistance remains elusive, to our knowledge. Here, we report experimental observation of such a spatiotemporal stabilizer in STML, by embedding a spatial light modulator (SLM) into a multi-mode fibre (MMF) laser. Mode decomposition reveals the mode content remains steady for an STML state when applying phase perturbations on the SLM. Conversely, the mode content changes significantly for a non-STML lasing state. Numerical simulations confirm our observation and show that spatial filtering and saturable absorber mainly contribute to the observed stability. The capability to resist the spatial phase fluctuations is observed to depend on the intracavity pulse energy as well as the modal pulse energy condensed in the low-order modes. Our work constitutes another building block for the concept of STML in multi-mode photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent spin and orbital angular momentum of light in twisted photonic bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the optical response of twisted photonic bilayers is sensitive to both spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light. Due to the transfer of the angular momenta between the light and the bilayer, optical beams with zero SAM and OAM acquire SAM upon transmission and OAM upon reflection. Our numerical calculations and the developed analytical theory show that the values of the emergent SAM and OAM depend differently on the interlayer distance and can be controlled by tuning the twist angle. The predicted phenomena do not require light absorption and are caused by the helicity-dependent light diffraction on the moir\'e pattern, which inevitably occurs in the twisted structure, and SAM-OAM conversion. We also reveal strong SAM and OAM in the moir\'e-diffracted beams.</description>

      <title>Chirality and dimensionality in the ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unveil the key-role of dimensionality in describing chiroptical properties of molecules embedded inside an optical Fabry-P\'erot cavity. For a 2D-layer configuration, we show that the interplay between molecular chirality and spatial dispersion of the cavity-modes, results in a gyrotropic coupling $\chi$ at the origin of a differential shift in polaritonic energy-spectra. This differential shift is proportional to $\chi$, while for 3D bulk-aggregate configurations it is shown to vanish. We interpret physically the former 2D-chiral effect by analogy with the classical Newtonian motion of a fictive particle in presence of 3D restoring force, and static magnetic field. The gyrotropic coupling is shown to directly perturbate the anholonomy angle of the classical trajectories, and the fictive particle undergoes cyclotron gyrations upon entering the ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime.</description>

      <title>A microcomb-empowered Fourier domain mode-locked LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has emerged as an indispensable tool in autonomous technology. Among its various techniques, frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) LiDAR stands out due to its capability to operate with ultralow return power, immunity to unwanted light, and simultaneous acquisition of distance and velocity. However, achieving a rapid update rate with sub-micron precision remains a challenge for FMCW LiDARs. Here, we present such a LiDAR with a sub-10 nm precision and a 24.6 kHz update rate by combining a broadband Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) laser with a silicon nitride soliton microcomb. An ultrahigh frequency chirp rate up to 320 PHz/s is linearized by a 50 GHz microcomb to reach this performance. Our theoretical analysis also contributes to resolving the challenge of FMCW velocity measurements with nonlinear frequency sweeps and enables us to realize velocity measurement with an uncertainty below 0.4 mm/s. Our work shows how nanophotonic microcombs can unlock the potential of ultrafast frequency sweeping lasers for applications including LiDAR, optical coherence tomography and sensing.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization of light by impurities in a solid transparent matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A solid transparent medium with randomly positioned, immobile impurity atoms is a promising candidate for observation of Anderson localization of light in three dimensions. It can have low losses and allows for mitigation of the detrimental effect of longitudinal optical fields by an external magnetic field, but it has its own issues: thermal oscillations of atoms around their equilibrium positions and inhomogeneous broadening of atomic spectral lines due to random local electric fields. We show that these complications should not impede observation of Anderson localization of light in such materials. The thermal oscillations hardly affect light propagation whereas the inhomogeneous broadening can be compensated for by increasing the number density of impurity atoms.</description>

      <title>Digitized Phase Change Material Heterostack for Diffractive Optical Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-optical and fully reconfigurable diffractive optical neural network (DONN) architectures are promising for high-throughput and energy-efficient machine learning (ML) hardware accelerators for broad applications. However, current device and system implementations have limited performance. This work demonstrates a novel diffractive device architecture, which is named digitized heterostack and consists of multiple layers of nonvolatile phase change materials (PCMs) with different thicknesses. This architecture can both leverage the advantages of PCM optical properties and mitigate challenges associated with implementing multilevel operations in a single PCM layer. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate the electrical tuning of one PCM layer in a spatial light modulation device, and thermal analysis guides the design of DONN devices and systems to avoid thermal crosstalk if individual heterostacks are assembled into an array. Further, heterostacks containing three PCM layers are designed to have a large phase modulation range and uniform coverage and the ML performance of DONN systems with designed heterostacks is evaluated. The developed device architecture provides new opportunities for desirable energy-efficient, fast-reconfigured, and compact DONN systems in the future.</description>

      <title>Single photon emitters in monolayer semiconductors coupled to transition metal dichalcogenide nanoantennas on silica and gold substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) single photon emitters (SPEs) offer numerous advantages to quantum information applications, such as high single photon purity and deterministic positioning. Strain in the host monolayer, induced by underlying dielectric Mie resonators, is known to localize their formation to positions co-located with near-field photonic hotspots providing further control over their optical properties. However, traditional materials used for the fabrication of nanoresonators, such as silicon or gallium phosphide (GaP), often require a high refractive index substrate resulting in losses of the emitted light and limited photonic enhancement. Here, we use nanoantennas (NAs) fabricated from multilayer TMDs, which allow complete flexibility with the choice of substrate due to the adhesive van der Waals forces, enabling high refractive index contrast or the use of highly reflective metallic surfaces. We demonstrate the localized formation of SPEs in WSe$_2$ monolayers transferred onto WS$_2$ NAs on both SiO$_2$ and Au substrates, enabling strong photonic enhancements and increased single photon collection. We provide evidence for enhanced quantum efficiencies (QE) reaching an average value of 43% (7%) for SPEs on WS$_2$ NAs on a SiO$_2$ (Au) substrate. We further combine the advantages offered by both dielectric and metallic substrates to numerically simulate an optimized NA geometry for maximum WSe$_2$ single photon excitation, emission, collection. Thus, the fluorescence is enhanced by a factor of over 4 orders of magnitude compared to vacuum and 5 orders of magnitude compared to a flat SiO$_2$/Si surface. Our work showcases the advantages offered by employing TMD material nanoresonators on various substrates for SPE formation and photonic enhancement.</description>

      <title>Dipole orientation reveals single-molecule interactions and dynamics on 2D crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct observation of single-molecule interactions and dynamic configurations in situ is a demanding challenge but crucial for both chemical and biological systems. However, optical microscopy that relies on bulk measurements cannot meet these requirements due to rapid molecular diffusion in solutions and the complexity of reaction systems. In this work, we leveraged the fluorescence activation of pristine hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in organic solvents as a molecular sensing platform, confining the molecules to a two-dimensional (2D) interface and slowing down their motion. Conformational recognition and dynamic tracking were achieved simultaneously by measuring the 3D orientation of fluorescent emitters through polarized single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). We found that the orientation of in-plane emitters aligns with the symmetry of the h-BN lattice, and their conformation is influenced by both the local conditions of h-BN and the regulation of the electrochemical environment. Additionally, lateral diffusion of fluorescent emitters at the solid-liquid interface displays more abundant dynamics compared to solid-state emitters. This study opens the door for the simultaneous molecular conformation and photophysics measurement, contributing to the understanding of interactions at the single-molecule level and real-time sensing through 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Delocalization of a Levitated Nanoparticle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every massive particle behaves like a wave, according to quantum physics. Yet, this characteristic wave nature has only been observed in double-slit experiments with microscopic systems, such as atoms and molecules. The key aspect is that the wavefunction describing the motion of these systems extends coherently over a distance comparable to the slit separation, much larger than the size of the system itself. Preparing these states of more massive and complex objects remains an outstanding challenge. While the motion of solid-state oscillators can now be controlled at the level of single quanta, their coherence length remains comparable to the zero-point motion, limited to subatomic distances. Here, we prepare a delocalized state of a levitating solid-state nanosphere with coherence length exceeding the zero-point motion. We first cool its motion to the ground state. Then, by modulating the stiffness of the confinement potential, we achieve more than a threefold increment of the initial coherence length with minimal added noise. Optical levitation gives us the necessary control over the confinement that other mechanical platforms lack. Our work is a stepping stone towards the generation of delocalization scales comparable to the object size, a crucial regime for macroscopic quantum experiments, and towards quantum-enhanced force sensing with levitated particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnons are quantized collective spin-wave excitations in magnetically ordered materials. Revealing their interactions among these collective modes is crucial for the understanding of fundamental many-body effects in such systems and the development of high-speed information transport and processing devices based on them. Nevertheless, identifying couplings between individual magnon modes remains a long-standing challenge. Here, we demonstrate spectroscopic fingerprints of anharmonic coupling between distinct magnon modes in an antiferromagnet, as evidenced by coherent photon emission at the sum and difference frequencies of the two modes. This discovery is enabled by driving two magnon modes coherently with a pair of tailored terahertz fields and then disentangling a mixture of nonlinear responses with different origins. Our approach provides a route for generating nonlinear magnon-magnon mixing.</description>

Abstract: We suggest and develop a novel approach for describing topological properties of a periodic system purely from the transfer matrix associated to a unit cell. This approach is employed to obtain a simple pictorial proof of the Zak phase bulk-edge correspondence for any one dimensional system. We apply the transfer matrix method to study some generalisations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, such as the tetramer SSH4 model and a dimerised one-dimensional photonic crystal.</description>

Abstract: With the growing prevalence of AI, demand increases for efficient machine learning hardware. Physical systems are sought which combine image feature detection with the essential nonlinearity for tasks such as image classification. Existing physical hardware typically detects features linearly, then employs digital processing for nonlinear activation. Biological vision systems excel at nonlinear image processing. The retina detects features in ganglion cells via lateral inhibition, where cells nonlinearly compete for neuronal firing while supressing neighbouring cells.
  We present a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' machine vision platform using an on-chip semiconductor network laser. The system detects multiple features in parallel via spatially-overlapping lasing modes, with integrated nonlinearity provided by antagonistic gain competition between modes - a photonic analogue of retinal inhibition. Parallel feature-detection enhances efficiency relative to feature-detection schemes which operate sequentially or via multiple device copies, with Si-compatible processing and a compact micron-scale footprint relative to existing mm-scale systems. We report 98.05% accuracy on MNIST-digits and 87.85% on Fashion-MNIST, with strong performance on short training datasets.</description>

Abstract: Tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling, caused by the jitter of test masses or satellites, is a significant noise source in space-based gravitational wave detection. Calibrating and suppressing TTL coupling noise at the sub-nanometer level is essential. One main challenge in current ground-based TTL coupling testing is the residual translational movement of the tilt actuator. This paper introduces the development of an advanced pure tilt actuator (APTA) specifically designed for testing TTL coupling. The APTA provides precise tilt motion and is monitored by a four-beam interferometer, which measures the displacement of attached array pyramids. We present a detailed theoretical model and experimental setup. Experimental results demonstrate that this optical test bed, equipped with the APTA, can achieve subnanometer-level TTL coupling calibration. In addition, a typical heterodyne interferometer was tested using the APTA test bed. Comparative testing demonstrated that the imaging system is capable of effectively suppressing TTL coupling errors. The TTL coupling coefficients were reduced from over plus-minus 30 micrometers per radian to within plus-minus 5 micrometers per radian across a range of plus-minus 200 microradians, meeting the preliminary requirements for the TianQin mission. This APTA test platform has the potential to be widely utilized for ground-based TTL coupling inspection.</description>
