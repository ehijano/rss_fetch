      <title>Coupled Aerodynamic-Electromagnetic Modeling for RCS Estimation of Million-Scale Chaff Clouds with Arbitrarily Curved 3D Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the radar cross section (RCS) of chaff clouds requires careful consideration of aerodynamic effects, as the orientation and spatial distribution of individual chaff elements evolve significantly after deployment. Building upon conventional six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) formulations for chaff aerodynamic analysis-which assumed straight or two-dimensionally bent geometries-we extend the framework to incorporate arbitrarily curved three-dimensional chaff geometries. This extension enables accurate modeling of both flattened and helical dynamics induced by aerodynamic moments acting along the roll, pitch, and yaw directions, thereby providing a more comprehensive and realistic description of chaff motion. We then finally develop a coupled aerodynamic-electromagnetic framework that integrates the extended aerodynamic model with our recently developed fast method-of-moments solver, which is optimized for efficiently estimating the RCS of million-scale chaff clouds. The proposed multiphysics coupled framework allows real-time, first-principles prediction of the monostatic and bistatic RCS of large-scale chaff clouds with arbitrary geometries, orientations, and lengths, accurately incorporating their time-varying aerodynamic evolution. Simulation results confirm that the monostatic RCS is strongly influenced by aerodynamic effects, with the coexistence of flattened and helical motions playing a critical role in determining the overall scattering response. The proposed framework thus provides a physically grounded and computationally efficient approach for predicting the RCS of large-scale chaff clouds. Furthermore, it can be directly extended to radar signal processing applications by utilizing multi-frequency complex-valued far-field responses, thereby enabling the reconstruction of Range-Doppler, Range-Angle, and Doppler-Angle maps.</description>

      <title>Towards Unified AI-Driven Fracture Mechanics: The Extended Deep Energy Method (XDEM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), with the Deep Energy Method (DEM) proving especially effective in fracture mechanics due to its energy-based formulation. Despite these advances, existing DEM approaches require dense collocation near cracks, face stability challenges, and typically treat discrete and continuous fracture models separately. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Extended Deep Energy Method (XDEM), a unified deep learning framework that incorporates both displacement discontinuities and crack-tip asymptotics in the discrete setting, while flexibly coupling displacement and phase fields in the continuous setting. This integration enables accurate fracture predictions using uniformly distributed, relatively sparse collocation points. Validation across benchmark problems including stress intensity factor evaluation, straight and kinked crack growth, and complex crack initiation demonstrates that XDEM consistently outperforms standard DEM in accuracy and efficiency. By bridging discrete and phase-field models within a single framework, XDEM establishes a robust foundation for applying AI to fracture mechanics and opens new avenues for predictive modeling in engineering and materials science.</description>

      <title>NeuroPINNs: Neuroscience Inspired Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce NeuroPINNs, a neuroscience-inspired extension of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) that incorporates biologically motivated spiking neuron models to achieve energy-efficient PDE solving. Unlike conventional PINNs, which rely on continuously firing activations and therefore incur high computational and energy costs, NeuroPINNs leverage Variable Spiking Neurons (VSNs) to enable sparse, event-driven communication. This makes them particularly well-suited for deployment on neuromorphic hardware and for scenarios with constrained computational resources, such as embedded and edge devices. A central challenge, however, lies in reconciling the discontinuous dynamics of spiking neurons with the smooth residual-based loss formulation required in PINNs. Direct smoothing introduces systematic biases, leading to inaccurate PDE learning. To overcome this, we employ a novel stochastic projection method inspired from upscaled theory that faithfully captures spiking behavior while maintaining compatibility with gradient-based optimization. Standard surrogate backpropagation is used for parameter updates, ensuring computational tractability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuroPINNs on four representative PDE problems across both regular and irregular domains. Furthermore, application of NeuroPINN for linear elastic micromechnics in three dimensions was also explored. Results show that NeuroPINNs achieve high accuracy while substantially reducing communication and energy demands, marking a step toward scalable, neuromorphic-ready scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Dielectric Parameters from Ultrasound Waves in Quantitative Thermoacoustic Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoacoustic tomography (TAT) is an imaging modality based on the thermoacoustic effect. In TAT, a short microwave or radio wave pulse is directed to the imaged target. The energy of the electromagnetic pulse is absorbed depending on the target's dielectric parameters, resulting in a spatially varying pressure distribution via the thermoacoustic effect. This pressure, known as the initial pressure distribution, relaxes as broadband ultrasound waves that are measured on the boundary of the target. In the inverse problem of TAT, the initial pressure is estimated from the measured ultrasound waves. TAT can further be extended to quantitative TAT (QTAT), where the aim is to estimate the dielectric parameters of the imaged target by utilizing a model for electromagnetic wave propagation. In this work, we consider the QTAT problem and propose an approach for simultaneous estimation of electrical conductivity and permittivity from the ultrasound waves. The problem is approached in the framework of Bayesian inverse problems. The forward model describing electromagnetic and acoustic wave propagation is based on Maxwell's equations and the acoustic wave equation, respectively. The approach is evaluated with numerical simulations. The results show that the dielectric parameters can be accurately estimated using the proposed approach. However, the ultrasound sensor geometry and the number of electromagnetic pulses have a significant effect on the accuracy of the estimated parameters.</description>

      <title>The noiseless limit and improved-prior limit of the maximum entropy method and their implications for the analytic continuation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are uniquely capable of providing exact simulations of quantum many-body systems. Unfortunately, the applications of a QMC simulation are limited because extracting dynamic properties requires solving the analytic continuation (AC) problem. Across the many fields that use QMC methods, there is no universally accepted analytic continuation algorithm for extracting dynamic properties, but many publications compare to the maximum entropy method. We investigate when entropy maximization is an acceptable approach. We show that stochastic sampling algorithms reduce to entropy maximization when the Bayesian prior is near to the true solution. We investigate when is Bryan's controversial optimization algorithm [Bryan, Eur. Biophys. J. 18, 165-174 (1990)] for entropy maximization (sometimes known as the maximum entropy method) appropriate to use. We show that Bryan's algorithm is appropriate when the noise is near zero or when the Bayesian prior is near to the true solution. We also investigate the mean squared error, finding a better scaling when the Bayesian prior is near the true solution than when the noise is near zero. We point to examples of improved data-driven Bayesian priors that have already leveraged this advantage. We support these results by solving the double Gaussian problem using both Bryan's algorithm and the newly formulated dual approach to entropy maximization [Chuna et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 58, 335203 (2025)].</description>

      <title>Walsh-Hadamard Neural Operators for Solving PDEs with Discontinuous Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard spectral methods based on Fourier transforms struggle with problems involving discontinuous coefficients due to the Gibbs phenomenon and poor representation of sharp interfaces. We introduce the Walsh-Hadamard Neural Operator (WHNO), which leverages Walsh-Hadamard transforms-a spectral basis of rectangular wave functions naturally suited for piecewise constant fields-combined with learnable spectral weights that transform low-sequency Walsh coefficients to capture global dependencies efficiently. We validate WHNO on three problems: steady-state Darcy flow (preliminary validation), heat conduction with discontinuous thermal conductivity, and the 2D Burgers equation with discontinuous initial conditions. In controlled comparisons with Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) under identical conditions, WHNO demonstrates superior accuracy with better preservation of sharp solution features at material interfaces. Critically, we discover that weighted ensemble combinations of WHNO and FNO achieve substantial improvements over either model alone: for both heat conduction and Burgers equation, optimal ensembles reduce mean squared error by 35-40 percent and maximum error by up to 25 percent compared to individual models. This demonstrates that Walsh-Hadamard and Fourier representations capture complementary aspects of discontinuous PDE solutions, with WHNO excelling at sharp interfaces while FNO captures smooth features effectively.</description>

      <title>AutoHood3D: A Multi-Modal Benchmark for Automotive Hood Design and Fluid-Structure Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a new high-fidelity multi-modal dataset containing 16000+ geometric variants of automotive hoods useful for machine learning (ML) applications such as engineering component design and process optimization, and multiphysics system surrogates. The dataset is centered on a practical multiphysics problem-hood deformation from fluid entrapment and inertial loading during rotary-dip painting. Each hood is numerically modeled with a coupled Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)-Finite Element Analysis (FEA), using 1.2M cells in total to ensure spatial and temporal accuracy. The dataset provides time-resolved physical fields, along with STL meshes and structured natural language prompts for text-to-geometry synthesis. Existing datasets are either confined to 2D cases, exhibit limited geometric variations, or lack the multi-modal annotations and data structures - shortcomings we address with AutoHood3D. We validate our numerical methodology, establish quantitative baselines across five neural architectures, and demonstrate systematic surrogate errors in displacement and force predictions. These findings motivate the design of novel approaches and multiphysics loss functions that enforce fluid-solid coupling during model training. By providing fully reproducible workflows, AutoHood3D enables physics-aware ML development, accelerates generative-design iteration, and facilitates the creation of new FSI benchmarks.

      <title>An MLCommons Scientific Benchmarks Ontology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning research spans diverse domains and data modalities, yet existing benchmark efforts remain siloed and lack standardization. This makes novel and transformative applications of machine learning to critical scientific use-cases more fragmented and less clear in pathways to impact. This paper introduces an ontology for scientific benchmarking developed through a unified, community-driven effort that extends the MLCommons ecosystem to cover physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, climate science, and more. Building on prior initiatives such as XAI-BENCH, FastML Science Benchmarks, PDEBench, and the SciMLBench framework, our effort consolidates a large set of disparate benchmarks and frameworks into a single taxonomy of scientific, application, and system-level benchmarks. New benchmarks can be added through an open submission workflow coordinated by the MLCommons Science Working Group and evaluated against a six-category rating rubric that promotes and identifies high-quality benchmarks, enabling stakeholders to select benchmarks that meet their specific needs. The architecture is extensible, supporting future scientific and AI/ML motifs, and we discuss methods for identifying emerging computing patterns for unique scientific workloads. The MLCommons Science Benchmarks Ontology provides a standardized, scalable foundation for reproducible, cross-domain benchmarking in scientific machine learning. A companion webpage for this work has also been developed as the effort evolves: https://mlcommons-science.github.io/benchmark/</description>

      <title>Cluster percolation in the three-dimensional $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on extensive parallel-tempering Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the relationship between cluster percolation and equilibrium ordering phenomena in the three-dimensional $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model as one varies the fraction of antiferromagnetic bonds. We consider a range of cluster definitions, most of which are constructed in the space of overlaps between two independent real replicas of the system. In the pure ferromagnet that is contained as a limiting case in the class of problems considered, the relevant percolation point coincides with the thermodynamic ordering transition. For the disordered ferromagnet encountered first on introducing antiferromagnetic bonds and the adjacent spin-glass phase of strong disorder this connection is altered, and one finds a percolation transition above the thermodynamic ordering point that is accompanied by the appearance of /two/ percolating clusters of equal density. Only at the lower (disordered) ferromagnetic or spin-glass transition points the densities of these two clusters start to diverge, thus providing a percolation signature of these thermodynamic transitions. We compare the scaling behavior at this secondary percolation transition with the thermodynamic behavior at the corresponding ferromagnetic and spin-glass phase transitions.</description>

      <title>A computational framework for evaluating an edge-integrated, multi-ramp construction model of the Great Pyramid of Giza</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of study, a quantitative, integrated framework to evaluate minutescale throughput, geometric control, and a zero external footprint for Khufu's pyramid has been lacking. We test the Integrated Edge-Ramp (IER) model-a helical path formed by omitting and backfilling perimeter courses-using a unified, end-to-end pipeline coupling parametric geometry, discrete-event logistics, and staged finite-element analysis (FEA). An adaptive multiramp strategy can sustain 4-6-minute dispatches and yields a median on-site duration of 13.8-20.6 years (95% CI); including quarrying, river transport, and seasonal pauses gives 20-27 years. FEA indicates that stresses and settlements remain within plausible limits for Old Kingdom limestone under self-weight. The model's geometry is also consistent with internal voids identified by muon imaging (a hypothesis-generating result). The IER helps reconcile throughput, survey access, and zero-footprint closure, and produces falsifiable predictions (edge-fill signatures, corner wear). Our study provides a transferable, open-data/code framework for testing construction hypotheses for ancient megastructures.</description>

      <title>Particle loads for cosmological simulations with equal-mass dark matter and baryonic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional cosmological hydrodynamical simulations usually assume equal-numbered but unequal-mass dark matter and baryonic particles, which can lead to spurious collisional heating due to energy equipartition. To avoid such a numerical heating effect, a simulation setup with equal-mass dark matter and baryonic particles, which corresponds to a particle number ratio of $N_{\rm DM}:N_{\rm gas} = \Omega_{\rm cdm} / \Omega_{\rm b}$, is preferred. However, previous studies have typically used grid-based particle loads to prepare such initial conditions, which can only reach specific values for $N_{\rm DM}:N_{\rm gas}$ due to symmetry requirements. In this study, we propose a method based on the glass approach that can generate two-component particle loads with more general $N_{\rm DM}:N_{\rm gas}$ ratios. The method simultaneously relaxes two Poisson particle distributions by introducing an additional repulsive force between particles of the same component. We show that the final particle load closely follows the expected minimal power spectrum, $P(k) \propto k^{4}$, exhibits good homogeneity and isotropy properties, and remains sufficiently stable under gravitational interactions. Both the dark matter and gas components individually also exhibit uniform and isotropic distributions. We apply our method to two-component cosmological simulations and demonstrate that an equal-mass particle setup effectively mitigates the spurious collisional heating that arises in unequal-mass simulations. Our method can be extended to generate multi-component uniform and isotropic distributions. Our code based on Gadget-2 is available at https://github.com/liaoshong/gadget-2glass .</description>

      <title>Do Discrete Fine-Scale Mechanical Models with Rotational Degrees of Freedom Homogenize Into a Cosserat or a Cauchy Continuum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article answers the question of whether homogenization of discrete fine-scale mechanical models, such as particle or lattice models, gives rise to an equivalent continuum that is of Cauchy-type or Cosserat-type. The study employs the machinery of asymptotic expansion homogenization to analyze discrete mechanical models with rotational degrees of freedom commonly used to simulate the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous solids. The proposed derivation has general validity in both stationary (steady-state) and transient conditions (assuming wavelength much larger that particle size) and for arbitrary nonlinear, inelastic fine-scale constitutive equations. The results show that the unit cell problem is always stationary, and the only inertia term appears in the linear momentum balance equation at the coarse scale. Depending on the magnitude of the local bending stiffness, mathematical homogenization rigorously identifies two limiting conditions that correspond to the Cauchy continuum and the Cosserat continuum. A heuristic combination of these two limiting conditions provides very accurate results also in the transition from one limiting case to the other. Finally, the study demonstrates that cases for which the Cosserat character of the homogenized response is significant are associated with non-physically high fine-scale bending stiffness and, as such, are of no interest in practice.</description>

      <title>Metabolic quantum limit and holographic bound to the information capacity of magnetoencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoencephalography, the noninvasive measurement of magnetic fields produced by brain activity, utilizes quantum sensors like superconducting quantum interference devices or atomic magnetometers. Here we derive a fundamental, technology-independent bound on the information that such measurements can convey. Using the energy resolution limit of magnetic sensing together with the brain's metabolic power, we obtain a universal expression for the maximum information rate, which depends only on geometry, metabolism, and Planck's constant, and the numerical value of which is 2.6 Mbit/s. At the high bandwidth limit we arrive at a bound scaling linearly with the area of the current source boundary. We thus demonstrate a biophysical holographic bound for metabolically powered information conveyed by the magnetic field. For the geometry and metabolic power of the human brain the geometric bound is 6.6 Gbit/s.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Validation of Replica Symmetry Breaking via Quantum Annealing: From Ground States to Topological Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Giorgio Parisi's exact solution of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, recognized with the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics, revealed revolutionary hierarchical organization in disordered systems, yet systematic validation has remained computationally intractable beyond $N \sim 100$ spins, and the topological limits of this complexity remain unexplored. Here we leverage quantum annealing to extend ground-state computations to 4000 spins and systematically probe both the emergence and breakdown of replica symmetry breaking. Three independent measurements validate core RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value $E_\infty/N = -0.7633$ with predicted $N^{-2/3}$ finite-size corrections; chaos exponent $\theta = 0.51 \pm 0.02$ confirms mean-field square-root scaling ($R^2 = 0.989$); and state-space overlap distribution exhibits broad continuous structure ($\sigma_q = 0.19$) characteristic of hierarchical landscape organization. We then investigate RSB robustness by introducing controlled network dilution via the Blume-Capel model with vacancy formation. Remarkably, hierarchical complexity remains invariant under 36\% dilution, proving RSB is a topological property of network connectivity rather than spin density. Beyond a critical threshold in the range $0.8 &lt; D_c &lt; 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously as the system undergoes complete conversion to the all-vacancy state within a narrow parameter window an abrupt avalanche-driven transition where independent-vacancy mean-field theory correctly predicts the energy scale but fails to capture the cooperative dynamics. This comprehensive validation across thermodynamics, universality, landscape geometry, and topological limits establishes quantum advantage for probing fundamental statistical mechanics in complex systems relevant to neural networks, optimization, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Resonating valence bond pairing energy in graphene by quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) state in graphene using real-space quantum Monte Carlo with correlated variational wave functions. Variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations with Jastrow-Slater-determinant and Jastrow-antisymmetrized-geminal-power ansatze are employed to evaluate the RVB pairing energy. Using a rectangular graphene sample that lacks $\pi/3$ rotational symmetry, we found that the single-particle energy gap near the Fermi level depends on the system size along the $x$-direction. The gap vanishes when the length satisfies $L_x=3n\sqrt{3}d$, where $n$ is an integer and $d$ is the carbon-carbon bond length, otherwise, the system, exhibits a finite gap. Our DMC results show no stable RVB pairing in the zero-gap case, whereas the opening of a finite gap near the Fermi level stabilizes the electron pairing. The DMC predicted absolute value of pairing energy at the thermodynamic limit for a finite-gap system is $\sim 0.48(1)$ mHa/atom. Our results reveal a feometry-driven electron pairing mechanism in the confined graphene nanostructure.</description>

      <title>Learning Biomolecular Motion: The Physics-Informed Machine Learning Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of statistical learning and molecular physics is transforming our approach to modeling biomolecular systems. Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) offers a systematic framework that integrates data-driven inference with physical constraints, resulting in models that are accurate, mechanistic, generalizable, and able to extrapolate beyond observed domains. This review surveys recent advances in physics-informed neural networks and operator learning, differentiable molecular simulation, and hybrid physics-ML potentials, with emphasis on long-timescale kinetics, rare events, and free-energy estimation. We frame these approaches as solutions to the "biomolecular closure problem", recovering unresolved interactions beyond classical force fields while preserving thermodynamic consistency and mechanistic interpretability. We examine theoretical foundations, tools and frameworks, computational trade-offs, and unresolved issues, including model expressiveness and stability. We outline prospective research avenues at the intersection of machine learning, statistical physics, and computational chemistry, contending that future advancements will depend on mechanistic inductive biases, and integrated differentiable physical learning frameworks for biomolecular simulation and discovery.</description>

      <title>Challenges in predicting positron annihilation lifetimes in lead halide perovskites: correlation functionals and polymorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged in the last decade as a new important class of semiconductors for a variety of optoelectronic applications. A lot of previous studies were thus devoted to the characterisation of their point defects. Positron annihilation spectroscopy is a well recognized tool for probing vacancies in materials. Recent applications of this technique to APbX$_3$ halide perovskites are sparse, and the rare theoretical predictions of positron lifetimes in these materials, published in association with experiments, do not fully agree with each other. These works suggest that vacancies on the A site are not detected.
  In our theoretical study we focus on the role of the electron-positron correlation functional. We thoroughly revisit and compare several approximations when applied to methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI$_3$) with or without vacancies, as well as inorganic perovskites CsPbI$_3$ and CsPbBr$_3$, in various phases. We show also the relationship between the size of the voids, through Voronoi volumes, and the calculated lifetimes. For the cubic phases we investigate in detail the role of polymorphism, including the distribution of vacancy formation energies and positron annihilation lifetimes.
  In our lifetimes calculations, apart from older and more recent semi-local approximations for the electron-positron correlation potential, we also consider the weighted density approximation (WDA), which is truly non-local and should better describe positron annihilation in regions with strong electronic density variations. We show that for this class of materials, and especially for cations vacancies, the influence of the chosen approximation is crucial, much stronger than in metals, alloys and conventional semiconductors. This influence may induce to reconsider the interpretation of experimentally determined lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Guiding Generative Models to Uncover Diverse and Novel Crystals via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering functional crystalline materials entails navigating an immense combinatorial design space. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have enabled the sampling of chemically plausible compositions and structures, a fundamental challenge remains: the objective misalignment between likelihood-based sampling in generative modelling and targeted focus on underexplored regions where novel compounds reside. Here, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework that guides latent denoising diffusion models toward diverse and novel, yet thermodynamically viable crystalline compounds. Our approach integrates group relative policy optimisation with verifiable, multi-objective rewards that jointly balance creativity, stability, and diversity. Beyond de novo generation, we demonstrate enhanced property-guided design that preserves chemical validity, while targeting desired functional properties. This approach establishes a modular foundation for controllable AI-driven inverse design that addresses the novelty-validity trade-off across scientific discovery applications of generative models.</description>

      <title>Effect of Misfit and Threading Dislocations on Surface Energies of PbTe-PbSe Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manufacturing processes of heterostructures determine the structure and properties of their interfaces. In this work, we simulate PbTe and PbSe heterostructures manufactured via (1) direct wave bonding and (2) heteroepitaxial growth. The former contains interfaces with 2D misfit dislocation networks while the latter contains complex 3D networks with both misfit and threading dislocations. To compute the surface energy of interfaces, we measure the interaction energy across surfaces using a well-verified code. Compared with hypothetical interfaces modeled to be coherent, a typical assumption in traditional slab-based methods, the surface energy of wafer bonded and epitaxially grown interfaces are significantly different. Semi-coherent interfaces exhibit up to ~27% lower surface energies than coherent ones, while coherent models overestimate surface energies by up to ~50% relative to epitaxial interfaces. The consequence of such differences can lead to conflicting predictions of physical phenomena such as fracture toughness or growth mode.</description>

      <title>BzScope: an absolute cross section calculator for neutron-phonon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BzScope is a Python package designed for efficiently calculating absolute cross sections of neutron-phonon inelastic scattering for crystalline powders in large phase spaces, addressing the limitations of traditional histogramming techniques in reproducing sharp structures and ensuring convergence. The package employs an adapted integral method and supports calculations of single- and two-phonon scattering functions in ideal crystalline powders, with numerical robustness up to a momentum transfer of 100 Ang^-1. Higher order scatterings up to several hundred orders are calculated by incoherent approximation in a well-established thermal neutron scattering physics package, NCrystal. In addition, a NCrystal plugin is made available for NCrystal-enabled Monte Carlo packages, facilitating direct comparison between the new physics and experimental data.
  Validation against NCrystal demonstrates good agreement in incoherent scattering for cubic systems Ni. In addition, it shows improved accuracy for low-symmetry materials $NiP_2$ by avoiding the isotropic atomic displacement approximations in NCrystal. Benchmarks the experimental differential cross section of LiH and total cross section of Be confirm its reliability.
  BzScope integrates with NCrystal via a plugin and therefore can be directly used in any NCrystal-enabled Monte Carlo package. This tool enhances the efficiency and accuracy of neutron scattering simulations, advancing the study of condensed matter dynamics.</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of quasipotentials via a combined data-driven method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quasipotential function allows for comprehension and prediction of the escape mechanisms from metastable states in nonlinear dynamical systems. This function acts as a natural extension of the potential function for non-gradient systems and it unveils important properties such as the maximum likelihood transition paths, transition rates and expected exit times of the system. Here, we demonstrate how to discover parsimonious equations for the quasipotential directly from data. Leveraging machine learning, we combine two existing data-driven techniques, namely a neural network and a sparse regression algorithm, specifically designed to symbolically describe multistable energy landscapes. First, we employ a vanilla neural network enhanced with a renormalization and rescaling procedure to achieve an orthogonal decomposition of the vector field. Next, we apply symbolic regression to extract the downhill and circulatory components of the decomposition, ensuring consistency with the underlying dynamics. This symbolic reconstruction involves a simultaneous regression that imposes constraints on both the orthogonality condition and the vector field. We implement and benchmark our approach using an archetypal model with a known exact quasipotential, as well as a nanomechanical resonator system. We further demonstrate its applicability to noisy data and to a four-dimensional system. Our model-unbiased analytical forms of the quasipotential is of interest to a wide range of applications aimed at assessing metastability and energy landscapes, serving to parametrically capture the distinctive fingerprint of the fluctuating dynamics.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moir\'e matter beyond one billion sites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Propagation/Refraction Through Diffuse Interface Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for simulating acoustic (pressure) wave propagation across different media separated by a diffuse interface through the use of a weak compressibility formulation. Our method builds on our previous work on an entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes/Cahn-Hilliard system %\cite{manzanero2020entropyNSCH}% (Manzanero et al. (2020)), and incorporates a modified weak compressibility formulation that allows different sound speeds in each phase. We validate our method through numerical experiments, demonstrating spectral convergence for acoustic transmission and reflection coefficients in one dimension and for the angle defined by Snell's law in two dimensions. Special attention is given to quantifying the modeling errors introduced by the width of the diffuse interface. Our results show that the method successfully captures the behavior of acoustic waves across interfaces, allowing exponential convergence in transmitted waves. The transmitted angles in two dimensions are accurately captured for air-water conditions, up to the critical angle of $13^\circ$. In a final example, we show a three-dimensional wave transmission from air into water to demonstrate the potential of this methodology for addressing general multiphase acoustic problems. This work represents a step forward in modeling acoustic propagation in incompressible multiphase systems, with potential applications to marine aeroacoustics.</description>

      <title>Scalable Machine Learning Models for Predicting Quantum Transport in Disordered 2D Hexagonal Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce scalable machine learning models to accurately predict two key quantum transport properties, the transmission coefficient T(E) and average local density of states (Average-LDOS) in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal materials with magnetic disorder. Using a tight binding Hamiltonian combined with the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism, we generate a large dataset of over 400,000 unique configurations across graphene, germanene, silicene, and stanene nanoribbons with varying geometries, impurity concentrations, and energy levels. A central contribution of this work is the development of a geometrydriven, physically interpretable feature space that enables the models to generalize across material types and device sizes. Random Forest regression and classification models are evaluated in terms of accuracy, stability, and extrapolation ability. Regression consistently outperforms classification in capturing continuous transport behavior on in-domain data. However, extrapolation performance degrades significantly, revealing the limitations of tree-based models in unseen regimes. This study highlights both the potential and constraints of scalable ML models for quantum transport prediction and motivates future research into physics-informed or graph-based learning architectures for improved generalization in spintronic and nanoelectronic device design.</description>

      <title>Microcanonical simulated annealing: Massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations with sporadic random-number generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important. Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (MicSA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the MicSA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.</description>

      <title>It's not a FAD: first results in using Flows for unsupervised Anomaly Detection at 40 MHz at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first implementation of a Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF) model for unsupervised anomaly detection within the realistic, high-rate environment of the Large Hadron Collider's L1 trigger systems. While CNFs typically define an anomaly score via a probabilistic likelihood, calculating this score requires solving an Ordinary Differential Equation, a procedure too complex for FPGA deployment. To overcome this, we propose a novel, hardware-friendly anomaly score defined as the squared norm of the model's vector field output. This score is based on the intuition that anomalous events require a larger transformation by the flow. Our model, trained via Flow Matching on Standard Model data, is synthesized for an FPGA using the hls4ml and da4ml libraries. We demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies a variety of beyond-the-Standard-Model signatures with performance comparable to existing machine learning-based triggers. The algorithm achieves a latency of a few hundred nanoseconds, or even less when using advanced quantization techniques, and requires minimal FPGA resources, establishing CNFs as a viable new tool for real-time, data-driven discovery at 40 MHz.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch-Slonczewski equations for spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is challenged when modeling spintronic devices where Joule heating is significant, due to its core assumption of a constant magnetization magnitude. Based on a statistical framework that treats the magnetization magnitude as a dynamic variable coupled to a thermal bath, we derive a dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch-Slonczewski set of equations for torques, that captures the transient, heating-induced demagnetization that occurs during high-current operation. Integrating these dynamic equations and comparing them to their stochastic equivalents reveals that both the energy landscape and switching dynamics in high-anisotropy systems are similarly modified. This approach yields accurate and accelerated predictions of critical currents and switching times.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian neural ODEs: Measuring the existence of a Lagrangian with Helmholtz metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural ODEs are a widely used, powerful machine learning technique in particular for physics. However, not every solution is physical in that it is an Euler-Lagrange equation. We present Helmholtz metrics to quantify this resemblance for a given ODE and demonstrate their capabilities on several fundamental systems with noise. We combine them with a second order neural ODE to form a Lagrangian neural ODE, which allows to learn Euler-Lagrange equations in a direct fashion and with zero additional inference cost. We demonstrate that, using only positional data, they can distinguish Lagrangian and non-Lagrangian systems and improve the neural ODE solutions.</description>

      <title>Local Order Average-Atom Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article describes an extension to the effective Average Atom (AA) method for random alloys to account for local ordering (short-range order) effects by utilizing information from partial radial distribution functions. The new Local-Order Average Atom (LOAA) method is rigorously derived based on statistical mechanics arguments and validated for non-stoichiometric binary 2D hexagonal crystals and 3D FeNiCr and NiAl alloys whose ground state is obtained through Monte Carlo sampling. Material properties for these alloys, and phase transformations for the NiAl system, computed from static and dynamic atomistic simulations using standard interatomic potentials (IPs) exhibit a strong dependence on local ordering that is captured by simulations with effective LOAA IPs, but not the original AA method. The advantage of LOAA is that it requires smaller system sizes to achieve statistically converged results and therefore enables the simulation of complex materials, such as high-entropy alloys, at a fraction of the computational cost of standard IPs.</description>

      <title>Neural Network for Subgrid Turbulence Modeling for Large Eddy Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When simulating multiscale systems, where some fields cannot be fully prescribed despite their effects on the simulation's accuracy, closure models are needed. This behavior is observed in turbulent fluid dynamics, where Large Eddy Simulations (LES) depict global behavior while turbulence modeling introduces dissipation correspondent to smaller sub-grid scales. Recently, scientific machine learning techniques have emerged to address this problem by integrating traditional (physics-based) equations with data-driven (machine-learned) models, typically coupling numerical solvers with neural networks. This work presents a comprehensive workflow, encompassing high-fidelity data generation, a priori learning, and a posteriori learning, where data-driven models enhance differential equations. The study underscores the critical role of post-processing and effective filtering of fine-resolution fields and the implications numerical methods selection, such as the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) or Finite Volume Method.</description>
