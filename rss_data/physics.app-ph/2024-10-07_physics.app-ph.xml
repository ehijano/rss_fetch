      <title>Subwavelength topological interface modes in a multilayered vibroacoustic metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic and rigorous analytical approach, based on the transfer matrix methodology, to study the existence, evolution, and robustness of subwavelength topological interface states in practical multilayered vibroacoustic phononic lattices. These lattices, composed of membrane-air cavity unit cells, exhibit complex band structures with various bandgaps, including Bragg, band-splitting induced, local resonance, and plasma bandgaps. Focusing on the challenging low-frequency range and assuming axisymmetric modes, we show that topological interface states are confined to Bragg-like band-splitting induced bandgaps. Unlike the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the vibroacoustic lattice exhibits diverse topological phase transitions across infinite bands, enabling broadband, multi-frequency vibroacoustics in the subwavelength regime. We establish three criteria for the existence of these states: the Zak phase, surface impedance, and a new reflection coefficient concept, all derived from transfer matrix components. Notably, we provide an explicit expression for the exact location of topological interface states within the band structure, offering insight for their predictive implementation. We confirm the robustness of these states against structural variations and identify delocalization as bandgaps narrow. Our work provides a complete and exact analytical characterization of topological interface states, demonstrating the effectiveness of the transfer matrix method. Beyond its analytical depth, our approach provides a useful framework and design tool for topological phononic lattices, advancing applications such as efficient sound filters, waveguides, noise control, and acoustic sensors in the subwavelength regime. Its versatility extends beyond the vibroacoustic systems, encompassing a broader range of phononic and photonic crystals with repetitive inversion-symmetric unit cells.</description>

      <title>Cavity Model for a Patch Antenna Embedded with a Hybrid Ground Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical method to characterise the farfield radiation pattern of a patch antenna embedded with a hybrid ground plane is presented using the Cavity Model. The hybrid ground plane is a two-layered structure with a Perfect Magnetic Conductor (PMC) stacked on top of a Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC) separated by a small distance. The model predicts an increase in the antenna's directivity, which is validated through a full-wave simulation model by realising the PMC surface through an Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) which is embedded into the patch antenna's substrate.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Insights into 1:2 and 1:3 Internal Resonance for Frequency Stabilization in Nonlinear Micromechanical Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micromechanical resonators are essential components in time-keeping and sensing devices due to their high frequency, high quality factor, and sensitivity. However, their extremely low damping can lead to various nonlinear phenomena that can compromise frequency stability. A major limiting factor is the Duffing hardening effect, which causes frequency drift through amplitude variations, known as the amplitude-frequency effect. Recently, internal resonance (InRes) has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate this issue and enhance frequency stabilization. In this study, we investigate the frequency stabilization mechanisms of 1:2 and 1:3 InRes using a generalized two-mode reduced-order model that includes Duffing nonlinearity and nonlinear modal coupling. By analyzing the frequency response curves and pi/2-backbone curves, we demonstrate how different parameters affect the effectiveness of frequency stabilization. Our results identify two distinct regimes depending on the coupling strength relative to the stiffening effect as a key factor in determining the stabilization mechanism. For the regime of weak coupling, both 1:2 and 1:3 InRes achieve frequency stabilization through amplitude and frequency saturation over a range of forcing amplitudes. In contrast, strong coupling reduces the amplitude-frequency effect by forming an asymptote line for 1:2 InRes or a zero-dispersion point for 1:3 InRes. These insights offer valuable guidelines for designing micromechanical resonators with high-frequency stability, highlighting InRes as a robust tool for enhancing performance in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Signatures of valley drift in the diversified band dispersions of bright, gray, and dark excitons in MoS2 monolayers under uni-axial strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of the strain-modulated excitonic properties of uni-axially strained transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers (TMD-MLs) by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) established on the basis of first principles. We show that imposing an uni-axial strain onto a MoS_$2$ monolayers leads to the diversified band dispersions of the bright exciton (BX), gray exciton (GX), and dark exciton (DX) states, as a consequence of the competitive interplay between strain-induced valley drift (VD) and momentum-dependent electron-hole exchange interaction (EHEI). While the band dispersions of BX doublet in the light-accessible small reciprocal area remain almost unchanged against strain, the band dispersion of DX is reshaped by an increasing uni-axial strain from a parabola to a Mexican-hat-like profile, featured with unusual sign-reversal of the heavy effective mass and strain-activated brightness. In contrast, the effective mass of GX is drastically lightened by uni-axial strain and remains always positive. We show that the strain-diversified exciton band dispersions leads to the distinct exciton diffusivities and angle-resolved optical patterns of BX, GX, and DX in a strained TMD-ML, suggesting the feasibility of {\it spatially} resolving spinallowed and -forbidden excitons in exciton transport experiments and angle-resolved optical spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying multifractal anisotropy in two dimensional objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient method of exploring the effects of anisotropy in the fractal properties of 2D surfaces and images is proposed. It can be viewed as a direction-sensitive generalization of the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) into 2D. It is tested on synthetic structures to ensure its effectiveness, with results indicating consistency. The interdisciplinary potential of this method in describing real surfaces and images is demonstrated, revealing previously unknown directional multifractality in data sets from the Martian surface and the Crab Nebula. The multifractal characteristics of Jackson Pollock's paintings are also analyzed. The results point to their evolution over the time of creation of these works.</description>

      <title>Unmasking hidden ignition sources: A new approach to finding extreme charge peaks in powder processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powders acquire a high electrostatic charge during transport and processing. Consequently, in the aftermath of dust explosions, electrostatic discharge is often suspected to be the ignition source. However, definite proof is usually lacking since the rise of electrostatic charge cannot be seen or smelled, and the explosion destroys valuable evidence. Moreover, conventional methods to measure the bulk charge of powder flows, such as the Faraday pail, provide only the aggregate charge for the entire particle ensemble. Our simulations show that, depending on the flow conditions, contacts between particles lead to bipolar charging. Bipolar charged powder remains overall neutral; thus, a Faraday pail detects no danger, even though individual particles are highly charged. To address this gap, we have developed a measurement technology to resolve the powder charge spatially. The first measurements have revealed a critical discovery: a localized charge peak near the inner wall of the conveying duct is 85 times higher than the average charge that would be measured using the Faraday pail. This finding underscores the possibility of extremely high local charges that can serve as ignition sources, even though they remain undetected by conventional measurement systems. Our new technology offers a solution by spatially resolving the charge distribution within powder flows, unmasking hidden ignition sources, and preventing catastrophic incidents in the industry.</description>

      <title>Cascaded-mode interferometers: spectral shape and linewidth engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometers are essential tools to measure and shape optical fields, and are widely used in optical metrology, sensing, laser physics, and quantum mechanics. They superimpose waves with a mutual phase delay, resulting in a change in light intensity. A frequency-dependent phase delay then allows to shape the spectrum of light, which is essential for filtering, routing, wave shaping, or multiplexing. Simple Mach-Zehnder interferometers superimpose spatial waves and typically generate an output intensity that depends sinusoidally on frequency, limiting the capabilities for spectral engineering. Here, we present a novel framework that uses the interference of multiple transverse modes in a single multimode waveguide to achieve arbitrary spectral shapes in a compact geometry. Through the design of corrugated gratings, these modes couple to each other, allowing the exchange of energy similar to a beam splitter, facilitating easy handling of multiple modes. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate narrow-linewidth spectra with independently tunable free spectral range and linewidth, as well as independent spectral shapes for various transverse modes. Our methodology can be applied to orthogonal optical modes of different orders, polarization, and angular momentum, and holds promise for sensing, optical metrology, calibration, and computing.</description>

      <title>Design and Fabrication of a Low-cost Liquid Optical Waveguide for Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexities of fabrication techniques and the demand for high precision have posed significant challenges in the mass production of augmented reality (AR) waveguide combiners. Leveraging the capabilities of Polyjet 3D printing techniques, we have developed a cost-effective method for fabricating liquid geometric waveguide combiners for AR applications, using silicone oil as the medium. During the design phase, we optimized the structure of the waveguide combiner to facilitate easier fabrication. Our proposed method simplifies the production process by removing the need for complicated steps like dicing, layer bonding, and polishing, which are usually involved in traditional manufacturing techniques. We conducted optical simulations and developed a prototype using our patented fabrication method, which successfully demonstrated the integration of virtual images with the real-world environment, thereby confirming its feasibility and potential for cost-effective mass production.</description>

      <title>Quantifying inhomogeneous magnetic fields at the micron scale using Graphene Hall-Effect sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response of a graphene Hall-Effect sensor to the inhomogeneous magnetic field generated by a dipole located above it, is investigated numerically at room temperature as a function of the dipole position, its orientation and the conduction regime of the sensor, i.e., diffusive or ballistic. By means of dedicated models, we highlight that the correction factor {\alpha} frequently used to relate the Hall voltage to the magnetic field averaged over the sensor area can be greatly improved in the high proximity situation enabled by the use of graphene, particularly in the ballistic regime. In addition, it is demonstrated that by fine-tuning the dipole position in the sensor plane, the Hall response becomes highly selective with respect to the dipole orientation. These analyses show that diffusive graphene Hall sensors may be preferred for particle detection, while ballistic ones used as close as possible to a nanomagnet would be preferred for magnetometry. With the support of micromagnetic simulations, the principle of the magnetic hysteresis loop measurement of an isolated nanomagnet is quantitively demonstrated with large signal-to-noise ratio to probe incoherent magnetization reversal. Devices based on specially designed graphene Hall crosses operating in the ballistic regime promise to outperform state-of-the-art ballistic Hall sensors based on semiconductor quantum wells especially for nano-magnetometry.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer between Dissimilar Dielectric Media by Coupling Surface Phonon Polaritons to Graphenes Plasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric media are very promising for near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) applications as these materials can thermally emit surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) resulting in large and quasi-monochromatic heat fluxes. Near-field radiative heat flux between dissimilar dielectric media is much smaller than that between similar dielectric media and is also not quasi-monochromatic. This is due to the mismatch of the SPhP frequencies of the two heat-exchanging dielectric media. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that NFRHT between dissimilar dielectric media increases substantially when a graphene sheet is deposited on the medium with the smaller SPhP frequency. An enhancement of 2.7 to 3.2 folds is measured for the heat flux between SiC and LiF separated by a vacuum gap of size 100 to 140 nm when LiF is covered by a graphene sheet. This enhancement is due to the coupling of SPhPs and surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). The SPPs of graphene are coupled to the SPhPs of LiF resulting in coupled SPhP-SPPs with a dispersion branch monotonically increasing with the wavevector. This monotonically increasing branch of dispersion relation intersects the dispersion branch of the SPhPs of SiC causing the coupling of the surface modes across the vacuum gap, which resonantly increases the heat flux at the SPhP frequency of SiC. This surface phonon-plasmon coupling also makes NFRHT quasi-monochromatic, which is highly desired for applications such as near-field thermophotovoltaics and thermophotonics. This study experimentally demonstrates that graphene is a very promising material for tuning the magnitude and spectrum of NFRHT between dissimilar dielectric media.</description>

      <title>Ar$\chi$i-Textile Composites: Role of Weave Architecture on Mode-I Fracture Toughness in Woven Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of weave architectures on the mechanics of crack propagation in fiber-reinforced woven polymer composites under quasi-static loading. Woven composites consist of fabrics/textiles containing fibers interwoven at 0 degrees (warp) and 90 degrees (weft) bound by a polymer matrix. The mechanical properties can be tuned by weaving fiber bundles with single or multiple materials in various patterns or architectures. Although the effects of uniform weave architectures, like plain, twill, satin, etc. on in-plane modulus and fracture energy have been studied, the influence of patterned weaves consisting of a combination of sub-patterns, that is, architected weaves, on these behaviors is not understood. We focus on identifying the mechanisms affecting crack path tortuosity and propagation rate in composites with architected woven textiles containing various sub-patterns, hence, \textit{Ar$\chi$i} {\bf(ar.kee)} \textit{-Textile} Composites. Through compact tension tests, we determine how architected weave patterns compared to uniform weaves influence mode-I fracture energy of woven composites due to interactions of different failure modes. Results show that fracture energy increases at transition regions between sub-patterns in architected weave composites, with more tortuous crack propagation and higher resistance to crack growth than uniform weave composites. We also introduce three geometrical parameters - transition, area, and skewness factors - to characterize sub-patterns and their effects on in-plane fracture energy. This knowledge can be exploited to design and fabricate safer lightweight structures for marine and aerospace sectors with enhanced damage tolerance under extreme loads.</description>
