      <title>A family of integrable maps associated with the Volterra lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Gubbiotti, Joshi, Tran and Viallet classified birational maps in four dimensions admitting two invariants (first integrals) with a particular degree structure, by considering recurrences of fourth order with a certain symmetry. The last three of the maps so obtained were shown to be Liouville integrable, in the sense of admitting a non-degenerate Poisson bracket with two first integrals in involution. Here we show how the first of these three Liouville integrable maps corresponds to genus 2 solutions of the infinite Volterra lattice, being the $g=2$ case of a family of maps associated with the Stieltjes continued fraction expansion of a certain function on a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g\geqslant 1$. The continued fraction method provides explicit Hankel determinant formulae for tau functions of the solutions, together with an algebro-geometric description via a Lax representation for each member of the family, associating it with an algebraic completely integrable system. In particular, in the elliptic case ($g=1$), as a byproduct we obtain Hankel determinant expressions for the solutions of the Somos-5 recurrence, but different to those previously derived by Chang, Hu and Xin. By applying contraction to the Stieltjes fraction, we recover integrable maps associated with Jacobi continued fractions on hyperelliptic curves, that one of us considered previously, as well as the Miura-type transformation between the Volterra and Toda lattices.</description>

      <title>Non-Stationary Difference Equation and Affine Laumon Space II: Quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15364v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Shakirov's non-stationary difference equation, when it is truncated, implies the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov ($q$-KZ) equation for $U_{\mathsf v}\bigl(A_1^{(1)}\bigr)$ with generic spins. Namely, we can tune mass parameters so that the Hamiltonian acts on the space of finite Laurent polynomials. Then the representation matrix of the Hamiltonian agrees with the $R$-matrix, or the quantum $6j$ symbols. On the other hand, we prove that the $K$ theoretic Nekrasov partition function from the affine Laumon space is identified with the well-studied Jackson integral solution to the $q$-KZ equation. Combining these results, we establish that the affine Laumon partition function gives a solution to Shakirov's equation, which was a conjecture in our previous paper. We also work out the base-fiber duality and four-dimensional limit in relation with the $q$-KZ equation.</description>

      <title>Integrable models on Rydberg atom chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of integrable models for spin chains with constrained Hilbert spaces; we focus on spin-1/2 chains with the Rydberg constraint. We extend earlier results for medium-range spin chains to the constrained Hilbert space, and formulate an integrability condition. This enables us to construct new integrable models with fixed interaction ranges. We classify all time- and space-reflection symmetric integrable Rydberg-constrained Hamiltonians of range 3 and 4. At range 3, we find a single family of integrable Hamiltonians: the so-called RSOS quantum chains, which are related to the well-known RSOS models of Andrews, Baxter, and Forrester. At range 4 we find two families of models, the first of which is the constrained XXZ model. We also find a new family of models depending on a single coupling $z$. We provide evidence of two critical points related to the golden ratio $\phi$, at $z=\phi^{-1/2}$ and $z=\phi^{3/2}$. We also perform a partial classification of integrable Hamiltonians for range 5.</description>
