      <title>Evaluating Universal Machine Learning Force Fields Against Experimental Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal machine learning force fields (UMLFFs) promise to revolutionize materials science by enabling rapid atomistic simulations across the periodic table. However, their evaluation has been limited to computational benchmarks that may not reflect real-world performance. Here, we present UniFFBench, a comprehensive framework for evaluating UMLFFs against experimental measurements of ~1,500 carefully curated mineral structures spanning diverse chemical environments, bonding types, structural complexity, and elastic properties. Our systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art UMLFFs reveals a substantial reality gap: models achieving impressive performance on computational benchmarks often fail when confronted with experimental complexity. Even the best-performing models exhibit higher density prediction error than the threshold required for practical applications. Most strikingly, we observe disconnects between simulation stability and mechanical property accuracy, with prediction errors correlating with training data representation rather than the modeling method. These findings demonstrate that while current computational benchmarks provide valuable controlled comparisons, they may overestimate model reliability when extrapolated to experimentally complex chemical spaces. Altogether, UniFFBench establishes essential experimental validation standards and reveals systematic limitations that must be addressed to achieve truly universal force field capabilities.</description>

      <title>Emerging ultra-wide band gap semiconductors for future high-frequency electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the growing demands of advanced electronic systems, next-generation power and RF semiconductor devices must operate efficiently at higher power levels and switching frequencies while remaining compact. Current state-of-the-art GaN semiconductor devices alone cannot meet all these demands. Emerging ultra-wide band gap (UWBG) alternatives like diamond, BN, AlN, and Ga2O3, face significant challenges including limited wafer availability, doping difficulties, and thermal management constraints. Herein we conduct a high-throughput computational screening for new semiconductors for high-frequency electronics. In our analysis we compute the modeled Johnson and Baliga high-frequency figures of merit in combination with thermal conductivity to assess their potential for RF and power devices. We show that there are plenty of alternative materials to explore and conclude by discussing dopability and synthesis of select candidate materials. This study lays the foundation for discovering new semiconductors that can push the boundaries of performance in applications ranging from EV chargers and solid-state transformers to sub-THz communications and advanced radar technologies.</description>

      <title>Structural and Optical Properties of Crystal Ion Sliced BaTiO$_3$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$) is a compelling material for integrated photonics due to its strong electro-optic and second-order nonlinear properties. Crystal Ion Slicing (CIS) presents a scalable and CMOS-compatible route for fabricating thin BaTiO$_3$ films; however, ion implantation during CIS introduces lattice damage that can degrade structural and optical performance. In this study, we demonstrate that post-slicing thermal annealing effectively restores the structural integrity and optical quality of CIS-processed BaTiO$_3$ flakes. Raman spectroscopy confirms the recovery of crystallinity, while second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy reveals systematic reorientation of ferroelectric domains and restoration of the associated second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor $X^{(2)}$. Notably, SHG signals persist even in regions with weak Raman signatures, indicating that long-range ferroelectric order can survive despite partial lattice disruption. Optical measurements show that the linear dispersion of annealed CIS flakes closely matches that of bulk BaTiO$_3$, validating their suitability for photonic integration. Together, these results qualify CIS - combined with thermal annealing - as a viable and scalable manufacturing strategy for high-quality BaTiO$_3$-on-insulator (BTOI) platforms, enabling advanced integrated photonic devices for modulation, frequency conversion, and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $\mu$SR Studies of Ion Dynamics in the Light of Extended Kubo-Toyabe Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical Kubo-Toyabe (dKT) function is extended to describe the spin relaxation under the coexisting dynamical and static internal magnetic fields. A detailed re-evaluation of the previous $\mu^\pm$SR data in Na$_x$CoO$_2$ using this function disfavors the conventional interpretation based on sodium-ion diffusion and instead supports the $\mu^+$ self-diffusion scenario. This also resolves the long-standing inconsistencies in the dKT-function-based $\mu$SR studies on ion diffusion from the viewpoint of classical over-barrier-jump mechanism.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Dealloyed Brass as Li-Metal Battery Current Collector: Effect of Zinc and Porosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Anode-free" lithium-metal batteries promise significantly higher energy density than conventional graphite-based lithium-ion batteries; however, lithium dendrite growth can lead to internal short circuits with associated safety risks. While porous current collectors can suppress dendrite growth, optimal porosity and composition remain unknown. Here, we show that the temperature during vapor phase dealloying (VPD) of alpha-brass (Cu63Zn37) controls the surface Zn concentration, decreasing from 8 percent to below 1 percent from 500 to 800 degrees C. The surface composition is controlled by the temperature-dependent diffusion. A battery cell maintains greater than 90 percent Coulombic efficiency (CE) over 100 cycles when the Zn content is the lowest, whereas the higher-Zn samples degraded to approximately 70 percent CE. The difference in surface composition has hence dramatic effects on battery performance, and our results demonstrate how precise compositional control enables stable lithium-metal battery operation, establishing about 1 atomic percent surface Zn as optimal for preventing capacity fading and uniform lithium plating, while establishing predictive relationships between processing temperature and surface composition. This work provides design rules for multifunctional current collectors and demonstrates scalable VPD production for next-generation batteries.</description>

      <title>Operation Regimes and Design Principles of Delta-E Effect Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delta-E effect-based magnetoelectric sensors have emerged as promising technology for detecting weak magnetic fields at low frequencies. However, the performance of such sensors remains difficult to predict, as signal and noise characteristics are dictated by interdependent parameters such as magnetic layer geometry, magnetic microstructure, and loss. In this work, we present a systematic experimental study of sub-mm-sized delta-E effect sensors, comprising 24 device configurations that vary in magnetic layer thickness and lateral dimensions. The sensors are statistically analyzed to identify the influence of magnetic layer geometry on performance through a combination of measurements and simulations. Our findings reveal three distinct operation regimes - dominated by electronic noise, magnetic noise, and nonlinearities - whose boundaries shift systematically with magnetic layer thickness. This regime behavior governs the trade-offs between sensitivity and noise, ultimately determining the sensor's limit of detection. Based on these results, the dependency of the regime boundaries on key device parameters is discussed in detail, providing fundamental insights for tailoring sensor performance. As such, this study establishes a necessary foundation for targeted performance optimization and the scalable design of advanced delta-E effect sensor systems.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Staging Structural Evolution and Li (De)Intercalation Kinetics in Graphite Anodes via Machine Learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revealing the dynamic structural evolution and lithium transport properties during the charge/discharge processes is crucial for optimizing graphite anodes in lithium-ion batteries, enabling high stability and fast-charging performance. However, the dynamic coupling mechanisms among carbon layer kinetics, lithium (de)intercalation/diffusion, and defects regulation remain insufficiently understood. In this study, we developed a universal automated workflow based on machine learning potentials to simulate the dynamic lithium (de)intercalation process. With this approach, the staging structural evolution of lithium-graphite intercalation compounds and their lithium transport behavior were resolved through molecular dynamics simulations. By introducing stacking faults into the graphite structure, we successfully simulated stage transitions driven by carbon layer sliding and reorganization, accompanied by stress release and structural stabilization. The dynamics of carbon layers regulate the lithium (de)intercalation positional selectivity, producing intermediate states with varying lithium concentrations and distributions during cycling. This facilitates the formation and transformation of stage structures while mitigating residual stress accumulation. A fundamental kinetic asymmetry arises between lithium intercalation and deintercalation, driven by the continuous and heterogeneous lithium transport and carbon layer sliding during charge/discharge processes. The carbon defects regulate lithium transport, in which the atomic-scale defects confine intralayer lithium transport and carbon sliding while enabling interlayer transport via dynamic lithium trapping/release mechanisms. Accordingly, for the future design, it is critical to construct structural units with controllable carbon layer sliding/reorganization, and tunable defects to enhance lithium-ion transport.</description>

      <title>Scalable Production of Photochromic Yttrium Oxyhydride Powder via Ball Milling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yttrium oxyhydride (YHO) represents one of the most promising photochromic materials discovered in recent years, yet its practical deployment has been severely constrained by the limitations of thin film deposition methods. Here we demonstrate the first successful synthesis of photochromic YHO powders through reactive ball milling under hydrogen atmosphere followed by controlled oxidation a fundamentally scalable approach that overcomes the production barriers facing this technology. High-energy planetary ball milling of yttrium metal under 50 bar hydrogen for 20 hours, followed by controlled oxidation in ultra-dry technical air, yielded nanostructured YHO powders with less than 500 nm particle sizes. These powders exhibit robust photochromic response with reflectance modulation at 850 nm under 405 nm excitation, reversible cycling behavior, and the characteristic memory effect previously observed only in thin films. Powder X-ray diffraction confirms the formation of the cubic YHO phase with lattice expansion consistent with oxygen incorporation into the yttrium hydride structure. Critically, we demonstrate that YHO powders can be processed into polymer composites enabling spatially-resolved photochromic patterning a capability essential for practical device applications. While optimization of optical contrast remains an opportunity for future work, this powder synthesis route fundamentally transforms the manufacturing of YHO-based photochromic systems, enabling mass-scale production using established industrial ball milling infrastructure. These findings establish a viable pathway toward commercial deployment of YHO in smart windows, adaptive optics, and rewritable information storage applications.</description>

      <title>Correlation between Exciton Dynamics and Spin Structure in van der Waals Antiferromagnet NiPS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials provide a platform for exploring novel physics regarding magnetism in low dimensions and developing ultrathin spintronic applications. Here, we investigate the ultrafast dynamics of excitons in a vdW NiPS3 crystal. The temporal evolution of the transient reflection spectra indicates that the spin-correlated exciton is formed through photocarrier localization, the rate of which is independent of the magnetic degrees of freedom. However, the recombination rate of these excitons is connected with the long-range magnetic order, and this connection probably arise from a spin-flip rooted in the underlying antiferromagnetic background during the recombination. Our findings uncover intertwined coupling between carrier, lattice and spin degrees of freedom in NiPS3, which may pave the path toward ultrafast optical manipulation of spin-related quantum states in vdW antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Machine Learning of Interatomic Potentials for Elastic Property Modeling in Al-Mg-Zr Solid Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of resilient and lightweight Aluminum alloys is central to advancing structural materials for energy-efficient engineering applications. To address this challenge, in this study, we explore the elastic properties of Al-Mg-Zr solid solutions by integrating advanced machine learning (ML) techniques with quantum-mechanical (QM) atomistic simulations. For this purpose, we develop accurate and transferable machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) using two complementary approaches: (i) an on-the-fly learning scheme combined with Bayesian linear regression during ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and (ii) the equivariant neural network architecture MACE. Both MLIPs facilitate the prediction of composition-dependent elastic properties while drastically reducing the computational cost compared to conventional QM methods. Comparison with ultrasonic measurements shows that the deviation between simulation and experiment remains within a few GPa across all Al-Mg-Zr systems investigated. These potentials also enable the systematic exploration of the Al-Mg-Zr solid solution phase space and provide insights into the elastic behavior as a function of alloying element concentration. Hence, our findings demonstrate the reliability and transferability of the parameterized on-the-fly MLIPs, making them valuable for accelerating the design of Al alloys with tailored physicomechanical properties in complex compositional spaces. While the present study focuses on homogeneous phases, it establishes a foundation for future multiscale simulations that include microstructural features such as precipitates and grain boundaries.</description>

      <title>An underdog story: Re-emergence of a polar instability at high pressure in KNbO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectricity in perovskites is known to be suppressed by a moderate hydrostatic pressure. The notion that a polar instability should reappear in a higher pressure regime is well accepted theoretically but experiments have failed so far to provide a conclusive evidence for it. Here, we investigate a classical but comparatively underlooked ferroelectric perovskite KNbO3. We use single crystal X-ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopy and second-harmonic generation to explore the phase transition sequence at high pressures up to 63 GPa. We show that the ferroelectric instability manifests itself in the emergence of an incommensurate modulation of the perovskite structure that combines cation displacements and tilts of the oxygen octahedra. Soft modes associated to the tilts and the modulation are clearly observed along with persistent order-disorder signatures. This demonstrates the presence of the high-pressure polar instability in a lead-free perovskite in spite of the centrosymmetric character of all observed high-pressure phases.</description>

      <title>Programing optical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes with benzoyl peroxide derivatives of tailored chemical characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have great potential for optoelectronics and photonics, further enhanced by covalent functionalization. However, scalable and controlled surface modification is challenging due to complex methodologies and unstable reagents. Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) has emerged as a simple alternative for introducing luminescent defects into SWCNTs. Yet, the lack of understanding of its radical chemistry limits precise defect engineering using BPOs. This is a major obstacle to the effective application of BPO in chemistry, despite its widespread use as a radical initiator. We present a thorough investigation into the radical chemistry of self-synthesized BPOs for functionalizing polymer-wrapped (6,5) and (7,5) SWCNTs in non-polar solvents, providing critical insights into the decomposition of BPO and its analogs. By varying the electronic and steric properties of typically unavailable BPO derivatives, we demonstrate tunability over the photoluminescence characteristics of SWCNTs, allowing control over defect density and light emission wavelength. This toolbox of BPO derivatives, created with simple radical chemistry and accessible organic precursors, alongside clarified structure-property relationships, facilitates effective implementation of BPO in chemical transformations and meticulous engineering of luminescent defects in SWCNTs for optoelectronic applications. Notably, this research offers insights into why SWCNTs modified with electron-deficient reactants provide the best optical characteristics.</description>

      <title>Leveraging transfer learning for accurate estimation of ionic migration barriers in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic mobility determines the rate performance of several applications, such as batteries, fuel cells, and electrochemical sensors and is exponentially dependent on the migration barrier ($E_m$), a difficult to measure/calculate quantity. Previous approaches to identify materials with high ionic mobility have relied on imprecise descriptors given the lack of generalizable models to predict $E_m$. Here, we present a graph neural network based architecture that leverages principles of transfer learning to efficiently and accurately predict $E_m$ across a diverse set of materials. We use a model pre-trained simultaneously on seven distinct bulk properties (labeled MPT), modify the MPT model to classify different migration pathways in a structure, and fine-tune (FT) on a manually-curated literature-derived dataset of 619 $E_m$ data points calculated with density functional theory. Importantly, our best-performing FT model (labeled MODEL-3) demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction accuracy compared to classical machine learning methods, graph models trained from scratch, and a universal machine learned interatomic potential, with a R$^2$ score of 0.703 and a mean absolute error of 0.261 eV on the test set. Notably, MODEL-3 is able to distinguish different migration pathways within a structure and also demonstrates excellent ability to generalize across intercalant compositions and chemistries. As a classifier, MODEL-3 exhibits 80\% accuracy and 82.8\% precision in identifying materials that are `good' ionic conductors (i.e., structures with $E_m &lt;$0.65~eV). Thus, our work demonstrates the effective use of FT strategies and architectural modifications necessary for making swift and accurate $E_m$ predictions, which will be useful for materials discovery in batteries and for predicting other data-scarce material properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable atomistic simulations with near first-principles accuracy at substantially reduced computational cost, making them powerful tools for large-scale materials modeling. The accuracy of MLIPs is typically validated on a held-out dataset of \emph{ab initio} energies and atomic forces. However, accuracy on these small-scale properties does not guarantee reliability for emergent, system-level behavior -- precisely the regime where atomistic simulations are most needed, but for which direct validation is often computationally prohibitive. As a practical heuristic, predictive precision -- quantified as inverse uncertainty -- is commonly used as a proxy for accuracy, but its reliability remains poorly understood, particularly for system-level predictions. In this work, we systematically assess the relationship between predictive precision and accuracy in both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes, focusing on ensemble-based uncertainty quantification methods for neural network potentials, including bootstrap, dropout, random initialization, and snapshot ensembles. We use held-out cross-validation for ID assessment and calculate cold curve energies and phonon dispersion relations for OOD testing. These evaluations are performed across various carbon allotropes as representative test systems. We find that uncertainty estimates can behave counterintuitively in OOD settings, often plateauing or even decreasing as predictive errors grow. These results highlight fundamental limitations of current uncertainty quantification approaches and underscore the need for caution when using predictive precision as a stand-in for accuracy in large-scale, extrapolative applications.</description>

      <title>A literature-derived dataset of migration barriers for quantifying ionic transport in battery materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rate performance of any electrode or solid electrolyte material used in a battery is critically dependent on the migration barrier ($E_m$) governing the motion of the intercalant ion, which is a difficult-to-estimate quantity both experimentally and computationally. The foundation for constructing and validating accurate machine learning (ML) models that are capable of predicting $E_m$, and hence accelerating the discovery of novel electrodes and solid electrolytes, lies in the availability of high-quality dataset(s) containing $E_m$. Addressing this critical requirement, we present a comprehensive dataset comprising 619 distinct literature-reported $E_m$ values calculated using density functional theory based nudged elastic band computations, across 443 compositions and 27 structural groups consisting of various compounds that have been explored as electrodes or solid electrolytes in batteries. Our dataset includes compositions that correspond to fully charged and/or discharged states of electrode materials, with intermediate compositions incorporated in select instances. Crucially, for each compound, our dataset provides structural information, including the initial and final positions of the migrating ion, along with its corresponding $E_m$ in easy-to-use .xlsx and JSON formats. We envision our dataset to be a highly useful resource for the scientific community, facilitating the development of advanced ML models that can predict $E_m$ precisely and accelerate materials discovery.</description>

      <title>A device-level compact model for mushroom-type phase change memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a compact model for mushroom-type phase-change memory devices that incorporates the shape and size of the amorphous mark under different programming conditions, and is applicable to both projecting and non-projecting devices. The model includes analytical equations for the amorphous and crystalline regions and uniquely features a current leakage path that injects current at the outer edge of the electrodes. The results demonstrate that accurately modeling the size and shape of the phase configurations is crucial for predicting the full-span of the RESET and SET programming, including the characteristics of threshold switching. Additionally, the model effectively captures read-out behaviors, including the dependence of resistance drift and bipolar current asymmetry behaviours on the phase configurations. The compact model is also provided in Verilog-A format, so it can be easily used in standard circuit-level simulation tools.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Multispectral Encoding: Advancing Optical Lithography for Encryption and Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most modern optical display and sensing devices utilize a limited number of spectral units within the visible range, based on human color perception. In contrast, the rapid advancement of machine-based pattern recognition and spectral analysis could facilitate the use of multispectral functional units, yet the challenge of creating complex, high-definition, and reproducible patterns with an increasing number of spectral units limits their widespread application. Here, we report a technique for optical lithography that employs a single-shot exposure to reproduce perovskite films with spatially controlled optical band gaps through light-induced compositional modulations. Luminescent patterns are designed to program correlations between spatial and spectral information, covering the entire visible spectral range. Using this platform, we demonstrate multispectral encoding patterns for encryption and multivariate optical converters for dispersive optics-free spectroscopy with high spectral resolution. The fabrication process is conducted at room temperature and can be extended to other material and device platforms.</description>

      <title>Observing Differential Spin Currents by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling spin currents, i.e., the flow of spin angular momentum, in small magnetic devices is the principal objective of spin electronics, a main contender for future energy efficient information technologies. Surprisingly, a pure spin current has never been measured directly since the associated electric stray fields and/or shifts in the non-equilibrium spin-dependent distribution functions are too small for conventional experimental detection methods optimized for charge transport. Here we report that resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) can bridge this gap by measuring the spin current carried by magnons -- the quanta of the spin wave excitations of the magnetic order -- in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator. This is possible due to the sensitivity of the momentum- and energy-resolved RIXS intensity to minute changes in the magnon distribution under non-equilibrium conditions. We use the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation to extract transport parameters, such as the magnon lifetime at finite momentum, essential for the realization of magnon spintronics.</description>

      <title>Unexpectedly large entropic barrier controls bond rearrangements in vitrimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vitrimers are a relatively new class of polymeric materials containing associative covalent dynamic bonds that make them recyclable by design. However, the fundamental mechanisms controlling their viscoelastic properties remain poorly understood. Our detailed studies of relaxation dynamics and viscoelastic behavior of model vitrimers revealed that the density of dynamic covalent crosslinks has no influence on chain dynamics (beyond a weak change in the glass transition temperature), yet it strongly affects the linear viscoelasticity of vitrimers. Increasing the crosslink density induces a sol-gel transition consistent with predictions of classical gelation theory, demonstrating its applicability to vitrimers. Remarkably, the temperature-dependent analysis of the bond rearrangement time reveals an unexpectedly large negative activation entropy in the transition state that strongly slows down the bond exchange process despite its relatively low activation enthalpy. This insight explains the unusual long timescale for bond rearrangement in vitrimers and highlights the significance of entropy in controlling the viscoelasticity of dynamic covalent networks.</description>

      <title>Isolated spin ladders in Ln$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ (Ln:La-Nd) metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we present the discovery and characterization of a series of antimonides Ln$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ (Ln: La--Nd) which exhibit well-isolated, $n=2$ rare-earth spin ladders. We discuss the structure of the new compounds, with a particular focus on the magnetic Ln spin ladders. Nd$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ and Ce$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ exhibit antiferromagnetic interactions and a well-defined doublet ground state, whereas Pr$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ exhibits a weakly magnetic singlet ground state. Nd$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ is a poor metal with an electrical resistivity of 0.1m$\Omega$-cm at 300K and weak temperature dependence. The thermal conductivity along the ladder exhibits significant field dependence even at 40K, considerably higher than the magnetic ordering temperature of 1.1K. Compared to compounds with transition metal spin ladders, the rare-earth elements impart much lower energy scales, making these compounds highly tunable with external stimuli like magnetic fields. The diverse magnetism of the rare-earth ions and RKKY interactions further contribute to the potential for a wide array of rich magnetic ground states, positioning these materials as a rare example of an inorganic square spin-ladder platform.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall Resistance and Quantum Hall Plateaus from Edge State Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the extensive literature on the quantum Hall effect (QHE), a direct derivation of the phenomenological formula $\rho_{xy} = h/e^2\nu$ from first principles has remained elusive. In this work, we revisit the Landau and Landauer-B\"uttiker formalisms and impose hard-wall boundary conditions on the wavefunction, an essential but often overlooked constraint. This condition quantizes the guiding center position and the longitudinal wave number $k_x$, leading naturally to a discrete number of edge states without invoking energy bending. We derive the Hall resistance directly and recover the standard result $\rho_{xy} = h/e^2\nu$, along with an explicit expression for the filling factor $\nu$ in terms of the Fermi energy and magnetic field. The resulting resistance steps reproduce the observed QHE plateaus and match experimental data without fitting parameters.</description>

      <title>Low-dimensional magnetocaloric materials for energy-efficient magnetic refrigeration: Does size matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetocaloric effect (MCE) provides a promising foundation for the development of solid-state refrigeration technologies that could replace conventional gas compression-based cooling systems. Current research efforts primarily focus on identifying cost-effective magnetic materials that exhibit large MCEs under low magnetic fields across broad temperature ranges, thereby enhancing cooling efficiency. However, practical implementation of magnetic refrigeration requires more than bulk materials; real-world devices demand efficient thermal management and compact, scalable architectures, often achieved through laminate designs or miniaturized geometries. Magnetocaloric materials with reduced dimensionality, such as ribbons, thin films, microwires, and nanostructures, offer distinct advantages, including improved heat exchange, mechanical flexibility, and integration potential. Despite these benefits, a comprehensive understanding of how size, geometry, interfacial effects, strain, and surface phenomena influence the MCE remains limited. This review aims to address these knowledge gaps and provide guidance for the rational design and engineering of magnetocaloric materials tailored for high-performance, energy-efficient magnetic refrigeration systems.</description>

      <title>Template masks for 4D-STEM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new analysis method for atomic resolution four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM, in which a diffraction pattern is collected at each point of a raster scan of a focused electron beam across the specimen). In 4D-STEM, each measured intensity has a dual character, forming a pixel in a diffraction pattern and, equally, forming a pixel in a STEM image. Applying a mask to the data to obtain a "virtual" bright field or dark field image is widely used and understood. However, there is a complementary procedure, in which an image (template) is applied to the data to obtain a mask. This mask shows the correlation between the data and the template and, when applied to atomic resolution 4D-STEM data produces an image optimised for the template. This allows, for example, imaging of specific atom columns and is a significant improvement over user-defined masks such as virtual annular bright field imaging. We demonstrate the capability of the approach, separately imaging Li and O atom columns in LiFePO4 and O, Pb and Ti across a domain wall in PbTiO3.These template masks provide a computationally straightforward and general method to probe 4D-STEM data. They are particularly effective for specimens of moderate thickness where multiple scattering produces strong and specific correlations in diffraction patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linking electrode microstructure to electrochemical performance is essential for optimizing Li-ion batteries. However, this requires mechanistic 4D observations at ultimate spatio-temporal scales, which remains elusive. Here we demonstrate the use of operando synchrotron X-ray nano-holo-tomography combined with Digital Volume Correlation to track chemomechanical dynamics at both particle (local) and electrode (averaged) scales. Quantitative scale-bridging image analysis is applied to a high-capacity silicon-graphite anode during its formation cycle. Our findings reveal that local diffusion properties, graphite particle morphology and position in the electrode, distance to silicon clusters, surface contact with electrolyte and mechanical deformations, all have a direct impact on the local electrochemical activity and irreversibility - but these parameters are not equally important. Particularly, we identify fast diffusion channels that play a key role and counterbalance intrinsic depth-dependent reaction heterogeneities due to ionic/electronic diffusion limitations. The various structural factors that determine Gr-Si battery performance beyond ensemble properties are classified using a scale of influence, providing a practical framework for the optimization of materials and electrode manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Observation of momentum dependent charge density wave gap in EuTe4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The occurrence of charge density wave (CDW) phenomena, particularly in low dimensional rare-earth chalcogenides, has attracted substantial research interest. Among these materials, EuTe4, which features multiple Te layers and a single Eu-Te layer, serves as a promising platform to study the interplay between CDW order and 4f electron configurations, including magnetism. In this study, First principles based density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to investigate the electronic band structure modifications arising from CDW modulation. Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) revealed the emergence of a CDW gap at the Fermi level, as well as hybridization induced gap features at lower binding energies. The low lying CDW gap reaches its maximum along the Gamma-Y high-symmetry direction and a minimum along GX reflecting the anisotropic nature of the electronic structure. We also performed low temperature heat capacity measurements in applied magnetic fields near the Neel temperature (TN ~ 6.9 K) to construct the magnetic phase diagram of EuTe4. This study provides valuable insight into the directional dependent evolution of the Fermi surface nesting induced CDW ordering, along with other observed gap openings within this system.</description>

      <title>Machine learning of kinetic energy densities with target and feature averaging: better results with fewer training data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning of kinetic energy functionals (KEF), in particular kinetic energy density (KED) functionals, has recently attracted attention as a promising way to construct KEFs for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT). Neural networks (NN) and kernel methods including Gaussian process regression (GPR) have been used to learn Kohn-Sham (KS) KED from density-based descriptors derived from KS DFT calculations. The descriptors are typically expressed as functions of different powers and derivatives of the electron density. This can generate large and extremely unevenly distributed datasets, which complicates effective application of machine learning techniques. Very uneven data distributions require many training data points, can cause overfitting, and ultimately lower the quality of a ML KED model. We show that one can produce more accurate ML models from fewer data by working with partially averaged density-dependent variables and KED. Averaging palliates the issue of very uneven data distributions and associated difficulties of sampling, while retaining enough spatial structure necessary for working within the paradigm of KEDF. We use GPR as a function of partially spatially averaged terms of the 4th order gradient expansion and the Kohn-Sham effective potential and obtain accurate and stable (with respect to different random choices of training points) kinetic energy models for Al, Mg, and Si simultaneously from as few as 2000 samples (about 0.3% of the total KS DFT data). In particular, accuracies on the order of 1% in a measure of the quality of energy-volume dependence B' = \frac{E(V_0-\Delta V)-2E(V_0)+E(V_0 + \Delta V)}{\big(\frac{\Delta V}{V_0}\big)^2} are obtained simultaneously for all three materials.</description>

      <title>Phase-field model of alloy solidification far from chemical equilibrium at the solid-liquid interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We further develop a recently introduced phase-field model of rapid alloy solidification [Ji et al., PRL 2023]. This model utilizes enhanced solute diffusivity within the spatially diffuse interface region to quantitatively capture solute trapping with a larger interface width, thereby making simulations on experimentally relevant length and time scales computationally feasible. The main developments presented here include testing the robustness of different variational formulations, extending the model to concentrated alloys by incorporating solid and liquid free energies from thermodynamic databases, as illustrated for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys with CALPHAD, extending convergence tests as a function of interface width to 3D, and carrying out simulations in both 2D and 3D to examine existing theories of microstructure development. Our results indicate that the simplest variational formulation that interpolates the bulk free-energy density between its solid and liquid forms is the most robust. Remarkably, for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys, this formulation yields a high-velocity nonequilibrium phase diagram that is independent of interface width, thereby demonstrating that the framework of enhanced solute diffusivity can be non-trivially extended to concentrated alloys. Other variational formulations have restricted ranges of materials or processing parameters that can be reliably modeled. We use 2D simulations to construct high-velocity microstructure selection maps for dilute Al-Cu alloys. Furthermore, 3D simulations demonstrate a good convergence similar to that observed in 2D as a function of interface width. Full 3D simulations reveal that the standard theory of absolute stability is a good predictor of the upper critical velocity beyond which steady-state growth becomes unstable, despite the different morphological manifestations of this instability in 2D and 3D.</description>

      <title>A model of full thermodynamic stabilization of nanocrystalline alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model of a polycrystalline alloy combining the Potts model for grain orientations with a lattice-gas model for solute thermodynamics and diffusion. The alloy evolution with this model is implemented by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with nonlinear transition barriers between microstates. The model is applied to investigate the long-standing question of whether grain boundary (GB) segregation of an appropriate solute can drive the GB free energy to zero, creating a fully stabilized polycrystalline state with a finite grain size. The model reproduces stable polycrystalline states under certain conditions, provided the solute-solute interactions are repulsive. The material's structure minimizing the total free energy is not static. It exists in a state of dynamic equilibrium between the competing processes of grain growth and grain refinement. The alloy eliminates triple junctions by forming a set of smaller grains embedded into a larger matrix grain. It is predicted that, if a fully stabilized nanocrystalline state is realized experimentally, it will look very different from the conventional (unstable) nanocrystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Hybrid d/p-wave altermagnetism in Ca$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and strain-controlled spin splitting</title>

Abstract: The interplay of strong electronic correlations, sizable octahedral distortions, and pronounced spin--orbit coupling (SOC) makes perovskite oxides promising candidates for realizing altermagnetic phases. We study altermagnetic phases in Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$, a non-centrosymmetric layered perovskite whose ground state is a Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnet. We show that an alternative N\'eel-type spin arrangement hosts a P-2 $d$-wave altermagnetic state with orbital selectivity similar to Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. Including SOC generates a symmetry-allowed $p$-wave component and yields a hybrid $d$/$p$-wave altermagnetic order. We further demonstrate that biaxial strain tunes both magnetic stability and band splitting: compressive strain beyond 2\% favors the altermagnetic phase over the antiferromagnetic ground state, while tensile strain increases altermagnetic splittings by up to 9\%. To quantify these trends, we define an altermagnetic figure of merit and trace its strain dependence to changes in electronic localization and octahedral geometry in this polar metal.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Ultrashort Orbital Transport in Heavy Metals Revealed by Terahertz Emission Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum of electrons offers a promising, yet largely unexplored, degree of freedom for ultrafast, energy-efficient information processing. As the foundation of orbitronics, understanding how orbital currents propagate and convert into charge currents is essential - but remains elusive due to the challenge in disentangling orbital and spin dynamics in ultrathin films. Although orbital currents have been predicted to propagate over long distances in materials, recent theoretical studies argue that lattice symmetry may constrain their mean free paths (MFPs) to the scale of a single atomic layer. In this work, we provide the first direct experimental evidence for ultrashort orbital MFPs in heavy metals (HMs) - W, Ta, Pt - revealed by femtosecond terahertz emission spectroscopy. This is enabled by sub-nanometer-precision control of thin-film thickness using wedge-shaped HM|Ni heterostructures. By employing a multi-component terahertz-emission model, we quantitatively extract the orbital MFPs, consistently finding them shorter than their spin counterparts. Furthermore, control experiments rule out interfacial orbital-to-charge conversion as the dominant mechanism, confirming that the process is governed by the bulk inverse orbital Hall effect. Our findings resolve a central controversy in orbitronics and provide key insights into orbital transport and conversion mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Line and Planar Defects with Zero Formation Free Energy: Applications of the Phase Rule toward Ripening-Immune Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended one- and two-dimensional defects in crystalline materials are usually metastable. The thermodynamic ground state of the material is presumed to be defect-free. Here, we investigate the conditions under which extended defects, such as grain boundaries, can exist in a multicomponent alloy when the latter reaches the thermodynamic ground state allowed by the Gibbs phase rule. We treat all extended defects as low-dimensional phases on the same footing as the conventional bulk phases. Thermodynamic analysis shows that, in the ground state, the formation free energies of all extended defects must be zero, and the system must follow a generalized phase rule. The latter predicts that only a finite number of symmetry-related defect types can coexist in the material in the ground state. Guided by the phase rule, we discuss finite-size polycrystalline and/or polyphase microstructures that are fully immune to coarsening and their possible transformations.</description>

      <title>Proximity-induced Rashba spin-orbit interaction in BaMnO$_\text{3}|$KTaO$_\text{3}$ heterostructure for antiferromagnetic spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic spintronics, a promising technology for ultra-fast electronic devices, faces several challenges, including the lack of materials simultaneously hosting robust antiferromagnetism and adequate Rashba-like interaction. We design a heterostructure of BaMnO$_3|$KTaO$_3$ with the idea of proximity-inducing strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction from KTaO$_3$ part to BaMnO$_3$ part, where the latter is already a robust antiferromagnet. Within our DFT calculations, the heterostructure reveals BaMnO$_3$ bands near the Fermi level with a significant magnetic moment per Mn atom and a decent ordering temperature. Further, the BaMnO$_3$ bands in the heterostructure exhibit linear Rashba interaction with a sizable Rashba coefficient, owing to its proximity to KTaO$_3$. Our work can motivate future research by demonstrating the road map to proximity-induced Rashba interaction for antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultrafast structural response of a thin iron film to sub-ps pulsed laser-induced heating has been investigated using time-resolved X-ray diffraction in the partial melting regime. A tetragonal distortion of the bcc-phase emerges at ~6 ps. Its formation is delayed relative to the initial heating (1-2 ps) and partial melting (2-5 ps) of the material, and controlled by the stress release in the quasi-instantaneously pressurized film. The distortion persists for at least 60 ps indicating the formation of a metastable bct phase between the equilibrium bcc and fcc phases.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Modeling of Vacancy-Cluster Interactions and Solute Clustering Kinetics in Multicomponent Alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prediction of solute clustering kinetics in aged multicomponent alloys requires a quantitative understanding of complex vacancy-cluster interactions across multiple scales. Here, we develop an integrated computational framework combining on-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, absorbing Markov chain models, and mesoscale cluster dynamics (CD) to investigate these interactions in Al-Mg-Zn alloys. The Markov chain model yields vacancy escape times from solute clusters and identifies a two-stage behavior of the vacancy-cluster binding energy. These binding energies are used to estimate residual vacancy concentrations in the Al matrix after quenching, which serve as critical inputs to CD simulations to predict long-term cluster evolution kinetics during natural aging. Our results quantitatively demonstrate the significant impact of quench rate on natural aging kinetics. Results provide insights to guide alloy chemistry, quench rates, and aging time at finite temperature to control the evolution of solute clusters and eventual precipitates in aged multicomponent alloys.</description>

      <title>Fermi Surface Reconstruction and Anisotropic Linear Magnetoresistance in the Charge Density Wave Topological Semimetal TaTe4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between topology and correlated electron states is central to the study of quantum materials. TaTe$_4$ is a quasi-one-dimensional charge density wave (CDW) compound predicted to host topological phases, which makes it a model platform to explore this interplay. Here, we combine high-field magnetotransport measurements with density functional theory calculations to provide a comprehensive mapping of the Fermi surface (FS) of TaTe$_4$ in its CDW phase. Using multiple current-field geometries, we resolve the four largest of six pockets of the FS predicted by theory and find no evidence of non-CDW bands, highlighting the full reconstruction of the FS in the bulk. We identify a previously unobserved quasi-cylindrical pocket and uncover a large size orbit consistent with magnetic breakdown between reconstructed FS sheets, from which we estimate a CDW gap of $\sim$0.29~eV. Moreover, we observe a robust linear magnetoresistance that persists across all field directions when current flows perpendicular to the 1D chains along which the CDW is formed, with a distinct high-field linear regime emerging when field is along the chains. These findings establish TaTe$_4$ as a prototypical material to study the coexistence of correlation-driven reconstruction and topological electronic states.</description>

      <title>Double Helix of atomic displacements in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of a "dipole spiral" structure in strained freestanding membranes, promising a route to giant electromechanical responses [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.046802}{PRL \textbf{133}, 046802 (2024)}]. However, its microscopic nature, energetic landscape, and electronic properties remain largely unexplored from a first-principles perspective. Here, using density function theory on PbTiO$_3$ under biaxial tensile strain, we unveil a novel form of polar order: a chiral, non-collinear ferroelectric double helix. We find that the Pb- and Ti-cation sublattices form two distinct, intertwined helices, reminiscent of DNA. This intricate topology is stabilized by a collective helical twisting of the oxygen octahedral framework, which mediates an emergent electric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like interaction. This unique structure, conceptualized as a "self-Moir\'e" crystal, manifests two coupled functionalities. First, it possesses a rotational pseudo-zero-energy mode that underpins a giant piezoelectric response ($e_{33}\approx$16 C/m$^2$). Second, the spiral's long-period potential fundamentally reconstructs the electronic band structure, leading to an emergent multi-valley electronic topology at the valence band edge. Our work establishes a powerful, purely physical route to designing complex chiral order and provides a unified platform where structural topology, giant electromechanical coupling, and multi-valley electronics are intrinsically linked.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied theoretically the specific heat of a large number of non-frustrated magnetic structures described by the Heisenberg model for systems with total angular momentum $J=7/2$, corresponding to the 4f$^7$ configuration of Gd$^{+3}$ and Eu$^{+2}$. For a given critical temperature (determined by the magnitude of the exchange interactions), we find that, to a high degree of accuracy, the specific heat is governed by two primary parameters: the effective number of neighbors, which dictates the extent of quantum fluctuations, and the axial anisotropy. Using these two parameters we fit the specific heat of four Gd compounds and two Eu compounds, achieving a remarkable agreement. Our work opens the possibility of describing the specific heat of 4f$^7$ systems within a general framework.</description>

      <title>CAST: Cross Attention based multimodal fusion of Structure and Text for materials property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have significantly enhanced the prediction of material properties by modeling crystal structures as graphs. However, GNNs often struggle to capture global structural characteristics, such as crystal systems, limiting their predictive performance. To overcome this issue, we propose CAST, a cross-attention-based multimodal model that integrates graph representations with textual descriptions of materials, effectively preserving critical structural and compositional information. Unlike previous approaches, such as CrysMMNet and MultiMat, which rely on aggregated material-level embeddings, CAST leverages cross-attention mechanisms to combine fine-grained graph node-level and text token-level features. Additionally, we introduce a masked node prediction pretraining strategy that further enhances the alignment between node and text embeddings. Our experimental results demonstrate that CAST outperforms existing baseline models across four key material properties-formation energy, band gap, bulk modulus, and shear modulus-with average relative MAE improvements ranging from 10.2% to 35.7%. Analysis of attention maps confirms the importance of pretraining in effectively aligning multimodal representations. This study underscores the potential of multimodal learning frameworks for developing more accurate and globally informed predictive models in materials science.</description>

      <title>Predicted versatile topological nodal magnons in Tb-based icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a recently-established band representation analysis, we discover two distinct types of topological nodal magnons in the real-space antiferroic ordering of whirling spin arrangements in the Tb-based icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants, both of which originate from a composite band (co-)representation $A\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(24)$ and its constituent elementary band representations. The first type is doubly-degenerate nodal line network and nodal planes associated with two-dimensional irreducible band representation, while the second type is a nodal line network due to accidental band inversions. Since our analysis, which relies solely on magnetocrystalline symmetry, is valid for a wide range of materials and spin textures belonging to the same magnetic space group irrespective of composition, these findings offer new universal insights into the research of Tb-based quasicrystal approximants as well as a contribution to broadening the range of topological magnon-hosting materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately identifying the synthesis conditions of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is essential for guiding experimental design, yet remains challenging because relevant information in the literature is often scattered, inconsistent, and difficult to interpret. We present MOFh6, a large language model driven system that reads raw articles or crystal codes and converts them into standardized synthesis tables. It links related descriptions across paragraphs, unifies ligand abbreviations with full names, and outputs structured parameters ready for use. MOFh6 achieved 99% extraction accuracy, resolved 94.1% of abbreviation cases across five major publishers, and maintained a precision of 0.93 +/- 0.01. Processing a full text takes 9.6 s, locating synthesis descriptions 36 s, with 100 papers processed for USD 4.24. By replacing static database lookups with real-time extraction, MOFh6 reshapes MOF synthesis research, accelerating the conversion of literature knowledge into practical synthesis protocols and enabling scalable, data-driven materials discovery.</description>

Abstract: The dielectric permittivity of liquid water is a fundamental property that underlies its distinctive behaviors in numerious physical, biological, and chemical processes. Within a machine learning framework, we present a unified approach to compute the dielectric permittivity of water, systematically incorporating various electric boundary conditions. Our method employs a long-range-inclusive deep potential trained on data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. Dielectric response is evaluated using an auxiliary deep neural network that predicts the centers of maximally localized Wannier functions. We investigate three types of electric boundary conditions--metallic, insulating, and Kirkwood-Frohlich--to assess their influence on correlated dipole fluctuations and dielectric relaxation dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate a consistent methodology for computing the Kirkwood correlation factor, correlation length, and dielectric permittivity under each boundary condition, where long-range electrostatics play a critical role. This work establishes a robust and generalizable machine-learning framework for modeling the dielectric properties of polar liquids under diverse electrostatic environments.</description>
