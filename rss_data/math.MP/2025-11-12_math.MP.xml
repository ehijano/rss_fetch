      <title>A ballistic upper bound on the accumulation of bosonic on-site energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study transport properties of the dynamics generated by translation-invariant and possibly long-ranged Hamiltonians of Bose-Hubbard type. For translation-invariant initial states with controlled boson density, we improve the known bound on the local repulsive energy at time $t$ from $\langle n^2_x\rangle_t\lesssim t^{2d}$ to $\langle n^2_x\rangle_t\lesssim t^d$. This shows that bosonic on-site energies accumulate at most ballistically. Extending the result to higher moments would have powerful implications for bosonic Lieb-Robinson bounds. While previous approaches focused on controlling particle transport, our proof develops novel ASTLOs (adiabatic space-time localization observables) that are able to track the growth of local boson-boson correlations.</description>

      <title>Analytical estimations of edge states and extended states in large finite-size lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence, one of the most significant features of topological matter, theoretically connects the existence of edge modes at the boundary with topological invariants of the bulk spectral bands. However, it remains unspecified in realistic examples how large the size of a lattice should be for the correspondence to take effect. In this work, we employ the diatomic chain model to introduce an analytical framework to characterize the dependence of edge states on the lattice size and boundary conditions. In particular, we apply asymptotic estimates to examine the bulk-boundary correspondence in long diatomic chains as well as reveal the finite-size regimes where it fails. Moreover, under our framework the eigenfrequencies near the band edges can be well approximated where two special patterns are detected. These estimates on edge states and eigenfrequencies in linear diatomic chains can be further extended to nonlinear chains to investigate the emergence of new nonlinear edge states and other nonlinear localized states. In addition to one-dimensional diatomic chains, examples of more complicated and higher-dimensional lattices are provided to show the universality of our analytical framework.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Time-Varying Perturbed Quantum Systems via Reduced Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical applications, quantum systems are inevitably subject to significant uncertainties, including unknown initial states, imprecise physical parameters, and unmodeled environmental noise, all of which pose major challenges to robust quantum feedback control. This paper proposes a feedback stabilization strategy based on a reduced quantum filter that achieves robustness against time-varying Hamiltonian perturbations and additional dissipative effects, without requiring prior knowledge of the initial state or exact system parameters. The proposed filter estimates only O(N) real variables corresponding to the diagonal elements of the system density matrix in a quantum non-demolition basis in contrast to the O(N^2) variables required by a full stochastic master equation, where N is the Hilbert space dimension. This dimensionality reduction substantially simplifies real-time computation and feedback implementation while preserving both convergence and robustness guarantees. Rigorous analysis further establishes global exponential stability of the target subspace. The results provide a scalable framework for robust and efficient measurement-based feedback control applicable to high-dimensional perturbed open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling Relations For The CLG's Critical Exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider, in any dimension, the constrained lattice gas introduced by Rossi et al., which is an exclusion process on a d-dimensional lattice following the additional constraint that only particles with at least one occupied neighbour can jump. In dimension d &gt; 2, this model features self-organized criticality at some critical density of particles. Numerical simulations predict the existence of scaling exponents close to criticality, and several relations can be derived between these exponents. The goal of this article is to give a mathematical framework for these relations, which have been numerically established in a companion article.</description>

      <title>Elementary commutator method for the Dirac equation with long-range perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present direct and elementary commutator techniques for the Dirac equation with long-range electric and mass perturbations. The main results are absence of generalized eigenfunctions and locally uniform resolvent estimates, both in terms of the optimal Besov-type spaces. With an additional massless assumption, we also obtain an algebraic radiation condition of projection type. For their proofs, following the scheme of Ito-Skibsted, we adopt, along with various weight functions, the generator of radial translations as conjugate operator, and avoid any of advanced functional analysis, pseudodifferential calculus, or even reduction to the Schr\"odinger equation. The results of the paper would serve as a foundation for the stationary scattering theory of the Dirac operator.</description>

      <title>Geometric Categories for Continuous Gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified categorical framework which encodes gauging of continuous and finite symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimension. We show that electric symmetry breaking, resulting from the addition of charged matter, is implemented by this gauging procedure, and identify electric and magnetic symmetries expected in $G$-gauge theory. We work with geometric categories, i.e. categories internal to stacks. This allows us to extend (de)equivariantization of fusion categories to continuous groups, construct a functorial SymTFT and boundaries for this theory, and compute the relevant categories of endomorphisms and Drinfeld centers.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Weighted Integrability of Vector Fields with Jacobi Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate analytic divergence-free vector fields and vector fields admitting a Jacobi multiplier on $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. We first introduce a functional acting on the space of divergence-free vector fields that quantifies the fraction of the manifold foliated by ergodic invariant tori, and establish a Kolmogorov--Arnold--Moser (KAM) type theorem for such systems. We prove that this functional is continuous at analytic, nondegenerate, Arnold--integrable divergence-free vector fields with respect to the $C^{\omega}$ topology, and analyze the persistence and breakdown of invariant $(n-1)$-dimensional tori under small perturbations.
  Extending this framework, we study vector fields possessing Jacobi multipliers, which generalize divergence-free fields by preserving a weighted volume form $d\mu_{\rho}=\rho\,\Omega$. We derive the local structure of their symmetry fields and show that, under suitable nondegeneracy and resonance conditions, every symmetry must be tangent to the invariant tori. We then define the \emph{weighted partial integrability functional} $m_{\rho}(V)$, measuring the weighted fraction of phase space occupied by quasi-integrable invariant tori of a vector field satisfying $\operatorname{div}(\rho V)=0$. Finally, we develop a numerical algorithm based on finite-time Lyapunov exponents to compute $m_{\rho}(V)$, and illustrate its behavior on a weighted nonlinear divergence-free system, showing the transition from integrable to partially integrable and irregular regimes as the nonlinear parameter $\alpha$ increases.</description>

      <title>The central heat trace on large compact classical groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the large-$N$ asymptotic expansion of the (central) trace of the heat kernel on any compact classical group $G_N\subset\mathrm{GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$, which extends a previous result known only for $\mathrm{U}(N)$ \cite{LM2}. It admits two new interpretations of the trace: in terms of ramified coverings of the torus, and Gromov-Witten invariants on elliptic curves. These connections allow us to explore several aspects of the gauge/string duality in two dimensions: a Yang-Mills/Hurwitz duality, and Yang-Mills/Gromov-Witten duality.</description>

      <title>Integrable Contour Kernels in Discrete $\beta=1,4$ Ensembles, Universality and Kuznetsov Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain explicit double-contour representations for the correlation kernels of the discrete orthogonal ($\beta=1$) and symplectic ($\beta=4$) random matrix ensembles with Meixner, Charlier, and Krawtchouk weights. A single Cauchy--difference--quotient composition identity expresses all $\beta=1,4$ blocks in terms of the projection kernel and bounded rational multipliers. From these formulas we give short steepest-descent proofs of bulk and edge universality (sine/Airy/Bessel) with uniform error control, an explicit Meixner$\to$Laguerre hard-edge crossover, and a first $A^{-1}$ correction that follows directly from the integrable structure. Finally, we show that Archimedean Kuznetsov tests splice into the Pfaffian kernels by a bounded holomorphic symbol acting in the contour variable; the symbol enters only through the same Cauchy difference--quotient, so the leading sine/Airy/Bessel limits persist and the $A^{-1}$ term again comes from linearizing at the saddle(s).</description>

      <title>Stacking and the triviality of invertible phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the superselection sectors of two quantum lattice systems stacked onto each other in the operator algebraic framework. We show in particular that all irreducible sectors of a stacked system are unitarily equivalent to a product of irreducible sectors of the factors. This naturally leads to a faithful functor between the categories for each system and the category of the stacked system. We construct an intermediate `product' category which we then show is equivalent to the stacked system category. As a consequence, the sectors associated with an invertible state are trivial, namely, invertible states support no anyonic quasi-particles.</description>

      <title>Soliton dynamics and stability in the ABS spinor model with a PT-symmetric periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects on solitons dynamics of introducing a
  PT-symmetric complex potential in a specific family of the cubic Dirac equation in (1+1)-dimensions, called the ABS model. The potential is introduced taking advantage of the fact that the nonlinear Dirac equation admits a Lagrangian formalism. As a consequence, the imaginary part of the potential, associated with gains and losses, behaves as a spatially periodic damping (changing from positive to negative, and back) that acts at the same time on the two spinor components. A collective coordinates theory is developed by making an ansatz for a moving soliton where the position, rapidity, momentum, frequency, and phase are all functions of time. We consider the complex potential as a perturbation and verify that numerical solutions of the equation of motions for the collective coordinates are in agreement with simulations of the nonlinear Dirac equation. The main effect of the imaginary part of the potencial is to induce oscillations in the charge and energy (they are conserved for real potentials) with the same frequency and phase as the momentum. We find long-lived solitons even with very large charge and energy oscillations. Additionally, we extend to the nonlinear Dirac equation an empirical stability criterion, previously employed successfully in the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Theoretical analysis of a two-dimensional bilayer convection-diffusion-reaction-source problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the two-dimensional thermal behavior of a bilayer medium subject to both internal and external heat sources. The model incorporates diffusion, advection, and temperature-dependent volumetric heat generation or absorption in each layer, as well as general convective conditions on the external boundaries. The influence of interfacial thermal resistance between the two materials is also considered. An analytical solution is developed using Fourier-based techniques, and a stable and convergent finite difference method is proposed to analyze particular scenarios. The theoretical results are validated against known solutions and numerical simulations, demonstrating consistency with the expected physical behavior. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of heat transfer phenomena in layered systems and offer potential insights for optimizing thermal performance in engineering applications involving composite materials.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity of the integrated density of states for quasi-periodic Jacobi block matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove H\"older continuity of the integrated density of states for discrete quasiperiodic Jacobi $d\times d$ block matrices with Diophantine frequencies. The H\"older exponent is shown to be any $\beta$ such that $0&lt;\beta&lt;1/(2\kappa^d)$, where $\kappa^d$ is the acceleration, i.e., the slope of the sum of the top $d$ Lyapunov exponents in the imaginary direction of the phase. This generalizes the H\"older continuity results in the Schr\"odinger operator setting in \cites{GS2,HS1}, and also strengthens them in that setting by covering more Diophantine frequencies. The proof is built on a new scheme for obtaining a local zero count for finite-volume characteristic polynomials from a global one.</description>

      <title>Random initial data and average shock time in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain with long-wavelength random initial data. When the energy per particle is small, thermal equilibrium is not reached on a fast timescale and the system enters prethermalization. The formation of the prethermal state is characterized by the development of a Burgers-type shock and the onset of a turbulent-like spectrum with a time dependent exponent $\zeta(t)$ in the inertial range. We perform a significant step forward by demonstrating that these features are robust under generic long-wavelength random initial conditions. By employing advanced probabilistic techniques inspired by the works of Dudley and Talagrand, we derive a sharp asymptotic expression for the average shock time in the thermodynamic limit. For large $p$, this time scales as $(p \sqrt{\log p})^{-1}$, where $p$ is the number of excited modes proving that it is an intensive quantity up to a logarithmic correction in the size of the system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Beem's three completeness notions -- finite compactness, timelike Cauchy completeness, and Condition A -- originally defined for spacetimes, to Lorentzian length spaces and study their relationships.
  We prove that finite compactness implies timelike Cauchy completeness and that
  timelike Cauchy completeness implies Condition A for globally hyperbolic Lorentzian length spaces.
  Furthermore, for globally hyperbolic $C^{1}$-spacetimes under suitable assumptions
  ensuring good behavior of causal geodesics, we show that the three conditions are equivalent.
  These results can be regarded as a Hopf-Rinow type theorem for low-regularity Lorentzian geometry.
  The appendix presents examples of $C^{1}$-spacetimes -- where geodesic uniqueness may fail -- in which causal geodesics nevertheless behave well, illustrating the scope of our results.</description>

      <title>Measuring FPUT thermalization with Toda integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the ergodic properties of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou-$\alpha$ model for generic initial conditions using a Toda integral. It serves as an adiabatic invariant for the system and a suitable observable to measure its equilibrium time. Over this timescale, the onset of action diffusion results in ergodic temporal fluctuations. We compare this timescale with the inverse of the maximum Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ and its saturation time, which are systematically shorter. The Toda integral ergodization/equilibrium time is system size independent for long chains, but show dramatic growth when the system size is smaller than a critical one, whose value depends on the energy density. We measure the dependence of energy density on the critical system size and relate this observation to the possible emergence of a Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser regime. We numerically determine the critical energy density of this regime, finding that it approximately decays as $1/N^2$ with the number of particles N.</description>

      <title>Spectral torsion of the internal noncommutative geometry of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the nonvanishing spectral torsion functional of the internal part of the noncommutative geometry behind the Standard Model. We show that with a suitable modification of the usual differential graded calculus it matches an analogous functional constructed in terms of the connection. We study also the impact of the torsion on the other spectral fuctionals, which correspond to geometric invariants such as volume integral, metric and Einstein tensors, and scalar curvature. We discuss the impact of the SM Yukawa couplings and the Majorana mass matrix on our results.</description>

      <title>Khovanov--Rozansky matrix factorization reduction for bipartite links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Khovanov-Rozansky (KR) link polynomial is a certain $t$-deformation of Wilson loops in 3-dimensional $SU(N)$ Chern--Simons topological field theory, believed to be an observable in the refined Chern-Simons theory, probably described in terms of 4d or 5d QFT and related by a certain procedure to the triply-graded link superpolynomial. This link invariant was originally introduced by M. Khovanov and L. Rozansky through a sophisticated matrix factorization technique based on the bicomplex structure, which depends on entire link diagrams and rapidly increases in complexity with the growth of a link. However, for particular link diagrams a local reduction is possible, allowing to eliminate vertices in a regular way, and thus, simplifying the KR polynomial and making it as simple as the Khovanov polynomial in the $N=2$ case. In particular, for a distinguished family of bipartite links, matrix factorization defined on MOY diagrams reduces just to planar cycles - very similar to the original Kauffman-Khovanov construction at $N=2$ for the Jones polynomial and its $t$-deformation. In the bipartite case, this can be done for any $N$. We make a further step of simplification and reduce from cohomology factor-rings in even variables crucially depending on a MOY diagram to vector spaces spanned by odd variables, so that the initial bicomplex of matrix factorizations becomes a monocomplex of just tensor products of $N$-dimensional vector spaces. We also find the explicit form of three universal morphisms which were guessed in a recent paper on this subject. Universality means independence of the other edges of the diagram, and we explain why this works in this particular case.</description>

      <title>Numerical Approaches for Identifying the Time-Dependent Potential Coefficient in the Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the inverse problem of identifying a time-dependent potential coefficient in a one-dimensional diffusion equation subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions and a nonlocal integral overdetermination constraint reflecting spatially averaged measurements. After establishing well-posedness for the forward problem and deriving an a priori estimate that ensures uniqueness and continuous dependence on the data, we prove existence and uniqueness for the inverse problem. To compute numerically the unknown coefficient, we propose and compare three numerical methods: an integration-based scheme, a Newton-Raphson iterative solver, and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). Numerical experiments on both exact and noisy data demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of each approach.</description>

      <title>Harmonic maps into principal bundles and generalized magnetic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study harmonic mappings from a Riemannian manifold $N$ into a principal $G$-bundle $P$ endowed with a $G$-invariant Riemannian metric (i.e. a Kaluza-Klein metric). These morphisms are called Kaluza-Klein harmonic maps and naturally lead to the notion of generalized magnetic maps for an arbitrary gauge group $G$, which are just their projections onto the base manifold of $P$ and might provide a geometric formulation for the magnetic interaction of extended objects modelled by $N$ under the action of a generalized Lorentz force. We provide a characterization of Kaluza-Klein harmonic maps and show that the space of generalized magnetic maps is a quotient of the space of Kaluza-Klein harmonic maps under an equivalence relation generated by an appropriate gauge group. We establish a necessary condition that they must satisfy, the gauge variation formula and the harmonic gauge fixing equation, also providing a main existence theorem for them. After analyzing how they are influenced by the geometry of the fibers of the principal bundle, we construct several instances of generalized magnetic maps, including two non-trivial one-parameter families of examples based on $\alpha$-twisted spherical harmonic immersions with values in the complex $S^{3}\longrightarrow S^{2}$ and quaternionic $S^{7}\longrightarrow S^{4}$ Hopf fibrations, proving that among them the unique uncharged ones are the standard Clifford torus and the standard spherical harmonic immersion of $ S^3\times S^3$ into $S^7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present exact evaluations of superconformal indices for 4d N =1 and N =2 pure Super Yang-Mills theories with arbitrary simple gauge group G. Our approach applies the Macdonald identities for untwisted affine Lie algebras to the integral formulas of the indices, yielding uniform closed formulas valid for all G, expressed both as q-series and as eta-quotients, related through specialized Macdonald identities. Using similar techniques, we also derive exact expressions for half Schur indices with Neumann boundary conditions and uncover a bilinear structure of the full Schur index. Within the framework of holomorphic-topological twists, we further explore connections to the category of line operators, the K-theoretical Coulomb branch, Schur quantization, IR formulas for the BPS spectrum, and class S constructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review our joint work on the scaling limits of disordered systems, linking the notion of disorder relevance/irrelevance to that of sub/super-criticality of singular SPDEs. This line of research culminated in the construction of the Critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF), a universal process which provides a non-trivial solution to the Stochastic Heat Equation in dimension 2, a critical singular SPDE that lies beyond the reach of existing solution theories. The SHF also offers a rare example of a non-Gaussian scaling limit for a disordered system at its phase transition point in the critical dimension.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue and pseudospectrum processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with rank 1 perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08129v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two kinds of matrix-valued dynamical processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with the additive rank 1 perturbations $\delta J$, where $\delta \in {\mathbb{C}}$ and $J$ is the all-ones matrix. For each process, first we report the complicated motion of the numerically obtained eigenvalues. Then we derive the specific equation which determines the motion of non-zero simple eigenvalues and clarifies the time-dependence of degeneracy of the zero-eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Comparison with the solutions of this equation, it is concluded that the numerically observed non-zero eigenvalues distributing around $\lambda_0$ are the exact eigenvalues not of the original system, but of the system perturbed by uncontrolled rounding errors of computer. The complex domain in which the eigenvalues of randomly perturbed system are distributed is identified with the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$ of the original system with $\delta J$. We characterize the pseudospectrum processes using the symbol curves of the corresponding nonnormal Toeplitz operators without $\delta J$. We report new phenomena in our second model such that at each time the outermost closed simple curve cut out from the symbol curve is realized as the exact eigenvalues, but the inner part of symbol curve is reduced in size and embedded in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Such separation of exact simple eigenvalues and a degenerated eigenvalue associated with pseudospectrum will be meaningful for numerical analysis, since the former is stable and robust, but the latter is highly sensitive and unstable with respective to perturbations. The present study will be related to the pseudospectra approaches to non-Hermitian systems developed in quantum physics</description>

      <title>Generalized Eigenspaces and Pseudospectra of Nonnormal and Defective Matrix-Valued Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider nonnormal matrix-valued dynamical systems with discrete time. For an eigenvalue of matrix, the number of times it appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial is called the algebraic multiplicity. On the other hand, the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the linear space of eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue. If the former exceeds the latter, then the eigenvalue is said to be defective and the matrix becomes nondiagonalizable by any similarity transformation. The discrete-time of our dynamics is identified with the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Its algebraic multiplicity takes about half of the matrix size at $t=1$ and increases stepwise in time, which keeps excess to the geometric multiplicity until their coincidence at the final time. Our model exhibits relaxation processes from far-from-normal to near-normal matrices, in which the defectivity of $\lambda_0$ is recovering in time. We show that such processes are realized as size reductions of pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Here the pseudospectra are the domains on the complex plane which are not necessarily exact spectra but in which the resolvent of matrix takes extremely large values. The defective eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ is sensitive to perturbation and the eigenvalues of the perturbed systems are distributed densely in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. By constructing generalized eigenspace for $\lambda_0$, we give the Jordan block decomposition for the resolvent of matrix and characterize the pseudospectrum dynamics. Numerical study of the systems perturbed by Gaussian random matrices supports the validity of the present analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14008v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $Q$ be an arbitrary finite quiver. We use nonabelian stable envelopes to relate representations of the Maulik-Okounkov Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ to representations of the BPS Lie algebra associated to the tripled quiver $\tilde Q$ with its canonical potential. We use this comparison to provide an isomorphism between the Maulik-Okounkov Lie algebra and the BPS Lie algebra. Via this isomorphism we prove Okounkov's conjecture, equating the graded dimensions of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ with the coefficients of Kac polynomials. Via general results regarding cohomological Hall algebras in dimensions two and three we furthermore give a complete description of $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ as a generalised Kac-Moody Lie algebra with Cartan datum given by intersection cohomology of singular Nakajima quiver varieties, and prove a conjecture of Maulik and Okounkov, stating that their Lie algebra is obtained from a Lie algebra defined over the rationals, by extension of scalars. Finally, we explain how our results suggest the correct definition of critical stable envelopes in vanishing cycle cohomology.</description>

Abstract: The three-manifold topological invariants $\hat Z$ capture the half-index of the three-dimensional theory with ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ supersymmetry obtained by compactifying the M5 brane theory on the closed three-manifold. In 2019, surprising general relations between the $\hat Z$-invariants, quantum modular forms, and vertex algebras have been proposed. In the meanwhile, an extensive array of examples have been studied, but several important general structural questions remain. First, for many three-manifolds we have seen hints of concrete $\widetilde {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ representations underlying the different $\hat Z$-invariants of the given manifolds. At the same time, these invariants appear to only span a subspace of the representation, and the role of the latter remains mysterious. We elucidate the meaning of the modular group representation, realized as vector-valued quantum modular forms, by first proposing the analogue $\hat Z$-invariants with supersymmetric defects, and subsequently showing that the full vector-valued quantum modular form for $\widetilde {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ is precisely the object capturing all the $\hat Z$-invariants of a given three-manifold, when the newly defined defects $\hat Z$-invariants are included. Second, it was expected that matching radial limits is a key feature of $\hat Z$-invariants when changing the orientation of the plumbed three-manifold, suggesting the relevance of mock modularity. We substantiate the conjecture by providing explicit proposals for such $\hat Z$-invariants for three three-manifolds and verify their mock modularity and limits. Third, we initiate the study of the vertex algebra structure of the mock type invariants by showcasing a systematic way to construct cone vertex operator algebras associated to these mock invariants, which can be viewed as the partner of logarithmic vertex operator algebras in this context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to study noncommutative geometry using the language of categories of sheaves of algebras with polynomial identities and their properties, introducing new (graded) noncommutative geometries, which include, for example, the following algebras: superalgebras, $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded superalgebras, Azumaya algebras, Clifford and quaternion algebras, the algebra of upper triangular matrices, quantum groups at roots of unity, and also some NC-schemes. More precisely, fix a group $G$, a $G$-graded associative algebra $A$ over a field $F$ of characteristic 0 and a topological space $X$; we construct a locally $G$-graded ringed space structure on $X$, where the sheaf structure belongs to the $G$-graded variety $\text{G-var}(A)$ of algebras generated by $A$, which classify all geometric spaces that belong to $\text{G-var}(A)$. We study conditions to compare two geometries in a (graded) Morita context, as well as their corresponding differential calculi.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new construction of vertex algebras using the Deligne category. This approach provides a rigorous framework for defining the so-called large $N$ vertex algebra, which has appeared in recent physics literatures. We first define the notion of a vertex algebra in a symmetric monoidal category and extend familiar constructions in ordinary vertex algebras to this broader categorical context. As an application, we consider a $\beta\gamma$ vertex algebra in the Deligne category and construct the large N vertex algebra from it. We study some simple properties of this vertex algebra and analyze a certain vertex Poisson algebra limit.</description>

Abstract: Many networks in nature and applications have an approximate low-rank structure in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks would also be low-dimensional. Indeed, theoretical results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or input. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. Here, we study the dimensionality of dynamics in recurrent networks with low-dimensional structure driven by high-dimensional inputs or perturbations. We find that dynamics in such networks can be high- or low-dimensional and we derive novel, precise conditions on the network structure under which dynamics are high-dimensional. In many low-rank networks, dynamics are suppressed in directions aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term ``low-rank suppression.'' We show that several low-rank network structures arising in nature satisfy the conditions for generating high-dimensional dynamics and low-rank suppression. Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a recurrent network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17326v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a relation between the quantum corner VOA $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, which can be regarded as a generalization of quantum $W_N$ algebra, and Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials. We demonstrate precisely that, under a specific map, the correlation functions of the currents of $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, coincide with the Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>Barrier relaxations of the classical and quantum optimal transport problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last fifteen years a significant progress was achieved by considering an entropic relaxation of the classical multi-partite optimal transport problem (MPOTP). The entropic relaxation gives rise to the rescaling problem of a given tensor. This rescaling can be achieved fast with the Sinkhorn type algorithms. Recently, it was shown that a similar approach works for the quantum MPOTP. However, the analog of the rescaling Sinkhorn algorithm is much more complicated than in the classical MPOTP. In this paper we show that the interior point method (IPM) for the primary and dual problems of classical and quantum MPOTP problems can be considered as barrier relaxations of the optimal transport problems (OTP). It is well known that the dual of the OTP are advantageous as it has much less variables than the primary problem. The IPM for the dual problem of the classical MPOTP are not as fast as the Sinkhorn type algorithm. However, IPM method for the dual of the quantum MPOTP seems to work quite efficiently.</description>

      <title>Free field construction of Heterotic string compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type in the Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01068v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterotic string models in $4$-dimensions are the hybrid theories of a left-moving $N=1$ fermionic string whose additional $6$-dimensions are compactified on a $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and a right-moving bosonic string, whose additional dimensions are also compactified on $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and the remaining $13$ dimensions compactified on the torus of $E(8)\times SO(10)$ Lie algebra.
  The important class of exactly solvable Heterotic string models considered earlier by D. Gepner corresponds to the products of $N=2$ minimal models with the total central charge $c=9$. These models are known to describe Heterotic string models compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds, which belong a special subclass of general CY manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type. We generalize this construction to all cases of compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds of general Berglund-Hubsch type, using Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach. In particular, starting from the mirror pair of Batyrev lattices corresponding to a given CY manifold, we construct vertex operators of the complete physical theory as cohomology of Borisov differentials that correspond to points of reflexive Batyrev polyhedra. In particular, we show how the number of $27$, $\overline{27}$ and Singlet representations of $E(6)$ is determined by the data of reflexive Batyrev polytope that determines this CY-manifold.</description>

      <title>Edge Universality for Inhomogeneous Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider symmetric and Hermitian random matrices whose entries are independent and symmetric random variables with an arbitrary variance pattern. Under a novel Short-to-Long Mixing condition, which is sharp in the sense that it precludes a corrected shift at the spectral edge, we establish GOE/GUE edge universality for such inhomogeneous random matrices. This condition effectively reduces the universality problem to verifying the mixing properties of a random walk governed by the variance profile matrix.
  Our universality results are applicable to a remarkably broad class of random matrix ensembles that may be highly inhomogeneous, sparse, or far beyond the mean-field setting of classical random matrix theory. Notable examples include:
  1. Inhomogeneous Wishart-type random matrices;
  2. Random band matrices whose entries are independent random variables with general variance profile, particularly with an optimal bandwidth in dimensions $d \le 2$;
  3. Sparse random matrices with structured variance profiles;
  4. Generalized Wigner matrices under significantly weaker sparsity constraints and heavy-tailed entry distributions;
  5. Wegner orbital models under sharp mixing assumptions;
  6. Random 2-lifts of random $d$-regular graphs where $d\geq N^{2/3+\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Carnot limit: work extraction via an entropy battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heat is a physical manifestation of entropy, where the removal of entropy from a thermal energy reservoir permits the conversion of heat into work. This entropy transfer is facilitated by the cold thermal energy reservoir in typical heat engines. Recent developments in quantum heat engines that operate between thermal energy and spin angular momentum reservoirs show that it is possible to transfer entropy out of energy and into a different conserved quantity. The implications of this type of entropy transfer have not been fully explored, especially on the work extractable using an ensemble with multiple conserved quantities. Using the aforementioned heat engines, we show that such an ensemble will transform heat into work beyond the Carnot efficiency limit while operating at maximum power. This result is obtained without induced quantum coherence, a technique commonly used in the field of quantum heat engines to achieve the same outcome. Without loss of generality, we also show that thermal spin reservoirs behave as thermodynamic baths with well-defined temperatures, heat capacities, and fluctuation-dissipation relations. Finally, our analysis of entropy capacity suggests that particle indistinguishability is necessary for inter-particle interactions, and for entropy to transfer between canonical ensembles. These results establish a foundation for entropy-based quantum devices that extract work from a hot thermal energy reservoir more efficiently than possible with a cold thermal energy reservoir. These devices also act as high energy-density batteries and efficient heat storage systems. Our results will have implications for quantum heat engines, spinor condenstates, spintronics, and quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>From Quantum Relative Entropy to the Semiclassical Einstein Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide arguments indicating that the semiclassical Einstein equations follow from quantum relative entropy and its proportionality to an area variation. Using modular theory, we establish that the relative entropy between the vacuum state and coherent excitations of a scalar quantum field on a bifurcate Killing horizon is given by the energy flux across the horizon. Under the assumption of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area formula, this energy flux is proportional to a variation in the surface area of the horizon cross section. The semiclassical Einstein equations follow automatically from this identification. Our approach provides a quantum field theoretic generalization of Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of the Einstein equations, replacing classical thermodynamic entropy with the well-defined quantum relative (Araki-Uhlmann) entropy. This suggests that quantum information plays a central role in what is often seen as a zeroth order approximation of a theory of quantum gravity, namely quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I define topological twists of supersymmetric field theories in the case when the supercharges involved obey an ``open'' algebra. Using the Batalin-Vilkovisky field-antifield formalism, I construct twisted theories algorithmically from the supersymmetry data, and explain supersymmetric localisation in terms of anticanonical transformations. I also treat equivariant topological twists and explain how BV observables contain the equivariant cohomology of the space of histories. Some results are generalised to theories with two topological supercharges -- such as the ``balanced'' topological field theories of Dijkgraaf and Moore -- using the geometry of ``differential gorms'' of Kochan and \v{S}evera. Finally, I exhibit examples of these constructions, including a $\mathrm{U}(1)$-equivariant topological B-model.</description>

      <title>Index theory for singular Lagrangian systems and Bessel-type differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of the present manuscript is to develop an index theory for singular Lagrangian systems, with a particular focus on the important class of singular operators given by Bessel type differential operators. The main motivation is to address several challenges posed by singular operators, which appear in a wide range of applications: celestial mechanics (for instance, perturbations in planetary motion), oscillatory systems with time dependent forcing, electromagnetism (such as wave equations in nonuniform media), and quantum mechanics (notably certain Schroedinger equations with periodic potentials).
  We pursue two principal objectives. First, we establish a spectral flow formula and a Morse Index Theorem for gap-continuous paths of singular Sturm Liouville operators. By means of these index formulas, we construct a Morse index theory for a broad class of Bessel type differential operators and apply it to a family of asymptotic solutions of the gravitational n body problem.
  Finally, our new index theory provides new insight into a phenomenon first observed by Rellich concerning the spectrum of one-parameter families of Sturm Liouville operators with varying domains.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative dyonic black holes sourced by nonlinear electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first-order noncommutative (NC) corrections to the general nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) Lagrangian depending on two electromagnetic invariants. The NC deformation of Einstein-NLE theory is implemented using the $\partial_t\wedge\partial_\varphi$ Drinfel'd twist and the NC effects are encoded in the matter sector through the Seiberg-Witten map. The resulting equations of motion reflect two distinct sources of nonlinearity in this framework; one arising from replacing Maxwell's electrodynamics with its nonlinear modifications and another from the NC deformations. Assuming a general form of static, spherically symmetric dyonic black hole as a seed solution in the commutative limit, we solve the equations of motion perturbatively to the first order in the NC parameter $a$. Finally, we evaluate the obtained corrections to the metric tensor and gauge potential for several prominent NLE theories.</description>

      <title>Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop groups and Drinfeld double of preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the following results: Given the Drinfeld double $\mathcal{A}^{ext}_{Q}$ of the localised preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+}_{Q}$ of quiver type $Q$ with the Cartan elements, there is a $\mathbb{Q}(q,t_e)_{e\in E}$-Hopf algebra isomorphism between $\mathcal{A}^{ext}_{Q}$ and the localised Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop group $U^{MO}_{q}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$ of quiver type $Q$. Moreover, we prove the isomorphism of $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1},t_{e}^{\pm1}]_{e\in E}$-algebras between the negative half of the integral Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop group $U_{q}^{MO,-,\mathbb{Z}}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$ with the opposite algebra of the integral nilpotent $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+,nilp,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q}$ of the same quiver type $Q$. As a result, one can identify the universal $R$-matrix for the root subalgebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{m},w}$ of the slope subalgebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbf{m}}$ in $\mathcal{A}^{ext}_{Q}$ with the wall $R$-matrix of the wall subalgebra $U_{q}^{MO}(\mathfrak{g}_{w})$ in $U^{MO}_{q}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$.
  Moreover, under the integrality conjecture for the integral preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q}$, we prove the isomorphism of $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1},t_{e}^{\pm1}]_{e\in E}$-algebras between the positive half of the integral Maulik-Okounkov quantum loop group $U_{q}^{MO,+,\mathbb{Z}}(\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{Q})$ with the integral preprojective $K$-theoretic Hall algebra $\mathcal{A}^{+,\mathbb{Z}}_{Q}$ of the same quiver type $Q$.</description>

      <title>Explicit Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff Radii in Special Banach--Malcev Algebras of Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish explicit convergence radii for the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff (BCH) series in special Banach--Malcev algebras of shifts-those embeddable into a Banach alternative algebra. Under the continuity estimate $\|[x,y]\|\leq B\|x\|\|y\|$, the series converges absolutely whenever $B(\|x\|+\|y\|)&lt;1/(4K)$, where $K\geq1$ bounds the absolute BCH coefficients. The constant $1/(4K)$ stems from a Catalan-number majorization and is sharp in the exponential-weight model. We compute $B$ explicitly for operator, exponential, polynomial, damped, and tree-like shift algebras, including the non-Lie split-octonionic (Zorn) algebra ($B=2$, $\rho=1/(8K)$). All results require the speciality assumption; the framework does not apply to general Malcev algebras. Geometrically, $\rho=1/(4KB)$ is the analyticity radius of the induced Moufang loop; numerically, it governs stability of BCH-type integrators.</description>
