      <title>Cladding effect on the mode index engineered tuned cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits require a cladding material on top to prevent any outside interaction with the photonic circuit elements and electromagnetic modes that could cause damage. Mohit et al. proposed selective tuning of the resonance of a cavity by using the mode-index engineering method. However, their work did not consider adding a cladding (upper cladding) material on top of the tuned cavity. In this study, I aim to build upon their work by investigating the impact of depositing cladding material on the frequency distribution of tuned cavities through analytical studies and numerical experiments. I identify crucial calculation parameters and discuss the optimum conditions for high-resolution tuning and large tuning range.</description>

      <title>Multiorbital effects in high-order harmonic emission from CO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ellipticity of high-order harmonics emitted from CO$_2$ molecule driven by linearly polarized laser fields using numerical simulations within the time-dependent density functional theory. We find that the overall ellipticity of the harmonics is small, which is in agreement with experimental data. On the other hand, our analysis of the numerical results indicates that several valence orbitals contribute significantly to the harmonic emission and some of these contributions show a strong ellipticity of the harmonics. The small ellipticity in the total harmonics signal arises from a combination of factors, namely, the fact that harmonic emission from different orbitals is strongest at different alignment angles of the molecular axis with respect to the laser polarization direction, as well as interference effects and a strong laser coupling between several inner valence orbitals.</description>
