      <title>Covering the Euclidean Plane by a Pair of Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A {$t$-stretch tree cover} of a metric space $M = (X,\delta)$, for a parameter $t \ge 1$, is a collection of trees such that every pair of points has a $t$-stretch path in one of the trees. Tree covers provide an important sketching tool that has found various applications over the years. The celebrated {Dumbbell Theorem} by Arya et al. [STOC'95] states that any set of points in the Euclidean plane admits a $(1+\epsilon)$-stretch tree cover with $O_\epsilon(1)$ trees. This result extends to any (constant) dimension and was also generalized for arbitrary doubling metrics by Bartal et al. [ICALP'19].
  Although the number of trees provided by the Dumbbell Theorem is constant, this constant is not small, even for a stretch significantly larger than $1+\epsilon$. At the other extreme, any single tree on the vertices of a regular $n$-polygon must incur a stretch of $\Omega(n)$. Using known results of ultrametric embeddings, one can easily get a stretch of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ using two trees. The question of whether a low stretch can be achieved using two trees has remained illusive, even in the Euclidean plane.
  In this work, we resolve this fundamental question in the affirmative by presenting a constant-stretch cover with a pair of trees, for any set of points in the Euclidean plane. Our main technical contribution is a {surprisingly simple} Steiner construction, for which we provide a {tight} stretch analysis of $\sqrt{26}$. The Steiner points can be easily pruned if one is willing to increase the stretch by a small constant. Moreover, we can bound the maximum degree of the construction by a constant.
  Our result thus provides a simple yet effective reduction tool -- for problems that concern approximate distances -- from the Euclidean plane to a pair of trees. To demonstrate the potential power of this tool, we present some applications [...]</description>

      <title>A Tight Lower Bound for Doubling Spanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any $n$-point set in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$, for $d = O(1)$, admits a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner with $\tilde{O}(n \cdot \epsilon^{-d+1})$ edges and lightness $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-d})$, for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. (The {lightness} is a normalized notion of weight, where we divide the spanner weight by the MST weight. The $\tilde{O}$ and $\tilde{\Omega}$ notations hide $\texttt{polylog}(\epsilon^{-1})$ terms.) Moreover, this result is tight: For any $2 \le d = O(1)$, there exists an $n$-point set in $\mathbb{R}^d$, for which any $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner has $\tilde{\Omega}(n \cdot \epsilon^{-d+1})$ edges and lightness $\tilde{\Omega}(n \cdot \epsilon^{-d})$.
  The upper bounds for Euclidean spanners rely heavily on the spatial property of {cone partitioning} in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which does not seem to extend to the wider family of {doubling metrics}, i.e., metric spaces of constant {doubling dimension}. In doubling metrics, a {simple spanner construction from two decades ago, the {net-tree spanner}}, has $\tilde{O}(n \cdot \epsilon^{-d})$ edges, and it could be transformed into a spanner of lightness $\tilde{O}(n \cdot \epsilon^{-(d+1)})$ by pruning redundant edges. Despite a large body of work, it has remained an open question whether the superior Euclidean bounds of $\tilde{O}(n \cdot \epsilon^{-d+1})$ edges and lightness $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-d})$ could be achieved also in doubling metrics. We resolve this question in the negative by presenting a surprisingly simple and tight lower bound, which shows, in particular, that the net-tree spanner and its pruned version are both optimal.</description>

      <title>Blending 3D Geometry and Machine Learning for Multi-View Stereopsis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods primarily depend on photometric and geometric consistency constraints. In contrast, modern learning-based algorithms often rely on the plane sweep algorithm to infer 3D geometry, applying explicit geometric consistency (GC) checks only as a post-processing step, with no impact on the learning process itself. In this work, we introduce GC MVSNet plus plus, a novel approach that actively enforces geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views (multi view) and at various scales (multi scale) during the learning phase (see Fig. 1). This integrated GC check significantly accelerates the learning process by directly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, effectively halving the number of training iterations compared to other MVS methods. Furthermore, we introduce a densely connected cost regularization network with two distinct block designs simple and feature dense optimized to harness dense feature connections for enhanced regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state of the art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets and secures second place on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To our knowledge, GC MVSNet plus plus is the first method to enforce multi-view, multi-scale supervised geometric consistency during learning. Our code is available.</description>
