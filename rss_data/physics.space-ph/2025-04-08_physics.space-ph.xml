      <title>Strong ionospheric activity at the MWA site associated with plasma bubble measured by GNSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Earth's ionosphere refracts radio signals, shifting the apparent position of radio sources. Wide-field measurements with a radio interferometer can measure the ionospheric distortion. The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has the ability to capture ionospheric structures that are smaller than 100 km in extent. We report unusually strong ionospheric activity in MWA data during a magnetic storm on 2023 December 1. The duct-like structure (roughly 50 km $\times$ $&gt;$100 km) passes through the MWA field-of-view (FOV) with a velocity of ~ 100 m/s. The offsets of the apparent position of the radio source are more than 1 degree in the MWA observation data at around 180 MHz. By comparing the Total Electron Content (TEC) data obtained from the GNSS receiver network, we have found that the TEC fluctuations represented by a high Rate of TEC change index (ROTI) coincided with the strong ionospheric activity observed by the MWA. This result suggests that unusual ionospheric signatures detected by the MWA could be caused by plasma bubbles extending across Western Australia during a magnetic storm.</description>

      <title>Plasma and Thermal Processing Leading to Spatial and Temporal Variability of the Trapped O2 at Europa and Ganymede</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe physical processes affecting the formation, trapping, and outgassing of molecular oxygen (O2) at Europa and Ganymede. Following Voyager measurements of their ambient plasmas, laboratory data indicated that the observed ions were supplied by and would in turn impact and sputtering their surfaces, decomposing the ice and producing thin O2 atmospheres. More than a decade later, Europa's ambient O2 was inferred from observations of the O aurora and condensed O2 bands at 5773 and 6275 angstroms were observed in Ganymede's icy surface. More than another decade later, the O2 atmosphere was shown to have a dusk/dawn enhancement, confirmed by Juno data. Although the incident plasma produces these observables, processes within the surface are still not well understood. Here we note that incident plasma produces a non-equilibrium defect density in the surface grains. Subsequent diffusion leads to the formation of voids and molecular products, some of which are volatile. Although some volatiles are released into their atmospheres, others are trapped at defects or in voids forming gas bubbles, which might be delivered to their subsurface oceans. Here we discuss how trapping competes with annealing of the radiation damage. We describe differences observed at Europa and Ganymede and roughly determine the trend with latitude of O2 bands on Ganymede's trailing hemisphere. This understanding is used to discuss the importance of condensed and adsorbed O2 as atmospheric sources, accounting for dusk/dawn enhancements and temporal variability reported in condensed O2 band depths. Since plasma and thermal annealing timescales affect the observed O2 variability on all of the icy moons, understanding the critical physical processes of O2 can help determine the evolution of other detected oxidants often suggested to be related to geological activity and venting.</description>
