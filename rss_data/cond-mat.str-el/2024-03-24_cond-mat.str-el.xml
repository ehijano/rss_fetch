      <title>Compressible quantum matter with vanishing Drude weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of quantum states of matter that are compressible but have vanishing DC conductivity in the absence of disorder. We show that the composite Fermi liquid emerging from strong interaction in a generic Chern band has zero Drude weight, in stark contrast to normal Fermi liquids. Our work establishes the absence of Drude weight as the defining property of the composite Fermi liquid phase, which distinguishes it from the Fermi liquid or other types of non-Fermi liquids. Our findings point to a possibly wide class of gapless quantum phases with unexpected transport and optical properties.</description>

      <title>Transforming from Kitaev to Disguised Ising Chain: Application to CoNb$_2$O$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many years, CoNb$_2$O$_6$ has served as an exemplar of the one-dimensional Ising model. However, recent experimental and theoretical analyses challenge its applicability to this material. Prior to that, a tailored spin model for 3d$^7$ systems such as Co$^{2+}$, known as the $JK\Gamma$ model, has emerged, featuring Heisenberg $(J)$, Kitaev $(K)$, and Gamma $(\Gamma)$ interactions. While these interactions are permitted by the symmetry of the system, their role in CoNb$_2$O$_6$ remains enigmatic. We present a microscopic theory based on spin-orbit entangled J$_{\textrm{eff}}$ = 1/2 states, aimed at elucidating the roles of Kitaev and Gamma interactions in shaping Ising anisotropy. Leveraging strong coupling theory, we identify a dominant ferromagnetic Kitaev interaction. Furthermore, by comparing dynamical structure factors obtained via exact diagonalization with those from inelastic neutron scattering experiments, we find an antiferromagnetic $\Gamma$ interaction, which dictates the Ising axis and explains the mechanism behind moment pinning. Our theory suggests that CoNb$_2$O$_6$ represents a rare one-dimensional Kitaev chain with significant ferromagnetic Kitaev and antiferromagnetic Gamma interactions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry, Superposition and Fragmentation in Classical Spin Liquids: A General Framework and Applications to Square Kagome Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical magnets offer glimpses of quantum-like features like spin liquids and fractionalization, promising an analogous construction of superposition and projective symmetry in classical field theory. While models based on system-specific spin-ice or soft-spin rules exist, a formal theory for general classical magnets remains elusive. Here, we introduce a mutatis mutandis symmetry group construction built from a vector field in a plaquette of classical spins, demonstrating how classical spins superpose in irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetry group. The corresponding probability amplitudes serve as order parameters and local spins as fragmented excitations. The formalism offers a many-body vector field representation of diverse ground states, including spin liquids and fragmented phases described as degenerate ensembles of irreps. We apply the theory specifically to a frustrated square Kagome lattice, where spin-ice or soft spin rules are inapt, to describe spin liquids and fragmented phases, all validated through irreps ensembles and unbiased Monte Carlo simulation. Our work sheds light on previously unknown aspects of spin-liquid phases and fragmentation and broadens their applications to other branches of field theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluctuations Suppress the Critical Fields in BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early efforts to realize exotic quantum ground states in frustrated magnets focused on frustration arising from the lattice geometry alone. Attention has shifted to bond-dependent anisotropic interactions, as well as further-neighbor interactions, on non-geometrically-frustrated lattices due to their greater versatility. The honeycomb magnet BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ recently emerged as a candidate host for both bond-dependent (e.g. Kitaev) and third-neighbor ($J_3$) interactions, and has become a model experimental system due to its relatively low levels of disorder. Understanding the relative importance of different exchange interactions holds the key to achieving novel ground states, such as quantum spin liquids. Here, we use the magnetotropic susceptibility to map out the intermediate and high-field phase diagram of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ as a function of the out-of-plane magnetic field direction at $T = 1.6$ K. We show that the experimental data are qualitatively consistent with classical Monte Carlo results of the XXZ-$J_1$-$J_3$ model with small Kitaev and off-diagonal exchange couplings included. However, the calculated critical fields are systematically larger than the experimental values. Infinite-DMRG computations on the quantum model reveal that quantum corrections from a nearby ferromagnetic state are likely responsible for the suppressed critical fields. Together, our experiment and theory analyses demonstrate that, while quantum fluctuations play an important role in determining the phase diagram, most of the physics of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ can be understood in terms of the classical dynamics of long-range ordered states, leaving little room for the possibility of a quantum spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based compression of quantum many body physics: PCA and autoencoder representation of the vertex function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing complex many-body phases of matter has been a central question in quantum physics for decades. Numerical methods built around approximations of the renormalization group (RG) flow equations have offered reliable and systematically improvable answers to the initial question -- what simple physics drives quantum order and disorder? The flow equations are a very high dimensional set of coupled nonlinear equations whose solution is the two particle vertex function, a function of three continuous momenta that describes particle-particle scattering and encodes much of the low energy physics including whether the system exhibits various forms of long ranged order. In this work, we take a simple and interpretable data-driven approach to the open question of compressing the two-particle vertex. We use PCA and an autoencoder neural network to derive compact, low-dimensional representations of underlying physics for the case of interacting fermions on a lattice. We quantify errors in the representations by multiple metrics and show that a simple linear PCA offers more physical insight and better out-of-distribution (zero-shot) generalization than the nominally more expressive nonlinear models. Even with a modest number of principal components (10 - 20), we find excellent reconstruction of vertex functions across the phase diagram. This result suggests that many other many-body functions may be similarly compressible, potentially allowing for efficient computation of observables. Finally, we identify principal component subspaces that are shared between known phases, offering new physical insight.</description>

      <title>Magnetic, charge, and bond order in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Holstein model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most nonperturbative numerical studies of electron-phonon interactions focus on model Hamiltonians where the electrons interact with a phonon branch via a single type of microscopic mechanism. Two commonly explored couplings in this context are the Holstein and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) interactions, which describe phonons modulating the on-site energy and intersite electron hopping, respectively. Many materials, however, have multiple phonon branches that can each interact with electronic degrees of freedom in different ways. We present here a determinant quantum Monte Carlo study of the half-filled two-dimensional (bond) SSH-Holstein Hamiltonian, where electrons couple to different phonon branches via either the Holstein or SSH mechanism. We map the model's phase diagram and determine the nature of the transitions between charge-density wave, bond order wave, and antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Generalized Spin Helix States as Quantum Many-Body Scars in Partially Integrable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are highly excited eigenstates of non-integrable Hamiltonians which violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and are embedded in a sea of thermal eigenstates. We provide a general mechanism to construct partially integrable models with arbitrarily large local Hilbert space dimensions, which host exact many-body scars. We introduce designed integrability-breaking terms to several exactly solvable spin chains, whose integrable Hamiltonians are composed of the generators of the Temperley-Lieb algebra. In the non-integrable subspace of these models, we identify a special kind of product states -- the generalized spin helix states as exact quantum many-body scars, which lie in the common null space of the non-Hermitian generators of the Temperley-Lieb algebra and are annihilated by the integrability-breaking terms. Our constructions establish an intriguing connection between integrability and quantum many-body scars, meanwhile provide a systematic understanding of scarred Hamiltonians from the perspective of non-Hermitian projectors.</description>

      <title>Universality of mean-field antiferromagnetic order in an anisotropic 3D Hubbard model at half-filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the 3D anisotropic Hubbard model on a cubic lattice with hopping parameter $t$ in the $x$- and $y$-directions and a possibly different hopping parameter $t_z$ in the $z$-direction; this model interpolates between the 2D and 3D Hubbard models corresponding to the limiting cases $t_z=0$ and $t_z=t$, respectively. We first derive all-order asymptotic expansions for the density of states. Using these expansions and units such that $t=1$, we analyze how the N\'eel temperature and the antiferromagnetic mean field depend on the coupling parameter, $U$, and on the hopping parameter $t_z$. We derive asymptotic formulas valid in the weak coupling regime, and we study in particular the transition from the three-dimensional to the two-dimensional model as $t_z \to 0$. It is found that the asymptotic formulas are qualitatively different for $t_z = 0$ (the two-dimensional case) and $t_z &gt; 0$ (the case of nonzero hopping in the $z$-direction). Our results show that certain universality features of the three-dimensional Hubbard model are lost in the limit $t_z \to 0$ in which the three-dimensional model reduces to the two-dimensional model.</description>

      <title>Exact Markovian Dynamics in Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems is a challenging frontier of physics. In this work, we systematically construct solvable non-integrable quantum circuits that exhibit exact Markovian subsystem dynamics. This feature thus enables accurately calculating local observables for arbitrary evolution time. Utilizing the influence matrix method, we show that the effect of the time-evolved global system on a finite subsystem can be analytically described by sequential, time-local quantum channels acting on the subsystem boundary. The realization of exact Markovian property is facilitated by a solvable condition on the underlying two-site gates in the quantum circuit. We further present several concrete examples with varying local Hilbert space dimensions to demonstrate our approach.</description>

      <title>Edge currents as probe of topology in twisted cuprate bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilayers made of high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ assembled with a twist angle close to $45^\circ$ have been recently shown to spontaneously break time reversal symmetry $\mathcal{T}$, consistent with theoretical predictions for emergent chiral topological $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ phase in such twisted $d$-wave superconductors. Here we use a minimal microscopic model to estimate the size of spontaneous chiral edge currents expected to occur in the $\mathcal{T}$-broken phase. In accord with previous theoretical studies of chiral $d$-wave superconductors we find small but non-vanishing edge currents which we nevertheless predict to be above the detection threshold of the state-of-the-art magnetic scanning probe microscopy. In addition, by deriving a simple relation between the edge current and the electron spectral function we help elucidate the longstanding disparity between the size of edge currents in chiral $d$-wave and $p$-wave superconductors.</description>

      <title>Description of CuInP$_{2}$S$_{6}$ ferrielectrics in a mixed Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The appearance of spontaneous polarization in CuInP$_{2}$S$_{6}$ ferrielectrics is related to the second order Jahn-Teller effect for copper cations located in a double-well local potential, the stereoactivity of indium cations located in a three-well local potential, as well as the valence fluctuations of phosphorus cations. The paraelectric to ferrielectric phase transition is primarily determined by the coupling of indium cations with their surroundings. This transition can be analyzed using the mixed Ising model with spins $s = 1/2$ and $S = 1$. The spectrum of pseudospin fluctuations at different temperatures was calculated using a mean-field approach for a set of quantum anharmonic oscillators. The results were then compared with Raman spectroscopy data for CuInP$_{2}$S$_{6}$ crystal. The analysis indicates that the lattice anharmonicity below 150 K, is mainly determined by the indium sublattice, leading to the coexistence of the glassy state and ferrielectric phase. Above 150 K, the anharmonicity of the copper sublattice activates the ionic conductivity and results in the existence of a long-ranged fluctuated cluster of spontaneous polarization in a temperature interval of the paraelectric phase above $T_{{C}}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin driven Yu-Shiba-Rusinov multiplets and fermion-parity-preserving phase transition in K$_3$C$_{60}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities in superconductors are of increasing interest due to emergent Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states and Majorana zero modes for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, a direct relationship between the YSR multiple states and magnetic anisotropy splitting of quantum impurity spins remains poorly characterized. By using scanning tunneling microscopy, we resolve systematically individual transition-metal (Fe, Cr and Ni) impurities induced YSR multiplets as well as their Zeeman effects in K$_3$C$_{60}$ superconductor. The YSR multiplets show identical $d$ orbital-like wave functions that are symmetry-mismatched to the threefold K$_3$C$_{60}$(111) host surface, breaking point-group symmetries of the spatial distribution of YSR bound states in real space. Remarkably, we identify an unprecedented fermion-parity-preserving quantum phase transition between ground states with opposite signs of the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy that can be manipulated by an external magnetic field. These findings can be readily understood in terms of anisotropy splitting of quantum impurity spins, and thus elucidate the intricate interplay between the magnetic anisotropy and YSR multiplets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive set of density functional theory calculations on the family of layered antiferromagnetic manganese pnictides (Ba, Ca, Sr)$\mathrm{Mn}_2\mathrm{(P, As, Sb)}_2$. We characterize all components to the linear magnetoelectric (ME) tensor $\alpha$ which are parsed into their contributions from spin and orbital moments for both lattice-mediated and their clamped-ion electronic analogs. Our main results show that the orbital magnetization components cannot be neglected in these systems. The ME response is dominated by electronic effects with total $\alpha$ values exceeding those of the prototypical $\mathrm{Cr}_2\mathrm{O}_3$ (i.e. $\alpha \simeq$ 6.79 ps/m in $\mathrm{BaMn}_2\mathrm{As}_2$). We also identify a strong correlation with the computed ME susceptibility on pnictogen substitution in the trigonal subfamily albeit with weaker amplitudes ($\alpha \simeq$ 0.2-1.7 ps/m). Additionally, we provide the dependence of these predictions on the Hubbard +U correction, at the level of the local density approximation, which show large variations on the calculated ME coefficients in the tetragonal compounds highlighting the role of strong correlation in these compounds.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Sachdev-Ye Models with Read-Saleur Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an SU(M)-symmetric disordered bipartite spin model with unusual characteristics. Although superficially similar to the Sachdev-Ye model, it has several markedly different properties for M&gt;2. In particular, it has a large non-trivial nullspace whose dimension grows exponentially with system size. The states in this nullspace are frustration-free, and are ground states when the interactions are ferromagnetic. The exponential growth of the nullspace leads to Hilbert-space fragmentation and a violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We demonstrate that the commutant algebra responsible for this fragmentation is a non-trivial subalgebra of the Read-Saleur commutant algebra of certain nearest-neighbour models such as the spin-1 biquadratic spin chain. We also discuss the low-energy behaviour of correlations for the disordered version of this model in the limit of a large number of spins and large M, using techniques similar to those applied to the SY model. We conclude by generalizing the Shiraishi-Mori embedding formalism to non-local models, and apply it to turn some of our nullspace states into quantum many-body scars.</description>

Abstract: Eu(Ga$_{1-x}$Al$_x$)$_4$ are centrosymmetric systems that have recently been identified as candidates to stabilise topologically non-trivial magnetic phases, such as skyrmion lattices. In this Letter, we present a high-resolution resonant x-ray and neutron scattering study on EuAl2Ga2 that provides new details of the complex coupling between the electronic ordering phenomena. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that the system orders to form a spin density wave with moments aligned perpendicular to the direction of the propagation vector, and upon further cooling, a cycloid with moments in the ab plane, in contrast to what has been reported in the literature. We show that concomitant with the onset of the spin density wave is the suppression of the charge order, indicative of a coupling between the localised 4$f$ electrons and itinerant electron density. Furthermore we demonstrate that the charge density wave order breaks the four-fold symmetry present in the I4/mmm crystal structure, thus declassifying these systems as square-net magnets.</description>

Abstract: The dynamical response of a quantum spin liquid upon injecting a hole is a pertinent open question. In experiments, the hole spectral function, measured momentum-resolved in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or locally in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), can be used to identify spin liquid materials. In this study, we employ tensor network methods to simulate the time evolution of a single hole doped into the Kitaev spin-liquid ground state. Focusing on the gapped spin liquid phase, we reveal two fundamentally different scenarios. For ferromagnetic spin couplings, the spin liquid is highly susceptible to hole doping: a Nagaoka ferromagnet forms dynamically around the doped hole, even at weak coupling. By contrast, in the case of antiferromagnetic spin couplings, the hole spectrum demonstrates an intricate interplay between charge, spin, and flux degrees of freedom, best described by a parton mean-field ansatz of fractionalized holons and spinons. Moreover, we find a good agreement of our numerical results to the analytically solvable case of slow holes. Our results demonstrate that dynamical hole spectral functions provide rich information on the structure of fractionalized quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the recent report of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ under pressure, we present an analysis of the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ as a function of pressure using correlated density functional theory methods (DFT+$U$). At the bare DFT level, the electronic structure of the ambient and high-pressure phases of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$are qualitatively similar. Upon including local correlation effects within DFT+$U$ and allowing for magnetic ordering, we find a delicate interplay between pressure and electronic correlations. Within the pressure-correlations phase space, we identify a region (at $U$ values consistent with constrained RPA) characterized by a high spin to low spin transition with increasing pressure. In contrast to previous theoretical work that only highlights the crucial role of the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbitals in this material, we find that the Ni-$d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals are active upon pressure and drive this rich magnetic landscape. This picture is preserved in the presence of oxygen deficiencies.</description>

      <title>Symmetric improved estimators for multipoint vertex functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multipoint vertex functions, and the four-point vertex in particular, are crucial ingredients in many-body theory. Recent years have seen significant algorithmic progress toward numerically computing their dependence on multiple frequency arguments. However, such computations remain challenging and are prone to suffer from numerical artifacts, especially in the real-frequency domain. Here, we derive estimators for multipoint vertices that are numerically more robust than those previously available. We show that the two central steps for extracting vertices from correlators, namely the subtraction of disconnected contributions and the amputation of external legs, can be achieved accurately through repeated application of equations of motion, in a manner that is symmetric with respect to all frequency arguments and involves only fully renormalized objects. The symmetric estimators express the core part of the vertex and all asymptotic contributions through separate expressions that can be computed independently, without subtracting the large-frequency limits of various terms with different asymptotic behaviors. Our strategy is general and applies equally to the Matsubara formalism, the real-frequency zero-temperature formalism, and the Keldysh formalism. We demonstrate the advantages of the symmetric improved estimators by computing the Keldysh four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model using the numerical renormalization group.</description>

      <title>Leading-logarithmic approximation by one-loop renormalization group within Matsubara formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate how to devise a Matsubara-formalism-based one-loop approximation to the flow of the functional renormalization group (FRG) that reproduces identically the leading-logarithmic parquet approximation. This construction of a controlled fermionic FRG approximation in a regime not accessible by perturbation theory generalizes a previous study from the real-time zero-temperature formalism to the Matsubara formalism and thus to the de facto standard framework used for condensed-matter FRG studies. Our investigation is based on a simple model for the absorption of x rays in metals. It is a core part of our construction to exploit that in a suitable leading-logarithmic approximation the values of the particle-hole susceptibility on the real- and on the imaginary-frequency axes are identical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of molecular Mott insulators on triangular lattice provided a few S=1/2 triangular quantum spin liquid candidates, with $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ being the most studied material of this group. The large number experimental works present a conflicting set of evidence, with some suggesting spin liquid behavior, while others point towards a valence bond solid with orphan spins. In this work we use Raman scattering spectroscopy to probe both local charge on molecular sites and lattice phonons as a function of temperature down to 6~K. Based on the analysis of the line shape of the BEDT-TTF charge sensitive vibration $\nu_2$ on cooling below 40 K, we suggest a development of disordered fluctuating charge disproportionation on (BEDT-TTF)$_2$ dimers of amplitude as small as 0.06$e$. The lattice phonons show strong anomalous broadening on cooling only in the (c,c) scattering channel, associated with the developing charge disproportionation. We suggest an interpretation, where the coupling of disordered charge dipoles on dimers to the lattice results in anisotropic modulation of charge transfer integrals between dimer lattice sites. Such fluctuations would result in modulation of magnetic coupling between spins which can produce fluctuating charge ordered spin-singlet pairs.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbital Ordering in Alkali Superoxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Akali superoxides AO2 (A=Na, K, Rb, Cs), due to an open p shell of the oxygen ion O2^- with degenerate pi orbitals, have spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The complex magnetic, orbital, and structural phase transitions observed experimentally in this family of materials are only partially understood. Based on density functional theory, we derive a strong-coupling effective model for the isostructural compounds AO2 (A=K, Rb, Cs) from a two-orbital Hubbard model. We find that CsO2 has highly frustrated exchange interactions in the a-b plane, while the frustration is weaker for smaller alkali ions. We solve the resulting Kugel-Khomskii model in the mean-field approximation. We show that CsO2 exhibits an antiferro-orbital (AFO) order with the ordering vector q=(1,0,0) and a stripe antiferromagnetic order with q=(1/2,0,0), which is consistent with recent neutron scattering experiments. We discuss the role of the pi-orbital degrees of freedom for the experimentally observed magnetic transitions and interpret the as-yet-unidentified T_s2=70K transition in CsO2 as an orbital ordering transition.</description>

      <title>A Noisy Approach to Intrinsically Mixed-State Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for studying two-dimensional (2D) topologically ordered states subject to local correlated errors and show that the resulting mixed-state can display intrinsically mixed-state topological order (imTO) -- topological order which is not expected to occur in the ground state of 2D local gapped Hamiltonians. Specifically, we show that decoherence, previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, "gauging out" anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed-state strongly symmetric under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking connection between the decohered density matrix and topological subsystem codes, which can appear as anomalous surface states of 3D topological orders. Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and even host chiral or non-modular topological order. We argue that the decohered states represent genuine mixed-state quantum phases of matter and that a partial classification of imTO is given in terms of braided fusion categories.</description>

      <title>Mott insulating states of the anisotropic SU(4) Dirac fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.11791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the large-scale quantum Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the Mott-insulating states of the half-filled SU(4) Hubbard model on the square lattice with a staggered-flux pattern. The noninteracting band structure that evolves from a nested Fermi surface at zero flux to isotropic Dirac cones at $\pi$ flux, exhibits anisotropic Dirac cones as the flux varies in between. Our simulations show transitions between the three phases of Dirac semimetal, antiferromagnet and valence-bond solid. A direct continuous transition between the antiferromagnetic phase and the valence-bond-solid phase is realized via varying the flux in the Mott regime. The simulated critical exponents remarkably agree with those of SU(4) $J$-$Q$ model. Inside the valence-bond-solid phase induced by the flux, the plaquette valence-bond state with vanishing single-particle gap is identified. At strong coupling, the valence-bond-solid phase disappears and the Mott-insulating state is always accompanied by antiferromagnetic ordering, regardless of the magnitude of the flux.</description>

      <title>A Generic Topological Criterion for Flat Bands in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the continuum limit of moir\'e graphene is described by a $(2+1)$-dimensional field theory of Dirac fermions coupled to two classical vector fields: a periodic gauge and spin field. We further show that the existence of a flat band implies an effective dimensional reduction, where the time dimension is ``removed.'' The resulting two-dimensional Euclidean theory contains the chiral anomaly. The associated Atiyah-Singer index theorem provides a self-consistency condition for flat bands. In the Abelian limit, where the spin field is disregarded, we reproduce a periodic series of quantized magic angles known to exist in twisted bilayer graphene in the chiral limit. However, the results are not exact. If the Abelian field has zero total flux, perfectly flat bands can not exist, because of the leakage of edge states into neighboring triangular patches with opposite field orientations. We demonstrate that the non-Abelian spin component can correct this and completely flatten the bands via an effective renormalization of the Abelian component into a configuration with a non-zero total flux. We present the Abelianization of the theory where the Abelianized flat band can be mapped to that of the lowest Landau level. We show that the Abelianization corrects the values of the magic angles consistent with numerical results. We also use this criterion to prove that an external magnetic field splits the series into pairs of magnetic field-dependent magic angles associated with flat moir\'e-Landau bands. The topological criterion and the Abelianization procedure provide a generic practical method for finding flat bands in a variety of material systems including but not limited to moir\'e bilayers.</description>

      <title>Prethermal stability of eigenstates under high frequency Floquet driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems subject to high-frequency driving exhibit Floquet prethermalization, that is, they heat exponentially slowly on a time scale that is large in the drive frequency, $\tau_{\rm h} \sim \exp(\omega)$. Nonetheless, local observables can decay much faster via energy conserving processes, which are expected to cause a rapid decay in the fidelity of an initial state. Here we show instead that the fidelities of eigenstates of the time-averaged Hamiltonian, $H_0$, display an exponentially long lifetime over a wide range of frequencies -- even as generic initial states decay rapidly. When $H_0$ has quantum scars, or highly excited-eigenstates of low entanglement, this leads to long-lived non-thermal behavior of local observables in certain initial states. We present a two-channel theory describing the fidelity decay time $\tau_{\rm f}$: the interzone channel causes fidelity decay through energy absorption i.e. coupling across Floquet zones, and ties $\tau_{\rm f}$ to the slow heating time scale, while the intrazone channel causes hybridization between states in the same Floquet zone. Our work informs the robustness of experimental approaches for using Floquet engineering to generate interesting many-body Hamiltonians, with and without scars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies identified spin-order-driven phenomena such as spin-charge interconversion without relying on the relativistic spin-orbit interaction. Those physical properties can be prominent in systems containing light magnetic atoms due to sizable exchange splitting and may pave the way for realization of giant responses correlated with the spin degree of freedom. In this paper, we present a systematic symmetry analysis based on the spin crystallographic groups and identify the physical property of a vast number of magnetic materials up to 1500 in total. By decoupling the spin and orbital degrees of freedom, our analysis enables us to take a closer look into the relation between the dimensionality of spin structures and the resultant physical properties and to identify the spin and orbital contributions separately. In stark contrast to the established analysis with magnetic space groups, the spin crystallographic group manifests richer symmetry including spin-translation symmetry and leads to emergent responses. For representative examples, we discuss the geometrical nature of the anomalous Hall effect and magnetoelectric effect and classify the spin Hall effect arising from the nonrelativistic spin-charge coupling. Using the power of computational analysis, we apply our symmetry analysis to a wide range of magnets, encompassing complex magnets such as those with noncoplanar spin structures as well as collinear and coplanar magnets. We identify emergent multipoles relevant to physical responses and argue that our method provides a systematic tool for exploring sizable electromagnetic responses driven by spin order.</description>

Abstract: We explore the edge properties of rectangular graphene nanoribbons featuring two zigzag edges and two armchair edges. Although the self-consistent Hartree-Fock fields break chiral symmetry, our work demonstrates that graphene nanoribbons maintain their status as short-range entangled symmetry-protected topological insulators. The relevant symmetry involves combined mirror and time-reversal operations. In undoped ribbons displaying edge ferromagnetism, the band gap edge states with a topological charge form on the zigzag edges. An analysis of the anomalous continuity equation elucidates that this topological charge is induced by the gap term. In low-doped zigzag ribbons, where the ground state exhibits edge spin density waves, this topological charge appears as a nearly zero-energy edge mode. Our system is outside the conventional calssification for topological insulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of superconductivity in the pressurized trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate, we explore its structural, electronic, and magnetic properties as a function of hydrostatic pressure from first-principles calculations. We find that in both the bilayer and trilayer nickelates, an orthorhombic(monoclinic)-to-tetragonal transition under pressure takes place concomitantly with the onset of superconductivity. The electronic structure of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ can be understood using a molecular trimer basis wherein $n$ molecular subbands arise as the $d_{z^2}$ orbitals hybridize strongly along the $c$-axis within the trilayer. The magnetic tendencies indicate that the ground state at ambient pressure is formed by nonmagnetic inner planes and stripe-ordered outer planes that are antiferromagnetically coupled along the $c$ axis, resulting in an unusual $\uparrow$, 0, $\downarrow$ stacking that is consistent with the spin density wave model suggested by neutron diffraction. Such a state is destabilized by the pressures wherein superconductivity arises. Despite the presence of $d_{z^2}$ states at the Fermi level, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals also play a key role in the electronic structure of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. This active role of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states in the low-energy physics of the trilayer RP nickelate, together with the distinct electronic behavior of inner and outer planes, resembles the physics of multilayer cuprates.</description>

Abstract: An indispensable ingredient for pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity is the presence of an attractive pairing interaction at finite momentum. Here, we show how this condition can be met with straightforward electron-density interactions in multiband systems. The electron-density interaction, when projected to the band basis, acquires form factors with nontrivial momentum dependence and thereby exhibits a potential tendency to a finite-momentum pairing instability. By applying a mean-field analysis to two simple multiband models, the checkerboard lattice and three-band Hubbard model, we find that PDW order can indeed become the leading instability if a strong nearest-neighbour attraction is present. Moreover, the condition for the transition from a uniform superconductor to a PDW superconductor is shown via a simple quantum geometric argument.</description>

Abstract: We show that crossing symmetry of S-matrices is modified in certain theories with non-invertible symmetries or anomalies. Focusing on integrable flows to gapped phases in two dimensions, we find that S-matrices derived previously from the bootstrap approach are incompatible with non-invertible symmetries along the flow. We present consistent alternatives, which however violate standard crossing symmetry and obey modified rules dictated by fusion categories. We extend these rules to theories with discrete anomalies.</description>
