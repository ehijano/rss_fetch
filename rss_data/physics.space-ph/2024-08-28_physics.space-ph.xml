      <title>Low-cost Monitoring of Energetic Particle Precipitation: Weather Balloon-borne Timepix Measurements During the May 2024 Superstorm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding energetic electron precipitation is crucial for accurate space weather modeling and forecasting, impacting the Earth's upper atmosphere and human infrastructure. This study presents a low-cost, low-mass, and low-power solution for high-fidelity analysis of electron precipitation events by measuring the resulting bremsstrahlung X-ray emissions. Specifically, we report on results from the flight of a radiation detector payload based on a silicon pixel read-out Timepix detector technology, and its successful utilization onboard a `burster' weather balloon. We launched this payload during the May 2024 superstorm, capturing high-resolution measurements of both background galactic cosmic ray radiation as well as storm-time energetic electron precipitation. We further developed particle and radiation detection algorithms to separate bremsstrahlung X-rays from other particle species in the pixel-resolved trajectories as seen in the Timepix detector. The measurements revealed a distinctive four-peak structure in X-ray flux, corresponding to periodic four-minute-long bursts of energetic electron precipitation between 21:20 and 21:40 UT. This precipitation was also observed by a riometer station close to the balloon launch path, further validating balloon measurements and the developed X-ray identification algorithm. The clear periodic structure of the measured precipitation is likely caused by modulation of the electron losses from the radiation belt by harmonic Pc5 ULF waves, observed contemporaneously on the ground. The study underscores the potential of compact, low-cost payloads for advancing our understanding of space weather. Specifically, we envision a potential use of such Timepix-based detectors in space science, for example on sounding rockets or nano-, micro-, and small satellite platforms.</description>

      <title>Interplanetary Causes and Impacts of the 2024 May Superstorm on the Geosphere: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent superstorm of 2024 May 10-11 is the second largest geomagnetic storm in the space age and the only one that has simultaneous interplanetary data (there were no interplanetary data for the 1989 March storm). The May superstorm was characterized by a sudden impulse (SI+) amplitude of +88 nT, followed by a three-step storm main phase development which had a total duration of ~9 hr. The cause of the first storm main phase with a peak SYM-H intensity of -183 nT was a fast forward interplanetary shock (magnetosonic Mach number Mms ~7.2) and an interplanetary sheath with southward interplanetary magnetic field component Bs of ~40 nT. The cause of the second storm main phase with a SYM-H intensity of -354 nT was a deepening of the sheath Bs to ~43 nT. A magnetosonic wave (Mms ~0.6) compressed the sheath to a high magnetic field strength of ~71 nT. Intensified Bs of ~48 nT was the cause of the third and most intense storm main phase with a SYM-H intensity of -518 nT. Three magnetic cloud events with Bs fields of ~25-40 nT occurred in the storm recovery phase, lengthening the recovery to ~2.8 days. At geosynchronous orbit, ~76 keV to ~1.5 MeV electrons exhibited ~1-3 orders of magnitude flux decreases following the shock/sheath impingement onto the magnetosphere. The cosmic ray decreases at Dome C, Antarctica (effective vertical cutoff rigidity &lt;0.01 GV) and Oulu, Finland (rigidity ~0.8 GV) were ~17% and ~11%, respectively relative to quite time values. Strong ionospheric current flows resulted in extreme geomagnetically induced currents of ~30-40 A in the sub-auroral region. The storm period is characterized by strong polar region field-aligned currents, with ~10 times intensification during the main phase, and equatorward expansion down to ~50 deg geomagnetic (altitude-adjusted) latitude.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of the extended cosmic-ray decreases observed with world-wide networks of neutron monitors and muon detectors; temporal variation of the rigidity spectrum and its implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the global analysis of two extended decreases of the galactic cosmic ray intensity observed by world-wide networks of ground-based detectors in 2012. This analysis is capable of separately deriving the cosmic ray density (or omnidirectional intensity) and anisotropy each as a function of time and rigidity. A simple diffusion model along the spiral field line between Earth and a cosmic-ray barrier indicates the long duration of these events resulting from about 190$^\circ$ eastern extension of a barrier such as an IP-shock followed by the sheath region and/or the corotating interaction region (CIR). It is suggested that the coronal mass ejection merging and compressing the preexisting CIR at its flank can produce such the extended barrier. The derived rigidity spectra of the density and anisotropy both vary in time during each event period. In particular we find that the temporal feature of the ``phantom Forbush decrease'' reported in an analyzed period is dependent on rigidity, looking quite different at different rigidities. From these rigidity spectra of the density and anisotropy, we derive the rigidity spectrum of the average parallel mean-free-path of pitch angle scattering along the spiral field line and infer the power spectrum of the magnetic fluctuation and its temporal variation. Possible physical cause of the strong rigidity dependence of the ``phantom Forbush decrease'' is also discussed. These results demonstrate the high-energy cosmic rays observed at Earth responding to remote space weather.</description>

      <title>Probing coronal mass ejections inclination effects with EUHFORIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are complex magnetized plasma structures in which the magnetic field spirals around a central axis, forming what is known as a flux rope (FR). The central FR axis can be oriented at any angle to the ecliptic. Throughout its journey, a CME will encounter interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind which are neither homogeneous nor isotropic. Consequently, CMEs with different orientations will encounter different ambient medium conditions and, thus, the interaction of a CME with its surrounding environment will vary depending on the orientation of its FR axis, among other factors. This study aims to understand the effect of inclination on CME propagation. We performed simulations with the EUHFORIA 3D magnetohydrodynamic model. This study focuses on two CMEs modelled as spheromaks with nearly identical properties, differing only by their inclination. We show the effects of CME orientation on sheath evolution, MHD drag, and non-radial flows by analyzing the model data from a swarm of 81 virtual spacecraft scattered across the inner heliospheric. We have found that the sheath duration increases with radial distance from the Sun and that the rate of increase is greater on the flanks of the CME. Non-radial flows within the studied sheath region appear larger outside the ecliptic plane, indicating a "sliding" of the IMF in the out-of ecliptic plane. We found that the calculated drag parameter does not remain constant with radial distance and that the inclination dependence of the drag parameter can not be resolved with our numerical setup.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Evolution of Lethal Non-Trackable Population and its Effect on LEO Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of the orbital population today is unobservable and untracked because of their small size. These lethal non-trackable objects will only become more numerous as more payloads and debris are launched into orbit and increase the collision rate. In this paper, the long-term effect of collisions is simulated with an efficient Monte-Carlo method to simulate the future LEO environment including lethal non-trackable objects, which is typically ignored due to the large computational resources required. The results show that simulations that do not incorporate lethal non-trackable debris would be omitting a large number of debilitating collisions with active payloads and catastrophic collisions to a smaller effect. This shows the importance of simulating small debris in the long-term evolution of the orbital population, which is often omitted in the literature. This increased debris population and consequentially the risk to orbital payloads diminishes as smaller lethal non-trackable objects are considered. An efficient and validated model is used to simulate these numerous small objects. Several future cases such as launches of registered megaconstellations, improved post-mission disposal rates and no-future launches are explored to understand the effect of the inclusion or exclusion of lethal non-trackable objects.</description>

      <title>Long-term variation of the solar polar magnetic fields at different latitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polar magnetic fields of the Sun play an important role in governing solar activity and powering fast solar wind. However, because our view of the Sun is limited in the ecliptic plane, the polar regions remain largely uncharted. Using the high spatial resolution and polarimetric precision vector magnetograms observed by Hinode from 2012 to 2021, we investigate the long-term variation of the magnetic fields in polar caps at different latitudes. The Hinode magnetic measurements show that the polarity reversal processes in the north and south polar caps are non-simultaneous. The variation of the averaged radial magnetic flux density reveals that, in each polar cap, the polarity reversal is completed successively from the 70 degree latitude to the pole, reflecting a poleward magnetic flux migration therein. These results clarify the polar magnetic polarity reversal process at different latitudes.</description>

      <title>SatHub Panel: Satellite Interference in Observatories Around the World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite constellation interference occurs across astronomical disciplines. We present examples of interference from radio and $\gamma$-Ray astronomy to optical and spectroscopic interference in ground-based and space-borne facilities. In particular, we discuss the impact of artificial satellites on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), an Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope, as well as possible mitigation strategies for the European Southern Observatory 4-metre Multi-Object Spectrograph Telescope (ESO 4MOST). Furthermore, we shed light on how ground-based optical telescopes such as the Oukaimeden Observatory contribute to IAU Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference (IAU CPS) efforts that quantify satellite brightness.</description>
