      <title>Refuting the Metaphysics of Wolfram and Tegmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wolfram's hypergraph dynamics should replace outmoded models in physics. This should even more so be the case if experimental evidence for the theory is found (which I believe is probable). However, due to the breadth and depth of the theory, it may be difficult to produce experimental evidence which falsifies it. Some of Wolfram's personal work relating to his physics project is philosophical, and so mechanics of particular phenomena in the natural world can become a triviality or an aside. In other words, the general theory "casts a wide net", and it is the philosophical topics I will challenge. I find that Wolfram must adopt a radical epistemology through his so-called Observer Theory because there is no clear notion of Truth. Tegmark believes in an objective Truth, but I find its relation to the observer untenable, and the proof of his Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH) is gematria. I argue both Wolfram and Tegmark conflate the inherent potential of mathematical truths with their instantiation or actuality in reality, making a similar error to the "so-called" Pythagoreans rebuked by Aristotle. Nonetheless, I believe that combinatorial structures of the kind used in the physics project (abstract rewriting, directed acyclic graphs) will be the future of physics as we know it.</description>

      <title>The Classical Limit of Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I consider the classical (i.e., non-relativistic) limit of Teleparallel Gravity, a relativistic theory of gravity that is empirically equivalent to General Relativity and features torsional forces. I show that as the speed of light is allowed to become infinite, Teleparallel Gravity reduces to Newtonian Gravity without torsion. I compare these results to the torsion-free context and discuss their implications on the purported underdetermination between Teleparallel Gravity and General Relativity. I conclude by considering alternative approaches to the classical limit developed in the literature.</description>
