      <title>Scattering map for the Vlasov--Poisson system with a repulsive harmonic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Vlasov--Poisson system with a repulsive harmonic potential and prove the (modified) scattering of solutions, as well as the existence of wave operators, in any spatial dimension $d\geq 2$. The main novelty of this work is the construction of the wave operators and the introduction of the lens transform for the Vlasov--Poisson system. In addition, we provide a new and simpler proof that relaxes the assumptions on the initial data compared with those in Bigorgne, Velozo Ruiz, and Velozo Ruiz (2025) and Velozo Ruiz, and Velozo Ruiz (2024).</description>

      <title>Global Strong Well-posedness of the heat-conducting, compressible primitive Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full heat-conducting compressible primitive equations are considered, extending the compressible primitive-equation framework by coupling the temperature through the ideal gas law and the thermal energy balance in the presence of gravity. Global strong well-posedness is established for small perturbations of an equilibrium state, thereby providing a result beyond the isothermal regime. The proof relies on a structural representation of the density in terms of the temperature and on a new Lagrangian transformation.</description>

      <title>Attractor Continuity for Semilinear Parabolic Equations on Thin Domains with Degenerating Outward Peaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the attractors associated with a semilinear parabolic equation subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions and defined on a thin domain $R^\varepsilon \subset \mathbb{R}^{1+n}$. We assume that the thin domain exhibits a cusp, known as an outward peak, whose geometry is characterized by a nonnegative function that vanishes at a point on the boundary. Our objective is to rigorously establish the continuity of the attractors as $\varepsilon \to 0$ and to determine their rate of convergence.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Exclusion Zones on the Coexistence of Predator and Prey with an Allee Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a reaction--diffusion model of predator--prey interaction in which the predators occupy only a subset of the prey's territory, leaving a predator-free exclusion zone. Ecological examples include marine protected areas where it is illegal to fish, or buffer zones left between the territories of rival predators. The prey are subject to a strong Allee effect, so excessive predation may lead to the extinction of both species. The exclusion zone mitigates this problem by providing the prey with a refuge in which to proliferate without predation. Thus, paradoxically, a smaller predator territory may be able to support a more substantial population than a larger one. Using a topological degree argument, we show in any dimensions that, provided the exclusion zone is large enough, the system possesses spatially heterogeneous coexistence equilibria with positive populations of both species. This result is global in the sense that it does not rely on local bifurcations from semi-trivial stationary states. We also show that as the predator domain becomes asymptotically small, the total predator population does not vanish, and in some cases may actually be maximized in this limit of shrinking predation area. Conversely, we show that as the predator domain becomes large, it may exhibit thresholding behavior, passing suddenly from a regime with coexistence solutions to one in which extinction becomes unavoidable, highlighting the need for careful analysis in the management of predator--prey systems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Model for Electrical Discharge in MEMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local well-posedness of the solution to a coupled nonlinear elliptic-parabolic system which models electrical discharge in a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS). A simple MEMS capacitor device contains two plates acting as the capacitor's electrodes, one of which is flexible, and which are separated by a narrow gas-filled gap. In the event of the flexible plate approaching the other, electrical discharge can occur. This is modelled here by two parabolic equations, for densities of electrons and positive ions, and an elliptic equation for electric potential. We show the local-in-time existence of a weak solution for the coupled system. Compactness techniques, used previously in the study of drift-diffusion equations, are employed in our proof.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limit of rarefaction wave for the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system with Coulomb potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the hydrodynamic limit of rarefaction wave for the two-species Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau(VML) system with Coulomb potential. We prove that for any given time interval, the solution of the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system with appropriate initial data converges to a rarefaction wave as the Knudsen number $\epsilon$ approaches zero. The main difficulty in the analysis lies in the loss of dissipation in the interaction between the electromagnetic field and the microscopic component, and the weak dissipation induced by the Lorentz force and the scaling with small parameter $\epsilon$. For this, we introduce a velocity weight function and a space-time scaling parameter together with suitable $\epsilon$-dependent energy estimates.</description>

      <title>Spreading dynamics for the Lotka-Volterra system with general initial supports: the strong competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the spreading dynamics of a high-dimensional strong competition Lotka-Volterra system where two species initially occupy disjoint measurable (possibly unbounded) subsets in $\mathbb{R}^N$, which are called initial support. Recently, Hamel and Rossi [14] introduced some new geometric notions, such as bounded or unbounded directions and positive-distance interior, for single-species equations with general initial supports. Under these notions and appropriate assumptions, we characterize directional spreading behavior for the two-species system: precise spreading speeds and sets for both species are derived.</description>

      <title>Refined wave breaking for the one-dimensional nonlinear shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to give a refined wave breaking description of the Cauchy problem to the one-dimensional nonlinear shallow water equations providing a sharp estimate of the lifespan of the solutions depending on the amplitude and topography parameters, under a non-cavitation condition which excludes the scenario that the solutions have compact support. We construct smooth initial data with finite $\dot{H}^5$-norm such that the $L^\infty$-norm of the spatial derivative of the solution blows up at one single point in finite time with a precise blowup profile.</description>

      <title>A Topological Approach to Singular Double-Phase Equations with Variable Exponents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study a singular double phase variable exponent Dirichlet problem in the setting of a new Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev space with the nonlinearity (the external source) having gradient dependence (so-called convection terms). We apply a topological existence result incorporating the Leray-Schauder degree and homotopy mapping together to prove the existence of at least one nontrivial solution.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hydrodynamic equation for semiconductor devices in 2-dimensional space and the relaxation time limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the author's previous analysis in \cite{AMZ3} on weak solutions with large norms for the collisional quantum hydrodynamic (QHD) equations in semiconductor modeling to 2-dimensional tori.
  We first establish the global existence of weak solutions with strictly positive density within the functional framework of GCP solutions introduced in \cite{AMZ1}. A logarithmic Sobolev-type inequality is employed to control oscillations in the mass density. Furthermore, by constructing a combined functional that incorporates both the GCP energy and the physical entropy, we derive the exponential decay of solutions. As a byproduct of our approach, we also prove the global existence of $H^2$ solutions for a nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Langevin equation.
  Finally, for GCP solutions that remain bounded away from vacuum, we justify the time-relaxation limit and provide an explicit convergence rate. Our analysis relies on compactness techniques that does not require the existence or smoothness of solutions to the limiting equations. Moreover, our results impose no well-preparedness conditions on the initial data, thereby accommodating the possible formation of an initial layer.</description>

      <title>2D incompressible inviscid Oldroyd-B equations: ill-posedness, long time existence, and high Weissenberg number limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the high-Weissenberg number limit of a Voigt-regularized two-dimensional Oldroyd-B model for viscoelastic fluids. We first demonstrate that the Euler-Oldroyd-B system is both linearly and nonlinearly ill-posed in Sobolev spaces, exhibiting Hadamard instability. Then, we introduce a Voigt-type regularization on the stress tensor, which stabilizes the system. For the regularized model, we establish long time ($T \sim \mathcal O(\varepsilon^{-2/3})$) well-posedness and uniform energy estimates with respect to the relaxation parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Lastly, we prove that, as $\varepsilon \to 0$, the solutions converge to a solution of the 2-d incompressible Navier-Stokes equations over time intervals of size $\mathcal O(\varepsilon^{-2/3})$. The proof relies on a decomposition of the stress tensor, high-order energy estimates, and a detailed analysis of the nonlinear coupling terms. Our results provide a mathematical justification for the Newtonian limit of a regularized viscoelastic fluid model that is otherwise ill-posed.</description>

      <title>Real analytic solutions to the divergence equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a differential-topological method to yield explicit real analytic solutions $v$ to the divergence equation $div_{\mathbb{R}^n} v = f$ on any annali $A(R_1 ,R_2) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n : R_1 &lt; |x| &lt; R_2\}$, with $n \geq 2$, and $0 &lt; R_1 &lt; R_2 &lt; \infty$. The prescribed source term $f$ is supposed to be real analytic on $\overline{A(R_1 , R_2)} = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n : R_1 \leq |x| \leq R_2\}$ satisfying the zero integral condition on $A(R_1, R_2)$. The resulting solution $v$ is a real analytic vector field on $\overline{A(R_1 , R_2)}$, which vanishes on $\partial \big( A(R_1, R_2 ) \big )$. The method which we develop here is different from the standard Bogovski approach and the Kapitanskii-Pileckas approach. The first main step our method is a clever differential-topological argument, which we develop under the inspiration and guidance of the standard proof of the cohomological statement $H_c^n \big ( \mathbb{R}^n\big ) = \mathbb{R}$ in Spviak book A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry, Vol I. This allows us to reduce the problem to that of solving a linear algebra problem.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of higher-order perturbations of the Perona--Malik functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gamma-limit of higher-order singular perturbations of the Perona-Malik functional is analyzed. The energies considered combine the critically scaled logarithmic term with a k-th order regularization designed to balance bulk and interfacial effects. A compactness result is obtained, and the Gamma-limit is identified as a free-discontinuity functional on SBV, given by the sum of the Dirichlet energy and a surface term proportional to the jump amplitude to the power 1/k. The surface density is characterized through a one-dimensional optimal-profile problem with homogeneous boundary conditions on derivatives up to order k-1. As a consequence, the limit of the same energies at a different scaling is determined. That scaling had been previously studied in the second-order case to address the so-called staircasing phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a universal blow-up bound for the focusing mass-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation for general initial data in $L^2(\mathbb R^d)$, extending previous knowledge for mass near the ground-state threshold due to Merle and Rapha\"el. The main results are twofold. First, we show the nonexistence of self-similar rate blow-up solutions. Second, under radial symmetry, we establish the sharp log--log correction to the self-similar bound on the blow-up rate. The proofs are based on a new analysis of general blow-up solutions, which does not rely on any ansatz or variational structure.</description>

      <title>Range expansion by growth and congestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a nonlinear and nonlocal model that describes the range expansion of a population resulting from growth and competition for space. This type of phenomenon underlies the expansion of colonies of immotile cells which motivated this work; Similar mechanisms are at play in urban sprawling which we briefly discuss as well. We rigorously derive a singular limit of this model corresponding to a regime where dispersal occurs only from saturated areas. The limiting model, which has the structure of an obstacle free boundary problem in time, provides an effective approach to the description of the range expansion of a population as a result of growth, saturation and dispersion. We then establish the main mathematical properties of this singular problem. In particular, we characterize the evolution of a free boundary that delimits the saturated area. We identify traveling wave solutions and characterize the asymptotic speed of spreading of compactly supported solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the stochastic 2D vortex model on the whole Euclidean space from stochastic particle systems driven by individual and environmental noises, obtaining pathwise quantitative bounds in the sense of relative entropy. The main novelty is the application of the Donsker-Varadhan inequality in the context of moderately interacting particles to handle the nonlinearity, as well as the use of localization techniques combined with the probabilistic data setting, to derive estimates for the quadratic variation terms. Moreover, we prove the existence of a suitable solution to the aforementioned model.</description>

  In the presence of a strong, constant background field $\mathbf{F}$, the evolution of the magnetic perturbation $\boldsymbol{b}$ is governed by the linearized induction equation. We analyze the system on both the entire space $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^d$ and a periodic domain $\Omega = \prod_{i=1}^d [0, L_i)$, which models a homogeneous medium with side lengths $L_i &gt; 0$. We analyze this problem by decomposing it into the injectivity of a parabolic forward map and the solvability of a divergence-free transport sub-problem. On the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$, we show that the transport sub-problem is well-posed when data is prescribed on a non-characteristic hypersurface transverse to $\mathbf{F}$. On the torus, we establish a sharp uniqueness criterion based on the rational dependence of the ratios $\{F_i/L_i\}_{i=1}^d$ between the background-field components and the corresponding domain periods. Furthermore, we show that for the reconstructed velocity to belong to $L^2$, a sufficient condition is that the background field must satisfy a Diophantine condition. The proof combines injectivity of the parabolic forward map with uniqueness for a steady transport equation along $\mathbf{F}$.</description>

      <title>Renormalised solutions to reaction-diffusion systems with interface conditions: Global existence and weak-strong uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the concept of renormalised solutions for entropy-dissipating reaction-diffusion systems due to J. Fischer (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 218, 2015) to systems coupled by nonlinear interface conditions. For this notion of solution, we establish global existence as well as a weak-strong stability estimate. Our framework allows to handle entropy-dissipating interfacial transmission rates without growth restrictions, including power-law nonlinearities as arising in the thermodynamic modelling of dissipative bulk-interface systems via generalised gradient structures. Our analysis relies on suitable extensions of the species' densities across the interface as well as on a non-local truncated variant of the relative entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a compact connected Lie group $G$, we study the global solvability and the cohomology spaces of the differential complex associated with an essentially real involutive structure that is invariant under left translations. We prove that solvability in the first degree of the complex implies solvability in all other degrees, and furnish a converse for this fact under a certain commutativity hypothesis (that always holds when $G$ is a torus). Additionally, it is proved that the solvability holds when the structure comes from the Lie algebra of a closed subgroup of $G$. We also investigate real tube structures when $G$ is the base manifold.</description>

      <title>An accelerated rearrangement method for two-phase composite optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze an Accelerated Rearrangement Method (ARM) for solving a class of nonconvex optimization problems involving two-phase composites. These problems include maximizing the (work) energy of a membrane governed by the Poisson equation and minimizing the principal eigenvalue of a weighted Dirichlet-Laplacian, both subject to material distribution constraints. Building on the classical rearrangement method, we introduce momentum-like acceleration by extrapolating the Fr\'echet derivative, leading to a provably convergent algorithm. We also introduce a restarted variant that guarantees monotonic improvement of the objective. In one dimension, we derive asymptotic convergence rates for ARM and prove that they improve upon the classical rearrangement method. Numerical experiments in both two and three dimensions confirm the accelerated convergence and demonstrate practical efficiency.</description>

      <title>Yet another look at narrow escape through a tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The narrow escape problem concerns the time needed for a diffusing particle to exit a confining domain through a small hole in the boundary. While this problem is now well-understood, determining the escape time for a particle that must exit through a narrow tube has proven challenging. Indeed, relying on analogies with electrodynamics, parameter fits to simulations, and heuristics, a variety of conflicting estimates for this escape time have been offered over the last three decades, some of which are counterintuitive and arguably non-physical. In this paper, we combine matched asymptotic analysis and probabilistic methods to determine the exact asymptotics of the narrow escape time through a tube. We obtain a new escape time formula which reduces to the various prior estimates in certain special cases. If the diffusivity in the tube differs from the diffusivity in the rest of the domain, our results reveal the importance of the form of the multiplicative noise inherent to any diffusivity that varies in space. We discuss our results in the context of asymmetric cell division.</description>

      <title>Fractal dimension of singular times for SPDEs: Energy bounds, criticality, and weak-strong uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For several physically relevant SPDEs, it is known that global weak solutions coexist with local strong ones. Typically, weak-strong uniqueness results are known, and ensure that the global and strong solutions coincide as long as the latter exist. Times at which a weak solution does not coincide with a strong one are called singular times. Determining their fractal dimension is fundamental to capturing the regularity of weak solutions.
  We define singular times for a wide class of semilinear SPDEs. We show that sets of singular times have fractal dimension (i.e., Hausdorff and/or Minkowski) at most $ 1-\ell\, \mathsf{Exc}$, where $\ell$ and $\mathsf{Exc}$ are the time integrability and the excess of spatial regularity compared to the critical regularity of the energy bound associated with weak solutions, respectively. Moreover, their corresponding $(1-\ell\,\mathsf{Exc} )$-dimensional measure is zero. We formulate and apply our theory to quenched strong Leray-Hopf solutions of 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) with physically relevant noises, including rough Kraichnan and Lie transport. In particular, we extend the fundamental $1/2$-dimensional bound of Leray and Scheffer on singular times for 3D NSEs to the stochastic setting, and we prove new conditional results under supercritical Serrin's conditions, irrespective of the roughness of the noise. Our framework is new even in the deterministic case, and provides the first partial regularity results for weak solutions to SPDEs with multiplicative noise.</description>

      <title>Target controllability for a minimum time problem in a trait-structured chemostat model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a minimum time control problem governed by a trait-structured chemostat model including mutation and one limiting substrate. Our first main result proves the well-posedness of the control-to-state mapping. We subsequently analyze the class of auxostat-type controls, feedback laws designed to regulate substrate concentration, and prove that the corresponding solutions converge to a stationary state of the system. These convergence results are used to show the reachability of a target set corresponding to the selection of a population with a low weighted averaged half-saturation constant. Finally, we show the existence of an optimal control for the minimum time problem associated with reaching the target set. These theoretical findings are completed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07328v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of periodic solutions in blood flow propagating through vessels with free boundary conditions via the bifurcation theory. It is rigorously proved that a local $C^1$-curve of small-amplitude periodic solutions is bifurcated. In contrast to previous studies on periodic flows that primarily focus on constant vorticity, our work emphasizes the bifurcation analysis of periodic solutions in blood flow with harmonic vorticity and external body forces. To utilize Crandall-Rabinowitz bifurcation theorem, the fundamental challenge lies in reducing a multiple variable-PDE subject to free boundary conditions to a system of one variable-ODE with fixed boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18500v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study linear backward parabolic SPDEs in bounded domains and present new a priori estimates for their weak solutions. Inspired by the seminal work of Y. Hu, J. Ma and J. Yong from 2002 on strong solutions, we establish $L^p$-estimates requiring minimal assumptions on the regularity of the coefficients, the terminal data, and the external force. Our approach relies on direct, constructive, and quantitative arguments, adapted from known methods in the theory of SPDEs to this setting. In particular, we develop a new It\^{o}'s formula for the $L^p$-norm of the backward solution, tailored to this setting and extending the classical result in the $L^2$-framework. This formula is then used to improve further the regularity of the first component of the solution up to $L^\infty$. We also present two applications: a local existence result for a semilinear equation without imposing any growth condition on the nonlinear term, and a novel local controllability result for semilinear backward SPDEs that partially resolves an open problem in the field.</description>

Abstract: We derive the explicit solution operator of an abstract Cauchy problem involving a time-variable coefficient and a fractional power of an almost sectorial operator. The time-variable coefficient is recovered by solving the inverse abstract Cauchy problem using the solution operator representation. As a complement, we also study similar problems by considering almost sectorial operators that depend on a time-variable.</description>

      <title>The time-relaxation limit for weak solutions to the quantum hydrodynamics system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes weak solutions of the quantum hydrodynamics (QHD) system with a collisional term posed on the one-dimensional torus. The main goal of our analysis is to rigorously prove the time-relaxation limit towards solutions to the quantum drift-diffusion (QDD) equation. \newline The existence of global in time, finite energy weak solutions can be proved by straightforwardly exploiting the polar factorization and wave function lifting tools previously developed by the authors. However, the sole energy bounds are not sufficient to show compactness and then pass to the limit. \newline For this reason, we consider a class of more regular weak solutions (termed GCP solutions), determined by the finiteness of a functional involving the chemical potential associated with the system. For solutions in this class and bounded away from vacuum, we prove the time-relaxation limit and provide an explicit convergence rate. \newline Our analysis exploits compactness tools and does not require the existence (and smoothness) of solutions to the limiting equations or the well-preparedness of the initial data. \newline As a by-product of our analysis, we also establish the existence of global in time $H^2$ solutions to a nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Langevin equation and construct solutions to the QDD equation as strong limits of GCP solutions to the QHD system.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Games without Rational Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean Field Game (MFG) models implicitly assume "rational expectations", meaning that the heterogeneous agents being modeled correctly know all relevant transition probabilities for the complex system they inhabit. When there is common noise, it becomes necessary to solve the "Master equation", in which the infinite-dimensional density of agents is a state variable. The rational expectations assumption and the implication that agents solve Master equations is unrealistic in many applications. We show how to instead formulate MFGs with non-rational expectations. Departing from rational expectations is particularly relevant in "MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling", i.e. MFGs in which agents' running reward function depends on the density only through low-dimensional functionals of this density. This happens, for example, in most macroeconomics MFGs in which these low-dimensional functionals have the interpretation of "equilibrium prices." In MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling, departing from rational expectations allows for completely sidestepping the Master equation and for instead solving much simpler finite-dimensional HJB equations. We introduce an adaptive learning model as a particular example of non-rational expectations and discuss its properties.</description>

      <title>On thermal transpiration and thermomolecular pressure difference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we demonstrate the phenomenon of thermal transpiration in a bounded convex domain. We employ the stationary Boltzmann equation with a cutoff potential. For boundary condition, we partition the boundary into diffuse reflection and incoming regions. We establish the existence of solution in a weighted $L^\infty$ space. Furthermore, we consider a convex domain with diffuse reflection boundary condition in the middle and incoming boundary condition at the two ends.
  We first consider Maxwellians with the same pressure but different temperatures at the two ends. We prove that the total flux $U(x)$ is directed toward the hot end. Furthermore, we derive an estimate for the total flux:
  \begin{align}
  U(x)\geq C\left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{T_2}}\right).
  \end{align}
  In addition, we show that when the pressures and temperatures on the two ends satisfy the relation
  \begin{align}
  \frac{P_1}{P_2}=\sqrt{\frac{T_1}{T_2}},
  \end{align}
  the total flux of the solution is of order $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\kappa})$. This result is consistent with Knudsen's finding of thermomolecular pressure difference in 1909.</description>

Abstract: We characterise the complex interpolation spaces of weighted vector-valued Sobolev spaces with and without boundary conditions on the half-space and on smooth bounded domains. The weights we consider are power weights that measure the distance to the boundary and do not necessarily belong to the class of Muckenhoupt $A_p$ weights. First, we determine the higher-order trace spaces for weighted vector-valued Besov, Triebel-Lizorkin, Bessel potential and Sobolev spaces. This allows us to derive a trace theorem for boundary operators and to interpolate spaces with boundary conditions. Furthermore, we derive density results for weighted Sobolev spaces with boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>$p$-Poincar\'e inequalities and cutoff Sobolev inequalities on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $p&gt;1$, we introduce the cutoff Sobolev inequality on general metric measure spaces, and prove that there exists a metric measure space endowed with a $p$-energy that satisfies the chain condition, the volume regular condition with respect to a doubling scaling function $\Phi$, and that both the Poincar\'e inequality and the the cutoff Sobolev inequality with respect to a doubling scaling function $\Psi$ hold if and only if $$\frac{1}{C}\left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^p\le\frac{\Psi(R)}{\Psi(r)}\le C\left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^{p-1}\frac{\Phi(R)}{\Phi(r)}\text{ for any }r\le R.$$ In particular, given any pair of doubling functions $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ satisfying the above inequality, we construct a metric measure space endowed with a $p$-energy on which all the above conditions are satisfied. As a direct corollary, we prove that there exists a metric measure space which is $d_h$-Ahlfors regular and has $p$-walk dimension $\beta_p$ if and only if $$p\le\beta_p\le d_h+(p-1).$$ Our proof builds on the Laakso-type space theory, which was recently developed by Murugan [Ann. Probab., to appear].</description>

      <title>Stability and Convergence of Modal Approximations in Coupled Thermoelastic Systems: Theory and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we review and analyze both the theoretical and numerical aspects of strongly and weakly coupled thermoelastic systems. By employing spectral analysis techniques and establishing uniform resolvent estimates, we derive uniform polynomial decay rates for the associated semigroups under a suitable class of boundary conditions. Particular attention is paid to the role of modal approximations in energy analysis. The theoretical results are complemented by numerical experiments that illustrate how the regularity of initial data, smooth versus nonsmooth, affects the observed decay rates, providing deeper insight into the interplay between spectral structure and energy dissipation.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order computational homogenization for hyperelastic media using gradient based sensitivity analysis of microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for the computational homogenization of locally periodic hyperelastic structures undergoing large deformations due to external quasi-static loading. The algorithm performs clustering of macroscopic deformations into subsets called "centroids", and, as a new ingredient, approximates the homogenized coefficients using sensitivity analysis of micro-configurations with respect to the macroscopic deformation. The novel "model-order reduction" approach significantly reduces the number of microscopic problems that must be solved in nonlinear simulations, thereby accelerating the overall computational process. The degree of reduction can be controlled by a user-defined error tolerance parameter. The algorithm is implemented in the finite element framework SfePy, and its performance effectiveness is demonstrated using two-dimensional test examples, when compared with solutions obtained by the proper orthogonal decomposition method, and by the full "FE-square" simulations. Extensions beyond the present implementations and the scope of tractable problems are discussed.</description>
