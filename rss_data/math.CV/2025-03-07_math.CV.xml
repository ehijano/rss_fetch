      <title>Polyharmonicity, Almansi-type decompositions and Fueter-Sce theorem for several Clifford variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study some harmonic properties of slice regular functions in one and several Clifford variables and give explicit formulas of the iterated Laplacian applied to slice regular functions and to their spherical derivative, which are new also in the one variable context. We propose several Almansi-type decompositions for slice functions in several Clifford variables. As a consequence, we establish a several variables version of Fueter-Sce theorem.</description>

      <title>Generalized Brieskorn Modules II: Higher Bernstein Polynomials and Multiple Poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our main result is to show that the existence of a root in. --$\alpha$--Nfor the p-th Bernstein polynomial of the (a,b)-module generated by a holomorphicform in the (convergent) Brieskorn (a,b)-module associated to f, under the hypothesis that f has an isolated singularity at the origin relative to the eigenvalue exp(2i$\pi$$\alpha$) of the monodromy, produces poles of order at least p for themeromorphic extension of the (conjugate) analytic functional given by polar partsat points--$\alpha$--N for N  well chosen integer. This result is new, even forp= 1. As a corollary, this implies that, in the case of an isolated singularity for f,the existence of a root in. --$\alpha$--N  for the p-th Bernstein polynomial of the (a,b)-module generated by a holomorphic form  implies the existence of at leastp roots (counting multiplicities) for the usual reduced Bernstein polynomial of thegerm of f at the origin.In the case of an isolated singularity for f, we obtain that for each $\alpha$ thebiggest root --$\alpha$--m. of the reduced Bernstein polynomial of f in --$\alpha$--N  producesa pole at--$\alpha$--m   for the meromorphic extension of the associated  distribution</description>

      <title>MMP for Generalized Pairs on K\"ahler 3-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we define generalized pairs $(X, B+\boldsymbol{\beta})$ where $X$ is an analytic variety and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a b-(1,1) current. We then prove that almost all standard results of the MMP hold in this generality for compact K\"ahler varieties of dim $X\leq 3$. More specifically, we prove the cone theorem, existence of flips, existence of log terminal models, log canonical models and Mori fiber spaces, the geography of log canonical and log terminal models, etc.</description>

      <title>Loewner traces driven by Levy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loewner chains with Levy drivers have been proposed as models for random dendritic growth in two dimensions, and as candidates for finding extremal multifractal spectra in problems in classical function theory. These processes are not scale-invariant in general, but they do enjoy a natural domain Markov property thanks to the stationary independent increments of Levy processes. The associated Loewner hulls feature remarkably intricate topological properties, of which very little is known rigorously.
  We prove that a chordal Loewner chain driven by a Levy process $W$ satisfying mild regularity conditions (including stable processes) is a.s. generated by a cadlag curve. Specifically, if the diffusivity parameter of the driving process $W$ is $\kappa \in [0,8)$, then the jump measure of $W$ is required to be locally (upper) Ahlfors regular near the origin, while if $\kappa &gt; 8$, no constraints are imposed. In particular, we show that the associated Loewner hulls are a.s. locally connected and path-connected. We also show that, the complements of the hulls are a.s. Holder domains when $\kappa \neq 4$ (which is not expected to hold when $\kappa=4$), without any regularity assumptions. The proofs of these results mainly rely on careful derivative estimates for both the forward and backward Loewner maps obtained using delicate but robust enough supermartingale domination arguments. As one cannot control the jump accumulation of general Levy processes, we must circumvent all reasoning that would use continuity. To prove the local connectedness, we use an extension of part of the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz theorem: hulls generated by cadlag curves are locally connected even when jumps would occur at infinite intensity.</description>

      <title>Generalized Cauchy-Riemann equations and relevant PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08941v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we give a survey of consequences from the theory of the Beltrami equations in the complex plane $\mathbb C$ to generalized Cauchy-Riemann equations $\nabla v = B \nabla u$ in the real plane $\mathbb R^2$ and clarify the relationships of the latter to the $A-$harmonic equation ${\rm div} A\,{\rm grad}\, u = 0$ with matrix valued coefficients $A$ that is one of the main equations of the potential theory, namely, of the hydro\-mechanics (fluid mechanics) in anisotropic and inhomogeneous media. The survey includes various types of results as theorems on existence, representation and regularity of their solutions, in particular, for the main boundary value problems of Hilbert, Dirichlet, Neumann, Poincare and Riemann.</description>
