      <title>ESPRESSO reveals a single but perturbed broad-line region in the supermassive black hole binary candidate PG 1302-102</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new, Bayesian analysis of the highest-resolution optical spectrum of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary candidate PG 1302-102, obtained with ESPRESSO@VLT (R \simeq 138, 000). Our methodology, based on robust Bayesian model selection, reveals the presence of multiple narrow emission lines at the expected redshift of the source and confirms (for H\{beta}) and detects (for H{\gamma}) the presence of redshifted broad components. Additionally, we have discovered a very broad and, if it is associated with the H\{beta}, very redshifted component at {\lambda} \simeq 5000{\AA}. We evaluate two scenarios for explaining the observed broad emission line (BEL) in PG 1302-102. In the case in which the redshifted BEL asymmetry arises from the orbital motion of a putative binary, our measurements coupled with simple estimates of the broad-line region (BLR) sizes suggest that the individual black hole BLRs are either settled in a single BLR or in the process of merging and, therefore truncated and highly disturbed. Alternatively, in the scenario of a single SMBH, we explain the distorted emission of the BELs with a nonsymmetric distribution of the BLR clouds; namely, a thin disk with a spiral perturbation. This BLR configuration is statistically preferred over any empirical multi-Gaussian fit and simultaneously explains the asymmetric emission of the H{\beta} and H{\gamma} close to the bulk of the line and any additional excess (or the lack of it, in the case of the H{\gamma}) at much longer wavelengths. The physical origins of the perturbation are unclear, and a connection with the possible presence of a black hole binary cannot be ruled out. Given the growing evidence from theoretical and observational works demonstrating the common presence of disturbed BLRs in active galactic nuclei, we argue that an origin related to self-gravitating instabilities may be more plausible.</description>

      <title>UNCOVER/MegaScience: No Evidence of Environmental Quenching in a z$\sim$2.6 Proto-cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental quenching -- where interactions with other galaxies and/or the intra-cluster medium (ICM) suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies -- has long been proposed as the primary driver to establish the red sequence for low-mass galaxies within clusters at low redshift ($z&lt;1$). However, we still do not know whether these environmental quenching mechanisms are also active at higher redshifts in proto-cluster environments that have yet to fully virialize. In large part, this regime has remained unexplored due to observational limitations; however, the James Webb Space Telescope has recently opened a new window into the role of environmental quenching on low-mass (log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$)$&lt;$9.5) galaxies at cosmic noon ($2 &lt; z &lt; 3$). Here, we use data from the JWST UNCOVER and MegaScience programs to directly probe the role of environmental quenching on low-mass galaxies in a newly-discovered $z\approx 2.6$ overdensity. Leveraging the deep imaging and R $\sim$ 15 spectrophotometry enabled by these JWST/NIRCam data, we analyze the stellar populations and inferred star formation histories (SFHs) of 20 low-mass (8.5$&lt;$log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$)$\leq$9.0) quiescent galaxies in the overdense environment and compare to a similar sample of 18 such galaxies in the field. The SFHs of quiescent galaxies in the proto-cluster and field across the entire probed stellar mass regime (8.5$&lt;$log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$)$\leq$11.0) are indistinguishable, demonstrating that the environment at cosmic noon is not yet accelerating quenching compared to the field. This is consistent with expectations that proto-clusters at $z&gt;2$ have yet to virialize and develop a dense enough environment to efficiently quench low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>The most metal poor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most metal-poor stars found in the Galaxy and in nearby galaxies are witnesses of the early evolution of the Universe. In a general picture in which we expect the metallicity to increase monotonically with time, as a result of the metal production in stars, we also expect the most metal-poor stars to be the most primitive objects accessible to our observations. The abundance ratios in these stars provide us important information on the first generations of stars that synthesised the nuclei that we observe in these stars. Because they are so primitive the modelling of their chemical inventory can be often satisfactorily achieved by assuming that all the metals were produced in a single supernova, or just a few. This is simpler than modelling the full chemical evolution, using different sources, that is necessary at higher metallicity. The price to pay for this relative ease of interpretation is that these stars are extremely rare and require specifically tailored observational strategies in order to assemble statistically significant samples of stars. In this review we try to summarise the main observational results that have been obtained in the last ten years.</description>

      <title>Stripped and Enriched: The Role of Ram-Pressure in Shaping Chemical Enrichment of Galaxies at Intermediate Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical evolution of galaxies is shaped by their star formation histories and the exchange of gas with their environments. Metallicity provides key insights into these processes, reflecting the interplay between star formation and gas flows. A fundamental aspect of this evolution is the mass-metallicity relation, which captures the strong correlation between a galaxy stellar mass ($M_\star$) and its gas-phase oxygen abundance. In this study, we use MUSE observations to analyze star-forming disc galaxies in 12 clusters within the redshift range $0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.5$. Galaxies were classified into three groups: ram-pressure stripping (RPS), control cluster, and control field. For the first time, we investigate the impact of RPS on gas-phase metallicities across a wide mass range of galaxies at intermediate redshift, comparing RPS galaxies to counterparts in both cluster and field environments. By analyzing the integrated flux within galactic disks, our results reveal that, on average, RPS induces a metallicity enhancement of 0.2 dex over non-stripped galaxies. Contrary to the prevailing view that cluster membership alone drives metallicity enrichment, we find that control cluster galaxies exhibit metallicities comparable to field galaxies at a given $M_\star$, with only RPS galaxies displaying significantly higher metal content, highlighting the unique role of RPS in shaping the chemical properties of galaxies. These differences become more pronounced at lower $M_\star$, indicating that environmental influences play a more critical role in shaping the chemical evolution of lower-mass galaxies. Our findings suggest that both enhanced star formation rates and suppressed gas inflows -- consequences of ram pressure stripping -- drive the elevated metallicity observed in RPS galaxies.</description>

      <title>Can a time evolving, asymmetric broad line region mimic a massive black hole binary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas within the influence sphere of accreting massive black holes is responsible for the emission of the broad lines observed in optical-UV spectra of unobscured active galactic nuclei. Since the region contributing the most to the broad emission lines (i.e. the broad line region) depends on the active galactic nucleus luminosity, the study of broad line reverberation to a varying continuum can map the morphology and kinematics of gas at sub-pc scales. In this study, we modify a preexisting model for disc-like broad line regions, including non-axisymmetric structures, by adopting an emissivity profile that mimics the observed luminosity-radius relation. This makes our implementation particularly well suited for the analysis of multi-epoch spectroscopic campaigns. After validating the model, we use it to check if strongly non-axisymmetric, single broad line regions could mimic the short time-scale evolution expected from massive black hole binaries. We explore different orientations and anisotropy degrees of the broad line region, as well as different light curve patterns of the continuum to which the broad line region responds. Our analysis confirms that recently proposed algorithms designed to search for massive black hole binaries in large multi-epoch spectroscopic data are not contaminated by false positives ascribed to anisotropic broad line regions around single MBHs.</description>

      <title>Chemical tagging with APOGEE, MUSE, and HST: constraints on the formation of $\omega$ Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A plethora of evidence suggests that $\omega$ Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is the nuclear star cluster of a galaxy that merged with the Milky Way in early times. We use APOGEE, Gaia, MUSE, and HST data supplemented by galaxy chemical evolution models to place constraints on the assembly and chemical enrichment history of $\omega$ Cen. The APOGEE data reveal three stellar populations occupying separate loci on canonical chemical planes. One population resembles metal-poor halo field stars (P1), a second shows light-element abundance anti-correlations typical of metal-poor globular clusters (IM), and a third population (P2) is characterised by an extreme "second-generation" abundance pattern. Both P1 and P2 populations cover a broad range of metallicity, consistent with extended histories of bursty star formation (SF), which is also evident from their light- and $\alpha$-element abundance patterns. Conversely, the IM stars exhibit a narrow metallicity spread, combined with the Al-Mg, Na-O, and C-N anti-correlations common to metal-poor Galactic globular clusters. Moreover, these three populations alone seem to account for the distribution of $\omega$ Cen stars in the chromosome map. We discuss these findings in context of a scenario according to which $\omega$ Cen formed by a combination of in situ SF within the host galaxy (P1), followed by the spiralling in of gas-rich globular clusters (IM), leading to another burst of SF (P2). We perform a robust comparison of the chemical composition of $\omega$ Cen with those of halo substructures well represented in APOGEE DR17, finding no chemical associations to a high confidence level.</description>

      <title>MACER3D -- an upgrade of MACER2D with enhanced subgrid models and gas physics -- and its application to simulating AGN feedback in a massive elliptical galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MACER3D (Multiscale AGN-regulated Cosmic Ecosystem Resolver in 3D), a new suite of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that study active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on galactic scales over Gyr duration, with major enhancement in subgrid models and gas physics over its predecessor -- MACER (Massive AGN Controlled Ellipticals Resolved) which is in two dimensions (hereafter MACER2D). MACER3D resolves gas dynamics from within the Bondi radius ($\sim 25\,\mathrm{pc}$) to halo scales. Combined with black hole accretion theory, it enables an accurate calculation of AGN outputs and subsequently their large-scale feedback effects. We present results from simulating an isolated elliptical galaxy with different feedback configurations. In the fiducial model with both AGN and supernova (SN) feedback, the temporal evolution of AGN luminosity and star formation rate are strongly correlated, suggesting shared dependence on the availability of gas supply for SMBH accretion and star formation. AGN duty cycles of several percent with a single-cycle timescale of $\sim 10^2\,\mathrm{Myr}$ agree with observations, while models with only AGN or SN feedback fail to reproduce observed cycles. While all models maintain a quiescent galaxy state, fiducial AGN+SN feedback model results in higher star formation than no-SN feedback, suggesting SN feedback, when acting synergistically with AGN feedback, may positively impact star formation. Combined AGN and SN feedback enhances halo-scale metal enrichment compared to single-feedback models. The simulated X-ray properties match observations and predict transient cavities produced by cold-mode AGN winds from past burst events. The differences between the results obtained by MACER2D and MACER3D are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Testing compact massive black hole binary candidates through multi-epoch spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission from two massive black holes (MBHs) bound in a close binary is expected to be modulated by different processes, such as Doppler boost due to the orbital motion, accretion rate variability generated by the interaction with a circumbinary disc, and binary gravitational self-lensing. When the binary is compact enough, the two black holes are thought to be surrounded by a common broad line region that reprocesses the impinging periodically varying ionising flux, creating broad emission lines with variable lineshapes. Therefore, the study of broad emission line variability through multi-epoch spectroscopic campaigns is of paramount importance for the unambiguous identification of a binary. In this work, we study the response of a disc-like broad line region to the Doppler-boosted ionising flux emitted by $\mathrm{sub-milli-pc}$ MBH binaries on a circular orbit and compare it with the response of a broad line region illuminated by a single MBH with a periodically but isotropically varying intrinsic luminosity.
  We show that in the binary case, the time lags of the blue and red wings of the broad emission lines, arising from diametrically opposite sides of the circumbinary disk, are out of phase by half of the binary's orbital period, as they each respond to the periodic "light-house" modulation from the binary's continuum emission. This asymmetric time-lag represents a new binary signature that can not be mimicked by a single MBH.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole signature as a kinematic diagnostic to constrain bar properties : implication for the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of a 'butterfly' or a quadrupole structure in the stellar mean radial velocity field of the Milky Way is well known from the Gaia and the APOGEE surveys. Past studies indicated that a stellar bar can excite such a quadrupole feature in the $&lt;V_R&gt;$ distribution. However, a systematic study investigating the co-evolution of bar and quadrupole structure is largely missing. Furthermore, whether this quadrupole structure in $&lt;V_R&gt;$ can be used as a robust kinematic diagnostic to constrain bar properties, particularly for the Milky Way, is still beyond our grasp. Here, we investigate the bar-induced quadrupole feature using a suite of isolated N-body models forming prominent bars and a sample of Milky Way-like barred galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. We demonstrate that the properties of the quadrupole (strength, length, and orientation) are strongly correlated with the bar properties, regardless of the choice of the stellar tracer population; thereby making the quadrupole feature an excellent kinematic diagnostic for constraining the bar properties. In presence of spirals, the estimator which takes into account the phase-angle of m=4 Fourier moment, serves as a more appropriate estimator for measuring the length of the quadrupole. Further, we constructed a novel Gaia-like mock dataset from a simulated bar model while incorporating the dust extinction and the broad trends of observational errors of the Gaia survey. The quadrupole properties (strength and length) estimated from those Gaia-like mock data are larger (~35-45 percent) when compared with their true values. We determined that the majority of this effect is due to the uncertainty in parallax measurement. This demonstrates the potential caveat of inferring Milky Way's bar properties by using the stellar kinematic information from the Gaia DR3 without properly accounting for the observational uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Exploring the dynamical state of Galactic open clusters using Gaia DR3 and observational parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic open clusters (OCs) are subject to internal and external destructive effects that gradually deplete their stellar content, leaving imprints on their structure. To investigate their dynamical state from an observational perspective, we employed Gaia DR3 data to perform a comprehensive analysis of 174 OCs (~10% of Dias et al.'s 2021 catalogue). We employed radial density profiles and astrometrically decontaminated colour-magnitude diagrams to derive structural parameters, distance, mass and time-related quantities. We explored the parameters space and searched for connections relating the clusters' structure with the internal evolutionary state and the external Galactic tidal field. Correlations were verified after segregating the sample according to the Galactocentric distance and half-light to Jacobi radius ratio ($r_h/R_J$). This tidal filling ratio decreases with both the cluster mass and dynamical age. At a given evolutionary stage, OCs with larger $r_h/R_J$ tend to present larger fractions of mass loss due to dynamical effects. Regarding the impact of the external conditions, we identified different evaporation regimes: for ambient densities ($\rho_{\rm{amb}}$) larger than ~0.1M$_{\odot}$/pc$^3$, clusters tend to be more tidally filled as they are subject to weaker tidal stresses. For $\rho_{\rm{amb}}$ $\lesssim$ 0.1M$_{\odot}$/pc$^3$, the opposite occurs: $R_J$ increases for smaller $\rho_{\rm{amb}}$, causing $r_h/R_J$ to decrease. In turn, two-body relaxation tends to compact the cluster core, which is less sensitive to variations of the external potential. The higher the degree of central concentration, the larger the number of relaxation times a cluster takes until its dissolution.</description>

      <title>Galactic-scale Quasar Pairs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We preform a systematic search for galactic-scale quasar pairs and small-scale (&lt;3 arcsec) lenses using the SDSS DR16 quasar catalog and Gaia DR3. Candidate double quasars (both are unobscured) are identified as Gaia resolved pairs around spectroscopically confirmed SDSS quasars ($L_{\rm bol} &gt; 10^{44.5} \ {\rm erg \ s^{-1}}$) at $0.5 &lt; z \lesssim 4.5$. Gaia astrometric information and SDSS spectral decomposition are used to exclude foreground star superpositions, which dominate ($\gtrsim 80\%$ of) the pair sample. We identify $136$ double quasar candidates from $1120$ Gaia-resolved pairs after a magnitude and redshift cut of $G&lt;20.5$ and $z&gt;0.5$ (803 double quasars out of 2,497 pairs without any cuts applied) with separations of $\sim$ 0.3 - 3 arcsec, corresponding to projected physical separations of $\sim$ 3 - 30 kpc at the median redshift of the sample of $z = 1.7$. We estimate an overall double quasar (lens and physical pairs combined) fraction using this sample, corrected for pair-resolving completeness, of $5.7_{-0.3}^{+0.3} \times 10^{-4}$ (bootstrapping errors). This double quasar fraction increases toward smaller separations, consistent with earlier findings. We also find little redshift evolution of the double quasar fraction for the luminous SDSS sample, consistent with previous observations and simulation predictions. However, the observed fraction is lower than simulation predictions by $\sim$0.8 - 1.6 dex, suggesting a significant population of obscured quasar pairs are missed in our search. Future wide-area space missions targeting both unobscured and obscured quasar pairs at sub-arcsec resolutions will reveal this population of obscured quasar pairs, and extend to much lower AGN luminosities.</description>

      <title>Analytic calculation of dynamical friction for Plummer sphere in ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical friction force acting on a spatially extended probe (globular clusters and dwarf galaxies) moving in the environment of ultralight bosonic dark matter in the state of the Bose-Einstein condensate is determined. Modeling the probe as a Plumer sphere of radius $l_p$, the radial and tangential components of the dynamic friction force are found in an analytic form, which reduce in the limit $l_p \to 0$ to the corresponding analytic expressions obtained in the literature in the case of a point probe. The dependence of dynamical friction force on boson particle mass $m$ was analyzed and found to be non-monotonous in the interval $10^{-23} - 10^{-21}$eV.</description>

      <title>Extraplanar [C II] and Halpha in the Edge-On Galaxy NGC 5775</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral galaxies are thin and susceptible to being disrupted vertically. The largest star clusters, and nuclear starbursts, generate enough energy from winds and supernovae to send disk material to the halo. % METHODS Observations of edge-on galaxies allow for the clearest view of vertical disruptions. We present new observations of the nearby, edge-on galaxy NGC 5775 with SOFIA [C II] 157.7 micron and archival images from Hubble in Halpha to search for extraplanar gas. The extraplanar [C II] extends 2 kpc from the midplane over much of the star-forming disk. The extraplanar [C II] at 2 kpc from the midplane approximately follows the rotation of the disk, with a lag of approximately 40 km/s; this lag is similar to what has been previously reported in Halpha. Significant vertical extensions (to 3 kpc) are seen on the northeast side of the galaxy, potentially due to super star clusters in the NGC 5775 disk combined with gravitational interaction with the companion galaxy NGC 5774. The Halpha narrow-band image reveals a narrow plume that extends 7 kpc from the nucleus and is almost exactly perpendicular to the disk. The plume shape is similar to that seen from the comparable galaxy NGC 3628 and may arise from the nuclear starburst. Alternatively, the Halpha plume could be a relic of past activity.</description>

      <title>Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS): New robust merger rates at intermediate redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mergers are fundamental to our understanding of the processes driving the evolution of the structure and morphology of galaxies, star formation, AGN activity, and the redistribution of stellar mass in the Universe. Determining the fraction and properties of mergers across cosmic time is critical to understanding the formation of the Universe we observe today. This fraction and its evolution also provide inputs and constraints for cosmological simulations, crucial for theoretical models of galaxy evolution. We present robust estimates of major close-pair fractions and merger rates at $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.9$ in the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS). We identify major mergers by selecting close-pairs with a projected spatial separation $r_{\mathrm{sep}} &lt; 20$ h$^{-1}$ kpc and a radial velocity separation $v_{\mathrm{sep}} &lt; 500$ km s$^{-1}$. For galaxies with stellar masses of log$_{10}$($M_\star$/$M_\odot$) = 10.66 $\pm$ 0.25 dex, we find a major close-pair fraction of $\approx 0.021$ at $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.34$ using a highly complete, unbiased spectroscopic sample. We extend these estimates to $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.9$ by combining the full probability distribution of redshifts for galaxies with high-quality spectroscopic, photometric, or grism measurements. Fitting a power-law $\gamma_{m} = A(1 + z)^m$, we find $A = 0.024 \pm 0.001$ and $m = 0.55 \pm 0.22$. Consistent with previous results, the shallow slope suggests weak redshift evolution in the merger fraction. When comparing with large hydrodynamical simulations, we also find consistent results. We convert close-pair fractions to merger rates using several literature prescriptions for merger timescales and provide all measurements for future studies.</description>

      <title>A multi-scale view of the magnetic field morphology in the hot molecular core G31.41+0.31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiscale studies of the morphology and strength of the magnetic field are crucial to properly unveil its role and relative importance in high-mass star and cluster formation. G31.41+0.31 (G31) is a hub-filament system that hosts a high-mass protocluster embedded in a hot molecular core (HMC). G31 is one of the few sources showing a clear hourglass morphology of the magnetic field on scales between 1000 au and a few 100 au in previous interferometric observations. This strongly suggests a field-regulated collapse. To complete the study of the magnetic field properties in this high-mass star-forming region, we carried out observations with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope $850 \mu$m of the polarized dust emission. These observations had a spatial resolution of $\sim$0.2 pc at 3.75 kpc. The aim was to study the magnetic field in the whole cloud and to compare the magnetic field orientation toward the HMC from $\sim$50,000 au to $\sim$260 au scales. The large-scale ($\sim$5 pc) orientation of the magnetic field toward the position of the HMC is consistent with that observed at the core ($\sim$4,000 au) and circumstellar ($\sim$260 au) scales. The self-similarity of the magnetic field orientation at these different scales might arise from the brightest sources in the protocluster, whose collapse is dragging the magnetic field. These sources dominate the gravitational potential and the collapse in the HMC. The cloud-scale magnetic field strength of the G31 hub-filament system, which we estimated using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, is in the range 0.04--0.09 mG. The magnetic field orientation in the star-forming region shows a bimodal distribution, and it changes from an NW--SE direction in the north to an E--W direction in the south [abridged abstract].</description>

      <title>Evidence of star cluster migration and merger in dwarf galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are the densest stellar systems in the Universe. They can be found at the center of all galaxy types, but tend to favor galaxies of intermediate stellar mass around 10$^9\,$M$_{\odot}$[1, 2]. Currently, two main processes are under debate to explain their formation: in-situ star-formation from gas infall[3] and migration and merging of globular clusters (GCs) caused by dynamical friction[4]. Studies[5-9] of NSC stellar populations suggest that the former predominates in massive galaxies, the latter prevails in dwarf galaxies, and both contribute equally at intermediate mass. However, up to now, no ongoing merger of GCs has yet been observed to confirm this scenario. Here we report the serendipitous discovery of five dwarf galaxies with complex nuclear regions, characterized by multiple nuclei and tidal tails, using high resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope. These structures have been reproduced in complementary N-body simulations, supporting the interpretation that they result from migrating and merging of star clusters. The small detection rate and short simulated timescales (below 100 Myr) of this process may explain why this has not been observed previously. This study highlights the need of large surveys with high resolution to fully map the migration scenario steps.</description>

      <title>FOREVER22: Insights into star formation and clustering properties of protoclusters from simulations and JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with radiative transfer, we investigate star formation and overdensity ($\delta$) in Coma-type cluster progenitors from $z=14$ to 6. Our simulations reproduce observed $M_{\rm star}$-SFR relations and $\delta$ at these redshifts. We find: (1) protocluster (PC) and mean-density field (MF) galaxies show similar $M_{\rm star}$-SFR relations, with PC galaxies extending to higher $M_{\rm star}$ and SFR. (2) UV-bright PC galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}\lesssim -20$~mag) have $&gt;2$ mag higher UV attenuation and shallower UV slopes than MF galaxies. (3) $\delta$ increases with redshift, depending on observational parameters (e.g., $\delta\sim50$ at $z=14$ to $\delta\sim3$ at $z=6$ for a search volume of $\sim3000$~cMpc$^3$ and a limiting magnitude of $M_{\rm UV}=-17$~mag). These results indicate that enhanced star formation in PCs is driven by massive galaxy overdensity, not anomalously high specific SFR. While simulated $\delta$ agrees with observed PC candidates (potential Coma progenitors), some MF galaxies show comparable $\delta$. We propose a robust PC identification method using both $\delta$ and $M_{\rm star}$ of the most massive member. Critical $M_{\rm star}$ thresholds for Coma progenitors are estimated ($10^{7.1}$ to $10^{10.2}$ M$_\odot$ from $z=14$ to 6). Comparison with JWST observations suggests GS-z14-0 and GS-z14-1, the current highest redshift holders, are likely progenitors of Coma-type clusters.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-ATOMS survey: A sample of weak hot core candidates identified through line stacking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot cores represent critical astrophysical environments for high-mass star formation, distinguished by their rich spectra of organic molecular emission lines. We aim to utilize high-angular resolution molecular line data from ALMA to identify hot cores, with a particular focus on weak-emission candidates, and to provide one of the largest samples of hot core candidates. We propose to use spectral stacking and imaging techniques of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the ALMA-ATOMS survey, including line identification &amp; weights, segmentation of line datacubes, resampling, stacking and normalization, moment 0 maps, and data analysis, to search for hot core candidates. We classify cores with dense emission of CH3OH and at least one molecule from the other six molecules as hot core candidates. In addition to the existing sample of 60 strong hot cores from the ALMA-ATOMS survey, we have detected 40 new weak candidates through stacking. All hot core candidates display compact emission from at least one of the other six COM species. For the strong sample, the stacking method provides molecular column density estimates that are consistent with previous fitting results. For the newly identified weak candidates, all species except CH3CHO show compact emission in the stacked image, which cannot be fully resolved spatially. These weak candidates exhibit column densities of COMs that are approximately one order of magnitude lower than those of the strong sample. The entire hot core sample, including the weak candidates, reveals tight correlations between the compact emission of CH3OH and other COM species, suggesting they may share a similar chemical environment for COMs, with CH3OH potentially acting as a precursor for other COMs. The molecular line stacking technique is used to identify hot core candidates in this work, leading to the identification of 40 new hot core candidates.</description>

      <title>The Lyman-alpha and Continuum Origins Survey I: Survey description and Ly$\alpha$ imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms driving the escape of ionizing or Lyman continuum (LyC) emission from the interstellar medium of galaxies is necessary to constrain the evolution of Reionization, and the sources responsible for it. While progress has been made into identifying the global galaxy properties linked to the escape fraction of ionizing radiation, f$_{esc}^{LyC}$, little is currently known about how spatially resolved galaxy properties impact this parameter. We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data obtained as part of the Lyman $\alpha$ and Continuum Origins Survey (LaCOS). LaCOS consists of HST imaging in 5 filters covering rest-frame optical and UV bands for a subsample of 42 galaxies in the Low redshift Lyman Continuum Survey, 22 being Lyman continuum emitters ($f_{esc}^{LyC}=0.01-0.49$). These data allow for investigations of the connection between sub-kpc stellar and nebular properties, including Ly$\alpha$ emission, and $f_{esc}^{LyC}$. Here, we describe the sample selection, observations and data reduction methods. Additionally, we present results on the link between global and resolved Ly$\alpha$ photometry and $f_{esc}^{LyC}$. We find similar trends between global photometric observables ($L_{Ly\alpha}$, $EW_{Ly\alpha}$, $f_{esc}^{Ly\alpha}$, $r_{50}$, $\Sigma_{SFR}$) and $f_{esc}^{LyC}$ as previously found with spectroscopy, but the correlations generally show a slightly smaller degree of correlations. However, we do find strong correlations between Ly$\alpha$ observables ($L_{Ly\alpha}$,$EW_{Ly\alpha}$) and $f_{esc}^{LyC}$ when measured in a small aperture around the brightest UV source in each galaxy. We interpret these results as evidence that LyC photons escaping on the line-of-sight are contributed by a small number of UV-bright compact regions in most galaxies in our sample.</description>

      <title>The Lyman-alpha and Continuum Origins Survey II: the uneventful journey of escaping Ly$\alpha$ and ionizing radiation through the neutral ISM and CGM of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the current challenges in galaxy evolution studies is to establish the mechanisms that govern the escape of ionizing radiation from galaxies. In this work, we investigate the connection between Lyman Continuum (LyC) escape and the conditions of the Circumgalactic Medium (CGM), as probed by Ly$\alpha$ halos (LAHs) in emission. We use Ly$\alpha$ and UV continuum imaging data from the Lyman alpha and Continuum Origins Survey (LaCOS), targeting 42 nearby ($z \simeq 0.3$), star-forming galaxies with LyC observations (escape fractions of $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC} \simeq 0.01-0.49$). LaCOS galaxies show extended Ly$\alpha$ emission ubiquitously, with LyC emitters (LCEs) having more compact Ly$\alpha$ morphologies relative to the UV size than non-LCEs, and Ly$\alpha$ spatial offsets that do not exceed the extent of the UV continuum. We model the diffuse LAHs using a combined Sersic plus exponential 2D profile, and find that the characteristic scale length of the Ly$\alpha$ is ten times the scale length of the UV, on average. We unveil a tight anti-correlation between $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ and the Ly$\alpha$ Halo Fraction (HF, or contribution of the halo to the total Ly$\alpha$ luminosity), that we propose as a new LyC indicator. Our observations also show that the HF scales positively with the neutral gas in the ISM, revealing a picture in which Ly$\alpha$ and LyC photons in LCEs emerge through clear sight-lines directly from the central starbursts and, in the case of Ly$\alpha$, minimizing the number of scattering interactions in the CGM. The properties of LAHs in LaCOS resemble those of LAHs at $z \geq 3$, suggesting a lack of evolution in the $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ predictors that rely on the spatial properties of Ly$\alpha$, and ensuring the applicability of these indicators to observations of high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Unexpected clustering pattern in dwarf galaxies challenges formation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03305v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The galaxy correlation function serves as a fundamental tool for studying cosmology, galaxy formation, and the nature of dark matter. It is well established that more massive, redder and more compact galaxies tend to have stronger clustering in space. These results can be understood in terms of galaxy formation in Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halos of different mass and assembly history. Here, we report an unexpectedly strong large-scale clustering for isolated, diffuse and blue dwarf galaxies, comparable to that seen for massive galaxy groups but much stronger than that expected from their halo mass. Our analysis indicates that the strong clustering aligns with the halo assembly bias seen in simulations with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology only if more diffuse dwarfs formed in low-mass halos of older ages. This pattern is not reproduced by existing models of galaxy evolution in a $\Lambda$CDM framework, and our finding provides new clues for the search of more viable models. Our results can be explained well by assuming self-interacting dark matter, suggesting that such a scenario should be considered seriously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high resolution follow-up data of the planetary microlensing event MOA-2010-BLG-328, using Keck and the Hubble. Keck data, taken 8 years after the event, reveal a strong lens detection enabling a direct measurement of lens flux and source-lens relative proper motion. We find the relative source-lens proper motion to be $\mu_{\rm rel, Hel} = 4.07 \pm 0.34\ \rm mas\ yr^{-1}$, with the lens being $\sim10$ times fainter than the source. The lens was very faint in the Hubble passbands, and the small lens-source separation of $\sim$35 mas made its detection difficult. However, we obtained estimates of the lens magnitudes in Hubble bands by constraining its location to match the Keck K-band detection. The original analysis by \citet{Furusawa2013} reports a degenerate light curve, with several viable models depending on higher-order effects. We attempt to break the degeneracy by remodeling the event using constraints from follow-up data. Our best fit model includes parallax, orbital motion, xallarap and the magnification of a source companion. Models omitting any of these are excluded. However, even with a lens detection the solution remains unclear, as the degeneracy between a nearby late M dwarf and a distant early M dwarf in the disk persists, and cannot be broken with NIR data alone. We conclude the lens is either a $\sim0.2\ M_{\odot}$ star at $2-3$kpc, or a $\sim0.5\ M_{\odot}$ star at $4-5$kpc. This study highlights the importance of multi-band data and comprehensive modeling to resolve microlensing degeneracies.</description>

Much is known about this problem if the specified force is non-relativistic gravity, and considerable progress has been made by considering the problem in one spatial dimension. Here, I review what is known about the relativistic gravitational $N$-body problem. Reduction to one spatial dimension has the feature of the absence of gravitational radiation, thereby allowing for a clear comparison between the physics of one-dimensional relativistic and non-relativistic self-gravitating systems. After describing how to obtain a relativistic theory of gravity coupled to $N$ point particles, I discuss in turn the two-body, three-body, four-body, and $N$-body problems. Quite general exact solutions can be obtained for the two-body problem, unlike the situation in general relativity in three spatial dimensions for which only highly specified solutions exist. The three-body problem exhibits mild forms of chaos, and provides one of the first theoretical settings in which relativistic chaos can be studied. For $N\geq 4$, other interesting features emerge. Relativistic self-gravitating systems have a number of interesting problems awaiting further investigation, providing us with a new frontier for exploring relativistic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Comptonizing medium of the black-hole candidate Swift J1727.8$-$1613 along the hard to hard-intermediate state transition using NICER</title>

Abstract: We analyse the properties of the Comptonizing medium in the black-hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 using the time-dependent Comptonization model vkompth, using NICER observations of type-C QPOs in the hard and hard-intermediate states. During the 2023 outburst of the source, we measure the rms and phase lags of the QPO across 45 observations as the QPO frequency, $\nu_{\rm QPO}$, evolves from $\sim 0.3$ Hz to $\sim 7$ Hz. By simultaneously fitting the time-averaged spectrum of the source and the rms and lag spectra of the QPO, we derive the evolution of the disk and corona parameters. At $\nu_{\rm QPO} = 0.34$ Hz, the QPO phase lags are hard, with 10 keV photons lagging 0.5 keV photons by $\sim 0.5$ rad. As $\nu_{\rm QPO}$ increases, the lags for the same energy bands decrease, reaching near zero at $\nu_{\rm QPO} \sim 1.2$ Hz, and then reverse to soft lags of $\sim -1.1$ rad at $\nu_{\rm QPO} \sim 7$ Hz. Initially, the inner radius of the accretion disk is truncated at $\sim 30-40 R_g$ (assuming a 10 solar-mass black hole) and, as the QPO frequency increases, the truncation radius decreases down to $\sim 10 R_g$. Initially, two coronas of sizes of $\sim 6.5 \times 10^3$ km and $\sim 2 \times 10^3$ km, extend over the disk and are illuminated by different regions of the disk. As the QPO frequency increases, both the coronas shrink to $\sim 2 \times 10^3$ km at $\nu_{\rm QPO} = 2.5$ Hz. Following a data gap, one corona expands again, peaking at a size of $\sim 2 \times 10^4$ km. We interpret the evolution of the coronal size in the context of accompanying radio observations, discussing its implications for the interplay between the corona and the jet.</description>

      <title>Universal profile for cosmic birefringence tomography with radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to tomographically probe cosmic birefringence using radio galaxies. We show that the redshift evolution of the cosmic birefringence angle induced by a slow-rolling pseudoscalar field, which is a candidate for dynamical dark energy, is independent of the detailed model of the pseudoscalor field. This universal profile evolves predominantly at $z\lesssim10$. In contrast, if the origin is a dark matter-like pseudscalor field, the resulting birefringence angle tends to be negligible in the low-redshift regime. This new insight provides a strong motivation to independently test the cosmic birefringence using polarized astrophysical sources such as radio galaxies. We find that a sample size of $\order{10^5-10^6}$ is required to distinguish the profiles, which is achievable with ongoing and upcoming radio surveys such as ASKAP or SKA.</description>

      <title>Revealing the ages of metal-rich RR Lyrae via kinematic label transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RR Lyrae stars have long been considered reliable tracers of old, metal-poor populations, primarily due to their prevalence in globular clusters and the Galactic halo. However, the discovery of a metal-rich subpopulation in the Galactic disc, kinematically colder and more rotationally supported, challenges this classical view. Understanding the age of these metal-rich RR Lyrae stars is crucial for constraining their formation pathways and assessing what Galactic populations they are tracing. In this work, we leverage the unprecedented astrometric precision of Gaia DR3 to infer the age distribution of metal-rich RR Lyrae stars through a kinematic comparison with O-rich Mira variables. Mira variables, with their well-established period-age relation, serve as a natural clock, allowing us to transfer age information to RR Lyrae stars via their phase-space properties. By applying this approach across different metallicity bins, we find that the most metal-rich RR Lyrae stars ($[\rm Fe/H] &gt; -0.5$) exhibit kinematics consistent with a population significantly younger ($\approx 6-7$ Gyr) than typically assumed for RR Lyrae stars. In contrast, those with $-1 &lt; [\rm Fe/H] &lt; -0.5$ show properties more aligned with older ($\approx 9-11$ Gyr) populations. Interestingly, we also find evidence of a possible double age populations for the most metal-rich RR Lyrae, one younger with ages between 3 and 6 Gyr, and another one older ranging from 8 to 11 Gyr. These results provide strong evidence that metal-rich RR Lyrae stars in the Galactic field do not exclusively trace ancient populations. This finding challenges the current model of RR Lyrae formation and supports alternative formation scenarios, such as binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Measuring and predicting galaxy assembly bias across galaxy samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most important effects shaping small-scale galaxy clustering is galaxy assembly bias, which refers to the dependence of galaxy clustering on halo properties. We investigate this effect using galaxy samples selected according to stellar mass, r-band magnitude, and broad-band colors from the largest hydrodynamical simulation of the IllustrisTNG suite. We find that galaxy assembly bias depends strongly upon the selection criteria, number density, and redshift of the sample, increasing or decreasing the clustering by as much as 25%. Interestingly, no single secondary halo property fully captures the strength of this effect for any galaxy population. Therefore, empirical approaches modeling galaxy assembly bias as a function of a single halo property cannot reproduce predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. We then study how galaxy assembly bias emerges from the interplay of halo assembly bias -- the dependence of halo clustering on properties other than mass -- and occupancy variation -- the correlation between galaxy occupation and secondary halo properties -- and provide an analytical expression that predicts the amount of galaxy assembly bias caused by any halo property. This expression facilitates understanding the dependence of galaxy assembly bias on halo properties and enables the straightforward incorporation of this effect into halo model approaches.</description>

      <title>Microlensing at Cosmological Distances: Event Rate Predictions in the Warhol Arc of MACS 0416</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly magnified stars ($\mu$ $&gt;$ 100) are now outinely identified as transient events at cosmological distances thanks to microlensing by intra-cluster stars near the critical curves of galaxy clusters. Using the {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) in combination with the {\it Hubble} Space Telescope (HST), we outline here an analytical framework that is applied to the Warhol arc (at $z=0.94$) in the MACS 0416 galaxy cluster (at $z=0.396)$ where over a dozen microlensed stars have been detected to date. This method is general and can be applied to other lensed arcs. Within this lensed galaxy we fit the spatially resolved SED spanned by eight JWST-NIRCam filters combined with three ACS filters, for accurate lensed star predictions in 2D. With this tool we can generate 2D maps of microlensed stars for well resolved arcs in general, including dependence on wavelength and limiting apparent magnitude, for comparison with with planned cadenced campaigns for JWST and Hubble, for constraining directly the IMF and the level of dark matter substructure.</description>

      <title>New empirical mass-loss recipe for UV radiation line-driven winds of hot stars across various metallicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The winds of massive stars remove a significant fraction of their mass, strongly impacting their evolution. As a star evolves, the rate at which it loses mass changes. In stellar evolution codes, different mass-loss recipes are employed for different evolutionary stages. The choice of the recipes is user-dependent and the conditions for switching between them are poorly defined. Focusing on hot stars, we aim to produce a physically motivated, empirically calibrated mass-loss recipe suitable for a wide range of metallicities. We want to provide a ready-to-use universal recipe that eliminates the need for switching between recipes for hot stars during stellar evolution calculations. We compile a sample of hot stars with reliable stellar and wind parameters in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. The sample is used to determine the dependence of the mass-loss rate on the basic stellar parameters. We find that independent of evolutionary stage and temperature, the wind mass-loss rate is a function of the electron-scattering Eddington parameter ($\Gamma_e$) and metallicity (Z), being in line with expectations of radiation-driven wind theory. Our derived scaling relation provides an adequate ($\Delta$log($\dot{M}$/(M$_\odot$/yr)) = 0.43) and broadly applicable mass-loss recipe for hot stars. The newly derived mass-loss recipe covers nearly the entire parameter space of hot stars with UV radiation-driven winds and eliminates the need for interpolation between mass-loss formulae at different evolutionary stages when applied in stellar evolution models. Examples of stellar evolution calculations using our new recipe reveal that the predictions on the ionizing fluxes and final fates of massive stars, especially at low metallicity, differ significantly from models that use the standard mass-loss rates, impacting our understanding of stellar populations at low metallicity and in the young Universe.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Evidence for Lensing-Induced Alignments of High-Redshift Galaxies in JWST-CEERS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The majority of low-mass ($\log_{10} M_*/M_{\odot}=9-10$) galaxies at high redshift ($z&gt;1$) appear elongated in projection. We use JWST-CEERS observations to explore the role of gravitational lensing in this puzzle. The typical galaxy-galaxy lensing shear $\gamma\sim1\%$ is too low to explain the predominance of elongated early galaxies with ellipticity $e\approx0.6$. However, non-parametric quantile regression with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees reveals hints of an excess of tangentially-aligned source-lens pairs with $\gamma&gt;10\%$. On larger scales, we also find evidence for weak lensing shear. We rule out the null hypothesis of randomly oriented galaxies at $\gtrsim99\%$ significance in multiple NIRCam chips, modules and pointings. The number of such regions is small and attributable to chance, but coherent alignment patterns suggest otherwise. On the chip scale, the average complex ellipticity $\langle e\rangle\sim10\%$ is non-negligible and beyond the level of our PSF uncertainties. The shear variance $\langle\overline{\gamma}^2\rangle\sim10^{-3}$ is an order of magnitude above the conventional weak lensing regime but is more sensitive to PSF systematics, intrinsic alignments, cosmic variance and other biases. Taking it as an upper limit, the maximum implied ``cosmic shear'' is only a few percent and cannot explain the elongated shapes of early galaxies. The alignments themselves may arise from lensing by a protocluster or filament at $z\sim0.75$ where we find an overabundance of massive lens galaxies. We recommend a weak lensing search for overdensities in ``blank'' deep fields with JWST and the Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>A Galaxy with an Extremely Blue UV Slope $\beta=-3$ at $z=9.25$ Identified by JWST Spectroscopy: Evidence for a Weak Nebular Continuum and Efficient Ionizing Photon Escape?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate UV continuum slopes $\beta$ of 863 galaxies at $z=4-14$ using archival JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectra obtained from major JWST GTO, ERS, and GO programs, including JADES, CEERS, and UNCOVER. Among these galaxies, we identify a remarkable galaxy at $z=9.25$, dubbed EBG-1, with a significantly blue UV slope $\beta=-2.99\pm0.15$, unlike the rest of the galaxies that exhibit red continua or ambiguous blue continua hindered by large uncertainties. We confirm that the $\beta$ value negligibly changes by the data reduction and fitting wavelength ranges for UV emission/absorption line masking. The extreme blue slope, $\beta=-3.0$, rules out significant contributions from dust extinction or AGN activity. Comparing with stellar and nebular emission models, we find that such a blue UV slope cannot be reproduced solely by stellar models even with very young, metal-poor, or top-heavy contiguous star formation associated with strong nebular continua making the UV slopes red, but with a high ionizing photon escape fraction, $f_\mathrm{esc}^\mathrm{ion} \gtrsim 0.5$, for a weak nebular continuum. While the H$\beta$ emission line is not detected, likely due to the limited sensitivity of the spectrum, we find moderately weak [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 emission lines for the given star-formation rate ($3\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) and stellar mass ($10^{8.0} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) that are about three times weaker than the average emission lines, again suggestive of the high ionizing photon escape fraction, $f_\mathrm{esc}^\mathrm{ion} \sim 0.7$ or more. EBG-1 would provide crucial insights into stellar and nebular continuum emission in high-redshift galaxies, serving as an example of the ionizing photon escaping site at the epoch of reionization.</description>

      <title>Galaxy infall models for arbitrary velocity directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For most galaxies in the cosmos, our knowledge of their motion is limited to line-of-sight velocities from redshift observations. To determine the radial velocity between two galaxies the minor and major infall models were established by Karachentsev and Kashibadze (2006). Regardless of the background cosmology, our derivations reveal that these infall models approximate the total radial velocity between two galaxies by two different projections employing different information about the system. For galaxies having small angular separations $\theta$, all infall models agree that the radial velocity is the difference of their line-of-sight components. Applying these models to ca. $500$ halos of the Illustris-3 simulation, we find the perpendicular and tangential velocity parts to be non-negligible for more than 90% of all, more than 5000 infalling subhalos. Thus, even for $\theta &lt; 10$ deg, the infall-model velocities deviate from the true radial velocity. Only for 30% we found the true one lay between the minor and major infall velocity. However, the infall models yield robust upper and lower bounds to the true radial velocity dispersion. Observed under $\theta &lt; 10$ deg the velocity dispersion inferred from the sole difference of line-of-sight velocity components even coincides with the true one, justifying this approach for high-redshift groups and clusters. Based on these findings, we predict the radial velocity dispersion of the M81-group from the minor infall model (upper bound) $\sigma_{\mathrm{r,min}} = (193 \pm 42)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$, from the major infall model (lower bound) $\sigma_{\mathrm{r,maj}} = (129 \pm 64) ~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$ and $\sigma_\mathrm{r,\Delta v} = (102 \pm 36)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}$ from the line-of-sight-velocity difference.</description>

      <title>Tracing High-z Galaxies in X-rays with JWST and Chandra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We leverage JWST data from the COSMOS-Web Survey in order to provide updated measurements on the auto-power spectrum of the now resolved Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and its coherence with the unresolved soft Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) observed by Chandra at z &gt; 6. Maps of the CIB in the F277W and F444W NIRCam filters are constructed with sources fainter than AB mag = 25 and cross-correlated with the CXB in the [0.5-2] keV band. We find that on scales between 1 and 1000'' the CIB-CXB cross-power in both NIRCam filters is statistically significant with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of 4.80 and 6.20 respectively from redshifts 0 &lt; z &lt; 13. In our high-z (6 &lt; z &lt; 13) interval we find coherence in both filters with a S/N of 7.32 and 5.39 respectively. These results suggest that there are X-ray emitting galaxies resolved by JWST, including star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We fit the large-scale biasing of the IR sources producing the CIB as a function of z with results consistent with prior measurements and place constraints on the CXB flux and biasing at low- and high-z. The CXB flux measurements presented in this study suggest that approximately 94% of the [0.5-2] keV CXB is resolved, and this value is consistent within 2$\sigma$ with the complete resolution of the [0.5-2] keV CXB.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation between soft X-rays and galaxies A new benchmark for galaxy evolution models</title>

Abstract: This article presents the construction and validation of complete stellar mass-selected, volume-limited galaxy samples using the Legacy Survey (data release 10) galaxy catalogs, covering $\sim16,800$ deg$^2$ of extra-galactic sky, and extending to redshift $z&lt;0.35$. We measure the correlation function of these galaxies with tiny statistical uncertainties at the percent level and systematic uncertainties up to 5\%. A 4-parameter halo occupation distribution (HOD) model is fitted to retrieve the population of host halos, yielding results on the stellar to halo mass relation consistent with the current models of galaxy formation and evolution. Using these complete galaxy samples, we measure and analyze the cross-correlation (X-corr) between galaxies and all soft X-ray photons observed by SRG/eROSITA in the 0.5-2 keV band over $\sim13,000$ deg$^2$. The cross correlation measurements have unprecedented sub-percent statistical uncertainty and ~5-10\% systematic uncertainty.
  An extension to the halo model is introduced to interpret the X-corr, decomposing contributions from X-ray point sources, hot gas (CGM), satellites, and the 2-halo term. For low stellar mass thresholds ($\log M^*/M_{\odot}&gt;$ 10, 10.25, 10.5), we find that the point source emission dominates the X-corr at small separation ($r&lt;80$kpc). Then, in the range ($80&lt;r&lt;2$Mpc), the emission from large halos hosting satellite galaxies dominates. Finally, on scales beyond that considered here ($r&gt;2$Mpc), the 2-halo term becomes dominant. Interestingly, there is no scale at which the CGM dominates. In the range ($20&lt;r&lt;200$kpc), the CGM contributes to more than 10\% of the signal. Progressively, with the minimum stellar mass increasing, the CGM emission increases. We constrain the $M_{500c}-L_X$ scaling relation slope, $1.629^{+0.091}_{-0.089}$, at the 5\% level using the samples with the lowest mass threshold.</description>

      <title>The Local Group Symbiotic Star Population and its Tenuous Link with Type Ia Supernovae</title>

Abstract: Binary stars are gravitationally bound stellar systems where the evolution of each component can significantly influence the evolution of its companion and the system as a whole. In certain cases, the evolution of these systems can lead to the formation of a red giant-white dwarf system, which may exhibit symbiotic characteristics. The primary goal of this work is to contribute in a statistical way to the estimation of the symbiotic system (SySt) population in the Milky Way and in the dwarf galaxies of the Local Group (LG). Additionally, we aim to infer the maximum contribution of SySt to Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) events. Given the significant discrepancies in previous estimates, we propose two distinct approaches to constrain the expected SySt population: one empirical and another theoretical. These approaches are designed to provide a robust estimation of the SySt population. For the Milky Way, we utilized position and velocity data of known SySts to determine their distribution. Based on these properties, we constrained the lower limit for the Galactic SySt population in the range of 800-4,100. Our theoretical approach, which relies on the properties of zero-age main-sequence binaries and known binary evolutionary paths, suggests a SySt population of $(53\pm6)\times10^3$ SySt in the Galaxy. The statistical SySt populations for LG dwarf galaxies are one to four orders of magnitude lower, primarily dependent on the galaxies' bolometric luminosity and, to a lesser extent, their binary fraction and metallicity. In this work, the contribution of the single-degenerate channel of SNe Ia from symbiotic progenitors is estimated to be of the order of 1% for the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Disk Thickness in M51 from H-alpha, Pa-alpha, and Mid-Infrared Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power spectra (PS) of high-resolution images of M51 (NGC 5194) taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope have been examined for evidence of disk thickness in the form of a change in slope between large scales, which map two-dimensional correlated structures, and small scales, which map three-dimensional correlated structures. Such a slope change is observed here in H-alpha, and possibly Pa-alpha, using average PS of azimuthal intensity scans that avoid bright peaks. The physical scale of the slope change occurs at ~120 pc and ~170 pc for these two transitions, respectively. A radial dependence in the shape of the H-alpha PS also suggests that the length scale drops from ~180 pc at 5 kpc, to ~90 pc at 2 kpc, to ~25 pc in the central ~kpc. We interpret these lengths as comparable to the thicknesses of the star-forming disk traced by HII regions. The corresponding emission measure is ~100 times larger than what is expected from the diffuse ionized gas. PS of JWST Mid-IR Instrument (MIRI) images in 8 passbands have more gradual changes in slope, making it difficult to determine a specific value of the thickness for this emission.</description>

      <title>Recent star formation in 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.5 quiescent galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of massive, quiescent galaxies reveal a relatively uniform evolution: following prolific star formation in the early universe, these galaxies quench and transition to their characteristic quiescent state in the local universe. The debate on the relative role and frequency of the process(es) driving this evolution is robust. In this letter, we identify 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.5 massive, quiescent galaxies in the HST/UVCANDELS extragalactic deep fields using traditional color selection methods and model their spectral energy distributions, which incorporates novel UV images. This analysis reveals ~15% of massive, quiescent galaxies have experienced minor, recent star formation(&lt;10% of total stellar mass within the past ~1Gyr). We find only a marginal, positive correlation between the probability for recent star formation and a measure of the richness of the local environment from a statistical analysis. Assuming the recent star formation present in these quiescent galaxies is physically linked to the local environment, these results suggest only a minor role for dynamic external processes (galaxy mergers and interactions) in the formation and evolution of these galaxies at this redshift.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning solutions to singular ordinary differential equations: from special functions to spherical accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singular regular points often arise in differential equations describing physical phenomena such as fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and gravitation. Traditional numerical techniques often fail or become unstable near these points, requiring the use of semi-analytical tools, such as series expansions and perturbative methods, in combination with numerical algorithms; or to invoke more sophisticated methods. In this work, we take an alternative route and leverage the power of machine learning to exploit Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a modern approach to solving ordinary differential equations with singular points. PINNs utilize deep learning architectures to approximate solutions by embedding the differential equations into the loss function of the neural network. We discuss the advantages of PINNs in handling singularities, particularly their ability to bypass traditional grid-based methods and provide smooth approximations across irregular regions. Techniques for enhancing the accuracy of PINNs near singular points, such as adaptive loss weighting, are used in order to achieve high efficiency in the training of the network. We exemplify our results by studying four differential equations of interest in mathematics and gravitation -- the Legendre equation, the hypergeometric equation, the solution for black hole space-times in theories of Lorentz violating gravity, and the spherical accretion of a perfect fluid in a Schwarzschild geometry.</description>

      <title>Unveiling two deeply embedded young protostars in the S68N Class 0 protostellar core with JWST/NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The near-infrared (NIR) emission of the youngest protostars still needs to be characterized to better understand the evolution of their accretion and ejection activity. We analyze James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec 1.7 -- 5.3 $\mu$m observations of two deeply embedded sources in the S68N protostellar core in Serpens. The North Central (NC) source exhibits a highly obscured spectrum (A_K ~ 4.8 mag) that is modeled with a pre-main-sequence photosphere and a hot disk component. The photospheric parameters are consistent with a young, low-mass photosphere, as suggested by the low surface gravity, log g of 1.95 $\pm$ 0.15 cm s$^{-2}$. The hot disk suggests that accretion onto the central protostellar embryo is ongoing, although prototypical accretion-tracing emission lines HI are not detected. The South Central (SC) source, which is even more embedded (A_K ~ 8 mag; no continuum is detected shortward of 3.6 $\mu$m) appears to be driving the large-scale S68N protostellar outflow, and launches a collimated hot molecular jet detected in \Ht and CO ro-vibrational lines. Shock modeling of the \Ht (ro)vibrational lines establishes that fast $C$-type shocks ($\geq$ 30 km s$^{-1}$), with high pre-shock density ($\geq$ $10^7$ cm$^{-3}$), and strong magnetic field (b ~ 3--10, where $B = b\,\times\,\sqrt{\textrm{n}_{\textrm{H}} (\textrm{cm}^{-3})}\,\mu\textrm{G}$) best match the data. The bright CO fundamental line forest suggests energetic excitation, with the contribution of non-LTE effects, ie irradiation pumping. Detected OH and CH$^{+}$ ro-vibrational lines support this hypothesis. These two Class 0 protostars seem to be in very young evolutionary stages and still have to acquire the bulk of their final stellar masses. These results demonstrate that JWST enables unprecedented diagnostics of these first stages of the protostellar evolutionary phase.</description>

      <title>FAST drift scan survey for HI intensity mapping: simulation on hunting HI filament with pairwise stacking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filaments stand as pivotal structures within the cosmic web. However, direct detection of the cold gas content of the filaments remains challenging due to its inherent low brightness temperature. With the TNG hydrodynamical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of isolating faint filament HI signal from the FAST HI intensity mapping (IM) survey through pairwise stacking of galaxies, which yields an average HI filament signal amplitude of $\sim 0.29\ {\mu{\rm K}}$ at $z\simeq 0.1$. However, our simulations reveal a non-negligible contribution from HI-rich galaxies within or near the filaments. Particularly, the faint galaxies dominantly contribute to the extra filament HI signal. Our simulation also shows that the measurement uncertainty is produced by both thermal noise and background variation caused by brightness leakage from surrounding random galaxies. Given a fixed total observation time, a wide-field HI IM survey, which includes a large number of galaxy pairs, can simultaneously reduce thermal noise to below the filament signal level and minimize background variation to a negligible level. Through the end-to-end simulation, this work demonstrates the critical role of the galaxy pairwise stacking method in future filament HI detection, outlining a road map for filament HI detection in the next-generation HI IM surveys.</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Enhanced multiplicity of early B-type dwarfs and giants at $Z=0.2\,{\rm Z}_\odot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early B-type stars ($M_i=8-15$ M$_\odot$) are frequently in multiple systems, as evidenced by spectroscopic campaigns in the Milky Way (MW) and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Previous studies have shown no strong metallicity dependence in the close-binary (a&gt;10 au) fraction or orbital-period distributions between the MW's solar metallicity (Z$_\odot$) and that of the LMC (Z=0.5 Z$_\odot$). However, similar analyses in more metal-poor environments are still scarce. We focus on 309 early B-type stars (luminosity classes III-V) from the Binarity at LOw Metallicity campaign in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC, Z=0.2 Z$_\odot$) using VLT/FLAMES multi-epoch spectroscopy. By applying binary detection criteria consistent with previous works, we identify 153 stars (91 SB1, 59 SB2, 3 SB3) exhibiting significant radial-velocity (RV) variations, resulting in an observed multiplicity fraction of $f^{obs}_{mult}=50\pm3\%$. Using Monte Carlo simulations to account for observational biases, we infer an intrinsic close-binary fraction of $f_{mult}=80\pm8\%$. A Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of the peak-to-peak RV distribution ($\Delta{\rm RV}_{\rm max}$) confirms a high multiplicity fraction of $f_{mult}=78\pm5\%$. These findings suggest a possible anti-correlation between metallicity and the fraction of close B-type binaries, with the SMC multiplicity fraction significantly exceeding previous measurements in the LMC and MW. The enhanced fraction of close binaries at SMC's low metallicity may have broad implications for massive-star evolution in the early Universe. More frequent mass transfer and envelope stripping could boost the production of exotic transients, stripped supernovae, gravitational-wave progenitors, and sustained UV ionising flux, potentially affecting cosmic reionisation. Theoretical predictions of binary evolution under metal-poor conditions will provide a key test of our results.</description>

      <title>H, He-like recombination spectra VI: Quadrupole $l$-changing collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a simple analytic formula that well describes quadrupole $l$-changing collisions of the form $nl \rightarrow nl'$, as confirmed by comparison with numerical quantal Born calculations obtained with the program autostructure (Badnell 2011). Such formulae could easily be included in models of astrophysical plasma emission, such as the hydrogen and helium-like recombination spectra. When compared with the results of previous quantal calculations based upon an analytic solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation by Vrinceanu &amp; Flannery (2001), we find relatively good agreement, with the exception of large $l &gt; n/2$ transitions. We provide a tentative explanation for such discrepancies. However, we also show that the rates for quadrupole $l$-changing collisions are typically two orders of magnitude lower than the dipolar ones. Inclusion of the quadrupolar rates in a hydrogenic collisional-radiative model of nebular plasma shows minimal changes to the level populations, typically within 1% in nebular conditions. Simple and complete theories are now available for $l$-changing collisions suitable for astrophysical applications.</description>
