      <title>A Universe of Sound: Processing NASA Data into Sonifications to Explore Participant Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically, astronomy has prioritized visuals to present information, with scientists and communicators overlooking the critical need to communicate astrophysics with blind or low-vision audiences and provide novel channels for sighted audiences to process scientific information. This study sonified NASA data of three astronomical objects presented as aural visualizations, then surveyed blind or low-vision and sighted individuals to elicit feedback on the experience of these pieces as it relates to enjoyment, education, and trust of the scientific data. Data analyses from 3,184 sighted or blind or low-vision survey participants yielded significant self-reported learning gains and positive experiential responses. Results showed that astrophysical data engaging multiple senses could establish additional avenues of trust, increase access, and promote awareness of accessibility in sighted and blind or low-vision communities.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Experiences of Neurodivergent Undergraduate Physicists Through Critical Disability Physics Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As more neurodivergent students enter college, discussion on neurodiversity in higher education is gaining momentum. It is increasingly imperative that we understand how neurodivergent individuals construct their identities within the context of physics programs. Using hte Critical Disability Physics Identity framework, this study offers a nuanced analysis of the lived experiences and identity development of neurodivergent undergraduate physicists through the lens of resource use and political agency. By examining the phenomenon of neurodivergent undergraduate physics identity, we uncover the multifaceted dimensions of their lived experiences, including the marginalization caused by a neurotypical-normative culture, the negotiation of conflicting definitions of being a physicist, and the influence of supportive networks. Our findings shed light on the intersectionality of neurodivergent identity and physics identity, offering valuable insights to educators, researchers, and institutions committed to fostering inclusive learning environments. Ultimately, this research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice within physics and higher education as a whole.</description>
