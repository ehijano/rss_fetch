      <title>A Reduction over finite fields of the tame local Langlands correspondence for SLn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a conjecture formulated by Vogan for SLn. Specifically, we construct a surjection from the set of irreducible representations of SLn(k), where k is a finite field, to the inertia equivalence classes of tame Langlands parameters for SLn(F), where F is a p-adic field with residue field k. Additionally, we provide a parametrization of the fibers of this surjection and examine its compatibility with the Local Langlands Correspondence for SLn. This work extends several results previously established for GLn to the context of SLn.</description>

      <title>On the additive image of 0th persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $X$ a finite category and $F$ a finite field, we study the additive image of the functor $\operatorname{H}_0(-,F) \colon \operatorname{rep}(X, \mathbf{Top}) \to \operatorname{rep}(X, \mathbf{Vect}_F)$, or equivalently, of the free functor $\operatorname{rep}(X, \mathbf{Set}) \to \operatorname{rep}(X, \mathbf{Vect}_F)$.
  We characterize all finite categories $X$ for which the indecomposables in the additive image coincide with the indecomposable indicator representations and provide examples of quivers of wild representation type where the additive image contains only finitely many indecomposables. Motivated by questions in topological data analysis, we conduct a detailed analysis of the additive image for finite grids. In particular, we show that for grids of infinite representation type, there exist infinitely many indecomposables both within and outside the additive image.
  We develop an algorithm for determining if a representation of a finite category is in the additive image. In addition, we investigate conditions for realizability and the effect of modifications of the source category and the underlying field.
  The paper concludes with a discussion of the additive image of $\operatorname{H}_n(-,F)$ for an arbitrary field $F$, extending previous work for prime fields.</description>

      <title>From the homotopy category of projective modules over gentle algebras to poset representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [BCP24], the authors describe a triangulated structure of a quotient of a certain category of representations of posets, nowadays known as the Bondarenko's category. This category was essential in [BM03] for classify all indecomposable objects of the derived category of gentle algebras. In view of this connection with the derived category, which possess a triangulated structure. In this paper, we identify another triangulated structure for Bondarenko's category, allowing us to utilize the functor presented in [BM03]. This functor will establishes a connection between the triangulated structure of the homotopy category of gentle algebras and the new triangulated structure of a quotient of a certain Bondarenko's category.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a Gelfand-Tsetlin representation of $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ in the space of sections of a local system. The local system lives on an open part of the flag variety given by the intersection of three translates of the big cell and has two complex monodromy parameters. We analyze the structure of this representation.</description>

      <title>Auslander regular algebras and Coxeter matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Iyama's grade bijection for Auslander-Gorenstein algebras coincides with the bijection introduced by Auslander-Reiten. This result uses a new characterisation of Auslander-Gorenstein algebras. Furthermore, we show that the grade bijection of an Auslander regular algebra coincides with the permutation matrix P in the Bruhat factorisation of the Coxeter matrix. This gives a new, purely linear algebraic interpretation of the grade bijection and allows us to calculate it in a much quicker way than was previously known. We give several applications of our main results. First, we show that the permanent of the Coxeter matrix of an Auslander regular algebra is either 1 or -1. Second, we obtain a new combinatorial characterisation of distributive lattices among the class of finite lattices. Explicitly, a lattice is distributive if and only if its Coxeter matrix can be written as PU where P is a permutation matrix and U is an upper triangular matrix. Other applications include new homological results about modules in blocks of category $\mathcal{O}$ of semisimple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>The Factorizable Feigin-Frenkel center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a factorizable version of the Feigin-Frenkel theorem on the center of the completed enveloping algebra of the affine Kac-Moody algebra attached to a simple Lie algebra at the critical level. On any smooth curve C we consider a sheaf of complete topological Lie algebras whose fiber at any point is the usual affine algebra at the critical level and consider its sheaf of completed enveloping algebras. We show that the center of this sheaf is a factorization algebra and establish that it is canonically isomorphic, in a factorizable manner, with the factorization algebra of functions on Opers on the pointed disk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define and classify the sign-equivalent exchange matrices. We give a Diophantine explanation for the differences between rank 2 cluster algebras of finite type and affine type based on \cite{CL24}. We classify the positive integer points of the Markov mutation invariant and its variant. As an application, several classes of Diophantine equations with cluster algebraic structures are exhibited.</description>

      <title>MatrixNet: Learning over symmetry groups using learned group representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group theory has been used in machine learning to provide a theoretically grounded approach for incorporating known symmetry transformations in tasks from robotics to protein modeling. In these applications, equivariant neural networks use known symmetry groups with predefined representations to learn over geometric input data. We propose MatrixNet, a neural network architecture that learns matrix representations of group element inputs instead of using predefined representations. MatrixNet achieves higher sample efficiency and generalization over several standard baselines in prediction tasks over the several finite groups and the Artin braid group. We also show that MatrixNet respects group relations allowing generalization to group elements of greater word length than in the training set.</description>

      <title>Cubic Dirac operator for $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the $q$-deformed Clifford algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and study its properties. This allows us to define the $q$-deformed noncommutative Weil algebra $\mathcal{W}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and the corresponding cubic Dirac operator $D_q$. In the classical case it was done by Alekseev and Meinrenken. We show that the cubic Dirac operator $D_q$ is invariant with respect to the $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-action and *-structures on $\mathcal{W}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, moreover, the square of $D_q$ is central in $\mathcal{W}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. We compute the spectrum of the cubic element on finite-dimensional and Verma modules of~$U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and the corresponding Dirac cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kr\"otz-Stanton Extension Theorem states that the orbit map of a K-finite vector in a Hilbert representation of a linear Lie group extends to a holomorphic map to a principal fibre bundle over the complex crown domain associated to the Riemannian symmetric space $G/K$. We extend this theorem to arbitrary connected semisimple Lie groups and prove polynomial growth estimates at the boundary. Using this, we show that the boundary values of these holomorphic extensions exist in the space of distribution vectors.</description>

      <title>Irreducible components in Hochschild cohomology of flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple, simply-connected complex algebraic group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, and $G/B$ the associated complete flag variety. The Hochschild cohomology $HH^\bullet(G/B)$ is a geometric invariant of the flag variety related to its generalized deformation theory and has the structure of a $\mathfrak{g}$-module. We study this invariant via representation-theoretic methods; in particular, we give a complete list of irreducible subrepresentations in $HH^\bullet(G/B)$ when $G=SL_n(\mathbb{C})$ or is of exceptional type (and conjecturally for all types) along with nontrivial lower bounds on their multiplicities. These results follow from a conjecture due to Kostant on the structure of the tensor product representation $V(\rho) \otimes V(\rho)$.</description>

      <title>Invariant Subspaces of Nilpotent Operators. Level, Mean, and Colevel: The Triangle $\Bbb T(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the category $\mathcal S(n)$ of all pairs $X = (U,V)$, where $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space with a nilpotent operator $T$ with $T^n = 0$, and $U$ is a subspace of $V$ such that $T(U) \subseteq U$. Our main interest in an object $X=(U,V)$ are the three numbers $uX=\dim U$ (for the subspace), $wX=\dim V/U$ (for the factor) and $bX=\dim {\rm Ker} T$ (for the operator). Actually, instead of looking at the reference space $\Bbb R^3$ with the triples $(uX,wX,bX)$, we will focus the attention to the corresponding projective space $\Bbb T(n)$ which contains for a non-zero object $X$ the level-colevel pair {\bf pr}$X = (uX/bX,wX/bX)$ supporting the object $X$.
  We use $\Bbb T(n)$ to visualize part of the categorical structure of $\mathcal S(n)$: The action of the duality $D$ and the square $\tau_n^2$ of the Auslander-Reiten translation are represented on $\Bbb T(n)$ by a reflection and a rotation by $120^\circ$ degrees, respectively. Moreover for $n\geq 6$, each component of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of $\mathcal S(n)$ has support either contained in the center of $\Bbb T(n)$ or with the center as its only accumulation point.
  We show that the only indecomposable objects $X$ in $\mathcal S(n)$ with support having boundary distance smaller than 1 are objects with $bX=1$ which lie on the boundary, whereas any rational vector in $\Bbb T(n)$ with boundary distance at least 2 supports infinitely many indecomposable objects. At present, it is not clear at all what happens for vectors with boundary distance between 1 and 2. The use of $\Bbb T(n)$ provides even in the (quite well-understood) case $n = 6$ some surprises: In particular, we will show that any indecomposable object in $\mathcal S(6)$ lies on one of 12 central lines in $\Bbb T(6)$.
  The paper is essentially self-contained, all prerequisites which are needed are outlined in detail.</description>

      <title>Cores and weights of multipartitions and blocks of Ariki-Koike algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $e$ be an integer at least two. We define the $e$-core and the $e$-weight of a multipartition associated with a multicharge as the $e$-core and the $e$-weight of its image under the Uglov map. We do not place any restriction on the multicharge for these definitions. We show how these definitions lead to the definition of the $e$-core and the $e$-weight of a block of an Ariki-Koike algebra with quantum parameter $e$, and an analogue of Nakayama's `Conjecture' that classifies these blocks. Our definition of $e$-weight of such a block coincides with that first defined by Fayers. We further generalise the notion of a $[w:k]$-pair for Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type $A$ to the Ariki-Koike algebras, and obtain a sufficient condition for such a pair to be Scopes equivalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the representation category of thread quivers and their quotients. A thread quiver is a quiver in which some arrows have been replaced by totally ordered sets. Pointwise finite-dimensional (pwf) representations of such a thread quiver admit a Krull-Remak-Schmidt-Azumaya decomposition. We show that an indecomposable representation is induced from an indecomposable representation of a quiver obtained from the original quiver by replacing some of its arrows by a finite linear $\mathbb{A}_n$ quiver. We study injective and projective pwf indecomposable representations and we fully classify them when the quiver satisfies a mild condition. We give a characterization of the indecomposable pwf representations of certain categories whose representation theory has similar properties to finite type or tame type. We further construct new hereditary abelian categories, including a Serre subcategory of pwf representations that includes every indecomposable representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Associated varieties are geometric objects appearing in infinite-dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras (groups). By applying Fourier transformations to the natural orthogonal oscillator representations of special linear Lie algebras, Luo and the second author (2013) obtained a big family of infinite-dimensional irreducible representations of the algebras on certain spaces of homogeneous solutions of the Laplace equation. In this paper, we prove that the associated varieties of these irreducible representations are the intersections of explicitly given determinantal varieties. This provides an explicit connection among representation theory, partial differential equations and algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Local Normal Forms of Noncommutative Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05900v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article describes local normal forms of functions in noncommuting variables, up to equivalence generated by isomorphism of noncommutative Jacobi algebras, extending singularity theory in the style of Arnold's commutative local normal forms into the noncommutative realm. This generalisation unveils many new phenomena, including an ADE classification when the Jacobi ring has dimension zero and, by taking suitable limits, a further ADE classification in dimension one. These are natural generalisations of the simple singularities and those with infinite multiplicity in Arnold's classification. We obtain normal forms away from some exceptional Type E cases. Remarkably these normal forms have no continuous parameters, and the key new feature is that the noncommutative world affords larger families.
  This theory has a range of immediate consequences to the birational geometry of 3-folds. The normal forms of dimension zero are the analytic classification of smooth 3-fold flops, and one outcome of NC singularity theory is the first list of all Type D flopping germs, generalising Reid's famous pagoda classification of Type A, with variants covering Type E. The normal forms of dimension one have further applications to divisorial contractions to a curve. In addition, the general techniques also give strong evidence towards new contractibility criteria for rational curves.</description>

Abstract: Secant varieties of a homogeneously embedded generalised Grassmannian $G/P$ inherit the natural group action, and one can reduce the study of their local geometric properties to $G$-orbit representatives. The case of secant varieties of lines is particularly elegant as their $G$-orbits are induced by $P$-orbits in both $G/P$ and $\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{p}$. Parabolic orbits are a classical problem in Representation Theory, well understood when $G/P$ is cominuscule. Exploiting them, we provide a complete and uniform description of both the identifiable and singular loci of the secant variety of lines to any cominuscule variety. We also introduce a finer version of the $2$-nd Terracini locus, called $2$-nd strong-Terracini locus, and we determine it for cominuscule varieties. Finally, we analyse the non-cominuscule case of isotropic Grassmannians for comparison, and we highlight a few differences.</description>
