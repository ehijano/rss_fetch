      <title>Hidden correlations in stochastic photoinduced dynamics of a solid-state electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoexcitation by ultrashort laser pulses plays a crucial role in controlling reaction pathways, creating nonequilibrium material properties, and offering a microscopic view of complex dynamics at the molecular level. The photo response following a laser pulse is, in general, non-identical between multiple exposures due to spatiotemporal fluctuations in a material or the stochastic nature of dynamical pathways. However, most ultrafast experiments using a stroboscopic pump-probe scheme struggle to distinguish intrinsic sample fluctuations from extrinsic apparatus noise, often missing seemingly random deviations from the averaged shot-to-shot response. Leveraging the stability and high photon-flux of time-resolved X-ray micro-diffraction at a synchrotron, we developed a method to quantitatively characterize the shot-to-shot variation of the photoinduced dynamics in a solid-state electrolyte. By analyzing temporal evolutions of the lattice parameter of a single grain in a powder ensemble, we found that the sample responses after different shots contain random fluctuations that are, however, not independent. Instead, there is a correlation between the nonequilibrium lattice trajectories following adjacent laser shots with a characteristic "correlation length" of approximately 1,500 shots, which represents an energy barrier of 0.38~eV for switching the photoinduced pathway, a value interestingly commensurate with the activation energy of lithium ion diffusion. Not only does our nonequilibrium noise correlation spectroscopy provide a new strategy for studying fluctuations that are central to phase transitions in both condensed matter and molecular systems, it also paves the way for discovering hidden correlations and novel metastable states buried in oft-presumed random, uncorrelated fluctuating dynamics.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of $k$-essence and Quintessence Scalar Field Models: A Data Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comparative analysis of quintessence and $k$-essence scalar field models in the data analysis perspective. We study the quintessence field with an exponential potential and the $k$-essence field with an inverse square potential in the present work. Before delving into data analysis, we provide a brief perspective on dynamical evolution on both of the models and obtain the stability constraints on the model parameters. We adopt Bayesian inference procedure to estimate the model parameters that best-fit the data. A comprehensive analysis utilizing Observational Hubble data (OHD) and Pantheon+ compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) shows that $k$-essence model fits the data slightly better than the quintessence model while the evidence of these models in comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model is weak. The value of the Hubble constant predicted by both the models is in close agreement with the value obtained by the Planck2018 collaboration assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Binary asteroid candidates in Gaia DR3 astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asteroids with companions constitute an excellent sample for studying the collisional and dynamical evolution of minor planets. The currently known binary population were discovered by different complementary techniques that produce, for the moment, a strongly biased distribution, especially in a range of intermediate asteroid sizes (approximately 20 to 100 km) where both mutual photometric events and high-resolution adaptive optic imaging are poorly efficient. A totally independent technique of binary asteroid discovery, based on astrometry, can help to reveal new binary systems and populate a range of sizes and separations that remain nearly unexplored. In this work, we describe a dedicated period detection method and its results for the Gaia DR3 data set. This method looks for the presence of a periodic signature in the orbit post-fit residuals. After conservative filtering and validation based on statistical and physical criteria, we are able to present a first sample of astrometric binary candidates, to be confirmed by other observation techniques such as photometric light curves and stellar occultations.</description>

      <title>Recent Neutrino Oscillation Parameters Impact on the Effective Majorana Neutrino Mass in 0$\nu\beta\beta$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how recent updates to neutrino oscillation parameters and the sum of neutrino masses influence the sensitivity of neutrinoless double-beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments. Incorporating the latest cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses and laboratory measurements on oscillations, we determine the sum of neutrino masses for both the normal hierarchy (NH) and the inverted hierarchy (IH). Our analysis reveals a narrow range for the sum of neutrino masses, approximately 0.06 eV/c$^2$ for NH and 0.102 eV/c$^2$ for IH. Utilizing these constraints, we calculate the effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH scenarios, establishing the corresponding allowed regions. Importantly, we find that the minimum neutrino mass is non-zero, as constrained by the current oscillation parameters. Additionally, we estimate the half-life of 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay using these effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH. Our results suggest that upcoming ton-scale experiments will comprehensively explore the IH scenario, while 100-ton-scale experiments will effectively probe the parameter space for the NH scenario, provided the background index can achieve 1 event/kton-year in the region of interest.</description>
