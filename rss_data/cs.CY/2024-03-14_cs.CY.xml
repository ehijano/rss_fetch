      <title>MetroGNN: Metro Network Expansion with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting urban regions for metro network expansion to meet maximal transportation demands is crucial for urban development, while computationally challenging to solve. The expansion process relies not only on complicated features like urban demographics and origin-destination (OD) flow but is also constrained by the existing metro network and urban geography. In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework to address a Markov decision process within an urban heterogeneous multi-graph. Our approach employs an attentive policy network that intelligently selects nodes based on information captured by a graph neural network. Experiments on real-world urban data demonstrate that our proposed methodology substantially improve the satisfied transportation demands by over 30\% when compared with state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Older adults' safety and security online: A post-pandemic exploration of attitudes and behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Older adults' growing use of the internet and related technologies, further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has prompted not only a critical examination of their behaviors and attitudes about online threats but also a greater understanding of the roles of specific characteristics within this population group. Based on survey data and using descriptive and inferential statistics, this empirical study delves into this matter. The behaviors and attitudes of a group of older adults aged 60 years and older (n=275) regarding different dimensions of online safety and cybersecurity are investigated. The results show that older adults report a discernible degree of concern about the security of their personal information. Despite the varied precautions taken, most of them do not know where to report online threats. What is more, regarding key demographics, the study found some significant differences in terms of gender and age group, but not disability status. This implies that older adults do not seem to constitute a homogeneous group when it comes to attitudes and behaviors regarding safety and security online. The study concludes that support systems should include older adults in the development of protective measures and acknowledge their diversity. The implications of the results are discussed and some directions for future research are proposed.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Potential of Open Government Data: Exploring the Strategic, Technical, and Application Perspectives of High-Value Datasets Opening in Taiwan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, data has an unprecedented value as it forms the basis for data-driven decision-making, including serving as an input for AI models, where the latter is highly dependent on the availability of the data. However, availability of data in an open data format creates a little added value, where the value of these data, i.e., their relevance to the real needs of the end user, is key. This is where the concept of high-value dataset (HVD) comes into play, which has become popular in recent years. Defining and opening HVD is an ongoing process consisting of a set of interrelated steps, the implementation of which may vary from one country or region to another. Therefore, there has recently been a call to conduct research in a country or region setting considered to be of greatest national value. So far, only a few studies have been conducted at the regional or national level, most of which consider only one step of the process, such as identifying HVD or measuring their impact. With this study, we answer this call and examine the national case of Taiwan by exploring the entire lifecycle of HVD opening. The aim of the paper is to understand and evaluate the lifecycle of high-value dataset publishing in one of the world's leading producers of information and communication technology (ICT) products - Taiwan. To do this, we conduct a qualitative study with exploratory interviews with representatives from government agencies in Taiwan responsible for HVD opening, exploring HVD opening lifecycle. As such, we examine (1) strategic aspects related to the HVD determination process, (2) technical aspects, and (3) application aspects.</description>

      <title>Governance of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Companies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), specifically large language models like ChatGPT, has swiftly entered organizations without adequate governance, posing both opportunities and risks. Despite extensive debates on GenAI's transformative nature and regulatory measures, limited research addresses organizational governance, encompassing technical and business perspectives. This review paper fills this gap by surveying recent works. It goes beyond mere summarization by developing a framework for GenAI governance within companies. Our framework outlines the scope, objectives, and governance mechanisms tailored to harness business opportunities and mitigate risks associated with GenAI integration. This research contributes a focused approach to GenAI governance, offering practical insights for companies navigating the challenges of responsible AI adoption. It is also valuable for a technical audience to broaden their perspective as increasingly ethical and business concerns gain in prevalence and allow them to identify novel research directions.</description>

      <title>Language-based game theory in the age of artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding human behaviour in decision problems and strategic interactions has wide-ranging applications in economics, psychology, and artificial intelligence. Game theory offers a robust foundation for this understanding, based on the idea that individuals aim to maximize a utility function. However, the exact factors influencing strategy choices remain elusive. While traditional models try to explain human behaviour as a function of the outcomes of available actions, recent experimental research reveals that linguistic content significantly impacts decision-making, thus prompting a paradigm shift from outcome-based to language-based utility functions. This shift is more urgent than ever, given the advancement of generative AI, which has the potential to support humans in making critical decisions through language-based interactions. We propose sentiment analysis as a fundamental tool for this shift and take an initial step by analyzing 61 experimental instructions from the dictator game, an economic game capturing the balance between self-interest and the interest of others, which is at the core of many social interactions. Our meta-analysis shows that sentiment analysis can explain human behaviour beyond economic outcomes. We discuss future research directions. We hope this work sets the stage for a novel game theoretical approach that emphasizes the importance of language in human decisions.</description>

      <title>Usable XAI: 10 Strategies Towards Exploiting Explainability in the LLM Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) refers to techniques that provide human-understandable insights into the workings of AI models. Recently, the focus of XAI is being extended towards Large Language Models (LLMs) which are often criticized for their lack of transparency. This extension calls for a significant transformation in XAI methodologies because of two reasons. First, many existing XAI methods cannot be directly applied to LLMs due to their complexity advanced capabilities. Second, as LLMs are increasingly deployed across diverse industry applications, the role of XAI shifts from merely opening the "black box" to actively enhancing the productivity and applicability of LLMs in real-world settings. Meanwhile, unlike traditional machine learning models that are passive recipients of XAI insights, the distinct abilities of LLMs can reciprocally enhance XAI. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Usable XAI in the context of LLMs by analyzing (1) how XAI can benefit LLMs and AI systems, and (2) how LLMs can contribute to the advancement of XAI. We introduce 10 strategies, introducing the key techniques for each and discussing their associated challenges. We also provide case studies to demonstrate how to obtain and leverage explanations. The code used in this paper can be found at: https://github.com/JacksonWuxs/UsableXAI_LLM.</description>

      <title>Caveat Lector: Large Language Models in Legal Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current fascination with large language models, or LLMs, derives from the fact that many users lack the expertise to evaluate the quality of the generated text. LLMs may therefore appear more capable than they actually are. The dangerous combination of fluency and superficial plausibility leads to the temptation to trust the generated text and creates the risk of overreliance. Who would not trust perfect legalese? Relying recent findings in both technical and legal scholarship, this Article counterbalances the overly optimistic predictions as to the role of LLMs in legal practice. Integrating LLMs into legal workstreams without a better comprehension of their limitations, will create inefficiencies if not outright risks. Notwithstanding their unprecedented ability to generate text, LLMs do not understand text. Without the ability to understand meaning, LLMs will remain unable to use language, to acquire knowledge and to perform complex reasoning tasks. Trained to model language on the basis of stochastic word predictions, LLMs cannot distinguish fact from fiction. Their knowledge of the law is limited to word strings memorized in their parameters. It is also incomplete and largely incorrect. LLMs operate at the level of word distributions, not at the level of verified facts. The resulting propensity to hallucinate, to produce statements that are incorrect but appear helpful and relevant, is alarming in high-risk areas like legal services. At present, lawyers should beware of relying on text generated by LLMs.</description>

      <title>An Extensive Comparison of Static Application Security Testing Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Static Application Security Testing Tools (SASTTs) identify software vulnerabilities to support the security and reliability of software applications. Interestingly, several studies have suggested that alternative solutions may be more effective than SASTTs due to their tendency to generate false alarms, commonly referred to as low Precision. Aim: We aim to comprehensively evaluate SASTTs, setting a reliable benchmark for assessing and finding gaps in vulnerability identification mechanisms based on SASTTs or alternatives. Method: Our SASTTs evaluation is based on a controlled, though synthetic, Java codebase. It involves an assessment of 1.5 million test executions, and it features innovative methodological features such as effort-aware accuracy metrics and method-level analysis. Results: Our findings reveal that SASTTs detect a tiny range of vulnerabilities. In contrast to prevailing wisdom, SASTTs exhibit high Precision while falling short in Recall. Conclusions: The paper suggests that enhancing Recall, alongside expanding the spectrum of detected vulnerability types, should be the primary focus for improving SASTTs or alternative approaches, such as machine learning-based vulnerability identification solutions.</description>

      <title>Gun Culture in Fringe Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing frequency of mass shootings in the United States has, unfortunately, become a norm. While the issue of gun control in the US involves complex legal concerns, there are also societal issues at play. One such social issue is so-called "gun culture," i.e., a general set of beliefs and actions related to gun ownership. However relatively little is known about gun culture, and even less is known when it comes to fringe online communities. This is especially worrying considering the aforementioned rise in mass shootings and numerous instances of shooters being radicalized online.
  To address this gap, we explore gun culture on /k/, 4chan's weapons board. More specifically, using a variety of quantitative techniques, we examine over 4M posts on /k/ and position their discussion within the larger body of theoretical understanding of gun culture. Among other things, our findings suggest that gun culture on /k/ covers a relatively diverse set of topics (with a particular focus on legal discussion), some of which are signals of fetishism.</description>

      <title>Trust AI Regulation? Discerning users are vital to build trust and effective AI regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is general agreement that some form of regulation is necessary both for AI creators to be incentivised to develop trustworthy systems, and for users to actually trust those systems. But there is much debate about what form these regulations should take and how they should be implemented. Most work in this area has been qualitative, and has not been able to make formal predictions. Here, we propose that evolutionary game theory can be used to quantitatively model the dilemmas faced by users, AI creators, and regulators, and provide insights into the possible effects of different regulatory regimes. We show that creating trustworthy AI and user trust requires regulators to be incentivised to regulate effectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of two mechanisms that can achieve this. The first is where governments can recognise and reward regulators that do a good job. In that case, if the AI system is not too risky for users then some level of trustworthy development and user trust evolves. We then consider an alternative solution, where users can condition their trust decision on the effectiveness of the regulators. This leads to effective regulation, and consequently the development of trustworthy AI and user trust, provided that the cost of implementing regulations is not too high. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the effect of different regulatory regimes from an evolutionary game theoretic perspective.</description>

      <title>Towards AI Accountability Infrastructure: Gaps and Opportunities in AI Audit Tooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audits are critical mechanisms for identifying the risks and limitations of deployed artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, the effective execution of AI audits remains incredibly difficult. As a result, practitioners make use of various tools to support their efforts. Drawing on interviews with 35 AI audit practitioners and a landscape analysis of 390 tools, we map the current ecosystem of available AI audit tools. While there are many tools designed to assist practitioners with setting standards and evaluating AI systems, these tools often fell short of supporting the accountability goals of AI auditing in practice. We thus highlight areas for future tool development beyond evaluation -- from harms discovery to advocacy -- and outline challenges practitioners faced in their efforts to use AI audit tools. We conclude that resources are lacking to adequately support the full scope of needs for many AI audit practitioners and recommend that the field move beyond tools for just evaluation, towards more comprehensive infrastructure for AI accountability.</description>

      <title>Transforming Competition into Collaboration: The Revolutionary Role of Multi-Agent Systems and Language Models in Modern Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article explores the dynamic influence of computational entities based on multi-agent systems theory (SMA) combined with large language models (LLM), which are characterized by their ability to simulate complex human interactions, as a possibility to revolutionize human user interaction from the use of specialized artificial agents to support everything from operational organizational processes to strategic decision making based on applied knowledge and human orchestration. Previous investigations reveal that there are limitations, particularly in the autonomous approach of artificial agents, especially when dealing with new challenges and pragmatic tasks such as inducing logical reasoning and problem solving. It is also considered that traditional techniques, such as the stimulation of chains of thoughts, require explicit human guidance. In our approach we employ agents developed from large language models (LLM), each with distinct prototyping that considers behavioral elements, driven by strategies that stimulate the generation of knowledge based on the use case proposed in the scenario (role-play) business, using a discussion approach between agents (guided conversation). We demonstrate the potential of developing agents useful for organizational strategies, based on multi-agent system theories (SMA) and innovative uses based on large language models (LLM based), offering a differentiated and adaptable experiment to different applications, complexities, domains, and capabilities from LLM.</description>
