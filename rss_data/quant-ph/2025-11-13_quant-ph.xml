      <title>Schr\"{o}dinger equation is $\mathcal{R}$-separable in toroidal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present, for the first time, exact solutions for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in Moon and Spencer's toroidal coordinates, and in the electromagnetic toroidal--poloidal coordinate systems. Curiously, both systems present a fractional angular momentum, because of the torus's hole. We achieve these novel solutions using the irregular $\mathcal{R}$-separation of variables, an unexplored approach in Physics, which results in a wavefunction with fractional angular momentum eigenvalues. Numerous solutions for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in a variety of external potentials are shown, including an external magnetic field. A plane-wave expansion and a Green function are also presented, setting the stage for future progress in this area.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Depth Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for Solving Constrained Shortest Path Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) has emerged as a promising approach for solving NP hard combinatorial optimization problems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, its performance is critically dependent on the selection of the circuit depth a parameter that must be specified a priori without clear guidance. In this paper, we introduce a variant of QAOA called dynamic depth Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (DDQAOA) that resolves the challenge of pre selecting a fixed circuit depth. Our method adaptively expands circuit depth, starting from p = 1 and progressing up to p = 10, by transferring learned parameters to deeper circuits based on convergence criteria. We tested this approach on 100 instances of the Constrained Shortest Path Problem (CSPP) at 10 qubit and 16 qubit scales. Our DDQAOA achieved superior approximation ratios and success probabilities with fewer CNOT gate evaluations than the standard QAOA for p = 3, 5, 10, and 15. In particular, while standard QAOA at p = 15 achieved results close to our approach, it used 217% and 159.3% more CNOT gates for 10 qubit and 16 qubit instances, respectively. This demonstrates the performance and practical applicability of DDQAOA to solve combinatorial optimization problems on near term devices.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of Thermal Reservoirs with Tunable Temperature in a Trapped-Ion Spin-Boson Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate an experimental scheme to engineer thermal baths with independently tunable temperatures and dissipation rates for the motional modes of a trapped-ion system. This approach enables robust thermal-state preparation and quantum simulations of open-system dynamics in bosonic and spin-boson models at well-controlled finite temperatures. We benchmark our protocol by experimentally realizing out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a charge-transfer model at different temperatures. We observe that, when the process occurs at a higher temperature, the transfer rate spectrum broadens, with reduced rates at small donor-acceptor energy gaps and enhanced rates at large gaps. We then employ our scheme to study local-temperature effects in a two-mode vibrationally assisted exciton transfer system, where we observe thermally activated interference pathways for excitation transfer.</description>

      <title>Fractal structure of multipartite entanglement in monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the distribution of multipartite entanglement in states produced in a one-dimensional random monitored quantum circuit where local Clifford unitaries are interspersed with single-site measurements performed with a probability $p$. This circuit has a measurement-induced phase transition at $p=p_c$, separating a phase in which the entanglement entropy scales with the system size (a volume law state) and one in which it scales with the boundary (an area law state). We calculate the entanglement depth, corresponding to the size of the largest cluster of entangled qubits, finding that it scales as a power law with system size in both the phases. The power law exponent is 1 in the volume law phase ($p &lt; p_c$) and continuously decreases to 0 as $p \to 1$ in the area law phase. We explain this behavior by studying the spatial distribution of entangled clusters. We find that the largest cluster of entangled qubits in these states has a fractal dimension between 0 and 1 and appears to be self-similar. Away from the critical point, this fractal dimension matches the entanglement depth power law exponent.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Atomistic-Parametric Decoherence Model for Molecular Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state molecular qubits with open-shell ground states have great potential for addressability, scalability, and tunability, but understanding the fundamental limits of quantum coherence in these systems is challenging due to the complexity of the qubit environment. To address this, we develop a random Hamiltonian approach where the molecular $g$-tensor fluctuates due to classical lattice motion obtained from molecular dynamics simulations at constant temperature. Atomistic $g$-tensor fluctuations are used to construct Redfield quantum master equations that predict the relaxation $T_1$ and dephasing $T_2$ times of copper porphyrin qubits in a crystalline framework. Assuming one-phonon spin-lattice interaction processes, $1/T$ temperature scaling and $1/B^3$ magnetic field scaling of $T_1$ are established using atomistic bath correlation functions. Atomistic $T_1$ predictions overestimate the available experimental data by orders of magnitude. Quantitative agreement with measurements at all magnetic fields is restored by introducing a magnetic field noise model to describe lattice nuclear spins, with field-dependent noise amplitude in the range $\delta B\sim 10\,\mu{\rm T}- 1\,{\rm mT}$ for the copper porphyrin system. We show that while $T_1$ scales as $1/B$ experimentally due to a combination of spin-lattice and magnetic noise contributions, $T_2$ scales strictly as $ 1/B^2$ due to low-frequency dephasing processes associated with magnetic field noise. Our work demonstrates the potential of dynamical methods for modeling the open quantum system dynamics of molecular spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Exact Floquet dynamics of strongly damped driven quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach for efficiently simulating strongly damped quantum systems subjected to periodic driving, employing a periodic matrix product operator representation of the influence functional. This representation enables the construction of a numerically exact Floquet propagator that captures the non-Markovian open system dynamics, thus providing a dissipative analogue to the Floquet Hamiltonian of driven isolated quantum systems. We apply this method to study the asymptotic heating of a reservoir in spin-boson models, characterizing the deviation from equilibrium conditions. Moreover, we show how a local driving of two qubits can be utilized to stabilize a transient entanglement buildup of the qubits originating from the interaction with a common environment. Our results make it possible to directly study both stationary and transient dynamics of strongly damped and driven quantum systems within a transparent theoretical and numerical framework.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time quantum walks on a defective lattice: boosting the spreading of delocalized states through Parrondo's strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum transport of delocalized states in continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) on a one-dimensional lattice containing a single defect. The defect is modeled by assigning complex-valued hopping amplitudes to the edges that connect the site corresponding to the mean position of the initial delocalized state to its nearest neighbors. We find that this single defective site is sufficient to enhance the ballistic spreading of an initially Gaussian wave packet. Extending these results, we implement a time-dependent alternation protocol between two distinct defect configurations, each individually yielding poor propagation of the state. The combination of these two unfavorable configurations improves the transport efficiency of the quantum walker, revealing a manifestation of Parrondo's paradox in CTQWs with delocalized initial states. This study provides new insights into the role of complex-phase defects and time-dependent protocols in CTQWs, demonstrating that the interplay between quantum interference and graph engineering can effectively enhance quantum transport in discrete lattices.</description>

      <title>Cold-Atom Buoy: A Differential Magnetic Sensing Technique in Cold Quadrupole Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a technique for vectorial magnetic sensing using a cold-atom cloud trapped in a magnetic quadrupole. The center of the trapped cloud is determined by absorption imaging and compared for opposite polarities of the quadrupole. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the displacement of the cloud depends on both the field's direction and magnitude. By analyzing this shift under polarity reversal, we infer the two transverse components of a homogeneous external magnetic field relative to the imaging axis, without requiring spectroscopic interrogation. Assuming micron-scale position sensitivity and typical magnetic field gradients, the method enables resolution at the milli-Gauss level. It is compatible with standard cold-atom setups and offers a practical tool for field compensation in magnetically sensitive experimental stages. As such, it establishes a bridge between traditional macroscopic magnetic field probes and atomic-physics-based precision sensors.</description>

      <title>Modelling many-body quantum dynamics with stochastic trajectories: a critical test on the Tavis-Cummings model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We critically explore the applicability of a recently proposed framework to sample the quantum dynamics of a many-body quantum system interacting with light by stochastic trajectories, applying it to the closed and open Tavis-Cummings model (TCM). The stochastic differential equations (SDEs) sample the positive P phase-space representation by analog complex-valued dynamical variables that are linked to the quantum operators. Statistical average over the stochastic trajectories yields the evolution of the quantum mechanical expectation values. However, numerical implementation of these SDEs for the TCM indicates divergent solutions, also known from other phase-space methods. This limits the applicability of the framework to finite propagation times, that are strongly dependent on the physical parameters and initial conditions of the system. We outline the underlying mathematical reason for these divergences and show that their contribution to the averages are, however, essential. To attempt to regularize the divergences, we transform the SDEs to an equivalent set of SDEs with different noise realisations, thereby pushing the valid time boundary. Quantum collapse and revival of the TCM, however, cannot be recovered by the stochastic trajectory approach, pointing to the general difficulty of the applicability of stochastic phase-space sampling methods to systems with strong quantum features.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Optimisations for Early Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerance is the future of quantum computing, ensuring error-corrected quantum computation that can be used for practical applications. Resource requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) are daunting, and hence, compilation techniques must be designed to ensure resource efficiency. There is a growing need for compilation strategies tailored to the early FTQC regime, which refers to the first generation of fault-tolerant machines operating under stringent resource constraints of fewer physical qubits and limited distillation capacity. Present-day compilation techniques are largely focused on overprovisioning of routing paths and make liberal assumptions regarding the availability of distillation factories. Our work develops compilation techniques that are tailored to the needs of early FTQC systems, including distillation-adaptive qubit layouts and routing techniques. In particular, we show that simple greedy heuristics are extremely effective for this problem, offering up to 60% reduction in the number of qubits compared to prior works. Our techniques offer results with an average overhead of 1.2X in execution time for a 53% reduction in qubits against the theoretical lower bounds. As the industry develops early FTQC systems with tens to hundreds of logical qubits over the coming years, our work has the potential to be widely useful for optimising program executions.</description>

      <title>Information Processing in Quantum Thermodynamic Systems: an Autonomous Hamiltonian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the quantum formulation of [Phys. Rev. X 3, 041003 (2013)] to a more general setting for studying the thermodynamics of information processing including initial correlations, we generalize the second law of thermodynamics to account for information processing in such autonomous systems. We consider a composite quantum system consisting of a principal system, heat bath, memory, and work source, and adopt an autonomous Hamiltonian framework. We derive constraints on the total Hamiltonian that ensure the work source to act as a catalyst preserving its original randomness, namely that the total unitary evolution must have a unitary partial transpose. We show that this requirement is equivalent to the commutativity of operators acting on the joint system of the principal system, bath, and memory, which underlies the Hamiltonian structure. Next, we generalize the quantum speed limit for the joint dynamics of system and memory to the quantum thermodynamic speed limit, from which we obtain a dynamical version of Landauer's bound. More importantly, we also interpret this quantum thermodynamic speed limit in the context of quantum hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Quantum-classical gravity distinction in reservoir-engineered massive quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive quantum systems have emerged as compelling tabletop interface-systems for testing the quantum nature of gravity. However, conventional schemes that focus on directly using gravity to induce entanglement suffer from overwhelming environmental decoherence: maintaining entanglement between two oscillators requires an impractically high mechanical quality factor. In this work, we put forward an alternative reservoir-engineered scheme, whose core function is to quantify how gravity modifies (rather than prepares) the steady-state entanglement. Compared to quantum gravity, classical gravity introduces additional dissipative channels, which in turn give rise to distinct entanglement characteristics and thus enable the discrimination between the two types of gravity. Notably, this entanglement difference can still be maintained even when the mechanical quality factor is far below the threshold required by conventional schemes. Moreover, it demonstrates significant robustness against non-gravitational couplings, specifically, those like Casimir and Coulomb forces that are inherent in experimental setups. Our scheme relaxes the experimental requirements for verifying quantum gravity, thereby paving a new path toward its near-term realization.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature Electrical Readout of Spin Defects in van der Waals Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negatively charged boron vacancy ($\mathrm{V_B^-}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is the most extensively studied room-temperature quantum spin system in two-dimensional (2D) materials. Nevertheless, the current effective readout of $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ spin states is carried out by systematically optical methods. This limits their exploitation in compact and miniaturized quantum devices, which would otherwise hold substantial promise to address quantum sensing and quantum information tasks. In this study, we demonstrated a photoelectric spin readout technique for $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ spins in hBN. The observed photocurrent signals stem from the spin-dependent ionization dynamics of boron vacancies, mediated by spin-dependent non-radiative transitions to a metastable state. We further extend this electrical detection technique to enable the readout of dynamical decoupling sequences, including the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) protocols, and of nuclear spins via electron-nuclear double resonance. These results provide a pathway toward on-chip integration and real-field exploitation of quantum functionalities based on 2D material platforms.</description>

      <title>All-nitride superconducting qubits based on atomic layer deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of large-scale quantum processors benefits from superconducting qubits that can operate at elevated temperatures and be fabricated with scalable, foundry-compatible processes. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is increasingly being adopted as an industrial standard for thin-film growth, particularly in applications requiring precise control over layer thickness and composition. Here, we report superconducting qubits based on NbN/AlN/NbN trilayers deposited entirely by ALD. By varying the number of ALD cycles used to form the AlN barrier, we achieve Josephson tunneling through barriers of different thicknesses, with critical current density spanning seven orders of magnitude, demonstrating the uniformity and versatility of the process. Owing to the high critical temperature of NbN, transmon qubits based on these all-nitride trilayers exhibit microsecond-scale relaxation times, even at temperatures above 300 mK. These results establish ALD as a viable low-temperature deposition technique for superconducting quantum circuits and position all-nitride ALD qubits as a promising platform for operation at elevated temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Photon loss is the biggest enemy in quantum communications. Direct transmission typically results in a small fraction of photons surviving over long distances, hindering advanced applications such as loophole-free Bell tests and device-independent quantum key distribution. Quantum teleportation offers a "disembodied" way of transferring particles through a virtual channel--quantum entanglement--which, in principle, could overcome the photon transmission loss. Experimentally, however, no previous quantum teleportation of single photons has shown a higher survival probability than using direct transmission. To overcome this challenge, here we first propose and demonstrate an all-optical scheme for remote preparation of entangled photons. Through an effective 15-dB channel loss, we realize a heralding efficiency of 82% for event-ready entangled photons. Based on the prior distributed entanglement, we demonstrate that teleportation-based transmission efficiency offers a 2.95-fold enhancement, compared to using direct transmission through the same channel, therefore establishing an unconditional teleportational advantage.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and spectral singularities in a class of one-dimensional parity-time-symmetric complex potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a two-parametric family of one-dimensional non-Hermitian complex potentials with parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. We find that there exist two distinct types of phase transitions, from an unbroken phase (characterized by a real spectrum) to a broken phase (where the spectrum becomes complex). The first type involves the emergence of a pair of complex eigenvalues bifurcating from the continuous spectrum. The second type is associated with the collision of such pairs at the bottom of the continuous spectrum. The first transition type is closely related to spectral singularities (SSs), at which point the transmission and reflection coefficients are divergent simultaneously. The second is associated with the emergence of bound states. In particular, under specific parameter conditions, we construct an exact bound state solution. By systematically exploring the parameter space, we establish a universal relationship governing the number of SSs in these potentials. These findings provide a fundamental theoretical framework for manipulating wave scattering in non-Hermitian systems, offering promising implications for designing advanced optical and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Feature Extraction in Superconducting Quantum Circuits: An Open-Source Finite-Element Workflow Using Palace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate electromagnetic (EM) feature extraction, including element characterization, eigenmodes, and field distributions, is essential for superconducting quantum circuit design. To streamline this process, we present a workflow built around Palace, an open-source, high-performance finite element method solver tailored for quantum applications. Starting from circuit layouts, the workflow automates mesh generation, multiple EM solver processing, and EM-to-Hamiltonian post-processing. We benchmark the workflow on a chip with bare resonators and qubits coupled with readout resonators, achieving resonator frequencies prediction within 0.3% and 3 out of 4 external couplings within 16% of cryogenic measurements. These results demonstrate open-source EM tools can match commercial accuracy while offering scalable, license-free analysis. Our Palace-based workflow provides an accessible and extensible foundation for rapid superconducting circuit development and materials-loss studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication and quantum sensing, which leverage the unique characteristics of quantum systems, enable information-theoretically secure communication and high-precision measurement of physical quantities. However, they both face numerous challenges on the path to practical application. Artificial intelligence (AI), as a major technological advancement in current scientific landscape, offers powerful data processing and analytical capabilities, providing new ideas and methods for optimizing and enhancing quantum communication and sensing systems. In quantum communication, AI techniques have greatly improved the performance and security of quantum key distribution, quantum memory, and quantum networks through parameter optimization, real-time feedback control, and attack detection. In quantum sensing, quantum sensing technology enables ultra-high sensitivity detection of physical quantities such as time and magnetic fields. The introduction of AI has opened up new avenues for achieving high-precision and high-sensitivity quantum measurements. With AI, sensor performance is optimized, and measurement accuracy is further enhanced through data analysis. This paper also analyzes the current challenges in using AI to empower quantum communication and sensing systems, such as implementing efficient algorithm deployment and system feedback control under limited computational resources, and addressing complex task environments, dynamically changing scenarios, and multi-task coordination requirements. Finally, this paper discusses and envisions future development prospects in this field.</description>

      <title>Inherently unpredictable beam steering for quantum LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum LiDAR offers noise resilience and stealth observation capabilities in low-light conditions. In prior demonstrations, the telescope pointing was raster-scanned, making the observation direction predictable from the pointing direction. However, while Quantum LiDAR can enable stealth observation, operational stealth is enhanced by inherently unpredictable beam steering. Here, we introduce a novel stealth beam steering method that is fundamentally immune to prediction. In a photon pair, the probe photon undergoes diffraction in an unpredictable direction at a grating due to wavelength randomness. The arrival time of the heralding photon, delayed by propagation through a dispersive medium, enables the determination of the probe photon's diffraction direction. Our method successfully detects multiple targets in parallel, demonstrating up to a 1000-fold enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio compared to classical LiDAR. This breakthrough establishes a new paradigm for quantum-enhanced sensing, with far-reaching implications for quantum metrology, secure communications, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Operational Characterization of Coherent Measurements with Steering and Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that a set of coherent measurements leverages semi-device-independent (SDI) steering and local randomness generation. To this end, we show that coherent measurements are a necessary resource for demonstrating SDI steering. Conversely, through one-to-one mapping of an SDI steerable correlation to a set of measurements, the coherence of the measurements, in turn, is a necessary and sufficient criterion for SDI steering. This result aligns with the relationship between the standard steering scenario and the measurement incompatibility. Then a nonconvex resource theory for SDI steering is formulated and a nonconvex monotone of the resource is obtained in the two-setting scenario using the above-mentioned one-to-one mapping. Finally, we apply this monotone to the quantification of local randomness from two-qubit states without requiring entanglement to be certified.</description>

      <title>Private Remote Phase Estimation over a Lossy Quantum Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Private remote quantum sensing (PRQS) aims at estimating a parameter at a distant location by transmitting quantum states on an insecure quantum channel, limiting information leakage and disruption of the estimation itself from an adversary. Previous results highlighted that one can bound the estimation performance in terms of the observed noise. However, if no assumptions are placed on the channel model, such bounds are very loose and severely limit the estimation. We propose and analyse a PRQS using, for the first time to our knowledge, continuous-variable states in the single-user setting. Assuming a typical class of lossy attacks and employing tools from quantum communication, we calculate the true estimation error and privacy of our protocol, both in the asymptotic limit of many channel uses and in the finite-size regime. Our results show that a realistic channel-model assumption, which can be validated with measurement data, allows for a much tighter quantification of the estimation error and privacy for all practical purposes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09124v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This perspective outlines promising pathways and critical obstacles on the road to developing useful quantum computing applications, drawing on insights from the Google Quantum AI team. We propose a five-stage framework for this process, spanning from theoretical explorations of quantum advantage to the practicalities of compilation and resource estimation. For each stage, we discuss key trends, milestones, and inherent scientific and sociological impediments. We argue that two central stages -- identifying concrete problem instances expected to exhibit quantum advantage, and connecting such problems to real-world use cases -- represent essential and currently under-resourced challenges. Throughout, we touch upon related topics, including the promise of generative artificial intelligence for aspects of this research, criteria for compelling demonstrations of quantum advantage, and the future of compilation as we enter the era of early fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy beyond the parity-symmetry protection in one-dimensional spinless models: The parity-violating Kerr parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional quantum systems that undergo spontaneous symmetry-breaking, having a symmetric (non-degenerate) and a broken-symmetry (doubly-degenerate) phase, have been intensely studied in different branches of physics. In most cases, the spontaneously-broken symmetry is parity. However, it is possible to obtain similar phases in systems without parity symmetry, through an antiunitary symmetry that implies a two-fold symmetry either on momentum or coordinate in the system's classical limit. To illustrate this phenomenon, we use a Kerr parametric oscillator (KPO) with one- and two-photon drives that, despite the breaking of parity symmetry, may have doubly-degenerate levels. Different realizations of squeezed KPOs convey a great deal of attention, as effective Hamiltonians for driven superconducting circuits and the occurrence of degeneracy in such systems could be of practical interest in their application to obtain protected qubits in parity-breaking setups. In addition to this, the reported spectral features strongly indicate the existence of additional symmetries in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises a revolution in information processing, with significant potential for machine learning and classification tasks. However, achieving this potential requires overcoming several fundamental challenges. One key limitation arises at the prediction stage, where the intrinsic randomness of quantum model outputs necessitates repeated executions, resulting in substantial overhead. To overcome this, we propose a novel measurement strategy for a variational quantum classifier that allows us to define the unambiguous quantum classifier. This strategy achieves near-deterministic predictions while maintaining competitive classification accuracy in noisy environments, all with significantly fewer quantum circuit executions. Although this approach entails a slight reduction in performance, it represents a favorable trade-off for improved resource efficiency. We further validate our theoretical model with supporting experimental results.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Photonic-Quantum Reservoir Computing For Time-Series Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the perspective of advanced time-series prediction and exploitation of Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC), we explored the design and implementation of a Hybrid Photonic-Quantum Reservoir Computing (HPQRC) paradigm. It brings together the high-speed parallelism of photonic systems with the quantum reservoir's capacity of modeling complex, nonlinear dynamics, and hence acts as a powerful tool for performing real-time prediction in resource resource-constrained environment with low latency. We have engineered a solution using this architecture to address issues like computational bottlenecks, energy inefficiency, and sensitivity to noise that are common in existing reservoir computing models. Our simulation results show that HPQRC attains much higher accuracy with lower computational time than both classical and quantum-only models. This model is robust when environments are noisy and scales well across large datasets, and therefore is suitable for application on diverse problems such as financial forecasting, industrial automation, and smart sensor networks. Our results substantiate that HPQRC performs significantly faster than traditional architectures and could be a viable and highly scalable platform for actual edge computing systems. Overall, HPQRC demonstrates significant advancements in time series modeling capabilities. In combination with enhanced predictive accuracy with reduced computational requirements, HPQRC establishes itself as an effective analytical tool for complex dynamic systems that require both precision and processing efficiency.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Framework for Forecasting Nonlinear and Chaotic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a tensor network model (TNM) for forecasting nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, bridging quantum many-body methods with classical complex systems. The TNM leverages hierarchical tensor contractions to encode non-Markovian temporal correlations and multiscale structures, enabling compact and interpretable representations of chaotic flows. Using the Lorenz and R\"{o}ssler systems as benchmarks, we show that the TNM accurately reconstructs short-term trajectories and faithfully captures the attractor geometry. The model enables robust short-term forecasting beyond several Lyapunov times, offering a meaningful horizon for data-driven prediction under chaos. Inhomogeneous parametrization of weight tensors improves convergence and robustness compared to homogeneous parametrization, while scaling with bond dimension reveals saturation beyond modest values, consistent with the low intrinsic dimensionality of the chaotic attractor. This work establishes tensor networks as a universal paradigm for data-driven modeling of complex dynamical systems, offering physically motivated control of model expressivity and opening pathways toward applications in climate systems and hybrid quantum-classical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transversality of the Toffoli gate in a hybrid-code system that employs two quantum error correction codes with special structure. We find that a system using a triorthogonal code with its paired code supports a fully transversal implementation of the Toffoli gate. Through circuit-level analysis, we prove the transversality of the Toffoli operation in this system. Based on this hybrid-code framework, we propose a Toffoli state distillation protocol that does not rely on pre-distilled $\mathbf{T}$-gate magic states. In our approach, the Toffoli state is directly distilled layer by layer within the hybrid-code system using only transversal operations. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method uses approximately 50\% fewer qubit resources than previously reported protocols.</description>

      <title>Multipolar and nonlocal effects in plasmon-mediated entanglement generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of quantum entanglement is important for a wide range of quantum technology protocols. In nanophotonics, a promising platform for quantum technologies, entanglement generation via plasmon-mediated coupling in quantum dot qubits is often modeled within the dipole limit, where only dipolar plasmons of the mediating nanoparticle are considered, and the local response approximation, where nonlocal corrections are ignored. However, multipolar effects manifest strongly at coupling distances less than the nanoparticle size, while nonlocal optical effects stem from a size-induced dielectric response. We investigated these two important effects in the generation of two-qubit entanglement mediated by plasmonic coupling. A cavity quantum electrodynamic approach is employed, where the induced plasmonic effects lead to modified transition rates in the dynamics of the coupled quantum dot qubits. We find that multipolar modes and size-dependent damping lead to entanglement decay at small coupling distances and limit mediated entanglement with certain particle sizes. We discuss potential implications of multipolar modes in entanglement-based quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Classical Optimization Strategies for Variational Quantum Algorithms: A Systematic Study of Noise Effects and Parameter Efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study systematically benchmarks classical optimization strategies for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm when applied to Generalized Mean-Variance Problems under near-term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum conditions. We evaluate Dual Annealing, Constrained Optimization by Linear Approximation, and the Powell Method across noiseless, sampling noise, and two thermal noise models. Our Cost Function Landscape Analysis revealed that the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm angle parameters $\gamma$ were largely inactive in the noiseless regime. This insight motivated a parameter-filtered optimization approach, in which we focused the search space exclusively on the active $\beta$ parameters. This filtering substantially improved parameter efficiency for fast optimizers like Constrained Optimization by Linear Approximation (reducing evaluations from 21 to 12 in the noiseless case) and enhanced robustness, demonstrating that leveraging structural insights is an effective architecture-aware noise mitigation strategy for Variational Quantum Algorithms.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Noise-Resilient Molecular Quantum Simulation with the Generalized Superfast Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating molecular systems on quantum computers requires efficient mappings from Fermionic operators to qubit operators. Traditional mappings such as Jordan-Wigner or Bravyi-Kitaev often produce high-weight Pauli terms, increasing circuit depth and measurement complexity. Although several local qubit mappings have been proposed to address this challenge, most are specialized for structured models like the Hubbard Hamiltonian and perform poorly for realistic chemical systems with dense two-body interactions. In this work, we utilize a suite of techniques to construct compact and noise-resilient Fermion-to-qubit mappings suitable for general molecular Hamiltonians. Building on the Generalized Superfast Encoding (GSE) and other similar works, we demonstrate that it outperforms prior encodings in both accuracy and hardware efficiency for molecular simulations. Our improvements include path optimization within the Hamiltonian's interaction graph to minimize operator weight, introduction of multi-edge graph structures for enhanced error detection without added circuit depth, and a stabilizer measurement framework that directly maps logical terms and stabilizers to the Z-basis using Clifford simulation. Applying these methods to simulations of $(H_2)_2$ and $(H_2)_3$ systems yields significantly improved absolute and correlation energy estimates under realistic hardware noise, with further accuracy gains achieved by increasing code distance. We also propose a [[2N, N, 2]] variant of GSE compatible with square-lattice and (quasi-)linear hardware topologies, demonstrating a twofold reduction in RMSE for orbital rotations on IBM Kingston hardware. These results establish GSE as a very attractive mapping for molecular quantum simulations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the generation of correlated photon pairs by means of spontaneous parametric down-conversion of an optical pump in the form of a finite energy Airy beam. The optical system function, which contributes to the propagation of the down-converted beam before being registered by the detectors, is computed. The spectral function is utilized to calculate the biphoton amplitude for finding the coincidence count of the inbound Airy photons in both far-field and near-field configurations. We report the reconstruction of the finite energy Airy beam in the spatial correlation of the down-converted beams in near field scenario. In far field, the coincidence counts resembles the probability density of the biphoton in momentum space, revealing a direct mapping of the anti-correlation of the biphoton momentum. By examining the spatial Schmidt modes, we also demonstrate that longer crystals have tighter real-space correlations, but higher-dimensional angular correlations, whereas shorter crystals have fewer modes in momentum space and broader multimode correlations in position space.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic uncertainty relations for relativistic quantum thermal machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit SWAP thermal machine -- a streamlined analogue of the four-stroke Otto cycle -- whose working medium comprises inertially moving Unruh-DeWitt qubit detectors, each coupled to a thermal quantum field bath prepared at a different temperature. In the presence of relative motion between the working medium and the thermal baths, we derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) that quantify the trade-off between performance, entropy production, and power fluctuations. Our analysis identifies regimes where relativistic motion leads to stronger violation of classical TURs, previously observed in static quantum setups. In addition, we establish generalized performance bounds for the thermal machine operating as either a heat engine or a refrigerator, and discuss how relativistic motion can enhance their performances beyond the standard Carnot limits defined by rest-frame temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental demonstration of boson sampling enhanced by optical feedback lines, a novel approach that introduces temporal correlations among photons to amplify computational complexity. We utilize a 25-mode femtosecond laser-written interferometer with five output channels connected to five input channels to create correlations between consecutive photon arrival events. We have reconstructed the unitary matrix of the chip and have conducted Bayesian analysis to validate the sampler and confirm that the system exhibits behavior distinct from standard boson sampling. We also built a theoretical description of the system based on the transformation of annihilation operators and, using it, delivered the structure of the transmission matrix and the complexity of our boson sampler in terms of a conventional boson sampler. This work advances photonic quantum computing by demonstrating a resource-efficient method to increase sampling complexity, paving the way for scalable demonstration of quantum advantage with single photons.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present several aspects of the interplay between classical and quantum theories. After reviewing the equivalence between positivity and complete positivity in the commutative setting, we introduce and analyze intermediate notions that interpolate between these two properties for linear maps on the space of operators on a Hilbert space, highlighting their natural connections to quantum dynamics and entanglement theory. Finally, we discuss possible constructions that allow one to derive quantum states and evolutions from classical counterparts, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>A family of two-parameter multipartite entanglement measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is regarded as a crucial physical resource in quantum network communication. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of quantum many-body systems, identifying a multipartite entanglement measure that is both efficiently computable and capable of accurately characterizing entanglement remains a challenging problem. To address these issues, we propose a family of two-parameter multipartite entanglement measures for mixed states, termed unified-entropy concentratable entanglements. Many well-known multipartite entanglement measures are recovered as special cases of this family of measures, such as the entanglement of formation and the concentratable entanglements introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 140501 (2021)]. We demonstrate that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements constitutes a well-defined entanglement monotones, and establish several desirable properties it satisfies, such as subadditivity and continuity. We further investigate the ordering relations of unified-entropy concentratable entanglements and discuss how these quantities can be efficiently estimated on near-term quantum devices. As an application, we demonstrate that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements can effectively distinguish between multi-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and W states. The ordering relations of these entanglement measures are further validated using four-partite star quantum network states and four-qubit Dicke states. Moreover, we find that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements exhibit greater sensitivity than the original concentratable entanglements in detecting certain four-partite star quantum network states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum memory plays a critical role in quantum communication, sensing, and computation. However, studies on quantum memory under a unified benchmarking framework remain scarce. In this paper, we propose a weight-based quantifier as a benchmarking method to evaluate the performance advantage of quantum memory in nonlocal exclusion tasks. We establish a general lower bound for the weight-based measure of quantum memory. Moreover, this measure provides fundamental theoretical bounds for transforming a general channel into an ideal quantum memory. Finally, we present explicit calculations of the weight-based quantifier for various channels, including unitary channels, depolarizing channels, maximal replacement channels, stochastic damping channels, and erasure channels.</description>

      <title>Improving Quantum Neural Networks exploration by Noise-Induced Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum noise is known to strongly affect quantum computation, thus potentially limiting the performance of currently available quantum processing units. Even models of quantum neural networks based on variational quantum algorithms, which were designed to cope with the limitations of state-of-the art noisy hardware capabilities, are affected by noise-induced barren plateaus, arising when the noise level becomes too strong. However, the generalization performances of such quantum machine learning algorithms can also be positively influenced by a proper level of noise, despite its generally detrimental effects. Here, we propose a pre-training procedure to determine the quantum noise level leading to desirable optimization landscape properties. We show that an optimal quantum noise level induces an ``equalization'' of variational parameters: the least important parameters gain relevance in the computation, while the most relevant ones lose it. We analyse this noise-induced equalization through the lens of the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix, thus providing a recipe that allows to estimate the noise level inducing the strongest equalization. Then, we report on extensive numerical simulations providing evidence of the beneficial noise effects in the neighborhood of the best equalization, often leading to improved generalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement classification of pure multipartite quantum states is a challenging problem in quantum information theory that can be mathematically stated as orbit classification for some given group action on the ambient Hilbert space. The group action depends on the grained classification one expects, the finer-grained one being the classification up to local unitary transformation (LU). In this article, we show how a variational quantum circuit approach can be used to learn entanglement orbits, and we apply our findings to build a classifier for four-qubit states.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Braiding of Anyons in Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent control and braiding of anyons remain central challenges in realizing topologically protected quantum operations. We propose a Ramsey interferometry protocol to directly access the geometric phases associated with anyons in fractional Chern insulators. Our approach employs impurities with individually addressable internal states that bind to the anyons, allowing their adiabatic motion and exchange under full spatial control. By combining Ramsey and spin-echo sequences, the protocol isolates the Aharonov-Bohm and exchange contributions to the total geometric phase, providing an unambiguous probe of anyonic statistics. Our scheme can potentially be implemented in cold-atom quantum simulators as well as in van der Waals heterostructures. Complementary finite-size simulations in non-interacting Chern insulators quantify the system sizes required to faithfully extract geometric phases, highlighting the role of edge effects. Our results establish impurity-based interferometry as a feasible route toward direct anyon braiding experiments in quantum simulators and lay the groundwork for future explorations of non-Abelian braiding and topological quantum control.</description>

      <title>Shorter width truncated Taylor series for Hamiltonian dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As established in the seminal work by Berry et al.[1], expanding the time evolution operator using truncated Taylor series (up to some order $K$) makes a good candidate for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics. Here, we adapt the method but present an alternative quantum circuit that maintains an equivalent asymptotic elementary gate cost but has an exponentially reduced number of ancilla qubits. This is realized by utilizing mid-circuit measurements (with early abort-and-restart of circuit execution), and transforming a series of multi-controlled$(H^k)$ to a series of singly-controlled$(H^{k'})$, where $H$ is a linear combination of unitaries and $k, k'$ are integers. The proposed circuit utilizes a total of $\lceil \log(K) \rceil + \lceil \log(L) \rceil +n$ qubits, where $L$ is the number of terms in the Hamiltonian and $n$ is the system qubit size. Our shorter width circuit with mid-measurements protocol is implemented and evaluated using the programming language Guppy[2,3].</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Gate Design using Quantum Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementing quantum gates on quantum computers can require the application of carefully shaped pulses for high-fidelity operations. We explore the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for quantum optimal control to assess their usefulness in predicting such pulses. Our PINN is a feedforward neural network that utilizes an unsupervised learning approach, whose loss function includes terms that enforce the equations that govern the evolution of a quantum system, measure how close the learned unitary is to the target unitary operation, and ensure state normalization. We use a sinusoidal activation function and adopt variance-type weight initialization, tailored to our activation function. By analyzing the model's performance with important machine learning metrics, we demonstrate that the choice of our architecture is well-suited for this type of problem. We ensure that our network avoids the vanishing and exploding gradients with our relevant choices. We build two different PINNs, one based on the Schr\"odinger equation and another one based on the Lindblad equation. Our PINNs are able to discover high-fidelity two-qubit gate pulses for a variety of quantum operations, demonstrating its flexibility and robustness.

      <title>Adaptive Estimation of Drifting Noise in Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing quantum information processors and building fault-tolerant architectures rely on the ability to accurately characterize the noise sources and suppress their impact on quantum devices. In practice, noise often drifts over time, whereas conventional noise characterization and decoding methods typically assume stationarity or provide only a time-average behavior of the noise. This treatment can result in suboptimal decoding performance. In this work, we present a rigorous analytical framework to capture time-dependent Pauli noise, by exploiting the syndrome statistics of quantum error correction experiments. We propose a sliding-window estimation method which allows us to recover the frequency components of the noise, by using optimal window sizes that we derive analytically. We prove the noise-filtering behavior of sliding windows, linking window size to spectral cutoff frequencies, and provide an iterative algorithm that captures multiple drift frequencies. We further introduce an overlapping window algorithm that enables us to capture rapid multi-frequency noise drifts in a single-pass fashion. Simulations for both phenomenological and circuit-level noise models validate our framework, demonstrating robust tracking of multi-frequency drift. The logical error rate obtained from our estimated models consistently align with the ground-truth logical error rate, and we find suppression of logical errors compared to static error models. Our window-based estimation methods and adaptive decoding offer new insights into noise spectroscopy and decoder optimization under drift using only syndrome data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the usual process-theoretic view on locality and causality in subsystems (based on the tensor product case) to general quantum systems (i.e. possibly non-factor, finite-dimensional Von Neumann algebras). To do so, we introduce a primitive notion of splitting maps within dagger symmetric monoidal categories. Splitting maps give rise to subsystems that admit comparison via a preorder called comprehension, and support an adaptation of the usual categorical trace. We show that the comprehension preorder precisely captures the inclusion partial order between Von Neumann algebras, and that the splitting map trace captures the natural notion of Von Neumann algebra trace. As a consequence of the development of these diagrammatic tools, we prove that the known equivalence between semi-causality and semi-localisability for factor subsystems extends to all (including non-factor) subsystems.</description>

      <title>Pure-State Quantum Tomography with Minimal Rank-One POVMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography seeks to reconstruct an unknown state from measurement statistics. A finite measurement (POVM) is \emph{pure-state informationally complete} (PSI-Complete) if the outcome probabilities determine any pure state up to a global phase. We study \emph{rank-one} POVMs that are minimally sufficient for this task. We call such a POVM \emph{vital} if it is PSI-Complete but every proper subcollection is not PSI-Complete.
  We prove sharp upper bounds on the size of vital rank-one POVMs in dimension \(n\): the size is at most \(\binom{n+1}{2}\) over \(\mathbb{R}\) and at most \(n^{2}\) over \(\mathbb{C}\), and we give constructions that attain these bounds. In the real case, we further exhibit a connection to block designs: whenever \(w \mid n(n-1)\), an \((n,w,w-1)\) design produces a vital rank-one POVM with \(n + n(n-1)/w\) outcomes. We provide explicit constructions for \(w=2,n-1\), and \(n\).</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Its Verification: A Tutorial on Classical and Quantum Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement, a defining property of quantum mechanics in which two physical subsystems cannot be seen as independent entities, challenges our everyday experience and classical intuition. However, only such strong quantum correlations enable quantum technologies, including quantum computing or communication, while revealing the limits of our classical worldview by violating local realism. Given its importance in modern quantum science, we present this tutorial addressing the questions: What is entanglement, how does it differ from classical correlations, and how can it be experimentally verified? Using celebrated examples, such as Schr\"odinger's cat, we highlight the distinction between classical and quantum correlations and illustrate the definition of entangled and separable states. We review entanglement criteria by discussing Heisenberg-type uncertainty relations for continuous variables and the CHSH inequality for discrete systems. Focusing on concepts of quantum correlations and operational entanglement witnesses, we provide accessible tools and illustrative examples aimed at demystifying entanglement for a broad readership.</description>

      <title>Topological Quantum Compilation Using Mixed-Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming framework for the quantum compilation problem and apply it in the context of topological quantum computing. In this setting, quantum gates are realized by sequences of elementary braids of quasiparticles with exotic fractional statistics in certain two-dimensional topological condensed matter systems, described by effective topological quantum field theories. We specifically focus on a non-semisimple version of topological field theory, which provides a foundation for an extended theory of Ising anyons and which has recently been shown by Iulianelli et al., Nature Communications {\bf 16}, 6408 (2025), to permit universal quantum computation. While the proofs of this pioneering result are existential in nature, the mixed integer programming provides an approach to explicitly construct quantum gates in topological systems. We demonstrate this by focusing specifically on the entangling controlled-NOT operation, and its local equivalence class, using braiding operations in the non-semisimple Ising system. This illustrates the utility of the Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming for topological quantum compilation.</description>

      <title>Separating QMA from QCMA with a classical oracle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a classical oracle proving that, in a relativized setting, the set of languages decidable by an efficient quantum verifier with a quantum witness (QMA) is strictly bigger than those decidable with access only to a classical witness (QCMA). The separating classical oracle we construct is for a decision problem we coin spectral Forrelation -- the oracle describes two subsets of the boolean hypercube, and the computational task is to decide if there exists a quantum state whose standard basis measurement distribution is well supported on one subset while its Fourier basis measurement distribution is well supported on the other subset. This is equivalent to estimating the spectral norm of a "Forrelation" matrix between two sets that are accessible through membership queries.
  Our lower bound derives from a simple observation that a query algorithm with a classical witness can be run multiple times to generate many samples from a distribution, while a quantum witness is a "use once" object. This observation allows us to reduce proving a QCMA lower bound to proving a sampling hardness result which does not simultaneously prove a QMA lower bound. To prove said sampling hardness result for QCMA, we observe that quantum access to the oracle can be compressed by expressing the problem in terms of bosons -- a novel "second quantization" perspective on compressed oracle techniques, which may be of independent interest. Using this compressed perspective on the sampling problem, we prove the sampling hardness result, completing the proof.</description>

      <title>High-quality nanostructured diamond membranes for nanoscale quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale quantum sensors for condensed matter and materials physics requires placing the NV centers close to the sensing target. One solution is to fabricate diamond nanostructures and integrate them with materials and devices. However, diamond etching and ion milling can introduce subsurface damage and surface defects that degrade the charge stability and spin coherence of NV centers near the surface. Here we report a procedure for fabricating low-damage nanostructured diamond membranes, and we show that this fabrication scheme preserves the optical and spin properties of state-of-the-art shallow NV center quantum sensors, within nanometers of the diamond surface, while providing significant photonic enhancement. Furthermore, we demonstrate a pick-and-place transfer method, which enables integration with diverse sensing targets.</description>

      <title>Path integral predictions for pre-asymptotic false vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When tunneling occurs out of generic initial states, a significant fraction of probability is lost at early times during which the dynamics is governed by excited resonance states. However, first-principles analyses based on path integrals have only captured the leading asymptotic behavior during which the tunneling rate is dominated by the false vacuum contribution. In this work, we discuss the behavior in the pre-asymptotic regime from a first-principles path integral perspective. We demonstrate how the relevant expressions can be evaluated systematically through semi-classical methods in the recently developed steadyon picture. This approach allows one to trace the role of the relevant physical scales, making transparent the underlying assumptions and approximations and offering a clear path to establishing a systematically improvable framework to evaluate tunneling rates non-perturbatively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in the understanding of real-time path integrals led to the development of the ``steadyon picture'' for the semi-classical calculation of quantum tunneling rates. We discuss tunneling out of a generic localized initial state in this picture and present its application for the important example of a resonance state in a one-dimensional point particle potential. We find that the steadyon picture indeed reproduces existing results obtained using the WKB method. Our analysis furthermore demonstrates how applying this picture to physical states naturally addresses open conceptual questions regarding this framework. Finally, we perform a numerical study for a specific potential. We demonstrate in particular the existence of regimes in which the tunneling rate is dominated by higher resonances, rather than the false vacuum, as well as their importance.</description>

      <title>Variational Method in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a variational framework for addressing two-dimensional non-integrable quantum field theories through the exact structure of their integrable counterparts. Concentrating on the $\varphi^4$ Landau-Ginzburg model, we use the analytical Vacuum Expectation Values and Form Factors of local operators in the sinh-Gordon theory as the foundation of a variational ansatz. In this way, we obtain controlled estimates of central physical quantities of the $\varphi^4$ theory - such as the finite-volume ground-state energy and the physical mass as a function of the coupling constant. The strengths of the variational methods are leveraged in combination with the Hamiltonian truncation techniques and the LeClair-Mussardo formula, which also allow to probe the accuracy of the variational approximation varying the system size. Within the weak-coupling regime, a detailed numerical analysis reveals the behaviour of the finite-volume spectrum, the ground-state energy, and the elastic part of the scattering matrix, showing how the rigorous machinery of integrable models can serve as a guiding light into the complex landscape of non-integrable quantum field dynamics.</description>

      <title>Universality and weak-ergodicity breaking in quantum quenches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sudden quenches in quantum many-body systems often lead to dynamical evolutions that unveil surprising physical behaviors. In this work, we argue that the emergence of weak ergodicity breaking following quantum quenches in certain local many-body systems is a direct consequence of lattice discretization. To support this claim, we investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum $O(n)$ models on a lattice. In doing so, we also revisit two puzzling results in the literature on quantum $O(n)$ models, concerning universal scaling and equilibration, and demonstrate how these apparent contradictions can be resolved by properly accounting for lattice effects.</description>

      <title>Topological subregions in Chern Simons theory and topological string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard, gapped entanglement boundary condition in Chern Simons theory breaks the topological invariance of the theory by introducing a complex structure on the entangling surface. This produces an infinite dimensional subregion Hilbert space, a non-trivial modular Hamiltonion, and a UV-divergent entanglement entropy that is a universal feature of local quantum field theories. In this work, we appeal to the combinatorial quantization of Chern Simons theory to define a purely topological notion of a subregion. The subregion operator algebras are spaces of functions on a quantum group. We develop a diagrammatic calculus for the associated $q$-deformed entanglement entropy, which arise from the entanglement of anyonic edge modes. The $q$-deformation regulates the divergences of the QFT, producing a finite entanglement entropy associated to a $q$-tracial state. We explain how these ideas provide an operator algebraic framework for the entanglement entropy computations in topological string theory \cite{Donnelly:2020teo,Jiang:2020cqo, wongtopstring}, where a large- $N$ limit of the $q$-deformed subregion algebra plays a key role in the stringy description of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Probing short-range gravity using quantum reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum reflection occurs when ultra-cold atoms are incident on a material surface with sufficiently low velocity. The reflecting matter wave can interfere with the incident wave to form a detectable pattern, and this pattern contains information about atom-surface interactions at micrometer scales. We discuss how such an interferometer could be used to probe for anomalous short-range forces that are predicted by some beyond-standard model theories. We compare a simple analytical model for the anomalous phase to numerical solution of both the linear and non-linear Schrodinger equations, finding good agreement. With interactions, the phase does depend on the atomic density, which can be a source of noise. We nonetheless predict that under realistic conditions, the reflection technique can reach sensitivities approaching those obtained with macroscopic objects, and significantly improve the limits on anomalous coupling to atoms.</description>

      <title>Complex Eigenvalues in a pseudo-Hermitian \b{eta}-Laguerre ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian PT-symmetric models have been extensively studied in recent years. Following the seminal work that reduced classical random matrix ensembles to a tridiagonal form, several efforts have aimed to generalize this framework to non-Hermitian extensions of the so-called \b{eta}-ensembles. In particular, while the transition of eigenvalues from the real axis to the complex plane has been well characterized for the \b{eta}-Hermite ensemble under symmetry breaking, the behavior of the \b{eta}-Laguerre ensemble in a similar non-Hermitian setting remains
  less understood. In this work, we investigate an ensemble of unstable matrices isospectral to the \b{eta}-Laguerre ensemble. Introducing a small non-Hermitian perturbation breaks the symmetry and drives the eigenvalues into the complex plane. We derive analytical expressions for the loci of complex-conjugate eigenvalue pairs, which organize into a balloon-like structure in the complex plane, followed by a discrete finite line of real eigenvalues. The asymptotic behavior of these eigenvalues is analyzed in the large matrix-size limit, and our theoretical predictions are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>QIBONN: A Quantum-Inspired Bilevel Optimizer for Neural Networks on Tabular Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for neural networks on tabular data is critical to a wide range of applications, yet it remains challenging due to large, non-convex search spaces and the cost of exhaustive tuning. We introduce the Quantum-Inspired Bilevel Optimizer for Neural Networks (QIBONN), a bilevel framework that encodes feature selection, architectural hyperparameters, and regularization in a unified qubit-based representation. By combining deterministic quantum-inspired rotations with stochastic qubit mutations guided by a global attractor, QIBONN balances exploration and exploitation under a fixed evaluation budget. We conduct systematic experiments under single-qubit bit-flip noise (0.1\%--1\%) emulated by an IBM-Q backend. Results on 13 real-world datasets indicate that QIBONN is competitive with established methods, including classical tree-based methods and both classical/quantum-inspired HPO algorithms under the same tuning budget.</description>

Abstract: The modern theory of Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluidity, and superconductivity is reviewed. The thermodynamic principle for superfluid flow and the equation of motion for condensed bosons are given. Computer simulations of Lennard-Jones $^4$He give the $\lambda$-transition and the superfluid viscosity. The statistical mechanical theory of high-temperature superconductivity is presented. Critical comparison is made with older approaches, such as ground energy state condensation, irrotational superfluid flow, and the macroscopic wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Enhanced spectral range of strain-induced tuning of quantum dots in circular Bragg grating cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tunable sources of entangled and single photons are essential for implementing entanglement-based quantum information protocols, as quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping depend on photon indistinguishability. Tunable devices are fabricated from indium arsenide (InAs) quantum dots (QDs) embedded in gallium arsenide (GaAs) nanomembranes placed on monolithic piezoelectric substrates. Circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators enhance emission brightness and exploit the Purcell effect; however, the inclusion of CBGs reduces strain-mediated tunability compared to planar nanomembranes. A simple and effective solution is introduced: filling the CBG trenches with a stiff dielectric (aluminum oxide) via atomic layer deposition (ALD) restores up to 95% of the tunability of planar structures. Finite element analysis (FEA) confirms that the tunability loss originates from bending in the device layers due to strain relief in the CBG geometry. Lowering the stiffness of intermediate layers between the QDs and the piezoelectric actuator, such as in bonding or reflector layers, further increases strain losses in uncoated CBGs. Coated devices maintain 98-99% strain-tuning efficiency across all simulated underlayer stiffnesses. The results demonstrate that advantageous optical cavity properties can be effectively combined with piezoelectric strain tuning, enabling scalable, bright, and tunable quantum light sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing quantum gravity theory remains one of the major challenges in modern physics, as the lack of experimental evidence makes it difficult to explore. In response to this challenge, proposals to test quantum entanglement induced by Newtonian gravity in table-top experiments have attracted significant attention as a potentially feasible approach far below the Planck energy scale. In this work, we propose a scheme to amplify gravity-induced entanglement between two masses using parametric resonance. Specifically, we consider two parametrically resonant oscillators interacting through Newtonian gravity, each governed by the Mathieu equation. We analyzed the logarithmic negativity between two oscillators and investigate the effects of random force noise and linear damping. As a result, we find an exponential growth of gravity-induced entanglement between the oscillators, which reflects the dynamical instability of parametric resonant systems.</description>

      <title>Infinite-component $BF$ field theory: Nexus of fracton order, Toeplitz braiding, and non-Hermitian amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the recent study of Toeplitz braiding by Li et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories. An intriguing analogy to the scenario of parallel universes is also briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: The conversion of the modulation signal from the coupling light to the probe light and the conversion of the additional phase noise from the coupling light to the amplitude noise of the probe light in the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectrum of the cesium atomic ladder type three level system were investigated by detecting the probe light output noise spectrum. It was demonstrated that frequency stabilization via external modulation can effectively avoid the transfer of modulation noise. In the experiment, two frequency stabilization methods external modulation transfer spectroscopy and internal modulation transfer spectroscopy were employed to achieve the frequency stabilization of the coupling light. The probe light noise spectra at the frequency stabilized output terminal and the detection output terminal were measured under both methods.</description>

Abstract: Key-length extension (KLE) techniques provide a general approach to enhancing the security of block ciphers by using longer keys. There are mainly two classes of KLE techniques, cascade encryption and XOR-cascade encryption. This paper presents several quantum meet-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against two specific KLE constructions.
  For the two-key triple encryption (2kTE), we propose two quantum MITM attacks under the Q2 model. The first attack, leveraging the quantum claw-finding (QCF) algorithm, achieves a time complexity of $O(2^{2\kappa/3})$ with $O(2^{2\kappa/3})$ quantum random access memory (QRAM). The second attack, based on Grover's algorithm, achieves a time complexity of $O(2^{\kappa/2})$ with $O(2^\kappa)$ QRAM. The latter complexity is nearly identical to Grover-based brute-force attack on the underlying block cipher, indicating that 2kTE does not enhance security under the Q2 model when sufficient QRAM resources are available.
  For the 3XOR-cascade encryption (3XCE), we propose a quantum MITM attack applicable to the Q1 model. This attack requires no QRAM and has a time complexity of $O(2^{(\kappa+n)/2})$ ($\kappa$ and $n$ are the key length and block length of the underlying block cipher, respectively.), achieving a quadratic speedup over classical MITM attack.
  Furthermore, we extend the quantum MITM attack to quantum sieve-in-the-middle (SITM) attack, which is applicable for more constructions. We present a general quantum SITM framework for the construction $ELE=E^2\circ L\circ E^1$ and provide specific attack schemes for three different forms of the middle layer $L$. The quantum SITM attack technique can be further applied to a broader range of quantum cryptanalysis scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A superintegrable generalization of the classical and quantum Zernike systems is reviewed. The corresponding Hamiltonians are endowed with higher-order integrals and can be interpreted as higher-order superintegrable perturbations of the 2D spherical (Higgs), hyperbolic, and Euclidean harmonic oscillators. As a new result, the complete polynomial Higgs-type symmetry algebra of the generalized classical system is presented. For the generalized quantum system, the symmetry algebra and the spectra are provided for a representative case.</description>

      <title>Coherent distributions for the rigid rotator</title>

      <description>arXiv:1504.04832v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent solutions of the classical Liouville equation for the rigid rotator are presented as positive phase-space distributions associated with the Lagrangian submanifolds of Hamilton-Jacobi theory. These solutions become Wigner-type quasiprobability distributions by a formal discretization of the left-invariant vector fields from their Fourier transform in angular momentum. The results are consistent with the usual quantization of the anisotropic rotator, but the expected value of the Hamiltonian contains a finite "zero point" energy term. It is shown that during the time when a quasiprobability distribution evolves according to the Liouville equation, the related quantum wave function should satisfy the time-dependent Schroedinger equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently there has been much interest and progress in extending the definition of contextuality to systems with disturbance. We prove that such an endeavor cannot simultaneously satisfy the following principles: (1) any deterministic system is noncontextual; (2) discarding information cannot turn a noncontextual system into a contextual one; (3) classical post-processing cannot create contextuality; (4) the joint realization of two statistically independent noncontextual systems is noncontextual. We also prove the same result without principle 4, under a stronger version of principle 1.</description>

      <title>Optimal Fermionic Joint Measurements for Estimating Non-Commuting Majorana Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important class of fermionic observables, relevant in tasks such as fermionic partial tomography and estimating energy levels of chemical Hamiltonians, are the binary measurements obtained from the product of anti-commuting Majorana operators. In this work, we investigate efficient estimation strategies of these observables based on a joint measurement which, after classical post-processing, yields all sufficiently unsharp (noisy) Majorana observables of even-degree. By exploiting the symmetry properties of the Majorana observables, as described by the braid group, we show that the incompatibility robustness, i.e., the minimal classical noise necessary for joint measurability, relates to the spectral properties of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. In particular, we show that for an $n$ mode fermionic system, the incompatibility robustness of all degree-$2k$ Majorana observables satisfies $\Theta(n^{-k/2})$ for $k\leq 5$. Furthermore, we present a joint measurement scheme achieving the asymptotically optimal noise, implemented by a small number of fermionic Gaussian unitaries and sampling from the set of all Majorana monomials. Our joint measurement, which can be performed via a randomization over projective measurements, provides rigorous performance guarantees for estimating fermionic observables comparable with fermionic classical shadows.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generation of Multi-partite Entanglement between Non-local Superconducting Qubits using Classical Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is one of the primary features which distinguishes quantum computers from classical computers. In gate-based quantum computing, the creation of entangled states or the distribution of entanglement across a quantum processor often requires circuit depths which grow with the number of entangled qubits. However, in teleportation-based quantum computing, one can deterministically generate entangled states with a circuit depth that is constant in the number of qubits, provided that one has access to an entangled resource state, the ability to perform mid-circuit measurements, and can rapidly transmit classical information. In this work, aided by fast classical field programmable gate array-based control hardware with a feedback latency of only 150 ns, we explore the utility of teleportation-based protocols for generating non-local, multi-partite entanglement between superconducting qubits. First, we demonstrate well-known protocols for generating Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and non-local CNOT gates in constant depth. Next, we utilize both protocols for implementing a quantum fan-out gate in constant depth among three non-local qubits (i.e., controlled-NOT-NOT). Finally, we demonstrate deterministic state teleportation and entanglement swapping between qubits on opposite sides of our quantum processor. Throughout this work, we find that the fidelity of our teleportation-based protocols is limited by measurement-induced dephasing on idling spectator qubits. Therefore, our work serves as a useful study of the current benefits and limitations of teleportation-based protocols on contemporary superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Simulating Non-Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics with Neural Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing computational scaling for simulating non-Markovian dissipative dynamics using artificial neural networks is both a major focus and formidable challenge in open quantum systems. To enable neural quantum states (NQSs), we encode environmental memory in dissipatons (quasiparticles with characteristic lifetimes), yielding the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation (DQME). The resulting NQS-DQME framework achieves compact representation of many-body correlations and non-Markovian memory. Benchmarking against numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion confirms NQS-DQME maintains comparable accuracy while enhancing scalability and interpretability. This methodology opens new paths to explore non-Markovian open quantum dynamics in previously intractable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The laws of thermodynamics strongly restrict the performance of thermal machines. Standard thermodynamics, initially developed for uncorrelated macroscopic systems, does not hold for microscopic systems correlated with their environments. We here derive an exact formula for the efficiency of any cyclically driven quantum engine by using generalized laws of quantum thermodynamics that account for all possible correlations between all involved parties, including initial correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of two basic modes of engine operation: the usual thermal case, where heat is converted into work, and a novel athermal regime, where work is extracted from entropic resources, such as system-bath correlations. In the latter regime, the efficiency is not bounded by the usual Carnot formula. Our results provide a unified formalism to determine the efficiency of correlated microscopic quantum machines.</description>

      <title>Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution with Single Quadrature Measurement at Arbitrary Reference Frame</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simplified measurement scheme for a Gaussian modulated coherent state (GMCS) protocol for continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), utilizing homodyne detection without quadrature switching. The reference frame of measurement is taken to be at an arbitrary angle, however, reconciliation converges the proposed scheme to GMCS with switching quadrature protocol. The arbitrary frame of measurement could also include the unknown random thermal drift within Bob's optical measurement setup. We found this scheme is advantageous for practical free-space and fibre-based GMCS protocol based CV-QKD systems as it does not require a phase modulator for random measurement selection quadrature at Bob.</description>

      <title>Boundaries for quantum advantage with single photons and loop-based time-bin interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16873v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loop-based boson samplers interfere photons in the time degree of freedom using a sequence of delay lines. Since they require few hardware components while also allowing for long-range entanglement, they are strong candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage beyond the reach of classical emulation. We propose a method to exploit this loop-based structure to more efficiently classically sample from such systems. Our algorithm exploits a causal-cone argument to decompose the circuit into smaller effective components that can each be simulated sequentially by calling a state vector simulator as a subroutine. To quantify the complexity of our approach, we develop a new lattice path formalism that allows us to efficiently characterize the state space that must be tracked during the simulation. In addition, we develop a heuristic method that allows us to predict the expected average and worst-case memory requirements of running these simulations. We use these methods to compare the simulation complexity of different families of loop-based interferometers, allowing us to quantify the potential for quantum advantage of single-photon Boson Sampling in loop-based architectures.</description>

      <title>Hiding, Shuffling, and Cycle Finding: Quantum Algorithms on Edge Lists</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The edge list model is arguably the simplest input model for graphs, where the graph is specified by a list of its edges. In this model, we study the quantum query complexity of three variants of the triangle finding problem. The first asks whether there exists a triangle containing a target edge and raises general questions about the hiding of a problem's input among irrelevant data. The second asks whether there exists a triangle containing a target vertex and raises general questions about the shuffling of a problem's input. The third asks whether there exists a triangle; this problem bridges the $3$-distinctness and $3$-sum problems, which have been extensively studied by both cryptographers and complexity theorists. We provide tight or nearly tight results for these problems as well as some first answers to the general questions they raise.
  Furthermore, given any graph with low maximum degree, such as a typical random sparse graph, we prove that the quantum query complexity of finding a length-$k$ cycle in its length-$m$ edge list is $m^{3/4-1/(2^{k+2}-4)\pm o(1)}$, which matches the best-known upper bound for the quantum query complexity of $k$-distinctness on length-$m$ inputs up to an $m^{o(1)}$ factor. We prove the lower bound by developing new techniques within Zhandry's recording query framework [CRYPTO '19] as generalized by Hamoudi and Magniez [ToCT '23]. These techniques extend the framework to treat any non-product distribution that results from conditioning a product distribution on the absence of rare events. We prove the upper bound by adapting Belovs's learning graph algorithm for $k$-distinctness [FOCS '12]. Finally, assuming a plausible conjecture concerning only cycle finding, we show that the lower bound can be lifted to an essentially tight lower bound on the quantum query complexity of $k$-distinctness, which is a long-standing open question.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems can display exceptional topological defects without Hermitian counterparts, exemplified by exceptional rings in NH two-dimensional systems. However, exceptional topological features associated with higher-dimension topological defects remain unexplored yet. We here investigate the topology for the singularities in an NH three-dimensional system. We find that the three-order singularities in the parameter space form an exceptional surface (ES), on which all the three eigenstates and eigenenergies coalesce. Such an ES corresponds to a two-dimensional extension of a point-like synthetic tensor monopole. We quantify its topology with the Dixmier-Douady invariant, which measures the quantized flux associated with the synthetic tensor field. We further propose an experimentally feasible scheme for engineering such an NH model. Our results pave the way for investigations of exceptional topology associated with topological defects with more than one dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizerness or quantum magic of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($\rm SYK$) model, a prototype example of maximally chaotic quantum matter. We show that the Majorana spectrum of its ground state, encoding the spreading of the state in the Majorana basis, displays a Gaussian distribution as expected for chaotic quantum many-body systems. We compare our results with the case of the $\rm SYK_2$ model, describing non-chaotic random free fermions, and show that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively different in the two cases, featuring an exponential Laplace distribution for the $\rm SYK_2$ model rather than a Gaussian. From the spectrum we extract the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) and show that for both models it displays a linear scaling with system size, with a prefactor that is larger for the SYK model, which has therefore higher magic. Finally, we discuss the spreading of quantun magic under unitary dynamics, as described by the evolution of the Majorana spectrum and the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy starting from a stabilizer state. We show that the SRE for the $\rm SYK_2$ model equilibrates rapidly, but that in the steady-state the interacting chaotic SYK model has more magic than the simple $\rm SYK_2$. Our results suggest that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively distinct in chaotic and non-chaotic many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks (QPINNs) integrate quantum computing and machine learning to impose physical biases on the output of a quantum neural network, aiming to either solve or discover differential equations. The approach has recently been implemented on both the gate model and continuous variable quantum computing architecture, where it has been demonstrated capable of solving ordinary differential equations. Here, we aim to extend the method to effectively address a wider range of equations, such as the Poisson equation and the heat equation. To achieve this goal, we introduce an architecture specifically designed to compute second-order (and higher-order) derivatives without relying on nested automatic differentiation methods. This approach mitigates the unwanted side effects associated with nested gradients in simulations, paving the way for more efficient and accurate implementations. By leveraging such an approach, the quantum circuit addresses partial differential equations, a challenge not yet tackled using this approach on continuous-variable quantum computers. As a proof-of-concept, we solve a one-dimensional instance of the heat equation, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling PDEs, both in an ideal and a noisy regime. We report our experiment on a photonic hardware to address a realistic noise scenario for our simulations. Such a framework paves the way for further developments in continuous-variable quantum computing and underscores its potential contributions to advancing quantum machine learning.</description>

Abstract: It is known that an entanglement-based witness of non-classicality can be applied to testing quantum effects in gravity. Specifically, if a system can create entanglement between two quantum probes by local means only, then it must be non-classical. Recently, claims have been made that collapse-based models of classical gravity, i.e. Di\'osi-Penrose model, can predict gravitationally induced entanglement between quantum objects, resulting in gravitationally induced entanglement is insufficient to conclude that gravity is fundamentally quantum, contrary to the witness statement. Here we vindicate the witness. We analyze the underlying physics of collapse-based models for gravity and show that these models have nonlocal features, violating the principle of locality.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bounds in Hybrid Quantum-Classical Machine Learning Models</title>

Abstract: Hybrid classical-quantum models aim to harness the strengths of both quantum computing and classical machine learning, but their practical potential remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a unified mathematical framework for analyzing generalization in hybrid models, offering insight into how these systems learn from data. We establish a novel generalization bound of the form $\tilde{\mathcal O}\left( \tfrac{\alpha^{k}}{\sqrt{N}}\, \big( k^{\tfrac{3}{2}}\sqrt{m n}\;+\;\sqrt{T\log T}\big) \right)$ for $N$ training data points, $T$ trainable quantum gates, $n$ dimensional quantum circuit output, and $k$ bounded linear layers $ \|F_i\|_F \leq \alpha$ where $ i = 1, \dots, k $ and $F_i \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} $ interspersed with activation functions. This generalization bound decomposes into quantum and classical contributions, providing a theoretical framework to separate their influence and clarifying their interaction. Alongside the bound, we highlight conceptual limitations of applying classical statistical learning theory in the hybrid setting and suggest promising directions for future theoretical work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first protocol specifically designed to generate anticoherent spin-$j$ states at different orders. The protocol consists of cycles of a rotation pulse about an axis followed by a squeezing pulse in a perpendicular direction. To protect these states, we develop dynamical decoupling techniques using group-based sequence design and the dynamically corrected gate formalism. We analyze key sources of dephasing, disorder, and dipole-dipole interactions and assess the effectiveness of our methods in preserving coherence. Potential applications of the produced anticoherent spin states include quantum sensing and studies related to quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Repeated quantum backflow and overflow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum backflow is a surprising phenomenon in which a quantum particle, moving in one dimension and with a state of rightwards momentum, can exhibit a net probability transfer to the left-hand half-line over a finite time interval. We generalise the setting of quantum backflow to allow for $M$ disjoint time intervals, considering the sum of probability differences for each interval. In classical statistical particle mechanics, the total backflow lies in the interval $[-1,0]$ for all $M$, indicating rightwards probability transfer. By contrast, we show that, in quantum mechanics, the maximum $M$-fold backflow is positive and unbounded from above as $M$ increases, demonstrating that there are states that exhibit repeated periods of backflow.
  Moreover, for $M\ge 2$, we discover a new phenomenon; namely, that there are states whose total backflow is below $-1$, giving a probability transfer to the right-hand half-line beyond that possible in classical statistical particle mechanics. We call this effect "quantum overflow". The maximum extent of the backflow and overflow effects is described by a hierarchy of backflow and overflow functions and constants, where the $M$'th backflow (overflow) constant is the supremum (infimum) of the $M$'th backflow (overflow) function. The $M=1$ backflow constant was first identified by Bracken and Melloy.
  Our results are obtained by formulating the $M$-fold backflow problem in terms of the spectra of suitable bounded operators. Using this formulation, we also study limiting cases of the backflow and overflow functions, including cases in which two disjoint intervals merge. Our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical investigations. Among other things, by applying numerical acceleration methods, we obtain a new estimate of the Bracken-Melloy constant of $0.0384506$ which is slightly lower than the previously accepted value of $0.038452$.</description>

      <title>Ergotropic characterization of continuous variable entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum thermodynamics in the Gaussian regime provides a promising framework for investigating the energetic role of quantum correlations, particularly in optical systems. In this work, we introduce an entropy-free criterion for entanglement detection in bipartite Gaussian states, rooted in a distinct thermodynamic quantity: ergotropy--the maximum extractable work via unitary operations. By defining the relative ergotropic gap, which quantifies the disparity between global and local ergotropy, we derive two independent analytical bounds that distinguish entangled from separable states. These bounds coincide for a broad class of quantum states, making the criterion both necessary and sufficient in such cases. Unlike entropy-based measures, our ergotropic approach captures fundamentally different aspects of quantum correlations and entanglement, particularly in mixed continuous-variable systems. We also extend our analysis beyond the Gaussian regime to certain non-Gaussian states and observe that Gaussian ergotropy continues to reflect thermodynamic signatures in entangled states, albeit with some limitations. These findings establish a direct operational link between entanglement and energy storage, offering an experimentally accessible approach to entanglement detection in continuous-variable optical platforms.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a family of operators exploiting the symmetry of superpositions of quadrature eigenstates (SQE) and demonstrate how the associated nonlinear squeezing, quantified by the expectation value of such operators, serves both as a witness of non-Gaussianity and as an indicator of the quality of SQE approximations. To establish the usefulness of this measure, we connect it to quantum state fidelity and evaluate its implications in breeding protocols. Finally, we construct optimal approximations of SQE states in truncated Fock spaces.</description>

Abstract: A single quantum emitter coupled to a structured non-Hermitian environment shows anomalous bound states and real-time dynamics without Hermitian counterparts, as shown in [Gong et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 223601 (2022)]. In this work, we establish a general approach for studying the scattering states of a single quantum emitter coupled to one-dimensional non-Hermitian single-band baths. We formally solve the exact eigenvalue equation for all the scattering states defined on finite periodic lattices. In the thermodynamic limit, the formal solution reduces to the celebrated Lippmann-Schwinger equation for generic baths. In this case, we find that the scattering states are no longer linear superpositions of plane waves in general, unlike those in Hermitian systems; Instead, the wave functions exhibit a large, yet finite localization length proportional to the lattice size. Furthermore, we show and discuss the cases where the Lippmann-Schwinger equation breaks down. We find the analytical solutions for the Hatano-Nelson and unidirectional next-to-nearest-neighbor baths in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Correlations and quantum circuits with dynamical causal order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Requiring that the causal structure between different parties is well-defined imposes constraints on the correlations they can establish, which define so-called causal correlations. Some of these are known to have a "dynamical" causal order in the sense that their causal structure is not fixed a priori but is instead established on the fly, with for instance the causal order between future parties depending on some choice of action of parties in the past. Here we identify a new way that the causal order between the parties can be dynamical: with at least four parties, there can be some dynamical order which can nevertheless not be influenced by the actions of past parties. This leads us to introduce an intermediate class of correlations with what we call non-influenceable causal order, in between the set of correlations with static (non-dynamical) causal order and the set of general causal correlations. We then define analogous classes of quantum processes, considering recently introduced classes of quantum circuits with classical or quantum control of causal order -- the latter being the largest class within the process matrix formalism known to have a clear interpretation in terms of coherent superpositions of causal orders. This allows us to formalise precisely in which sense certain quantum processes can have both indefinite and dynamical causal order.</description>

      <title>A resource-centric, task-based approach to quantum network control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum networks exhibit fundamental differences from their classical counterparts. These differences necessitate novel principles when organizing, managing, and operating them. Here we propose an unconventional approach to organize and manage the operations of quantum network devices. Instead of a hierarchical scheme using layers, like in classical networks and present quantum network stack models, we propose a resource-centric task-based scheme. In this scheme, quantum applications pose objectives, initiated by a node, to a quantum network, such as sharing an entangled state or sending a qubit along a path. The quantum network node initiating the objective consequently derives a distributed workflow, referred to as saga, comprising numerous tasks operating on resources, which completes the objective. We identify three different kinds of resources with their own and independent topology, namely classical messaging, quantum channels and entanglement. Sagas can either be centrally orchestrated or performed in choreography by the network nodes. The tasks of a saga originate from and operate on resources of the network, such as quantum channels or entanglement, and they not only comprise operations and measurements, but potentially also include other tasks or even entire protocols, such as sending a qubit, distributing entanglement or performing entanglement purification steps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum-to-classical transition in finite-dimensional systems is generally believed to occur asymptotically, yet this process has not been systematically examined and the mechanism governing the intermediate regime remains unclear. We address this question using an operational framework that bridges discrete generalized measurements and continuous isotropic depolarizing channels. We show that a single round of such a generalized measurement can eliminate quasiprobability negativity, that is, nonclassicality, in quantum phase space for finite-dimensional systems. From the perspective of decoherence, we find that although the overall process is continuous, the loss of quasiprobability negativity occurs abruptly, defying the conventional expectation of asymptotic decay. Additionally, we propose quantum-circuit implementations and analyze their feasibility on current quantum platforms, such as superconducting systems. Our results provide new insight into the intermediate regime of the quantum-to-classical transition in finite-dimensional systems and enable the simulation of open system dynamics through operational generalized measurements.</description>

      <title>A Compact Framework for Analyzing Asynchronous Entanglement Distribution in Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a compact framework for analyzing asynchronous entanglement distribution protocols under realistic error models. We focus on two contemporary protocols: sequential, where entanglement is established one node at a time, and parallel, where all nodes attempt to generate entanglement simultaneously. We derive an analytical expression for the fidelity of distributed entangled states, showing that the fidelity depends only on the total time all qubits spend in memory, rather than the individual memory times for each qubit. This result distills the complex dynamics of entanglement distribution into a compact accessible form, providing an scalable tool for evaluating protocol efficiency. Using this lightweight framework, we analyze the performance of parallel and sequential protocols, demonstrating that parallel distribution consistently outperforms sequential and highlighting the potential of parallel protocols for practical quantum network implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Programmable quantum systems based on Rydberg atom arrays have recently emerged as a promising testbed for combinatorial optimization. Indeed, the Maximum Weighted Independent Set problem on unit-disk graphs can be efficiently mapped to such systems due to their geometric constraints. However, extending this capability to arbitrary graph instances typically necessitates the use of reduction gadgets, which introduce additional experimental overhead and complexity. Here, we analyze the complexity-theoretic limits of polynomial reductions from arbitrary graphs to unit-disk instances. We prove any such reduction incurs a quadratic blow-up in vertex count and degrades solution approximation guarantees. As a practical alternative, we propose a divide-and-conquer heuristic with only linear overhead which leverages precalibrated atomic layouts. We benchmark it on Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs, and demonstrate feasibility on the Orion Alpha processor.</description>

      <title>Can Randomly Structured Metasurfaces Be Used for Quantum Tomography of High-Dimensional Spatial Qudits?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing the density matrix of the quantum state of photons through a tomographically complete set of measurements, known as quantum state tomography, is an essential task in nearly all applications of quantum science and technology, from quantum sensing to quantum communications. Recent advances in optical metasurfaces enable the design of ultrathin nanostructured optical elements performing such state tomography tasks, promising greater simplicity, miniaturization, and scalability. However, reported metasurfaces on this goal were limited to a small Hilbert dimension, e.g., polarization qubits or spatial qudits with only a few states. When scaling up to higher-dimensional qudit tomography problems, especially those involving spatial qudits, a natural question arises: whether a metasurface with randomized nanostructures is sufficient to perform such qudit tomography, achieving optimal conditions. In this work, we attempt to answer this question through a set of numerical experiments with random metasurfaces, utilizing large-scale simulations of over 16,000 distinct metasurfaces each exceeding 200 wavelengths in size. We show that with sufficient redundancy in the number of detectors, random metasurfaces perform reasonably well in quantum photonic spatial qudit tomography encoded in Hermite-Gaussian states for up to approximately 10 states. Furthermore, we discuss additional considerations for optimizing metasurfaces in multiphoton cases. Our work opens a pathway toward computationally efficient, miniaturized, and error-tolerant quantum measurement platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the entanglement between electronic and nuclear motions in molecular wave functions, by using different widely used ansatzes in molecular Hamiltonian models (H$^+_2$ in 1D and the Shin-Metiu model); namely, i) Born-Oppenheimer separation in both adiabatic and ii) diabatic pictures and beyond it, iii) using a Born-Huang expansion, which involves non-adiabatic couplings in the solution. Any molecule can be considered a bipartite system in terms of electronic and nuclear halfspaces. Accordingly, the Schmidt decomposition theorem can be applied to each molecular ansatz to find a much shorter representation in terms of Schmidt basis and to estimate the entanglement content through the calculation of von Neumann entropies. Although here we justify that the ground BO vibronic state of any molecule may be regarded as an almost separable and non-entangled state, this property worsens with the vibrational excitation, which increases the entanglement monotonically. The interlace between electronic and nuclear wave functions for each vibronic state becomes even more critical for those electronic excited states whose electronic wave functions change drastically with the molecular geometry. We find that the entanglement may be quantified by the variation of the electronic wave function along the different nuclear geometries, and that the nuclear wave function indeed plays the role of a tester. In addition, the presence of avoided crossings among the potential energy curves brings about a strong enhancement of entanglement in the Born-Oppenheimer adiabatic picture, which instead is much reduced in a diabatic picture. Finally, the Born-Huang expansion uncovers some synergistic vibronic states whose entanglement content is larger than that of any Born-Oppenheimer component in the superposition.</description>

Abstract: Hydrogen-like alkali atoms with a single valence electron are the most common objects in quantum optics and, at the same time, serve as essential tools of the field. Under conditions of optical pumping, strong spin-exchange and ultra-weak magnetic field (spin-exchange relaxation free mode, SERF), ensembles of such atoms in the gas phase can demonstrate not only the absence of spin-exchange relaxation, but also nonlinear collective effects. We present experimental evidence that the alignment, i.e. the quadrupole momentum, can not only be preserved under SERF conditions, but also coexist and interact with the orientation, i.e. the dipole momentum. We also show that this interaction leads to bistability: a small change in conditions can cause the medium to transition to a different steady state, an effect characterized by hysteresis. The combination of properties of this effect opens up a wide range of applications as optical keys or memory elements with a storage time of hundreds of seconds in tasks of quantum information and cryptography.</description>

Abstract: The advantage that many quantum algorithms have over their classical counterparts may be lost when the results are extracted as classical data (output problem). One example are eigenpair solvers, which encode the eigenpairs in a quantum state. Extracting these states results in significant sampling overheads. We propose an amplitude-amplification-based post-filtering process that reduces the number of eigenpairs encoded in the final state to a feasible amount. Often for practical applications, computing a subset of all eigenpairs is sufficient, which drastically reduces the sampling overhead. We show, that our adapted eigenpair solver does not only compete with classical alternatives but outperforms them in terms of memory requirements, runtime, and versatility. This makes it an efficient end-to-end quantum algorithm with real-world application in science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Computational complexity of injective projected entangled pair states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) constitute a variational family of quantum states with area-law entanglement. PEPS are particularly relevant and successful for studying ground states of spatially local Hamiltonians. However, computing local expectation values in these states is known to be \postBQP-hard. Injective PEPS, where all constituent tensors fulfil an injectivity constraint, are generally believed to be better behaved, because they are unique ground states of spatially local Hamiltonians. In this work, we therefore examine how the computational hardness of contraction depends on the injectivity. We establish that below a constant positive injectivity threshold, evaluating local observables remains \postBQP-complete, while above a different constant nontrivial threshold there exists an efficient classical algorithm for the task, resolving an open question from (Anshu et al., STOC `24). We do this by proving that noisy postselected quantum computation can be made fault-tolerant.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic driving at Rydberg excitation for symmetric $C_Z$ gates with ultracold neutral atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the scheme of neutral atom Rydberg $C_Z$ gate based on double sequence of adiabatic pulses applied symmetrically to both atoms using counterdiabatic driving in the regime of Rydberg blockade. This provides substantial reducing of quantum gate operation times (at least five times) compared to previously proposed adiabatic schemes, which is important for high-fidelity entanglement due to finite Rydberg lifetimes. We analyzed schemes of adiabatic rapid passage with counterdiabatic driving for single-photon, two-photon and three-photon schemes of Rydberg excitation for rubidium and cesium atoms. We designed laser pulse profiles with fully analytical shapes and calculated the Bell fidelity taking into account atomic lifetimes and finite blockade strengths. We show that the upper limit of the Bell fidelity reaches ${\mathcal F}\simeq0.9999$ in a room-temperature environment.</description>

      <title>Reconquering Bell sampling on qudits: stabilizer learning and testing, quantum pseudorandomness bounds, and more</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell sampling is a simple yet powerful tool based on measuring two copies of a quantum state in the Bell basis, and has found applications in a plethora of problems related to stabiliser states and measures of magic. However, it was not known how to generalise the procedure from qubits to $d$-level systems -- qudits -- for all dimensions $d &gt; 2$ in a useful way. Indeed, a prior work of the authors (arXiv'24) showed that the natural extension of Bell sampling to arbitrary dimensions fails to provide meaningful information about the quantum states being measured. In this paper, we overcome the difficulties encountered in previous works and develop a useful generalisation of Bell sampling to qudits of all $d\geq 2$. At the heart of our primitive is a new unitary, based on Lagrange's four-square theorem, that maps four copies of any stabiliser state $|\mathcal{S}\rangle$ to four copies of its complex conjugate $|\mathcal{S}^\ast\rangle$ (up to some Pauli operator), which may be of independent interest. We then demonstrate the utility of our new Bell sampling technique by lifting several known results from qubits to qudits for any $d\geq 2$:
  1. Learning stabiliser states in $O(n^3)$ time with $O(n)$ samples;
  2. Solving the Hidden Stabiliser Group Problem in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples;
  3. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser size at least $d^t$ or is $\varepsilon$-far from all such states in $\tilde{O}(n^3/\varepsilon)$ time with $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ samples;
  4. Clifford circuits with at most $n/2$ single-qudit non-Clifford gates cannot prepare pseudorandom states;
  5. Testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ has stabiliser fidelity at least $1-\varepsilon_1$ or at most $1-\varepsilon_2$ with $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = 0$ or $O(d^2/\varepsilon_2^2)$ samples if $\varepsilon_1 = O(d^{-2})$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Sum Rule from Higher-Form Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an entanglement sum rule for $(d-1)$-dimensional quantum lattice models with finite abelian higher-form symmetries, obtained by minimally coupling a sector on $p$-simplices carrying a $p$-form $G$ symmetry to a sector on $(p+1)$-simplices carrying the dual $(d-p-2)$-form $\widehat G$ symmetry (with $\widehat G$ being the Pontryagin dual of $G$). The coupling is introduced by conjugation with a symmetry-preserving operator $\mathcal{U}$ that dresses symmetry-invariant operators with appropriate Wilson operators. Our main result concerns symmetric eigenstates of the coupled model that arise by acting with $\mathcal{U}$ on direct-product symmetric eigenstates of the decoupled model: provided a topological criterion formulated via the Mayer--Vietoris sequence holds for the chosen bipartition, $\mathcal{U}$ factorizes across the cut when acting on the symmetric state, and the entanglement entropy equals the sum of the entropies of the two sectors. This framework explains and generalizes known examples in fermion-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, identifies when topology obstructs the sum rule, and provides a procedure to construct new examples by gauging higher-form symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven multi-ensemble superradiance is a multi-ensemble extension of the cooperative resonance fluorescence model, exhibiting characteristics of multiple dark states that depend on the initial state. We analytically derive the dark-state covariance matrices in the large-$N$ limit, revealing entanglement among the ensembles that enhances quantum metrology. The minimum eigenvalue, linked to the curvature of the superradiance potential trapping the dark state, corresponds to the optimal multiparameter spin-squeezing coefficient, defined as the Rayleigh quotient of the spin-squeezing matrix. This system provides a concrete protocol for achieving optimal quantum enhancement in the estimation of arbitrary linear combinations of multiple parameters, making it a promising candidate for multimode quantum interferometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the scheme of attosecond quantum interferometry (AQI), the quantum optical version of classical attosecond interferometry, which allows to measure quantum optical properties on the attosecond time-scale. We develop how the scheme of AQI can be used for quantum state engineering of the emitted harmonics, by varying the relative phase of a two-color driving field, and further enables one to manipulate the field correlations as well as their entanglement characteristics. In addition, this scheme allows us to learn properties of the phase-space distribution of the harmonic quantum state, by means of measuring an attosecond quantum tomography trace. This serves as a new type of protocol for in situ attosecond measurements of quantum optical observables. With this, we achieve to further connect all-optical attosecond measurement schemes with quantum optics, allowing for a rich manifold of observations.</description>

      <title>Initial-State Typicality in Quantum Relaxation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relaxation in open quantum systems is fundamental to quantum science and technologies. Yet, the influence of the initial state on relaxation remains a central, largely unanswered question. Here, by systematically characterizing the relaxation behavior of generic initial states, we uncover a typicality phenomenon in high-dimensional open quantum systems: relaxation becomes nearly initial-state-independent as system size increases under verifiable conditions. Crucially, we prove this typicality for thermalization processes above a size-independent temperature. Our findings extend the typicality to open quantum dynamics, in turn identifying a class of systems where two widely used quantities -- the Liouvillian gap and the maximal relaxation time -- merit re-examination. We formalize this with two new concepts: the 'typical strong Mpemba effect' and the 'typical relaxation time'. Beyond these conceptual advances, our results provide practical implications: a scalable route to accelerating relaxation and a typical mixing-time benchmark that complements conventional worst-case metrics for quantum simulations and state preparation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The realization of electron-spin resonance at the single-atom level using scanning tunneling microscopy has opened new avenues for coherent quantum sensing and quantum state manipulation at the ultimate size limit. This allows to build many-body Hamiltonians and the study of their complex physical behavior. Recently, a novel qubit platform has emerged from this field, raising questions about the driving mechanism from single-atom magnets. In this work, we demonstrate how single-atom magnets can be used to drive a nearby single spin qubit efficiently. We show that the modulation of exchange coupling is the primary driving force, which successfully reproduces Rabi rates in the tens of MHz range, consistent with experimental data, while also addressing critical aspects related to the optimization of experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Universal Behavior in Entanglement Entropy Reveals Quantum Criticality and Underlying Symmetry Breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09942v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement plays a key role in quantum physics, but how much information it can extract from many-body systems is still an open question, particularly regarding quantum criticalities and emergent symmetries. In this work, we systematically study the entanglement entropy (EE) and derivative entanglement entropy (DEE) near quantum phase transitions in various quantum many-body systems. A one-parameter scaling relation between the DEE and system size at the critical point has been derived for the first time, which successfully obtains the critical exponent via data collapse. Furthermore, we find that the EE peaks at the (emergent) symmetry enhanced first-order transition, reflecting higher symmetry breaking. This work provides a new paradigm for quantum many-body research from the perspective of EE and DEE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the generation rate of the quantum entanglement in a system composed of multiple massive particles with large spin, where the mass of a single particle can be split into multiple trajectories by a generalized Stern-Gerlach interferometer. Taking the coherent spin states (CSS) as the initial state and considering the gravitational interaction due to Newtonian potential, we compute the generation rate of the entanglement for different configurations of the setup. Explicitly, the optimal polar angles of the spin are found numerically for systems with three and four particles, respectively. We conclude that the amount of the entanglement increases with the number of particles as well as the spin, and the configuration of the prism with a particle at the center generates the best rate of the entanglement.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg blockade effect provides a convenient platform for simulating locally constrained many-body systems, such as quantum dimer models and quantum loop models, especially their novel phases like topological orders and gapless quantum spin ice (QSI) phases. To discuss the possible phase diagram containing different QSIs in three-dimensional (3D) Rydberg arrays, we have constructed an extended Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonian with equal weight superposition ground state in different fillings at the RK point. Therefore, the perfect QSIs with fixed local dimer filling and their monomer-doped states can be simulated directly by Monte Carlo sampling. Using single-mode approximation, the excitations of dimers and monomers have also been explored in different fillings. We find that, in the thermodynamical limit, even doping a small amount of monomers can disrupt the topological structure and lead to the existence of off-diagonal long-range order. However, in a finite size (as in cold-atom experiment), the property of QSI will be kept in a certain region like a crossover after doping. The phase diagram containing different QSIs and off-diagonal order phases is proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is analyzed in the Majorana fermion conformal field theory (CFT) in the vacuum, in the fermion state, and in states built from conformal interfaces. In the boundary-state approach, the Hilbert space admits two factorizations for a single interval, producing distinct entanglement spectra determined by spin structures. Although R\'enyi and relative entropies are shown to be insensitive to these structures, symmetry-resolved entanglement naturally reveals their differences. The Majorana fermion's $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ symmetry, generated by the fermion-parity operator $(-1)^F$, distinguishes bosonic from fermionic sectors, motivating the notion of fermion-parity resolution. While $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ is naturally a symmetry of the vacuum and fermion reduced density matrices, the Hilbert space factorization is shown to stabilize this symmetry in conformal interface states. When an unpaired Majorana zero mode is present, fermion-parity-resolved entropies display equipartition at all orders in the UV cutoff; in its absence, the breaking of equipartition is quantified by Ramond-sector data. This behavior persists across all states considered. Connections with symmetry-protected topological phases of matter are outlined. All results are compared with twist field computations.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate quantum simulations of strongly correlated nuclear many-body systems on the RIKEN-Quantinuum Reimei trapped-ion quantum computer, targeting ground states of oxygen, calcium, and nickel isotopes. By combining a hard-core-boson representation of the nuclear shell model with a pair-unitary coupled-cluster doubles ansatz, we achieve sub-percent relative error in the ground-state energies compared to noise-free statevector simulations. Our approach leverages symmetry-aware state preparation and particle-number post-selection to efficiently capture pairing correlations characteristic of systems with same-species nucleons. These findings highlight the viability of high-fidelity trapped-ion platforms for nuclear physics applications and provide a foundation for scaling to more complex nuclear systems.</description>

      <title>Large deviations in the many-body localization transition: The case of the random-field XXZ chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of rare system-wide resonances in the many-body localization (MBL) transition has recently attracted significant attention. They are expected to play a prominent role in the stability of the MBL phase, prompting the development of new theoretical frameworks to properly account for their statistical weight. We employ a method based on an analogy with mean-field disordered glassy systems to characterize the statistics of transmission amplitudes between distant many-body configurations in Hilbert space, and apply it to the random-field XXZ spin chain. By introducing a Lagrange multiplier, which formally plays the role of an effective temperature controlling the influence of extreme outliers in the heavy-tailed distribution of propagators, we identify three distinct regimes: (i) an ergodic phase with uniform spreading in Hilbert space, (ii) an intermediate regime where delocalization is driven by rare, disorder-dependent long-range resonances, and (iii) a robust MBL phase where such resonances cannot destabilize localization. We derive a finite-size phase diagram in the disorder--interaction plane both in the spin and in the Anderson basis that quantitatively agrees with recent numerical results based on real-space spin-spin correlation functions. We further demonstrate that even infinitesimal interactions can destroy the Anderson insulator at finite disorder, with the critical disorder remaining finite down to small interaction strengths. By visualizing resonant transmission pathways on the Hilbert space graph, we provide a complementary perspective to real-space and spectral probes, revealing how the destabilization of the MBL phase at finite sizes stems from the emergence of resonant paths that become progressively rarer and shorter-ranged deep in the localized phase.</description>
