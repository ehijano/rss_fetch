      <description>arXiv:2501.06271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancements in large language model (LLM) technology and the emergence of bioinformatics-specific language models (BioLMs), there is a growing need for a comprehensive analysis of the current landscape, computational characteristics, and diverse applications. This survey aims to address this need by providing a thorough review of BioLMs, focusing on their evolution, classification, and distinguishing features, alongside a detailed examination of training methodologies, datasets, and evaluation frameworks. We explore the wide-ranging applications of BioLMs in critical areas such as disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and vaccine development, highlighting their impact and transformative potential in bioinformatics. We identify key challenges and limitations inherent in BioLMs, including data privacy and security concerns, interpretability issues, biases in training data and model outputs, and domain adaptation complexities. Finally, we highlight emerging trends and future directions, offering valuable insights to guide researchers and clinicians toward advancing BioLMs for increasingly sophisticated biological and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised detection and fitness estimation of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Application to wastewater samples (ANRS0160)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repeated waves of emerging variants during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics have highlighted the urge of collecting longitudinal genomic data and developing statistical methods based on time series analyses for detecting new threatening lineages and estimating their fitness early in time. Most models study the evolution of the prevalence of particular lineages over time and require a prior classification of sequences into lineages. Such process is prone to induce delays and bias. More recently, few authors studied the evolution of the prevalence of mutations over time with alternative clustering approaches, avoiding specific lineage classification. Most of the aforementioned methods are however either non parametric or unsuited to pooled data characterizing, for instance, wastewater samples. In this context, we propose an alternative unsupervised method for clustering mutations according to their frequency trajectory over time and estimating group fitness from time series of pooled mutation prevalence data. Our model is a mixture of observed count data and latent group assignment and we use the expectation-maximization algorithm for model selection and parameter estimation. The application of our method to time series of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data collected from wastewater treatment plants in France from October 2020 to April 2021 shows its ability to agnostically group mutations according to their probability of belonging to B.1.160, Alpha, Beta, B.1.177 variants with selection coefficient estimates per group in coherence with the viral dynamics in France reported by Nextstrain. Moreover, our method detected the Alpha variant as threatening as early as supervised methods (which track specific mutations over time) with the noticeable difference that, since unsupervised, it does not require any prior information on the set of mutations.</description>

      <title>Temporal Dynamics of Microbial Communities in Anaerobic Digestion: Influence of Temperature and Feedstock Composition on Reactor Performance and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anaerobic digestion (AD) offers a sustainable biotechnology to recover resources from carbon-rich wastewater, such as food-processing wastewater. Despite crude wastewater characterisation, the impact of detailed chemical fingerprinting on AD remains underexplored. This study investigated the influence of fermentation-wastewater composition and operational parameters on AD over time to identify critical factors influencing reactor biodiversity and performance. Eighteen reactors were operated under various operational conditions using mycoprotein fermentation wastewater. Detailed chemical analysis fingerprinted the molecules in the fermentation wastewater throughout AD including sugars, sugar alcohols and volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Sequencing revealed distinct microbiome profiles linked to temperature and reactor configuration, with mesophilic conditions supporting a more diverse and densely connected microbiome. Significant elevations in Methanomassiliicoccus were correlated to high butyric acid concentrations and decreased biogas production, further elucidating the role of this newly discovered methanogen. Dissimilarity analysis demonstrated the importance of individual molecules on microbiome diversity, highlighting the need for detailed chemical fingerprinting in AD studies of microbial trends. Machine learning (ML) models predicting reactor performance achieved high accuracy based on operational parameters and microbial taxonomy. Operational parameters had the most substantial influence on chemical oxygen demand removal, whilst Oscillibacter and two Clostridium sp. were highlighted as key factors in biogas production. By integrating detailed chemical and biological fingerprinting with ML models this research presents a novel approach to advance our understanding of AD microbial ecology, offering insights for industrial applications of sustainable waste-to-energy systems.</description>

      <title>A neuromorphic camera for tracking passive and active matter with lower data throughput</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the merits of an event-based camera (EBC) for tracking of passive and, in particular, active matter. For passive matter, we tracked the Brownian motion of different microparticles and estimated their diffusion coefficient. For active matter, we explored the case of tracking murine spermatozoa and aimed to extract motility parameters from the motion of cells. This has applications in enhancing outcomes for clinical fertility treatments. Using the EBC, we obtain results equivalent to those from an sCMOS camera, yet achieve a reduction in file size of up to two orders of magnitude. This is important in the modern computer era, as it simplifies data acquisition and analysis. We believe the EBC is an excellent choice, particularly for long-term studies of active matter.</description>

      <title>Tricritical behavior in epidemic dynamics with vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08135v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We scrutinize the phenomenology arising from a minimal vaccination-epidemic (MVE) dynamics using three methods: mean-field approach, Monte Carlo simulations, and finite-size scaling analysis. The mean-field formulation reveals that the MVE model exhibits either a continuous or a discontinuous active-to-absorbing phase transition, accompanied by bistability and a tricritical point. However, on square lattices, we detect no signs of bistability, and we disclose that the active-to-absorbing state transition has a scaling invariance and critical exponents compatible with the continuous transition of the directed percolation universality class. Additionally, our findings indicate that the tricritical and crossover behaviors of the MVE dynamics belong to the universality class of mean-field tricritical directed percolation.</description>

      <title>Accuracy versus Predominance: Reassessing the validity of the quasi-steady-state approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation to the Michaelis--Menten reaction mechanism is a textbook example of biochemical model reduction, derived using singular perturbation theory. However, determining the specific biochemical conditions that dictate the validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation remains a challenging endeavor. Emerging research suggests that the accuracy of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation improves as the ratio of the initial enzyme concentration, $e_0$, to the Michaelis constant, $K_M$, decreases. In this work, we examine this ratio and its implications for the accuracy and validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation. Using standard tools from the analysis of ordinary differential equations, we show that while $e_0/K_M$ provides an indication of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation's asymptotic accuracy, the standard quasi-steady-state approximation's predominance relies on a small ratio of $e_0$ to the Van Slyke-Cullen constant, $K$. We conclude that the magnitude of $e_0/K$ offers the most accurate measure of the validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation.</description>

      <title>Dual-Modality Representation Learning for Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular property prediction has attracted substantial attention recently. Accurate prediction of drug properties relies heavily on effective molecular representations. The structures of chemical compounds are commonly represented as graphs or SMILES sequences. Recent advances in learning drug properties commonly employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on the graph representation. For the SMILES representation, Transformer-based architectures have been adopted by treating each SMILES string as a sequence of tokens. Because each representation has its own advantages and disadvantages, combining both representations in learning drug properties is a promising direction. We propose a method named Dual-Modality Cross-Attention (DMCA) that can effectively combine the strengths of two representations by employing the cross-attention mechanism. DMCA was evaluated across eight datasets including both classification and regression tasks. Results show that our method achieves the best overall performance, highlighting its effectiveness in leveraging the complementary information from both graph and SMILES modalities.</description>

      <title>MEXA-CTP: Mode Experts Cross-Attention for Clinical Trial Outcome Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical trials are the gold standard for assessing the effectiveness and safety of drugs for treating diseases. Given the vast design space of drug molecules, elevated financial cost, and multi-year timeline of these trials, research on clinical trial outcome prediction has gained immense traction. Accurate predictions must leverage data of diverse modes such as drug molecules, target diseases, and eligibility criteria to infer successes and failures. Previous Deep Learning approaches for this task, such as HINT, often require wet lab data from synthesized molecules and/or rely on prior knowledge to encode interactions as part of the model architecture. To address these limitations, we propose a light-weight attention-based model, MEXA-CTP, to integrate readily-available multi-modal data and generate effective representations via specialized modules dubbed "mode experts", while avoiding human biases in model design. We optimize MEXA-CTP with the Cauchy loss to capture relevant interactions across modes. Our experiments on the Trial Outcome Prediction (TOP) benchmark demonstrate that MEXA-CTP improves upon existing approaches by, respectively, up to 11.3% in F1 score, 12.2% in PR-AUC, and 2.5% in ROC-AUC, compared to HINT. Ablation studies are provided to quantify the effectiveness of each component in our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Moment-based parameter inference with error guarantees for stochastic reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferring parameters of models of biochemical kinetics from single-cell data remains challenging because of the uncertainty arising from the intractability of the likelihood function of stochastic reaction networks. Such uncertainty falls beyond current error quantification measures, which focus on the effects of finite sample size and identifiability but lack theoretical guarantees when likelihood approximations are needed. Here, we propose a method for the inference of parameters of stochastic reaction networks that works for both steady-state and time-resolved data and is applicable to networks with non-linear and rational propensities. Our approach provides bounds on the parameters via convex optimisation over sets constrained by moment equations and moment matrices by taking observations to form moment intervals, which are then used to constrain parameters through convex sets. The bounds on the parameters contain the true parameters under the condition that the moment intervals contain the true moments, thus providing uncertainty quantification and error guarantees. Our approach does not need to predict moments and distributions for given parameters (i.e., it avoids solving or simulating the forward problem), and hence circumvents intractable likelihood computations or computationally expensive simulations. We demonstrate its use for uncertainty quantification, data integration and prediction of latent species statistics through synthetic data from common non-linear biochemical models including the Schl\"ogl model and the toggle switch, a model of post-transcriptional regulation at steady state, and a birth-death model with time-dependent data.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Enabled Multidimensional Data Utilization in Multi-Resonance Biosensors: A Pathway to Enhanced Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel framework is proposed that combines multi-resonance biosensors with machine learning (ML) to significantly enhance the accuracy of parameter prediction in biosensing. Unlike traditional single-resonance systems, which are limited to one-dimensional datasets, this approach leverages multi-dimensional data generated by a custom-designed nanostructure, a periodic array of silicon nanorods with a triangular cross-section over an aluminum reflector. High bulk sensitivity values are achieved for this multi-resonant structure, with certain resonant peaks reaching up to 1706 nm/RIU. The predictive power of multiple resonant peaks from transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarizations is evaluated using Ridge Regression modeling. Systematic analysis reveals that incorporating multiple resonances yields up to three orders of magnitude improvement in refractive index detection precision compared to single-peak analyses. This precision enhancement is achieved without modifications to the biosensor hardware, highlighting the potential of data-centric strategies in biosensing. The findings establish a new paradigm in biosensing, demonstrating that the synergy between multi-resonance data acquisition and ML-based analysis can significantly enhance detection accuracy. This study provides a scalable pathway for advancing high-precision biosensing technologies.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Computational Method for Practical Identifiability Analysis in Mathematical Models Arising from Biology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practical identifiability is a critical concern in data-driven modeling of mathematical systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for practical identifiability analysis to evaluate parameter identifiability in mathematical models of biological systems. Starting with a rigorous mathematical definition of practical identifiability, we demonstrate its equivalence to the invertibility of the Fisher Information Matrix. Our framework establishes the relationship between practical identifiability and coordinate identifiability, introducing a novel metric that simplifies and accelerates the evaluation of parameter identifiability compared to the profile likelihood method. Additionally, we introduce new regularization terms to address non-identifiable parameters, enabling uncertainty quantification and improving model reliability. To guide experimental design, we present an optimal data collection algorithm that ensures all model parameters are practically identifiable. Applications to Hill functions, neural networks, and dynamic biological models demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed computational framework in uncovering critical biological processes and identifying key observable variables.</description>

      <title>A Text-guided Protein Design Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04611v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current AI-assisted protein design mainly utilizes protein sequential and structural information. Meanwhile, there exists tremendous knowledge curated by humans in the text format describing proteins' high-level functionalities. Yet, whether the incorporation of such text data can help protein design tasks has not been explored. To bridge this gap, we propose ProteinDT, a multi-modal framework that leverages textual descriptions for protein design. ProteinDT consists of three subsequent steps: ProteinCLAP which aligns the representation of two modalities, a facilitator that generates the protein representation from the text modality, and a decoder that creates the protein sequences from the representation. To train ProteinDT, we construct a large dataset, SwissProtCLAP, with 441K text and protein pairs. We quantitatively verify the effectiveness of ProteinDT on three challenging tasks: (1) over 90% accuracy for text-guided protein generation; (2) best hit ratio on 12 zero-shot text-guided protein editing tasks; (3) superior performance on four out of six protein property prediction benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Multi-channel learning for integrating structural hierarchies into context-dependent molecular representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable molecular property prediction is essential for various scientific endeavors and industrial applications, such as drug discovery. However, the data scarcity, combined with the highly non-linear causal relationships between physicochemical and biological properties and conventional molecular featurization schemes, complicates the development of robust molecular machine learning models. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a popular solution, utilizing large-scale, unannotated molecular data to learn a foundational representation of chemical space that might be advantageous for downstream tasks. Yet, existing molecular SSL methods largely overlook chemical knowledge, including molecular structure similarity, scaffold composition, and the context-dependent aspects of molecular properties when operating over the chemical space. They also struggle to learn the subtle variations in structure-activity relationship. This paper introduces a novel pre-training framework that learns robust and generalizable chemical knowledge. It leverages the structural hierarchy within the molecule, embeds them through distinct pre-training tasks across channels, and aggregates channel information in a task-specific manner during fine-tuning. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance across various molecular property benchmarks and offers strong advantages in particularly challenging yet ubiquitous scenarios like activity cliffs.</description>

Abstract: The extraction of biomedical data has significant academic and practical value in contemporary biomedical sciences. In recent years, drug repositioning, a cost-effective strategy for drug development by discovering new indications for approved drugs, has gained increasing attention. However, many existing drug repositioning methods focus on mining information from adjacent nodes in biomedical networks without considering the potential inter-relationships between the feature spaces of drugs and diseases. This can lead to inaccurate encoding, resulting in biased mined drug-disease association information. To address this limitation, we propose a new model called Dual-Feature Drug Repurposing Neural Network (DFDRNN). DFDRNN allows the mining of two features (similarity and association) from the drug-disease biomedical networks to encode drugs and diseases. A self-attention mechanism is utilized to extract neighbor feature information. It incorporates two dual-feature extraction modules: the single-domain dual-feature extraction (SDDFE) module for extracting features within a single domain (drugs or diseases) and the cross-domain dual-feature extraction (CDDFE) module for extracting features across domains. By utilizing these modules, we ensure more appropriate encoding of drugs and diseases. A cross-dual-domain decoder is also designed to predict drug-disease associations in both domains. Our proposed DFDRNN model outperforms six state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets, achieving an average AUROC of 0.946 and an average AUPR of 0.597. Case studies on two diseases show that the proposed DFDRNN model can be applied in real-world scenarios, demonstrating its significant potential in drug repositioning.</description>
