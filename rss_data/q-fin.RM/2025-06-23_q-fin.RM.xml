      <title>Disaster Risk Financing through Taxation: A Framework for Regional Participation in Collective Risk-Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an economy composed of different risk profile regions wishing to be hedged against a disaster risk using multi-region catastrophe insurance. Such catastrophic events inherently have a systemic component; we consider situations where the insurer faces a non-zero probability of insolvency. To protect the regions against the risk of the insurer's default, we introduce a public-private partnership between the government and the insurer. When a disaster generates losses exceeding the total capital of the insurer, the central government intervenes by implementing a taxation system to share the residual claims. In this study, we propose a theoretical framework for regional participation in collective risk-sharing through tax revenues by accounting for their disaster risk profiles and their economic status.</description>

      <title>Partial Law Invariance and Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17265v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of partial law invariance, generalizing the concepts of law invariance and probabilistic sophistication widely used in decision theory, as well as statistical and financial applications. This new concept is motivated by practical considerations of decision making under uncertainty, thus connecting the literature on decision theory and that on financial risk management. We fully characterize partially law-invariant coherent risk measures via a novel representation formula. Strong partial law invariance is defined to bridge the gap between the above characterization and the classic representation formula of Kusuoka. We propose a few classes of new risk measures, including partially law-invariant versions of the Expected Shortfall and the entropic risk measures, and illustrate their applications in risk assessment under different types of uncertainty. We provide a tractable optimization formula for computing a class of partially law-invariant coherent risk measures and give a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Extremal cases of distortion risk measures with partial information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the best- and worst-case of a general class of distortion risk measures when only partial information regarding the underlying distributions is available. Specifically, explicit sharp lower and upper bounds for a general class of distortion risk measures are derived based on the first two moments along with some shape information, such as symmetry/unimodality property of the underlying distributions. The proposed approach provides a unified framework for extremal problems of distortion risk measures.</description>
