      <title>The role of coal plant retrofitting strategies in developing India's net-zero power system: a data-driven sub-national analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: India set two Nationally Determined Contribution targets to achieve the net zero carbon emission goal by 2070, which requires deep decarbonization of India's power generation sector. Yet, coal power generation contributes to more than 60\% of its total power generation, and policies still permit further coal fleet expansion and lifetime extensions. In this paper, we investigate the role of retrofitting India's coal plants for carbon capture and storage and biomass co-firing in developing the net-zero power system. We model the power generation and transmission network expansions across 30 Indian states in four representative grid evolution scenarios under progressively tighter carbon emission caps, taking into account sub-national coal price variation and thermal efficiency of individual coal plants. We find that coal plant retrofitting could happen by 2035 when an annual carbon cap for the power generation sector is less than 1,000 million tons CO$_2$. This reduces the unabated coal plant capacity, electricity generation, and carbon abatement costs. Exploiting renewable energy potentials solely, such as wind resources, could reduce carbon abatement costs significantly but will result in low coal plant utilization and uneven renewable generation deployment between Southern and Central regions concerning energy justice.</description>

      <title>Collective motion using quantum-like entanglement of neighbours in perceptual space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18985v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the collective motion of self-propelled agents through the lens of quantum-like entanglement in visual perception. This approach makes the non-linear dynamics in ordinary space a derivative of dynamics in the Hilbert space of perception. By appropriate choice of operators in this quantum-inspired model, we show how the familiar Vicsek model, a well-known paradigm for flocking behaviour, naturally emerges. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to explore how different types of entangled quantum states-such as GHZ states, W states, and cluster states-affect collective motion. Each type of entanglement introduces unique coordination patterns, interaction strength, and information sharing among agents, leading to different collective behaviours.</description>

      <title>Closing the reproducibility gap: 2D materials research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D materials research has reached significant scientific milestones, accompanied by a rapidly growing industrial sector in the two decades since the field's inception. Such rapid progress requires pushing past the boundary of what is technically and scientifically feasible and carries the risk of disseminating irreproducible research results. This Expert Recommendation addresses the need for enhanced reproducibility in 2D materials science and physics. Through a comprehensive examination of the factors that affect reproducibility the authors present a set of concrete guidelines designed to improve the reliability of research results. The introduction of a Standardised Template for Experimental Procedures (STEP) offers a novel approach to documenting experimental details that are crucial for replication and troubleshooting. We emphasise the importance of involving stakeholders from research, industry, publishing, funding agencies, and policymaking to foster a culture of transparency, reliability, and trust without blind angles and critical oversights. By addressing systemic issues that hinder reproducibility and presenting actionable steps for improvement, we aim to pave the way for more robust research practices in 2D materials science, contributing to the field's scientific maturation and the subsequent development of beneficial technologies.</description>

      <title>Pickleball Flight Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the flight dynamics of the ball in the sport of pickleball. Various simplifications are introduced according to the features of the game. These simplifications and some approximations enable straightforward coding to study aspects of the game such as the trajectory of the ball and its velocity. In turn, strategic questions may be addressed that have not been previously considered. In particular, our primary research question involves the preference between playing with the wind versus against the wind. It is demonstrated that playing against the wind is often preferable than playing with the wind.</description>

      <title>Unravelling compound risks of hydrological extremes in a changing climate: Typology, methods and futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have witnessed and experienced increasing compound extreme events resulting from simultaneous or sequential occurrence of multiple events in a changing climate. In addition to a growing demand for a clearer explanation of compound risks from a hydrological perspective, there has been a lack of attention paid to socioeconomic factors driving and impacted by these risks. Through a critical review and co-production approaches, we identified four types of compound hydrological events based on autocorrelated, multivariate, and spatiotemporal patterns. A framework to quantify compound risks based on conditional probability is offered, including an argument on the potential use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for identifying emerging trends and patterns for climate change. Insights for practices are discussed, highlighting the implications for disaster risk reduction and knowledge co-production. Our argument centres on the importance of meaningfully considering the socioeconomic contexts in which compound risks may have impacts, and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to effectively translate climate science to climate actions.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Energy Needs with Logistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The logistic function is used to forecast energy consumed worldwide and oil production in the U.S. The logistic substitution model is used to describe the energy mix since 1965 presenting a picture significantly different from the one covering the previous 100 years. In the new picture coal gently gains on oil and hydroelectric gains on natural gas even if it is three times smaller. Finally, renewables (wind, geothermal, solar, biomass, and waste) grow exclusively on the expense of nuclear and are poised to overtake it by the late 2030s. By mid-21st century, coal, oil, and natural gas still remain the main players of comparable size. Hydroelectric has almost doubled in size. The only significant substitution is that of renewables having replaced nuclear albeit remaining at less than one-fourth the size of the other three energy sources. U.S. oil produced by fracking is forecasted to cease by mid-21st century, while oil produced by traditional methods should continue on its slowly declining trend. US oil production is likely to represent less than 1% of the oil consumed worldwide by mid-21st century.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Framework for Assessing Equity in Ground Transportation Infrastructure: An Exploratory Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground transportation infrastructure significantly impacts community connectivity, economic growth, and access to essential services such as jobs, education, and healthcare. However, in practice, these infrastructures do not provide equitable services for all, and historical disparities have led to inequitable conditions for many individuals. This paper explores diverse definitions of equity relevant to ground infrastructures, examines the consequences of inequitable transportation systems throughout the history of the U.S. highway system, and explores various approaches for conducting equity analysis. Based on the collected information, a generalized framework is introduced to analyze the impact of these infrastructures on transportation equity. The study also provides a novel equity index that can be used to assess equity considering accessibility and affordability. Finally, the framework is applied to a case study in Baltimore City, Maryland, examining the equitable distribution of electric vehicle (EV) chargers. By demonstrating its practical application, the paper offers managers and policymakers a concise step-by-step approach to analyze transportation equity. This method assesses both the socioeconomic features of affected populations and the distribution of services, contributing to the development of a more sustainable ground transport system.</description>

      <title>Precipitation analysis in Tlaquepaque: a look at the past and the present</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precipitation events in large cities can be a challenge and a problem for continuing the regular dynamics of people flows and economic activities. It is enough to remember what happens at overpasses, on main avenues, as well as in the lower and marginalized parts of cities when we have intense rainfall. Unfortunately, the accelerated and disorganized growth of metropolises in Mexico has not allowed for the fulfillment of urban planning (S\'anchez-Rodr\'iguez et al., 2013), a situation that is especially evident during conditions of abundant rainfall. In this work, the behavior of rainfall in the municipality of Tlaquepaque, Jalisco, since 1951 and until 2022, is specifically explained and with a certain level of detail.</description>

      <title>Understanding everyday public transit travel habits: a measurement framework for the peakedness of departure time distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persuasive scholarship presents how individual daily travel habits implicate congestion, environmental pollution, and the travel experience. However, the empirical characteristics and dynamics of travel habits remain poorly understood. Quantifying both our individual travel habits and how these habits aggregate to form system-wide dynamics is of critical importance to enable the smart design of public transit systems that are better tailored to our daily mobility needs. We contribute to this need through the development and implementation of a new measurement framework capturing the 'peakedness' of users' departure time distributions. Departure time 'peakedness' reflects a user's tendency to repeatedly choose the same departure time for a given origin-destination trip, offering a clearer and more intuitive representation of regularity and habitual patterns compared to traditional metrics like standard deviation or entropy. Our framework demonstrates that system-wide departure time peakedness can be decomposed into individual users' departure time peakedness and the alignment of their peak times. This allows for a systematic analysis of both individual and collective behaviours. We apply our framework to departure time data from a 12-month period, encompassing 5,947,907 bus journeys made by 29,640 individuals across three urban networks within a large regional metropolis. Our findings reveal that departure time peakedness is more deeply tied to inherent, passenger-specific characteristics, such as passenger type, rather than external factors like weather or holidays. Additionally, individual-level departure time peakedness shows notable dynamics over time, indicating that habitual routines can evolve in the long term, while system-level peakedness exhibits remarkable long-term stability.</description>

      <title>Indirect rewards outperform direct punishment in promoting cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing research demonstrates that direct punishment, which targets defectors who harm the individual directly, can address social dilemmas and sustain cooperation in social networks. This study introduces a novel form of punishment that targets second-order defectors--those who harm an individual's neighbors--rather than directly punishing one's own defecting neighbors. This mechanism acts as an indirect reward to immediate neighbors by following the principle of ``I help you by punishing those who defect against you." Using evolutionary simulations, we find that in a narrow region of the cost-fine space, when punishment is less costly and fines on defectors are low, indirect rewards are more effective at promoting cooperation than direct punishment. In other cases, direct punishment proves more effective. These results are robust regardless of whether network reciprocity alone can support cooperation. Indirect reward excel under these conditions, because it imposes multiple sources of punishment on defectors without substantially raising the costs for the punishers, thereby amplifying the overall punitive effect. In contrast, direct punishment targets defectors within a limited range, reducing its impact. Taken together, these findings provide novel insights into the comparative effectiveness of different punishment forms, and highlight the importance of indirect rewards in understanding the evolution of cooperation.</description>

      <title>Extreme heat is associated with reductions in human activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme heat is a growing threat to both individual livelihoods and broader economies, killing an increasing number of people each year as temperatures increase and limiting productivity - often in the countries that would benefit most from economic growth. Many studies document the link between heat waves and mortality or morbidity, and others explore the economic consequences of them, but few are able to identify the ways in which populations respond to the shock of extreme heat. Toward this end, we investigate the link between human mobility and fluctuations in temperature. Using additive models fitting data in Indonesia, India and Mexico, we show that extreme heat reduces mobility by up to 10% in rural areas and 5% in urban settings. Effects are stronger in poorer areas. Twinning these models with climate projections, we show that without adaptation mobility will fall 1-2% per year on aggregate, with certain seasons and places seeing activity fall by as much as 10%. According to our estimates, rural areas will face the highest relative losses and urban megacities will experience the greatest absolute impacts.</description>

      <title>Quantifying discriminability of evaluation metrics in link prediction for real networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link prediction is one of the most productive branches in network science, aiming to predict links that would have existed but have not yet been observed, or links that will appear during the evolution of the network. Over nearly two decades, the field of link prediction has amassed a substantial body of research, encompassing a plethora of algorithms and diverse applications. For any algorithm, one or more evaluation metrics are required to assess its performance. Because using different evaluation metrics can provide different assessments of the algorithm performance, how to select appropriate evaluation metrics is a fundamental issue in link prediction. To address this issue, we propose a novel measure that quantifiers the discriminability of any evaluation metric given a real network and an algorithm. Based on 131 real networks and 20 representative algorithms, we systematically compare the discriminabilities of eight evaluation metrics, and demonstrate that H-measure and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) exhibit the strongest discriminabilities, followed by Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). Our finding is robust for networks in different domains and algorithms of different types. This study provides insights into the selection of evaluation metrics, which may further contribute to standardizing the evaluating process of link prediction algorithms.</description>

      <title>An interpretable wildfire spreading model for real-time predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forest fires pose a natural threat with devastating social, environmental, and economic implications. The rapid and highly uncertain rate of spread of wildfires necessitates a trustworthy digital tool capable of providing real-time estimates of fire evolution and human interventions, while receiving continuous input from remote sensing. The current work aims at developing an interpretable, physics-based model that will serve as the core of such a tool. This model is constructed using easily understandable equations, incorporating a limited set of parameters that capture essential quantities and heat transport mechanisms. The simplicity of the model allows for effective utilization of data from sensory input, enabling optimal estimation of these parameters. In particular, simplified versions of combustion kinetics and mass/energy balances lead to a computationally inexpensive system of differential equations that provide the spatio-temporal evolution of temperature and flammables over a two-dimensional region. The model is validated by comparing its predictions and the effect of parameters such as flammable bulk density, moisture content, and wind speed, with benchmark results. Additionally, the model successfully captures the evolution of the firefront shape and its rate of spread in multiple directions.</description>

      <title>Influence of initiators on the tipping point in the extended Watts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how the influence of initiators (seeds) affects the tipping point of information cascades in networks. We consider an extended version of the Watts model, in which each node is either active (i.e., having adopted an innovation) or inactive. In this extended model, the adoption threshold, defined as the fraction of active neighbors required for an inactive node to become active, depends on whether the node is a seed neighbor (i.e., connected to one or more initiators) or an ordinary node (i.e., not connected to any initiators). Using the tree approximation on random graphs, we determine the tipping point, at which the fraction of active nodes in the final state increases discontinuously with an increasing seed fraction. The occurrence of a tipping point and the scale of cascades depend on two factors: whether a giant component of seed neighbors is formed when the seed fraction is large enough to trigger cascades among seed neighbors, and whether the giant component of ordinary nodes is maintained when newly activated nodes trigger further activations among ordinary nodes. The coexistence of two giant components suggests that a tipping point can appear twice. We present an example demonstrating the existence of two tipping points when there is a gap between the adoption thresholds of seed neighbors and ordinary nodes. Monte Carlo simulations clearly show that the first cascade, occurring at a small tipping point, occurs in the giant component of seed neighbors, while the second cascade, occurring at a larger tipping point, extends into the giant component of ordinary nodes.</description>

      <title>Is UEFA really committed to sporting merit? A misaligned rule in the post-2024 Champions League</title>

Abstract: UEFA declares that it is fully committed to respecting the fundamental values of sport. However, the qualification of the post-2024 UEFA Champions League is not always based on sporting merit. Consequently, a match with misaligned incentives has been barely avoided in the 2023/24 German Bundesliga. Two straightforward solutions are recommended to safeguard the integrity of the competition. Fairness can be easily guaranteed by reversing the order of two articles in the Champions League regulation. Since UEFA repeatedly commits the same mistake that is widely known among researchers, governing bodies in sports are called to work more closely together with the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Thermophotovoltaic performance metrics and technoeconomics: efficiency vs. power density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00940v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) are a promising new approach for converting heat to electricity. Their performance is primarily characterized by two metrics: efficiency and power density. While recent works have shown high efficiency, as ensuing efforts to commercialize the technology develop, it is important to understand how both of these metrics impact the technoeconomics of a TPV system. In this work, we develop a technoeconomic model based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) to understand the relative importance of efficiency and power density. We find that systems with high infrastructure and fuel costs should prioritize TPV efficiency, while systems where the TPV cell cost dominates should prioritize power density. We then evaluate how five example systems fit into these cost regimes. Finally, we analyze how cell improvements could improve system technoeconomics, and we identify the most impactful properties. Namely, improving spectral control with sub-bandgap reflectance is the most effective way to reduce LCOE in systems with high infrastructural costs, while increasing the view factor and reducing series resistance are most critical in systems where the TPV cell cost is high. Improving just one or two of these properties can reduce the LCOE by 30-50%, reaching competitive values ~ 8 cents/kWh-e, less than the average cost of electricity in the US. This study elucidates which TPV performance metric is more important for a given application and how to maximize it.</description>

      <title>Divergence asymmetry and connected components in a general duplication-divergence graph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This Letter introduces a generalization of known duplication-divergence models for growing random graphs. This general duplication-divergence model includes a new coupled divergence asymmetry rate, which allows to obtain the structure of random growing networks by duplication-divergence in a continuous range of configurations between two known limit cases (1) complete asymmetric divergence, i.e., divergence rates affect only edges of either the original or the copy vertex, and (2) symmetric divergence, i.e., divergence rates affect equiprobably both the original and the copy vertex. Multiple connected sub-graphs (of order greater than one) (of order greater than one) emerge as the divergence asymmetry rate slightly moves from the complete asymmetric divergence case. Mean-field results of priorly published models are nicely reproduced by this generalization. In special cases, the connected components size distribution $C_s$ suggests a power-law scaling of the form $C_s \sim s^{-\lambda}$ for $s&gt;1$, e.g., with $\lambda \approx 5/3$ for divergence rate $\delta \approx 0.7$.</description>
