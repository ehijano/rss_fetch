      <title>Energy-based theory of autoresonance in chains of coupled damped-driven generic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An energy-based theory of autoresonance in driven dissipative chains of coupled generic oscillators is discussed on the basis of a variational principle concerning the energy functional. The theory is applied to chains of delayed Duffing-Ueda oscillators and the equations that together govern the autoresonance forces and solutions are derived and solved analytically for generic values of parameters and initial conditions, including the case of quenched time-delay disorder. Remarkably, the presence of retarded potentials with time-delayed feedback drastically modify the autoresonance scenario preventing the growth of the energy oscillation over specific regions of the parameter space. Additionally, effective harmonic forces with a slowly varying frequency are derived from the exact autoresonant excitations and the effectiveness of the theory is demonstrated at suppressing the chaos induced by homogeneous periodic excitations in such oscillator chains. Numerical experiments confirmed all the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Trapping and extreme clustering of finitely-dense inertial particles near a rotating vortex pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small heavy particles cannot get attracted into a region of closed streamlines in a non-accelerating frame (Sapsis &amp; Haller 2010). In a rotating system, however, particles can get trapped (Angilella 2010) near vortices. We perform numerical simulations examining trapping of inertial particles in a prototypical rotating flow: an identical pair of rotating Lamb-Oseen vortices, without gravity. Our parameter space includes the particle Stokes number $St$, measuring the particle's inertia, and a density parameter $R$, measuring the particle-to-fluid relative density. We focus on inertial particles that are finitely denser than the fluid. Particles can get indefinitely trapped near the vortices and display extreme clustering into smaller dimensional objects: attracting fixed-points, limit cycles and chaotic attractors. As $St$ increases for a given $R$, we may have an incomplete or complete period-doubling route to chaos, as well as an unusual period-halving route back to a fixed-point attractor. The fraction of trapped particles can vary non-monotonically with $St$. We may even have windows in $St$ for which no particle trapping occurs. At $St$ larger than a critical value, beyond no trapping occurs, significant fractions of particles can spend long but finite times in the vortex vicinity. The inclusion of the Basset-Boussinesq history (BBH) force is imperative in our study due to particle's finite density. BBH force significantly increases the basin of attraction as well as the range of $St$ where trapping can occur. Extreme clustering can be physically significant in planetesimal formation by dust aggregation in protoplanetary disks, phytoplankton aggregation in oceans, etc.</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking Nonlinear Regulator with Concurrent Uncertainties in Exosystems and Control Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a non-adaptive control solution framework to the practical output regulation problem (PORP) for a class of nonlinear systems with uncertain parameters, unknown control directions and uncertain exosystem dynamics. The concurrence of the unknown control directions and uncertainties in both the system dynamics and the exosystem pose a significant challenge to the problem. In light of a nonlinear internal model approach, we first convert the robust PORP into a robust non-adaptive stabilization problem for the augmented system with integral Input-to-State Stable (iISS) inverse dynamics. By employing an extremum-seeking control (ESC) approach, the construction of our solution method avoids the use of Nussbaum-type gain techniques to address the robust PORP subject to unknown control directions with time-varying coefficients. The stability of the non-adaptive output regulation design is proven via a Lie bracket averaging technique where uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop signals is guaranteed. As a result, both the estimation and tracking errors converge to zero exponentially, provided that the frequency of the dither signal goes to infinity. Finally, a simulation example with unknown coefficients is provided to exemplify the validity of the proposed control solution frameworks.</description>
