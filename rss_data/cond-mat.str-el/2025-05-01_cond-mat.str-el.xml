      <title>Phonon Induced Energy Relaxation in Quantum Critical Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metals at the brink of electronic quantum phase transitions display high-temperature superconductivity, competing orders, and unconventional charge transport, revealing strong departures from conventional Fermi liquid behavior. Investigation of these fascinating intertwined phenomena has been at the center of research across a variety of correlated materials over the past many decades. A ubiquitous experimental observation is the emergence of a universal timescale that governs electrical transport and momentum relaxation. In this work, we analyze an equally important theoretical question of how the energy contained in the electronic degrees of freedom near a quantum phase transition relaxes to the environment via their coupling to acoustic phonons. Assuming that the bottleneck for energy dissipation is controlled by the coupling between electronic degrees of freedom and acoustic phonons, we present a universal theory of the temperature dependence of the energy relaxation rate in a marginal Fermi liquid. We find that the energy relaxation rate exhibits a complex set of temperature-dependent crossovers controlled by emergent energy scales in the problem. We place these results in the context of recent measurements of the energy relaxation rate via non-linear optical spectroscopy in the normal state of hole-doped cuprates.</description>

      <title>EuAuSb: A helical variation on altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EuAuSb is a triangular-lattice Dirac semimetal in which a topological Hall effect has been observed to develop in association with a magnetically-ordered phase. Our single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements have identified an incommensurate helical order in which individual ferromagnetic Eu$^{2+}$ layers rotate in-plane by $\sim$120$^{\circ}$ from one layer to the next. An in-plane magnetic field distorts the incommensurate order, eventually leading to a first order transition to a state that is approximately commensurate and that is continuously polarized as the bulk magnetization approaches saturation. From an analysis of the magnetic diffraction intensities versus field, we find evidence for a dip in the ordered in-plane moment at the same field where the topological Hall effect is a maximum, and we propose that this is due to field-induced quantum spin fluctuations. Our electronic structure calculations yield exchange constants compatible with the helical order and show that the bands near the Fermi level lose their spin degeneracy. The occurrence of spin-split bands in a magnetically ordered state with compensated moments suggests that this should be considered a helical flavor of altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Explorative Curriculum Learning for Strongly Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural network quantum states (NQS) have enabled high-accuracy predictions for complex quantum many-body systems such as strongly correlated electron systems. However, the computational cost remains prohibitive, making exploration of the diverse parameters of interaction strengths and other physical parameters inefficient. While transfer learning has been proposed to mitigate this challenge, achieving generalization to large-scale systems and diverse parameter regimes remains difficult. To address this limitation, we propose a novel curriculum learning framework based on transfer learning for NQS. This facilitates efficient and stable exploration across a vast parameter space of quantum many-body systems. In addition, by interpreting NQS transfer learning through a perturbative lens, we demonstrate how prior physical knowledge can be flexibly incorporated into the curriculum learning process. We also propose Pairing-Net, an architecture to practically implement this strategy for strongly correlated electron systems, and empirically verify its effectiveness. Our results show an approximately 200-fold speedup in computation and a marked improvement in optimization stability compared to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Photoengineering the Magnon Spectrum in an Insulating Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond optical pulses have opened a new frontier in ultrafast dynamics, enabling direct access to fundamental interactions in quantum materials. In antiferromagnets (AFMs), where the fundamental quantum mechanical exchange interaction governs spin dynamics, this access is especially compelling, enabling the excitation of magnons - collective spin-wave modes - that naturally reach terahertz (THz) frequencies and supersonic velocities. Femtosecond optical pulses provided a route to coherently excite such magnons across the entire Brillouin zone. Controlling their spectral properties - such as the magnon gap and dispersion - represents the next monumental step, enabling dynamic tuning of group velocities, coherence, and interaction pathways. Yet, achieving this remains a challenge, requiring ultrafast and long-lasting manipulation of the underlying exchange interaction. Here, we show that in DyFeO3 - an insulating AFM with strongly coupled electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom - resonant above-bandgap optical excitation leads to a dramatic renormalization of the THz magnon spectrum, including a near-total collapse of the magnon gap. Our analysis reveals this transformation to be consistent with a transient reduction of the exchange interaction by nearly 90% in the near-surface nanoscale region. These findings establish a pathway for light-driven, nanoscale control of AFM spin dynamics, opening opportunities for reconfigurable, high-speed magnonic and spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Accelerating two-dimensional tensor network contractions using QR-decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tool for studying strongly correlated systems directly in the thermodynamic limit. A core component of the algorithm is the approximate contraction of the iPEPS, where the computational bottleneck typically lies in the singular value or eigenvalue decompositions involved in the renormalization step. This is particularly true on GPUs, where tensor contractions are substantially faster than these decompositions. Here we propose a contraction scheme for $C_{4v}$-symmetric tensor networks based on combining the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) with QR-decompositions which are substantially faster -- especially on GPUs. Our approach achieves up to two orders of magnitude speedup compared to standard CTMRG and yields state-of-the-art results for the Heisenberg and $J_1$-$J_2$ models in about one hour on an H100 GPU.</description>

      <title>Single-site entanglement as a marker for quantum phase transitions at non-zero temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement has been widely investigated in condensed matter systems since they are considered good candidates for developing quantum technologies. Additionally, entanglement is a powerful tool to explore quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated systems, with the von Neumann entropy being considered a proper measure of quantum entanglement for pure bipartite systems. For lattice systems, in particular, the single-site entanglement quantifies how much information about the quantum state of the remaining sites can be obtained by a measurement at a single site. Here, we use Quantum Monte Carlo calculations to obtain the average single-site entanglement for the two-dimensional Hubbard model in different geometries, probing the effects of varying temperature and interaction strength. We find that the average single-site entanglement signals the quantum phase transitions in such systems, allowing us to identify and characterize signatures of quantum phase transitions even at finite temperatures. We also analyze the relation between entanglement and magnetic susceptibility: in all the geometries considered, we find regimes in which the quantities are linearly connected. Our findings could then guide experiments to estimate entanglement via the susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Strange correlator and string order parameter for non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases in 1+1d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct strange correlators and string order parameters for non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases (NISPTs) in 1+1d quantum lattice spin models. The strange correlator exhibits long-range order when evaluated between two distinct NISPTs and decays exponentially otherwise. We show that strange charged operators inserted into the strange correlator are linked to the interface algebra (boundary tube algebra) and are non-trivial when all its irreducible representations have dimensions greater than one. We discuss the generalization to higher dimensions. The string order parameter is obtained by contracting the truncated symmetry operator with charge decoration operators, which are determined by the NISPT action tensors. We illustrate the above construction using the three NISPTs of $\text{Rep}(D_8)$ and demonstrate the extraction of categorical data via tensor networks, particularly through the ZX calculus. Finally, we show that the entanglement spectrum degeneracy is determined by the irreducible representations of the interface algebra when assuming non-invertible symmetry on-site condition.</description>

      <title>Emergent photons and mechanisms of confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories in 4D as prototypical models of systems with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-$\textit{form symmetry}$. For $N \geq 3$, we provide evidence that such systems exhibit not only the expected phases with spontaneously broken/restored symmetry but also a third photon phase. When present, the 1-form symmetry provides a precise notion of confinement, and it is commonly believed that confinement ensues due to the proliferation of extended, string-like objects known as $\textit{center vortices}$, which carry a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ flux. However, this picture is challenged by the three-phase scenario investigated here. We show that both the confined and the photon phases are associated with the proliferation of center vortices and that the key difference between them lies in whether or not vortex-junctions, the $\textit{monopoles}$, proliferate.</description>

      <title>Diffusion and instabilities in large-N holographic Fermi liquids: the vector fluctuations of the electron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic response of the AdS electron star in the vector sector, and compute the correlation functions and the transverse conductivity of the dual field theory. The system exhibits hydrodynamic behavior at low temperatures and near the critical temperature where the electron star undergoes the phase transition to the RN black hole. However, at intermediate temperatures the hydrodynamics does not exist. Remarkably, the system has an instability, i.e. a pole on the positive imaginary frequency axis at finite temperature. This instability is found both from analytical arguments and from numerics. Its physical meaning is so far unclear but it might mean that the ideal fluid limit for the star is a false vacuum.</description>

      <title>Dominant apical-oxygen electron-phonon coupling in HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How electron-phonon interactions influence high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates remains contested, and their role outside the CuO$_2$ planes has been largely overlooked. The most conspicuous evidence for such coupling is the ubiquitous 70-meV dispersion kink seen by photoemission, yet its microscopic origin is still debated. Here we use oxygen-$K$-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to probe the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg1223). When both incident photon energy and polarization are tuned to the apical-oxygen $1s\!\rightarrow\!2p_z$ transition, the RIXS spectra exhibit a ladder of at least ten phonon overtones, evenly spaced by 70 meV, whose intensities follow a Franck-Condon envelope, signalling exceptionally strong electron-phonon coupling. Quantitative modelling that incorporates core-hole lifetime evaluation yields an apical-phonon coupling energy of 0.25(1) eV, significantly larger than that of the planar stretching mode. Such a coupling strength offers a strong contender for explaining the universal 70-meV kink and suggests that the dominant electron-phonon channel resides outside the CuO$_2$ planes. By elevating inter-layer lattice dynamics from a peripheral factor to a central actor, our results provide a fresh starting point for theories seeking to reconcile strong correlations, lattice dynamics and high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Signatures of three-dimensional photo-induced superconductivity in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant optical excitation of apical-oxygen phonon modes in underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ has been shown to induce superconducting-like optical properties at temperatures far higher than the equilibrium $T_C$. All of the evidence collected so far has been based on the changes of the THz frequency $c$-axis response. In these measurements, the capacitive interlayer coupling was seen to transform into an inductive response, reminiscent of a superconducting state, an assignement that was strengthened by recent measurements of ultrafast magnetic field expulsion. Here, we report the first experimental determination of the transient in-plane optical properties. These experiements have so far been challenging because of the high in-plane equilibrium reflectivity, from which small changes in the optical response determine the transient conductivity. We observe a photo-induced in-plane optical gap $2\Delta\simeq30$ cm$^{-1}$ and a divergent imaginary conductivity, also consistent with photo-induced superconductivity. A global fit to these data suggests that in- and out-of-plane electronic properties never completely equilibrate during the dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable linear in temperature resistivity of the cuprate superconductors, which extends in some samples from $T_c$ to the melting temperature, remains unexplained. Although seemingly simple, this temperature dependence is incompatible with the conventional theory of metals that dictates that the scattering rate, $1/\tau$, should be quadratic in temperature if electron-electron scattering dominates. Understanding the origin of this temperature dependence and its connection to superconductivity may provide the key to pick the lock of high-temperature superconductivity. Using time-domain terahertz spectroscopy (TDTS) we elucidate the low temperature conducting behavior of two FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ (FTS) samples, one with almost equal amounts of Se and Te that is believed to be a topological superconductor, and one that is more overdoped. Constrained with DC resistivity, we find two conduction channels that add in parallel, a broad one in frequency with weak temperature dependence and a sharper one whose scattering rate goes as the Planckian limited rate, $\sim kT/h$. Through analysis of its spectral weight we show the superconducting condensate is mainly drawn from the channel that undergoes this Planckian scattering.</description>

Abstract: Superconductivity is usually assumed to arise from attractive interaction. In this work we show that strong pairing is possible soley from kinetic energy even without a net attraction. We demonstrate a high-temperature kinetic superconductor in a simple lattice model with nearest-neighbor hopping ($t$) projected onto a constrained Hilbert space, analogous to the $t$-$J$ model with $J=0$, where kinetic magnetism has been previously studied. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) on cylinders up to width $L_y=8$, we find a superconducting ground state exhibiting a key difference from high-$T_c$ cuprates: both the pairing gap and phase stiffness \textit{increase} with doping ($x$). We find pairing gaps, determined from spin and single-electron charge gaps, exceeding $1.5t$. This model can be realized within the double Kondo lattice model, relevant to bilayer nickelates, in the limit of strong inter-layer spin coupling ($J_\perp/t \rightarrow +\infty$) and a balancing inter-layer repulsion ($V$). Importantly, the double Kondo model does not fundamentally restrict $J_\perp/t$, suggesting the potential for high critical temperatures ($T_c$) approaching $0.5t$. While this idealized limit predicts large pairing gaps, we show a smooth connection to the more realistic regime with $J_\perp \sim t$, albeit with a reduced pairing gap of approximately $0.1t$. Assuming $t \sim 10^3$ K in typical solid state systems, our model suggests the exciting possibility of achieving $T_c$ of hundreds of Kelvin. We propose searching for bilayer materials with reduced out-of-plane lattice constants to better approximate the conditions of our ideal model.</description>

Abstract: Photoelectron diffraction (PED) is a powerful and essential experimental technique for resolving the structure of surfaces with sub-angstrom resolution. In the high energy regime, researchers in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) observe modulating patterns attributed to X-ray-PED (XPD) effects. This is accompanied by other challenges such as low cross-sections, significant photon momentum transfer, and non-negligible phonon scattering. Overall, XPD is not only an advantageous approach but also exhibits unexpected effects. To disentangle these diffraction influences, we present a PED implementation for the SPRKKR package that utilizes multiple scattering theory and a one-step model in the photoemission process. Unlike real-space implementations of the multiple scattering XPD formalism, we propose a k-space implementation based on the layer KKR method. The main advantage of this method is its ability to address a very broad kinetic energy range (20-8000 eV) without convergence problems related to angular momentum and cluster size. Furthermore, the so-called alloy analogy model can be used to simulate XPD at finite temperatures as well as XPD effects observed in soft and hard X-ray ARPES. For practical applications, we have calculated the circular dichroism in angular distributions (CDAD) associated with core-level photoemission of 2p from Si(100) and 3p from Ge(100). Photoelectrons are excited by hard X-rays (6000 eV) with right and left circularly polarized radiation (RCP and LCP, respectively).</description>

      <title>Tensor cross interpolation approach for quantum impurity problems based on the weak-coupling expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm to solve equilibrium quantum impurity problems with high precision based on the weak-coupling expansion. The TCI algorithm, a kind of active learning method, factorizes high-dimensional integrals that appear in the perturbative expansion into a product of low-dimensional ones, enabling us to evaluate higher-order terms efficiently. This method is free from the sign problem which quantum Monte Carlo methods sometimes suffer from, and allows one to directly calculate the free energy. We benchmark the TCI impurity solver on an exactly solvable impurity model, and find good agreement with the exact solutions. We also incorporate the TCI impurity solver into the dynamical mean-field theory to solve the Hubbard model, and show that the metal-to-Mott insulator transition is correctly described with comparable accuracy to the Monte Carlo methods. Behind the effectiveness of the TCI approach for quantum impurity problems lies the fact that the integrands in the weak-coupling expansion naturally have a low-rank structure in the tensor-train representation.</description>

      <title>Chirped amplitude mode in photo-excited superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a state-of-the-art numerical scheme, we show that the Higgs mode under excitation exhibits chirped oscillations and exponential decay when fluctuations are included. This is in stark contrast to conventional BCS collisionless dynamics which predict power-law decay and the absence of chirping. The chirped amplitude mode enables us to determine the local modification of the effective potential even when the system is in a long-lived prethermal state. We then show that this chirped amplitude mode is an experimentally observable quantity since the photoinduced (super)current in pump-probe experiments serves as an efficient proxy for the order parameter dynamics, including the chirped dynamics. Our result is based on the attractive Hubbard model using dynamical mean-field theory within the symmetry-broken state after a excitation across the superconducting gap. Since the collective response involves long timescales, we extend the hierarchical low-rank compression method for nonequilibrium Green's functions to symmetry-broken states and show that it serves as an efficient representation despite long-lived memory kernels.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Time Stepping for the Two-Time Integro-Differential Kadanoff-Baym Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-equilibrium Green's function gives access to one-body observables for quantum systems. Of particular interest are quantities such as density, currents, and absorption spectra which are important for interpreting experimental results in quantum transport and spectroscopy. We present an integration scheme for the Green's function's equations of motion, the Kadanoff-Baym equations (KBE), which is both adaptive in the time integrator step size and method order as well as the history integration order. We analyze the importance of solving the KBE self-consistently and show that adapting the order of history integral evaluation is important for obtaining accurate results. To examine the efficiency of our method, we compare runtimes to a state of the art fixed time step integrator for several test systems and show an order of magnitude speedup at similar levels of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of decoherence in a noisy driven environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the decoherence dynamics of a central spin coupled to a spin chain with a time-dependent noisy magnetic field, focusing on how noise influences the system's decoherence. Our results show that decoherence due to the nonequilibrium critical dynamics of the environment is amplified in the presence of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise. We demonstrate that decoherence factor consistently signals the critical points, and exhibits exponential scaling with the system size, the square of noise intensity, and the noise correlation time at the critical points. We find that strong coupling between the qubit and the environment leads to partial revivals of decoherence, which diminish with increasing noise intensity or decreasing noise correlation time. In contrast, weak coupling leads to monotonic enhanced decoherence. The numerical results illustrate that, the revivals decay and scale exponentially with noise intensity. Moreover, the revivals increase and indicate linear or power law scaling with noise correlation time depends on how the correlated noise is fast or slow. Additionally, we explore the non-Markovianity of the dynamics, finding that it decays in the presence of noise but increases as the noise correlation time grows.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of terahertz conductivity in a gated monolayer semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors and their moir\'e superlattices have emerged as important platforms for investigating correlated electrons. However, many key properties of these systems, such as the frequency-dependent conductivity, remain experimentally inaccessible because of the mesoscopic sample size. Here we report a technique to directly measure the complex conductivity of electrostatically gated two-dimensional semiconductors in the terahertz frequency range. Applying this technique to a WSe2 monolayer encapsulated in hBN, we observe clear Drude-like response between 0.1 and 1 THz, in a density range challenging to access even in DC transport. Our work opens a new avenue for studying tunable van der Waals heterostructures using terahertz spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>The Effect of the Non-Abelian Quantum Metric on Superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor, which encodes the full geometric information of quantum states in projective Hilbert space, plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics. In this work, we examine the effect of the non-Abelian quantum metric -- the real part of the non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor -- on the superfluid weight in time-reversal symmetric systems. For conventional $s$-wave pairing, we demonstrate that the superfluid weight includes a contribution proportional to the trace of the non-Abelian quantum metric. Notably, this contribution remains significant even when the total Chern number of a set of degenerate bands is zero and can exceed the conventional contribution, as confirmed using lattice models. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations for MoS$_2$ and TiSe$_2$ further corroborate these findings, revealing that the non-Abelian quantum metric accounts for up to 20% of the superfluid weight in MoS$_2$ and 50% in TiSe$_2$. Our results provide new insights into the nontrivial relationship between the geometric properties of quantum states and superconductivity, opening avenues for further exploration in topological and superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and average symmetry protected topological order in the doubled Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Target model in this study is an extended version of the cluster model in one dimension with $Z_2\otimes Z_2$ symmetry, and we investigate effects of decoherence applied to the ground state of the model, focusing on the symmetry aspect. By using a scheme that we propose, a strong symmetry protected topological (SPT) mixed state and double average SPT (ASPT) state are constructed through the pure gapless SPT order and the domain-wall duality. Among them, the double ASPT is categorized by coexisting orders, i.e., a strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and ASPT defined by the remaining weak and strong symmetries. We make use of the doubled Hilbert space formalism for the construction scheme. We numerically demonstrate the emergence of the two mixed SPT states and find that a phase transition occurs between them tuned by the strength of decoherence. Finally, we discuss the coexistence of SPT and SWSSB in the double SPT state from the view point of symmetrically invertible property, and comment on the classification of ASPT proposed recently. Suitable multiple-decoherence channel applied to SPT states gives a broad possibility to induce rich ASPTs, possessing non-trivial internal entanglement properties from the view of doubled Hilbert space formalism.</description>
