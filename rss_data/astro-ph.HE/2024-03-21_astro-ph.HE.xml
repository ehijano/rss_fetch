      <title>Elements formation in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the details of $r$-process nucleosynthesis in binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs) ejecta is key to interpret kilonovae observations and to identify the role of BNSMs in the origin of heavy elements. We present a self-consistent 2-dimensional (ray-by-ray) radiation-hydrodynamic evolution of BNSM ejecta with an online nuclear network (NN) up to the days timescale. For the first time, an initial numerical-relativity ejecta profile composed of the dynamical component, spiral-wave and disk winds is evolved including detailed $r$-process reactions and nuclear heating effects. A simple model for the jet energy deposition is also included. Our simulation highlights that the commonly assumed approach of relating the final nucleosynthesis yields to the initial thermodynamic profile of the ejecta can lead to inaccurate predictions. We also find significant deviations (up to four orders of magnitudes) in the abundance evolution of several analyzed elements compared to previous predictions employing the NN in post-processing. The presence of a jet affects elements production only in the innermost part of the polar ejecta, and it does not alter the global nucleosynthesis results. Overall, our analysis shows that employing an online NN is highly desiderable in order to obtain reliable predictions of $r$-process nucleosynthesis and ejecta evolution.</description>

      <title>The Distance to the S147 Supernova Remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the absence of a parallax distance to a pulsar or a surviving binary in a supernova remnant (SNR), distances to Galactic SNRs are generally very uncertain. However, by combining Gaia data with wide field, multi-fiber echelle spectroscopy, it is now possible to obtain accurate distances to many SNRs with limited extinction by searching for the appearance of high velocity CaII or NaI absorption lines in hot stars as a function of distance. We demonstrate this for the SNR S147 using the spectra of 259 luminous, blue stars. We obtain a median distance of 1.37 kpc (1.30 to 1.47 kpc at 90% confidence) that is consistent with the median parallax distance to the pulsar of 1.46 kpc (1.12 to 2.10 kpc at 90% confidence), but with significantly smaller uncertainties. Our distance is also consistent with the distance to the candidate unbound binary companion in this SNR, HD37424. The presence of high velocity absorption lines is correlated with the emission line flux of the SNR but not with the radio flux.</description>

      <title>Lepto-Hadronic Scenarios for TeV Extensions of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglow Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent multi-wavelength observations of gamma-ray burst afterglows observed in the TeV energy range challenge the simplest Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) interpretation of this emission, and are consistent with a single power-law component spanning over eight orders of magnitude in energy. To interpret this generic behaviour in the single-zone approximation without adding further free parameters, we perform an exhaustive parameter space study using the public, time-dependent, multi-messenger transport software AM3. This description accounts for the radiation from non-thermal protons and the lepto-hadronic cascade induced by pp- and p{\gamma}-interactions. We summarise the main scenarios which we have found (SSC, Extended-syn, Proton-syn, pp-cascade, and p{\gamma}-cascade), and discuss their advantages and limitations. We find that possible high-density environments, as may be typical for surrounding molecular cloud material, offer an alternative explanation for producing flat hard (source) spectra up to and beyond energies of 10 TeV.</description>

      <title>Return to the forgotten ULX: a broadband NICER+NuSTAR study of NGC 4190 ULX-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed the nearby and relatively understudied ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 4190 ULX-1 jointly with NICER and NuSTAR to investigate its broadband spectrum, timing properties, and spectral variation over time. We found NGC 4190 ULX-1 to have a hard spectrum characterized by two thermal components (with temperatures ~0.25keV and ~1.6keV) and a high-energy excess typical of the ULX population, although the spectrum turns over at an unusually low energy. While no pulsations were detected, the source shows significant stochastic variability and the covariance spectrum indicates the presence of a high-energy cut-off power-law component, potentially indicative of an accretion column. Additionally, when fitting archival XMM-Newton data with a similar model, we find that the luminosity-temperature evolution of the hot thermal component follows the behavior of a super-Eddington slim disk though the expected spectral broadening for such a disk is not seen, suggesting that the inner accretion disk may be truncated by a magnetic field. Therefore, despite the lack of detected pulsations, there is tantalizing evidence for NGC 4190 ULX-1 being a candidate neutron star accretor, although further broadband observations will be required to confirm this behavior.</description>

      <title>Stationary neutron star envelopes at high accretion rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we model stationary neutron star envelopes at high accretion rates and describe our new code for such studies. As a first step we put special emphasis on the rp-process which results in the synthesis of heavy elements and study in detail how this synthesis depends on the mass accretion rate and the chemical composition of the accreted matter. We show that at very low accretion rate, $\dot{M} \sim 0.01 \dot{M}_{\text{Edd}}$, mostly low mass ($A\leq$ 24) elements are synthesized with a few heavier ones below the $^{40}$Ca bottleneck. However, once $\dot{M}$ is above ${\buildrel \sim \over &gt;} 0.1 \dot{M}_{\text{Edd}}$ this bottleneck is surpassed and nuclei in the iron peak region ($A\sim$ 56) are abundantly produced. At higher mass accretion rates progressively heavier nuclei are generated, reaching $A \sim 70$ at $\dot{M}_{\text{Edd}}$ and $A \sim 90$ at $5 \dot{M}_{\text{Edd}}$. We find that when the rp-process is efficient, the nucleosynthesis it generates is independent of the accreted abundance of CNO elements as these are directly and copiously generated once the $3\alpha$-reaction is operating. We also explore the efficiency of the rp-process under variations of the relative abundances of H and He. Simultaneously, we put special emphasis on the density profiles of the energy generation rate particularly at high density beyond the hydrogen exhaustion point. Our results are of importance for the study of neutron stars in systems in which X-ray bursts are absent but are also of relevance for other systems in describing the low density region, mostly below $10^6$ g cm\mmm, inbetween bursts.</description>

      <title>Kilonova parameters estimation with LSST at Vera C. Rubin Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The up-coming Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) opens a new opportunity to rapidly survey the southern Sky at optical wavelenghts (\ie ugrizy bands). In this study, we aim to test the possibility of using LSST observations to constrain the mass and velocity of different KN ejecta components from the observation of a combined set of light curves from GRB afterglows and KN\ae. We used a sample of simulated light curves from the aforementioned events as they would have been seen during the LSST survey to study how observing strategies' choice impacts the parameters' estimation. We found that the observing strategy design to be the best compromise between light curves coverage, observed filters and fit reliability involves a high number of visits with long gap pairs of about 4 hours every 2 nights in the same or different filters. The features of the observing strategy will allow us to recognize the different stages of the light curve evolution and gather observations in at least 3 filters.</description>

      <title>Bulk properties of PSR J0030+0451 inferred with the compactness measurement of NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2019, Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) mission released its findings on the mass and radius of the isolated neutron star (INS) PSR J0030+0451, revealing a mass of approximately 1.4 solar masses ($M_{\odot}$) and a radius near 13 kilometers. However, the recent re-analysis by the NICER collaboration \citep{vinciguerra2024updated} suggests that the available data primarily yields a precise inference of the compactness for this source while the resulting mass and radius are strongly model-dependent and diverse (the 68.3\% confidence counters just overlap slightly for the ST+PDT and PDT-U models). By integrating this compactness data with the equation of state (EoS) refined by our latest investigations, we have deduced the mass and radius for PSR J0030+0451, delivering estimates of $M=1.48^{+0.09}_{-0.10}~M_\odot$ and $R=12.39_{-0.70}^{+0.50}~{\rm km}$ for the compactness found in ST+PDT model, alongside $M=1.47^{+0.14}_{-0.20}~M_\odot$ and $R=12.37_{-0.70}^{+0.50}~{\rm km}$ for the compactness in PDT-U model. These two groups of results are well consistent with each other and the direct X-ray data inference within the ST+PDT model seems to be favored. Additionally, we have calculated the tidal deformability, moment of inertia, and gravitational binding energy for this NS. Furthermore, employing these refined EoS models, we have updated mass-radius estimates for three INSs with established gravitational redshifts.</description>

      <title>The disappearance of the blue and luminous progenitor of the Type IIn SN 2010jl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type IIn supernovae (SNe) exhibit narrow hydrogen lines that arise from the strong interaction between ejecta and circumstellar material. It remains poorly understood, however, what progenitor stars give rise to these explosions. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of the progenitor and environment of the nearby Type IIn SN 2010jl. With newer images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, we confirm that the previously reported progenitor candidate is a blend of the progenitor itself and a field star cluster in its close vicinity. SN 2010jl has now become much fainter than the progenitor. The progenitor is very blue and luminous with an effective temperature of log $T_{\rm eff}/{\rm K}$=4.26$^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$ and a luminosity of log $L/L_{\odot}$ =6.52$^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$. It is located in a very young star-forming region, but its luminosity is much higher than that expected from the environmental stellar populations. We suggest that the progenitor was in outburst when observed. Its nature and evolutionary history remain to be investigated.</description>

      <title>The properties of FR0 radio galaxies as intermediate objects in the evolution of radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The counter-rotation between black holes and accretion disk configuration was introduced over a decade ago to elucidate the nature of the radio loud/radio-quiet dichotomy and the jet-disk connection, but has since been applied to a plethora of observations across space and time. We briefly review the paradigm in which counter-rotation is key for the triggering of radio galaxies and its observational support, then apply it to a series of observations concerning FR0 radio galaxies. FR0 radio galaxies appear to be radio galaxies in transition, with low-spinning black holes and thus weaker but tilted jets with respect to an earlier radio quasar phase. As a result, FR0 radio galaxies are prescribed to be in an earlier phase of star formation suppression in radio galaxies, compared to a later phase that is unlikely to be less than tens of millions of years in the future if they have enough accretion fuel to evolve into more powerful FRI radio galaxies. FR0 radio galaxies will have a greater or lesser star formation suppression feedback effect depending on how long they live. Tilted jets also enhance stellar velocities in the bulge. Because FR0 jet lengths are of the same order of magnitude as the radius of the stellar bulge, FR0 jets are prescribed to have begun, more or less recently depending on their age, to affect stellar velocity dispersions as well. As a result, they will be associated with dispersion values that tend to be larger than for characteristically non-jetted active galaxies, but smaller than giant radio galaxies such as M87 that have experienced a long-term tilted and more powerful FRI jet. With these ideas it is possible to make a coarse-grained prediction for the slope of the M-{\sigma} plane for FR0 radio galaxies with values between 4 and 8.</description>

      <title>Spectro-polarimetric study to constrain accretion-ejection properties of MCG-5-23-16 using IXPE and NuSTAR observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a study on the X-ray polarization properties of MGC-5-23-16 by analyzing long-term monitoring data from {\it NuSTAR} jointly with {\it IXPE} observations in May and November 2022. The re-analysis of {\it IXPE} data gives model-dependent polarization degree, PD (\%) = $1.55\pm0.99$ and $1.31\pm0.95$ in the energy band $2-8$ keV, agrees with previous studies within error bars. The model-independent analysis of PD poses an upper limit of $\leq3.8$ ($1\sigma$ level) for the same energy band. The observed upper limit of PD, along with broadband spectral analysis ($3-79$ keV), allowed us to derive corona geometry (i.e. length and height) and the accretion disk inclination ($\sim 33^\circ$). Additional {\it NuSTAR} observations were also analyzed to gain insights into the accretion flow properties of the source and to estimate the expected polarization during those epochs with PD $\sim 4.3\%$. The radius and height of the corona exhibited to vary between $28.2\pm3.1 - 39.8\pm4.6$ r$_s$ and $14.3\pm1.7-21.4\pm1.9$ r$_s$, with a mass outflow rate from the corona measuring $0.14\pm0.03-0.2\pm0.03$ Eddington rate ($\dot M_{\rm Edd}$). The estimated PD values were nearly constant up to a certain radial distance and height of the corona and then decreased for increasing corona geometry. The spectral analysis further provided an estimate for the mass of the central black hole $\sim 2\times 10^7$ M$_\odot$ and the velocity of the outflowing gas $\sim 0.16-0.19c$. Our modeling of the disk-corona-outflows and polarization connection can be extended and validated with data from recently launched India's first X-ray Polarimeter Satellite, offering potential applications to other sources.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the magnetic cataclysmic variable XMM J152737.4-205305.9 with a deep eclipse-like feature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we report a discovery from XMM-Newton, which involves the identification and subsequent examination of a newly discovered polar-type cataclysmic variable named XMM J152737.4-205305.9. The discovery was made by matching the XMM-Newton data archive with the cataclysmic variable candidate catalog provided by Gaia Data Release 3. The utilization of X-ray photometry has led to the identification of two distinct dips that exhibit a recurring pattern with a precise period of 112.4(1) minutes in two XMM-Newton observations that are one year apart. The data obtained from the photometry of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and ATLAS surveys consistently indicate the presence of the different mass accretion states of up to 2 mag. Following the optical data, the \textit{SRG}(Spectrum Roentgen Gamma)/eROSITA All Sky Survey observed the system in two different X-ray levels which may imply different accretion states. Following these observations, the low-resolution spectrum obtained using SALT spectroscopy exposes the prominent hydrogen Balmer and helium emission lines, strongly supporting that the system belongs to the category of polar-type magnetic cataclysmic variable. The XMM-Newton observations, conducted under various conditions of X-ray levels, reveal a consistent pattern of a deep dip-like feature with a width of $\approx 9.1$ min. This feature implies the presence of an eclipse in both observations. According to Gaia data, the object is located at a distance of $1156^{+720}_{-339}$,pc, and its X-ray luminosity lies within the $L_{\rm X}$= (3-6)$\times10^{31}$ \lergs range.</description>

      <title>Effects of non-continuous inverse Compton cooling in blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Blazar flares provide a window into the extreme physical processes occurring in relativistic outflows. Most numerical codes used for modeling blazar emission during flares utilize a simplified continuous-loss description of particle cooling due to the inverse Compton (IC) process, neglecting non-continuous (discrete) effects that arise in the Klein-Nishina (KN) regime. The significance of such effects has not been explored in detail yet. Aims. In this study, we investigate the importance of non-continuous Compton cooling losses and their impact on the electron spectrum and spectral energy distribution (SED) of blazars during high flux states (flares), as well as in the low state. Methods. We solve numerically the full transport equation accounting for large relative jumps in energy, by extending our existing blazar flare modeling code EMBLEM. We perform a detailed physical modeling of the brightest gamma-ray flare of the archetypal Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) 3C 279 detected in June 2015. We then compare results obtained using the full cooling term and using the continuous-loss approximation. Results. We show that during flaring states of FSRQs characterized by high Compton dominance, the non-continuous cooling can lead to a significant modification of the electron spectrum, introducing a range of distinct features, such as low-energy tails, hardening/softening, narrow and extended particle excesses, and shifts in the cooling break position. Such distortion translates to differences in the associated SED up to 50%. This highlights the importance of non-continuous effects and the need to consider them in blazar emission models, particularly applied to extreme gamma-ray flares.</description>

      <title>Hubble Space Telescope images of SN 1987A: Evolution of the ejecta and the equatorial ring from 2009 to 2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) 1987A offers a unique opportunity to study how a spatially resolved SN evolves into a young supernova remnant (SNR). We present and analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging observations of SN 1987A obtained in 2022 and compare them with HST observations from 2009 to 2021. These observations allow us to follow the evolution of the equatorial ring (ER), the rapidly expanding ejecta, and emission from the center over a wide range in wavelength from 2000 to 11 000 AA. The ER has continued to fade since it reached its maximum ~8200 days after the explosion. In contrast, the ejecta brightened until day ~11000 before their emission levelled off; the west side brightened more than the east side, which we attribute to the stronger X-ray emission by the ER on that side. The asymmetric ejecta expand homologously in all filters, which are dominated by various emission lines from hydrogen, calcium, and iron. From this overall similarity, we infer the ejecta are chemically well-mixed on large scales. The exception is the diffuse morphology observed in the UV filters dominated by emission from the Mg II resonance lines that get scattered before escaping. The 2022 observations do not show any sign of the compact object that was inferred from highly-ionized emission near the remnant's center observed with JWST. We determine an upper limit on the flux from a compact central source in the [O III] HST image. The non-detection of this line indicates that the S and Ar lines observed with JWST originate from the O free inner Si - S - Ar rich zone and/or that the observed [O III] flux is strongly affected by dust scattering.</description>

      <title>Periodicity from X-ray sources within the inner Galactic disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many years, it has been claimed that the Galactic ridge X-ray emission at the Galactic Center (GC) is truly diffuse in nature. However, with the advancement of modern X-ray satellites, it has been found that most of the diffuse emission is actually comprised of thousands of previously unresolved X-ray point sources. Further, many studies suggest that a vast majority of these X-ray point sources are magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs) and active binaries. One unambiguous way to identify these mCVs and other sources is by detecting their X-ray periodicity. Therefore, we systematically searched for periodic X-ray sources in the inner Galactic disk, including the GC region. We have used data from our ongoing XMM-Newton Heritage survey of the inner Galactic disk ($350^{\circ}\lesssim l\lesssim+7^{\circ}$ and $-1^{\circ}\lesssim b\lesssim +1^{\circ}$) plus the XMM-Newton archival observations of the GC. We computed the Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the light curves for the periodicity search. We fitted the energy spectra of the sources using a simple power-law model plus three Gaussians at 6.4, 6.7, and 6.9 keV for the iron $K$ emission complex. We detected periodicity in 26 sources. For 14 of them, this is the first discovery of periodicity. For the other 12 sources, we found periods similar to those already known, indicating no significant period evolution. We also searched for the Gaia counterparts of the periodic sources to estimate their distances using the Gaia parallax. We found a likely Gaia counterpart for seven sources. We have classified the sources into four categories based on the periodicity, hardness ratio, and the equivalent width of Fe $K$ line emission. Of the 14 sources where we detect the periodicity for the first time, four are likely to be intermediate polars, five are likely to be polars, two are neutron star X-ray binaries, and three are of unknown nature.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Probe of Planck-scale Physics After Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle decays are always accompanied by the emission of graviton quanta of gravity through bremsstrahlung processes. However, the corresponding branching ratio is suppressed by the square of the ratio of particle's mass to the Planck scale. The resulting present abundance of gravitational waves (GWs), composed of gravitons, is analogously suppressed. We show that superheavy particles, as heavy as the Planck scale, can be naturally produced during the post-inflationary reheating stage in the early Universe and their decays yield dramatic amounts of GWs over broad frequency range. GW observations could hence directly probe Planck-scale physics, notoriously challenging to explore.</description>

      <title>Joint Deconvolution of Astronomical Images in the Presence of Poisson Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for joint likelihood deconvolution (Jolideco) of a set of astronomical observations of the same sky region in the presence of Poisson noise. The observations may be obtained from different instruments with different resolution, and different point spread functions. Jolideco reconstructs a single flux image by optimizing the posterior distribution based on the joint Poisson likelihood of all observations under a patch-based image prior. The patch prior is parameterised via a Gaussian Mixture model which we train on high-signal-to-noise astronomical images, including data from the James Webb Telescope and the GLEAM radio survey. This prior favors correlation structures among the reconstructed pixel intensities that are characteristic of those observed in the training images. It is, however, not informative for the mean or scale of the reconstruction. By applying the method to simulated data we show that the combination of multiple observations and the patch-based prior leads to much improved reconstruction quality in many different source scenarios and signal to noise regimes. We demonstrate that with the patch prior Jolideco yields superior reconstruction quality relative to alternative standard methods such as the Richardson-Lucy method. We illustrate the results of Jolideco applied to example data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Fermi-LAT Gamma-ray Space Telescope. By comparing the measured width of a counts based and the corresponding Jolideco flux profile of an X-ray filament in SNR 1E 0102.2-721} we find the deconvolved width of 0.58+- 0.02 arcsec to be consistent with the theoretical expectation derived from the known width of the PSF.</description>

      <title>Conditional variational autoencoder inference of neutron star equation of state from astrophysical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new inference framework for neutron star astrophysics based on conditional variational autoencoders. Once trained, the generator block of the model reconstructs the neutron star equation of state from a given set of mass-radius observations. While the pressure of dense matter is the focus of the present study, the proposed model is flexible enough to accommodate the reconstructing of any other quantity related to dense matter equation of state. Our results show robust reconstructing performance of the model, allowing to make instantaneous inference from any given observation set. The present framework contrasts with computationally expensive evaluation of the equation-of-state posterior probability distribution based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>Shadows and Properties of Spin-Induced Scalarized Black Holes with and without a Ricci Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the properties and shadows of spin-induced scalarized black holes, as well as investigate how a Ricci coupling influences them. Our findings reveal significant deviations from the Kerr metric in terms of the location and geodesic frequencies of the innermost stable circular orbit and light ring, with the former exhibiting more pronounced disparities. The shadows of scalarized black holes exhibit relatively minor deviations when compared to those of Kerr black holes with the same mass and spin. Overall, the presence of a Ricci coupling is observed to mitigate deviations from the Kerr metric.</description>

      <title>Observing the Galactic Underworld: Predicting photometry and astrometry from compact remnant microlensing events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isolated black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs) are largely undetectable across the electromagnetic spectrum. For this reason, our only real prospect of observing these isolated compact remnants is via microlensing; a feat recently performed for the first time. However, characterisation of the microlensing events caused by BHs and NSs is still in its infancy. In this work, we perform N-body simulations to explore the frequency and physical characteristics of microlensing events across the entire sky. Our simulations find that every year we can expect $88_{-6}^{+6}$ BH, $6.8_{-1.6}^{+1.7}$ NS and $20^{+30}_{-20}$ stellar microlensing events which cause an astrometric shift larger than 2~mas. Similarly, we can expect $21_{-3}^{+3}$ BH, $18_{-3}^{+3}$ NS and $7500_{-500}^{+500}$ stellar microlensing events which cause a bump magnitude larger than 1~mag. Leveraging a more comprehensive dynamical model than prior work, we predict the fraction of microlensing events caused by BHs as a function of Einstein time to be smaller than previously thought. Comparison of our microlensing simulations to events from in Gaia finds good agreement. Finally, we predict that in the combination of Gaia and GaiaNIR data there will be $14700_{-900}^{+600}$ BH and $1600_{-200}^{+300}$ NS events creating a centroid shift larger than 1~mas and $330_{-120}^{+100}$ BH and $310_{-100}^{+110}$ NS events causing bump magnitudes $&lt; -1$. Of these, $&lt;10$ BH and $5_{-5}^{+10}$ NS events should be detectable using current analysis techniques. These results inform future astrometric mission design, such as GaiaNIR, as they indicate that, compared to stellar events, there are fewer observable BH events than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Log-Normal Waiting Time Widths Characterize Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many astronomical phenomena, including Fast Radio Bursts and Soft Gamma Repeaters, consist of brief distinct aperiodic events. The intervals between these events vary randomly, but there are periods of greater activity, with shorter mean intervals, and of lesser activity, with longer mean intervals. A single dimensionless parameter, the width of a log-normal function fitted to the distribution of waiting times between events, quantifies the variability of the activity. This parameter describes its dynamics in analogy to the critical exponents and universality classes of renormalization group theory. If the distribution of event strengths is a power law, the width of the log-normal fit is independent of the detection threshold and is a robust measure of the dynamics of the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Comparing jet-shaped point symmetry in cluster cooling flows and supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I point out similarities between point-symmetric X-ray morphologies in cooling flow groups and clusters of galaxies, which are observed to be shaped by jets, and point-symmetric morphologies of eight core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants. I use these similarities to strengthen the jittering jet explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe, which predicts that the last pairs of jets to be launched by the newly born neutron star might shape some CCSN remnants to point-symmetric morphology. The point-symmetric morphologies in both types of objects are composed of two or more pairs of opposite bubbles (cavities), nozzles, some clumps, small protrusions (termed ears), and rims. The typically large volume of a CCSN remnant shaped by jets implies that the shaping jets carry an energy comparable to that of the ejecta, which in turn implies that jets exploded the remnant's massive star progenitor. The morphological similarities studied here add to the similarity of CCSN remnants, not only point-symmetric ones, to planetary nebulae shaped by jets. Together, these similarities solidify the JJEM as the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe. I consider the identification of point-symmetry in CCSNe, as expected by jet-shaping in the JJEM, to be the most severe challenge to the competing neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. I reiterate my earlier claim, but in a more vocal voice, that the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe is the JJEM.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and extension of the inverse-Compton emission of the Crab Nebula from a combined Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Crab Nebula is a unique laboratory for studying the acceleration of electrons and positrons through their non-thermal radiation. Observations of very-high-energy $\gamma$ rays from the Crab Nebula have provided important constraints for modelling its broadband emission. We present the first fully self-consistent analysis of the Crab Nebula's $\gamma$-ray emission between 1 GeV and $\sim$100 TeV, that is, over five orders of magnitude in energy. Using the open-source software package Gammapy, we combined 11.4 yr of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope and 80 h of High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) data at the event level and provide a measurement of the spatial extension of the nebula and its energy spectrum. We find evidence for a shrinking of the nebula with increasing $\gamma$-ray energy. Furthermore, we fitted several phenomenological models to the measured data, finding that none of them can fully describe the spatial extension and the spectral energy distribution at the same time. Especially the extension measured at TeV energies appears too large when compared to the X-ray emission. Our measurements probe the structure of the magnetic field between the pulsar wind termination shock and the dust torus, and we conclude that the magnetic field strength decreases with increasing distance from the pulsar. We complement our study with a careful assessment of systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Quark-hadron pasta phase in neutron stars: the role of medium-dependent surface and curvature tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the hadron-quark mixed phase, often termed the \textit{pasta} phase, expected to exist in the cores of massive neutron stars. To construct the equations of state (EoS), we combine an analytical representation based on the APR EoS for hadronic matter with the MIT bag model featuring vector interactions for quark matter. For modeling the mixed phase, we utilize the compressible liquid drop model that consistently accounts for finite-size and Coulomb effects. Unlike most previous analyses that treated surface tension as a constant free parameter and neglected curvature tension, we employ microphysical calculations using the multiple reflection expansion formalism to determine these parameters, while also ensuring their self-consistency with the EoS. We construct an extensive set of mixed hybrid EoSs by varying model parameters, solve the stellar structure equations to obtain neutron star mass-radius relationships, and select the models that satisfy current astrophysical constraints. Our findings closely align with calculations using a constant surface tension in terms of EoS stiffness and resulting stellar structure. However, they reveal significant differences in the types of geometric structures and their prevalence ranges within the mixed phase. Specifically, curvature effects enhance the emergence of tubes and bubbles at high densities despite the large value of surface tension, while suppressing the existence of drops and rods at low densities.</description>

Abstract: The prospect of unprecedented high-quality data of gravitational waves in the upcoming decades demands a theoretical effort to optimally study and analyze the signals that next generation detectors will provide. Here we study the gravitational wave emission and related dynamics during the inspiralling phase of the Circular Restricted Three Body Problem, a modification of the conventional binary scenario in which a small third object co-rotates with the parent binary system. Specifically, we obtain analytic expressions for the emitted power, frequency variation and other dynamical variables that describe the evolution of the system. As a key highlight, we find that the presence of the third body actually slows down the coalescence of the binary, which can be partially interpreted as an effective rescaling of the binary's chirp-mass. Our analysis assumes semi-Keplerian orbits for the particles and a highly mass asymmetric parent binary needed for the stability of orbits.</description>
