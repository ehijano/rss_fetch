      <title>Factors in infinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $A\subseteq G$ a non-empty subset. A right $s$-factor associated with $A$ is a maximal subset $U\subseteq G$ such that the product $AU$ is direct. The lower and upper $s$-indices $|G:A|^-$ and $|G:A|^+$ are defined as the minimum and the supremum of the cardinalities of such maximal sets $U$. The subset $A$ is called stable if $|G:A|^- = |G:A|^+$, and $G$ is called stable if every subset of $G$ is stable.
  Using a graph-theoretic reformulation in terms of Cayley graphs, we prove that every infinite group is unstable. Equivalently, for every infinite group $G$ there exists a subset $A\subseteq G$ for which maximal subsets $U$ with direct product $AU$ do not all have the same cardinality. This gives a negative answer to Question 21.58 of the Kourovka Notebook.</description>

      <title>Structure Theorems for locally compact modules over localizations of the integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a multiplicatively closed subset $S$ of the integers, there exist Structure Theorems for $LC$ modules over the localization $\mathbb{Z}S^{-1}$ that are "similar" to those of $LCA$ groups. The most notable one is the 1st Theorem: Given such a module $M$, there exists a unique set of prime numbers $\Sigma$ (purely dependent on $S$) for which $M \cong \mathbb{R}^n \times \sideset{}{'}\prod_{q \in \Sigma} \mathbb{Q}_p^{n_p} \times N$, where $(n, (n_p)_{p \in \Sigma})$ is a sequence of nonnegative integers and $N$ contains a compact open submodule $K$ such that $K/K_0$ is a topological module over $\prod_{ q \in \mathbb{P}\setminus{\Sigma}} \mathbb{Z}_q$. Just like for $LCA$ groups, it is also possible to characterize the locally compact, compactly generated modules over $\mathbb{Z}S^{-1}$, as well as their Pontryagin Duals (which then allows to conclude that any locally compact $\mathbb{Z}S^{-1}$-module is an inverse limit of modules within a specific family). These characterizations are given in the 2nd and 3rd Structure Theorems respectively. Furthermore, as an elementary consequence of the 1st Structure Theorem, one can obtain a full classification of locally compact vector spaces over $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>Ramanujan subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite, connected, $(d+1)$-regular graph $G$ is called Ramanujan if every its eigenvalue $\lambda$ satisfies either $\lambda=\pm (d+1)$ or $|\lambda|\leq 2\sqrt{d}$. The Ramanujan condition corresponds to the optimal rate of decay of correlations for the associated non-backtracking edge subshift. We consider a higher-dimensional generalization of this observation. We introduce the notion of a $d$-regular $\mathbb{Z}^{\delta}$-subshift of finite type, and we define a Ramanujan subshift as a $d$-regular $\mathbb{Z}^{\delta}$-subshift with an optimal rate of decay of correlations. We show that for every odd prime power $q\geq 3$ and dimension $\delta&lt;q$, there exists a $q$-regular Ramanujan $\mathbb{Z}^{\delta}$-subshift. The construction is based on the quaternionic lattices over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ introduced by Rungtanapirom-Stix-Vdovina (2019). Each of our $q$-regular Ramanujan subshifts gives rise to a family of non-bipartite $(q+1)$-regular Ramanujan graphs. These graphs are very explicit and local in the strong sense: the neighbors of any vertex can be computed by an explicit Mealy automaton associated with the subshift. As a byproduct, for every odd prime power $q$, we get a single lifting rule that can be iterated to produce an infinite family of $(q+1)$-regular Ramanujan graphs.</description>

      <title>Structural Chirality from Inverse Semigroups to Twisted Groupoid $C^*$-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a structural theory of chirality for inverse semigroups and show how it propagates canonically to \'{e}tale groupoids and twisted groupoid $C^*$-algebras. Starting from inverse semigroup data equipped with admissible twist information, we construct a canonical twisted universal groupoid in the sense of Paterson and introduce a mirror correspondence encoding intrinsic asymmetry. Our main result identifies a structural obstruction to mirror self-duality at the level of twisted universal groupoids and shows that this obstruction descends to an obstruction for the associated reduced twisted groupoid $C^*$-algebra to be isomorphic to its opposite. The framework is representation-independent, yet compatible with concrete germ groupoid models, and provides a unified bridge between partial symmetries, groupoid structures, and analytic invariants in noncommutative operator algebras.</description>

      <title>Matroids from gain graphs over quotient groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new construction for matroids from gain graphs that simultaneously generalizes several existing constructions. The construction takes as input a gain graph over a Frobenius group $\Gamma$ with Frobenius kernel $\Gamma_1$ and outputs an elementary lift of the frame matroid of the underlying gain graph over the quotient group $\Gamma/\Gamma_1$.
  While the hypothesis that $\Gamma$ is a Frobenius group may seem unusual, we prove that it is in some sense necessary: if $\Gamma$ is any finite group with a nontrivial proper normal subgroup $\Gamma_1$ and there is a construction that takes in a complete $\Gamma$-gain graph and outputs an elementary lift $M$ of the frame matroid of the underlying $(\Gamma/\Gamma_1)$-gain graph so that a cycle of the graph is a circuit of $M$ if and only if it is $\Gamma$-balanced, then $\Gamma$ is a Frobenius group with Frobenius kernel $\Gamma_1$.</description>

      <title>Cusped spaces for hierarchically hyperbolic groups, and applications to Dehn filling quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a construction that simultaneously yields cusped spaces of relatively hyperbolic groups, and spaces quasi-isometric to Teichmueller metrics. We use this to study Dehn-filling-like quotients of various groups, among which mapping class groups of punctured spheres. In particular, we show that the mapping class group of a five-holed sphere (resp. the braid group on four strands) has infinite hyperbolic quotients (strongly) not isomorphic to hyperbolic quotients of any other given sphere mapping class group (resp. any other braid group). These quotients are obtained by modding out suitable large powers of Dehn twists, and we further argue that the corresponding quotients of the extended mapping class group have trivial outer automorphism groups. We obtain these results by studying torsion elements in the relevant quotients.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of valued Hahn groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06290v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hahn groups endowed with the canonical valuation play a fundamental role in the classification of valued abelian groups. In this paper we study the group of valuation (respectively order) preserving automorphisms of a Hahn group $G$. Under the assumption that $G$ satisfies some lifting property, we prove a structure theorem decomposing the automorphism group into a semidirect product of two notable subgroups. We characterise a class of Hahn groups satisfying the aforementioned lifting property. For some special cases we provide a matrix description of the automorphism group.</description>

      <title>Garside shadows and biautomatic structures in Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2022, Osajda and Przytycki showed that any Coxeter group $W$ is biautomatic. Key to their proof is the notion of voracious projection of an element $g \in W$, which is used iteratively to construct a biautomatic structure for $W$: the voracious language. In this article, we generalize these two notions by defining them for any Garside shadow $B$ in a Coxeter system $(W,S)$. This leads to the result that any finite Garside shadow in $(W,S)$ can be used to construct a biautomatic structure for $W$. In addition, we show that for the Garside shadow $L$ of low elements, the biautomatic structure obtained corresponds to the original voracious language of Osajda and Przytycki. These results answer a question of Hohlweg and Parkinson.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the major problems in the structural theory of skew braces consists in the classification of skew braces of finite order up to isomorphism. In this light, the open question of the existence of a Cauchy theorem for finite skew braces is of great interest. We prove a positive answer for the classes of finite two-sided skew braces and bi-skew braces. Consequences and related structural results are also outlined.</description>

      <title>Towards Graham's rearrangement conjecture via rainbow paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an old question in combinatorial group theory which can be traced back to a conjecture of Graham from 1971. Given a group $\Gamma$, and some subset $S\subseteq \Gamma$, is it possible to permute $S$ as $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_d$ so that the partial products $\prod_{1 \leq i \leq t} s_i$, $t\in [d]$ are all distinct? Most of the progress towards this problem has been in the case when $\Gamma$ is a cyclic group. We show that for any group $\Gamma$ and any $S \subseteq \Gamma$, there is a permutation of $S$ where all but a vanishing proportion of the partial products are distinct, thereby establishing the first asymptotic version of Graham's conjecture under no restrictions on $\Gamma$ or $S$.
  To do so, we explore a natural connection between Graham's problem and the following very natural question attributed to Schrijver. Given a $d$-regular graph $G$ properly edge-coloured with $d$ colours, is it always possible to find a rainbow path with $d-1$ edges? We settle this question asymptotically by showing one can find a rainbow path of length $d - o(d)$. While this has immediate applications to Graham's question for example when $\Gamma = \mathbb{F}_2^k$, our general result above requires a more involved result we obtain for the natural directed analogue of Schrijver's question.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the (first) Sylow theorem for certain classes of finite skew braces, proving it to hold true when the skew brace is two-sided, bi-skew, right nilpotent, $\lambda$-homomorphic or supersoluble. We also show it to hold true for soluble skew braces that are left-nilpotent, and address a number of more specialized settings, proving general Hall-type theorems.</description>

      <title>On the order of lazy cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the most elementary family of cellular automata defined over an arbitrary group universe $G$ and an alphabet $A$: the lazy cellular automata, which act as the identity on configurations in $A^G$, except when they read a unique active transition $p \in A^S$, in which case they write a fixed symbol $a \in A$. As expected, the dynamical behavior of lazy cellular automata is relatively simple, yet subtle questions arise since they completely depend on the choice of $p$ and $a$. In this paper, we investigate the order of a lazy cellular automaton $\tau : A^G \to A^G$, defined as the cardinality of the set $\{ \tau^k : k \in \mathbb{N} \}$. In particular, we establish a general upper bound for the order of $\tau$ in terms of the fibers of $p$, and we prove that this bound is attained when $p$ is a quasi-constant pattern.</description>
