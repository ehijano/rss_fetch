      <title>Seeking the nearest neutron stars using a new local electron density map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a compelling testing ground for gravity, nuclear dynamics, and physics beyond the Standard Model, and so it will be useful to locate the neutron stars nearest to Earth. To that end, we revisit pulsar distance estimates extracted from the dispersion measure of pulsar radio waves scattering on electrons. In particular, we create a new electron density map for the local kiloparsec by fitting to parallax measurements of the nearest pulsars, which complements existing maps that are fit on the Galactic scale. This ``near-Earth'' electron density map implies that pulsars previously estimated to be 100-200 pc away may be as close as tens of parsecs away, which motivates a parallax-based measurement campaign to follow-up on these very-near candidate pulsars. Such nearby neutron stars would be valuable laboratories for testing fundamental physics phenomena, including several late-stage neutron star heating mechanisms, using current and forthcoming telescopes. We illustrate this by estimating the sensitivities of the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope and Thirty Meter Telescope to neutron stars heated by dark matter capture.</description>

      <title>Nonthermal Signatures of Radiative Supernova Remnants II: The Impact of Cosmic Rays and Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near the ends of their lives, supernova remnants (SNRs) enter a "radiative phase," when efficient cooling of the postshock gas slows expansion. Understanding SNR evolution at this stage is crucial for estimating feedback in galaxies, as SNRs are expected to release energy and momentum into the interstellar medium near the ends of their lives. A standard prediction of SNR evolutionary models is that the onset of the radiative stage precipitates the formation of a dense shell behind the forward shock. In Paper I, we showed that such shell formation yields detectable nonthermal radiation from radio to $\gamma$-rays, most notably emission brightening by nearly two orders of magnitude. However, there remains no observational evidence for such brightening, suggesting that this standard prediction needs to be investigated. In this paper, we perform magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of SNR evolution through the radiative stage, including cosmic rays (CRs) and magnetic fields to assess their dynamical roles. We find that both sources of nonthermal pressure disrupt shell formation, reducing shell densities by a factor of a few to more than an order of magnitude. We also use a self-consistent model of particle acceleration to estimate the nonthermal emission from these modified SNRs and demonstrate that, for reasonable CR acceleration efficiencies and magnetic field strengths, the nonthermal signatures of shell formation can all but disappear. We therefore conclude that the absence of observational signatures of shell formation represents strong evidence that nonthermal pressures from CRs and magnetic fields play a critical dynamical role in late-stage SNR evolution.</description>

      <title>Decoding the deterministic nature of black hole IGR J17091-3624</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The differentiation between chaotic and stochastic systems has long been scrutinized, particularly in observations where data is often noise-contaminated and finite. Our research examines the dual nature of the black hole X-ray binary IGR J17091-3624, an object whose behavior has been closely studied in parallel to GRS 1915+105. Remarkable similarities in the temporal classes of these two objects are explored in literature. However, this was not the case with their non-linear dynamics: GRS 1915+105 shows signs of determinism, while IGR J17091-3624 was found to be stochastic. In this study, we confront the inherent challenge of noise contamination, as in IGR J17091-3624, faced by previous studies, particularly Poisson noise, which adversely impacts the reliability of non-linear results. We employ several denoising techniques to mitigate noise effects and employ methods like Autoencoder, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Correlation Integral (CI) to isolate the deterministic signatures. We have found signs of determinism in IGR J17091-3624 after denoising, thus supporting the hypothesis of it being similar to GRS 1915+105, even as a dynamical system.</description>

Abstract: We report on follow-up observations of the recently discovered transient by the Einstein Probe, EP240709A, with the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We also incorporated archival multiwavelength survey data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (X-ray), Gaia (optical), the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (gamma-ray), and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (infrared) to distinguish between blazars and stellar systems. We suggest that EP240709A is likely an active blazar.</description>

      <title>Fast dynamic ejecta in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ejection of neutron-rich matter is one of the most important consequences of a neutron star merger. While the bulk of the matter is ejected at fast, but non-relativistic velocities ($\sim0.2c$), a small amount of mildly relativistic dynamic ejecta have been seen in a number of numerical simulations. Such ejecta can have far reaching observational consequences ranging from the shock breakout burst of gamma-rays promptly after the merger, to an early ($\sim 1$ hour post-merger) blue kilonova precursor signal, to synchrotron emission years after the merger ("kilonova afterglow"). These all potentially carry the imprint of the binary system parameters and the equation of state. By analyzing Lagrangian simulations in full General Relativity, performed with the code SPHINCS\_BSSN, we identify two ejection mechanisms for fast ejecta: i) about 30\% of the ejecta with {$v&gt; 0.4c$} are "sprayed out" from the shear interface between the merging stars and escape along the orbital plane and ii) the remaining $\sim$ 70\% of the fast ejecta result from the central object "bouncing back" after strong, general-relativistic compression. This "bounce component" is ejected in a rather isotropic way and reaches larger velocities (by $\sim0.1c$) so that its faster parts can catch up with and shock slower parts of the spray ejecta. Even for a case that promptly collapses to a black hole, we find fast ejecta with similar properties to the non-collapsing case, while slower matter parts are swallowed by the forming black hole. We discuss observational implications of these fast ejecta, including shock breakout and kilonova afterglow.</description>

      <title>Lateral Distribution Function of Extensive Air Showers Cherenkov Light and Stable Laws: Fast Modelling Method for the CORSIKA Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper proposes a new approach for approximating the lateral distribution functions (LDF) of Cherenkov light emitted by the electromagnetic component of extensive air showers (EAS) in the Earth's atmosphere. The information basis of the study is a series of simulations with the CORSIKA code. To approximate the LDF atmospheric Cherenkov light the probability density functions of one-dimensional fractional stable distributions were used. The results obtained in the work allow us to propose a fast modeling method for the CORSIKA code using a procedure similar to the Nishimura-Kamata-Greisen (NKG) for calculating the LDF of the EAS electromagnetic component.</description>

      <title>The spectra of a radiative reprocessing outflow model for fast blue optical transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiation reprocessing model, in which an optically-thick outflow absorbs the high-energy emission from a central source and re-emits in longer wavelengths, has been frequently invoked to explain some optically bright transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) whose progenitor and explosion mechanism are still unknown. Previous studies on this model did not take into account the frequency dependence of the opacity. We study the radiative reprocessing and calculate the UV-optical-NIR band spectra from a spherical outflow composed of pure hydrogen gas, for a time-dependent outflowing mass rate. Electron scattering and frequency-dependent bound-free, free-free opacities are considered. The spectrum deviates from the blackbody at NIR and UV frequencies; in particular, it has $\nu L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{1.5}$ at NIR frequencies, because at these frequencies the absorption optical depth from the outflow's outer edge to the so-called photon trapping radius is large and is frequency dependent. We apply our model to the proto-type FBOT AT2018cow by {the spectra} to the observed SED. The best-fit mass loss rate suggests that the total outflow mass in AT2018cow is $M_{\rm out} \approx 5.7^{+0.4}_{-0.4} \, M_{\odot}$. If that equals the total mass lost during an explosion, and if the progenitor is a blue supergiant (with a pre-explosion mass of $\sim 20 \, M_{\odot}$), then it will suggest that the central compact remnant mass is at least $\approx \, \rm{14 \, M_{\odot}}$. This would imply that the central remnant is a black hole.</description>

      <title>Rapid Rotation of Polarization Orientations in PSR B1919+21's Single Pulses: Implications On Pulsar's Magnetospheric Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse and model rapid rotations of polarization orientations in PSR B1919+21's single pulses, based on FAST observation data. In more than one third of B1919+21's single pulses, polarization angle (PA) is found to rotate quasi-monotonically with pulse longitude, by over 180 or even 360 degrees. Most of these quasi-monotonic PA curves have negative slopes with respect to pulse longitude. Oscillations of circular polarization fraction accompany these PA rotations. This rapid rotation could be induced by quick change of phase lag between normal wave modes within an individual pulse. We propose a phenomenological model to successfully reproduce the observed polarization rotations in single pulses, and calculate phase lags in a dipolar magnetic field of an aligned rotating pulsar, with a dispersion relation of orthogonal wave modes in strongly magnetized plasma. The weak frequency dependence of observed polarization rotation requires the radio emission height to be low, approximately 10 times the neutron star radius.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Intensity of the Interstellar Radiation Field with Ultra-high Energy $\gamma$ ray Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of the intensity distribution of the interstellar radiation background is based on the observational data from IRAS, COBE-FIRAS and Planck. The intensity of this radiation field increases rapidly towards the Galactic plane and is the highest near the Galactic centre due to the high density of stars and dust. However, a precise determination of the variations of this radiation field with spatial and angular coordinates is not feasible observationally. We explore how future studies of gamma-ray spectra from numerous ultra-high-energy gamma-ray sources can indirectly probe variations in the interstellar radiation field's intensity across different distances from the Galactic centre and across Galactic latitudes and longitudes. This study is crucial for making self-consistent predictions of high energy gamma-ray fluxes from Galactic sources detected by observatories like LHAASO, Tibet AS$_{\gamma}$ and the next-generation gamma-ray telescopes.</description>

      <title>Large-scale unpinning and pulsar glitches due to the forced oscillation of vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basic framework of the superfluid vortex model for pulsar glitches, though, is well accepted; there is a lack of consensus on the possible trigger mechanism responsible for the simultaneous release of a large number ($\sim 10^{17}$) of superfluid vortices from the inner crust. Here, we propose a simple trigger mechanism to explain such catastrophic events of vortex unpinning. We treat a superfluid vortex line as a classical massive straight string with well-defined string tension stretching along the rotation axis of pulsars. The crustquake-induced lattice vibration of the inner crust can act as a driving force for the transverse oscillation of the string. Such forced oscillation near resonance causes the bending of the vortex lines, disturbing their equilibrium configuration and resulting in the unpinning of vortices. We consider unpinning from the inner crust's so-called {\it strong (nuclear)} pinning region, where the vortices are likely pinned to the nuclear sites. We also comment on vortex unpinning from the interstitial pinning region of the inner crust. We sense that unifying crustquake with the superfluid vortex model can naturally explain the cause of large-scale vortex unpinning and generation of large-size pulsar glitches.</description>

      <title>Spectral and magnetic properties of the jet base in NGC 315</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic of relativistic jets in the inner parsec regions is deeply affected by the nature of the magnetic fields. The level of magnetization of the plasma, as well as the geometry of these fields on compact scales, have not yet been fully constrained. In this paper we employ multi-frequency and multi-epoch very long baseline interferometry observations of the nearby radio galaxy NGC 315. We aim to derive insights into the magnetic field properties on sub-parsec and parsec scales by examining observational signatures such as the spectral index, synchrotron turnover frequency, and brightness temperature profiles. This analysis is performed by considering the properties of the jet acceleration and collimation zone, which can be probed thanks to the source vicinity, as well as the inner part of the jet conical region. We observe remarkably steep values for the spectral index on sub-parsec scales ($\alpha \sim -2$, $S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$) which flatten around $\alpha \sim -0.8$ on parsec scales. We suggest that the observed steep values may result from particles being accelerated via diffusive shock acceleration mechanisms in magnetized plasma and subsequently experiencing cooling through synchrotron losses. The brightness temperature of the 43 GHz cores indicates a dominance of the magnetic energy at the jet base, while the cores at progressively lower frequencies reveal a gradual transition towards equipartition. Based on the spectral index and brightness temperature along the incoming jet, and by employing theoretical models, we derive that the magnetic field strength has a close-to-linear dependence with distance going from parsec scales up to the jet apex. Overall, our findings are consistent with a toroidal-dominated magnetic field on all the analyzed scales.</description>

      <title>Accurate muonic interactions in neutron-star mergers and impact on heavy-element nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundances resulting from $r$-process nucleosynthesis as predicted by simulations of binary neutron-star (BNS) mergers remain an open question as the current state-of-the-art is still restricted to three-species neutrino transport. We present the first BNS merger simulations employing a moment-based general-relativistic neutrino transport with five neutrino species, thus including (anti)muons and advanced muonic $\beta$-processes, and contrast them with traditional three neutrino-species simulations. Our results show that a muonic trapped-neutrino equilibrium is established, forming a different trapped-neutrino hierarchy akin to the electronic equilibrium. The formation of (anti)muons and the muonization via muonic $\beta$-processes enhance the neutrino luminosity, leading to rapid cooling in the early post-merger phase. Since muonic processes redirect part of the energy otherwise used for protonization by electronic processes, they yield a cooler remnant and disk, together with neutrino-driven winds that are more neutron-rich. Importantly, the unbound ejected mass is smaller than three-species simulations and, because of its comparatively smaller temperature and proton fraction, it can enhance lanthanide production and reduce the overproduction of light $r$-process elements for softer equations of state. This finding underlines the importance of muonic interactions and five neutrino species in long-lived BNS remnants.</description>

      <title>Tayler-Spruit dynamo in binary neutron star merger remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In binary neutron star mergers, the remnant can be stabilized by differential rotation before it collapses into a black hole. Therefore, the angular momentum transport mechanisms are crucial for predicting the lifetime of the hypermassive neutron star. One such mechanism is the Tayler-Spruit dynamo, and recent simulations have shown that it could grow in proto-neutron stars formed during supernova explosions. We aim to investigate whether hypermassive neutron stars with high neutrino viscosity could be unstable to the Tayler-Spruit dynamo and study how magnetic fields would evolve in this context. Using a one-zone model based on the result of a 3D GRMHD simulation, we investigate the time evolution of the magnetic fields generated by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. In addition, we analyze the dynamics of the 3D GRMHD simulation to determine whether the dynamo is present. Our one-zone model predicts that the Tayler-Spruit dynamo can increase the toroidal magnetic field to $ \ge 10^{17}$ G and the dipole field to amplitudes $\ge 10^{16}$ G. The dynamo's growth timescale depends on the initial large-scale magnetic field right after the merger. In the case of a long-lived hypermassive neutron star, an initial magnetic field of $\ge 10^{12}$ G would be enough for the magnetic field to be amplified in a few seconds. However, we show that the resolution of the current GRMHD simulations is insufficient to resolve the Tayler-Spruit dynamo due to high numerical dissipation at small scales. We find that the Tayler-Spruit dynamo could occur in hypermassive neutron stars and shorten their lifetime, which would have consequences on multi-messenger observations.</description>

The parameter $C_1$ depends on the power law index of the wavenumber spectrum of electron density inhomogeneities in the ionized interstellar medium. Radio waves propagating through the inhomogeneous ionized medium suffer multipath propagation, as a result of which the pulsed emission from a neutron star undergoes scatter broadening. Consequently, interference between the delayed copies of the scatter-broadened electric field manifests as scintillation. We measure a scintillation bandwidth $\Delta\nu_d=149\pm3$ Hz as well as a scatter-broadening timescale $\tau_d=1.22\pm0.09$ ms at 650 MHz towards the magnetar XTE J1810-197, using which we estimate $C_1=1.14\pm0.09$ directly from the uncertainty relation. This is also the first reported direct measurement of a scintillation bandwidth of order 100 Hz. We describe the methods employed to obtain these results and discuss their implications in general, as well as for the magnetar XTE J1810-197. We also discuss how such, effectively in-situ, measurements of $C_1$ can aid in inferring the wavenumber spectrum power law index, and hence, quantitatively discriminate between the various possible scattering scenarios in the ionized medium.</description>

      <title>Can the central compact object in HESS J1731--347 be indeed the lightest neutron star observed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exceptionally low mass of $0.77_{-0.17}^{+0.2} M_{\odot}$ for the central compact object (CCO) XMMU J173203.3 -- 344518 (XMMU J1732) in the supernova remnant (SNR) HESS J1731 -- 347 challenges standard neutron star (NS) formation models. The nearby post-AGB star IRAS 17287 -- 3443 ($\approx 0.6 M_\odot$), also within the SNR, enriches the scenario. To address this puzzle, we advance the possibility that the gravitational collapse of a rotating pre-SN iron core ($\approx 1.2 M_\odot$) could result in a low-mass NS. We show that angular momentum conservation during the collapse of an iron core rotating at $\approx 45\%$ of the Keplerian limit results in a mass loss of $\approx 0.3 M_\odot$, producing a stable newborn NS of $\approx 0.9 M_\odot$. Considering the possible spin-down, this indicates that the NS is now slowly rotating, thus fulfilling the observed mass-radius relation. Additionally, the NS's surface temperature ($\approx 2 \times 10^6$ K) aligns with canonical thermal evolution for its $\approx 4.5$ kyr age. We propose the pre -- SN star, likely an ultra-stripped core of $\approx 4.2 M_\odot$, formed a tidally locked binary with IRAS 17287 -- 3443, having a 1.43-day orbital period. The supernova led to a $\approx 3 M_\odot$ mass loss, imparting a kick velocity $\lesssim 670$ km s$^{-1}$, which disrupted the binary. This scenario explains the observed 0.3 pc offset between XMMU J1732 and IRAS 17287 -- 3443 and supports the possibility of CCOs forming in binaries, with rotation playing a key role in core-collapse, and the CCO XMMU J1732 being the lightest NS ever observed.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection under centrifugal and gravitational electromotive forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the physical implications of the centrifugal and gravitational electromotive forces on magnetic reconnection in a Kerr black hole background. We find that both forces increase the reconnection rate, though the underlying mechanisms differ substantially. The gravitational force leads to a separation of charge density, breaking the quasi-neutrality of the plasma. In contrast, the centrifugal electromotive force affects the electric current by reducing the effective length of the current sheet. This reduction arises from the non-Euclidean spatial geometry observed by a locally comoving observer with respect to the rotating sheet. This phenomenon amplifies both the transport of charged carriers and the thermal-inertia effect within the current sheet, irrespective of the presence of a black hole.</description>

      <title>PKS 1424-418: A persistent candidate source of the mm$-\gamma$-ray connection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a long-term strong correlation between millimeter (mm) radio and $\gamma$-ray emission in the flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) PKS 1424-418. The mm$-\gamma$-ray connection in blazars is generally thought to originate from the relativistic jet close to the central engine. We confirm a unique long-lasting mm$-\gamma$-ray correlation of PKS 1424-418 by using detailed correlation analyses and statistical tests, and we find its physical meaning in the source. We employed ~8.5 yr of (sub)mm and $\gamma$-ray light curves observed by ALMA and Fermi-LAT, respectively. From linear and cross-correlation analyses between the light curves, we found a significant, strong mm$-\gamma$-ray correlation over the whole period. We did not find any notable time delay within the uncertainties for the mm$-\gamma$-ray correlation, which means zero lag. The mm wave spectral index values (S$_{\nu}$ $\propto$ $\nu_{\alpha}$) between the band 3 and 7 flux densities indicate a time-variable opacity of the source at (sub)mm wavelengths. Interestingly, the mm wave spectral index becomes temporarily flatter (i.e., $\alpha$ &gt; $-$0.5) when the source flares in the $\gamma$-rays. We relate our results with the jet of PKS 1424-418, and we discuss the origin of the $\gamma$-rays and opacity of the inner (sub)parsec-scale jet regions.</description>

      <title>The classification and formation rate of $\mathbf{Swift/BAT}$ gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are usually classified into long/short categories according to their durations, but controversy still exists in this aspect. Here we re-examine the long/short classification of GRBs and further compare the cosmological distribution and evolution of each potential subclass. A large number of $Swift/BAT$ GRBs are analyzed in this study. The Gaussian mixture model is used to fit the duration distribution as well as the joint distribution of duration and hardness ratio, and the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria are adopted to assess the goodness of fit. It is found that three Gaussian components can better fit both the univariate and bivariate distributions, indicating that there are three subclasses in the $Swift/BAT$ GRBs, namely short, intermediate, and long subclasses. The non-parametric Efron-Petrosian and Lynden-Bell's $c^{-}$ methods are used to derive the luminosity function and formation rate from the truncated data of bursts with known redshift in each subclass. It is found that the luminosity distributions and birth rates of the three subclasses are different, further supporting the existence of the intermediate subclass in the $Swift/BAT$ GRBs.</description>

      <title>SIRIUS: Identifying Metal-poor Stars Enriched by a Single Supernova in a Star-by-star Cosmological Zoom-in Simulation of a Dwarf Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-poor stars enriched by a single supernova (mono-enriched stars) are direct proof (and provide valuable probes) of supernova nucleosynthesis. Photometric and spectroscopic observations have shown that metal-poor stars have a wide variety of chemical compositions; the star's chemical composition reflects the nucleosynthesis process(es) that occurred before the star's formation. While the identification of mono-enriched stars enables us to study the ejecta properties of a single supernova, the fraction of mono-enriched stars among metal-poor stars remains unknown. Here we identify mono-enriched stars in a star-by-star cosmological zoom-in simulation of a dwarf galaxy. We find that the fraction of mono-enriched stars is higher for lower metallicity, stars with [Fe/H] $&lt; -2.5$. The percentages of mono-enriched stars are 11% at [Fe/H] = $-$5.0 and 1% at [Fe/H] = $-$2.5, suggesting that most metal-poor stars are affected by multiple supernovae. We also find that mono-enriched stars tend to be located near the center of the simulated dwarf. Such regions will be explored in detail in upcoming surveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) on the Subaru telescope.</description>

      <title>Simulating super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last few decades, there has been considerable interest in the violation of the sacred "Chandrasekhar" mass limit of white dwarfs (WDs). Peculiar over-luminous type Ia supernovae (such as SNLS-03D3bb) lend observational support to the idea that these super-Chandrasekhar WDs exist. Our group, for more than a decade, has been actively working on the theoretical possibility of these objects through the presence of the star's magnetic field. The magnetic field greatly contributes to the existence of these massive WDs, both through classical and quantum effects. In this work, we explore super-Chandrasekhar WDs, formed via evolution from a main sequence star, as a result of the classical effects of the star's magnetic field. We obtain super-Chandrasekhar WDs and new mass limit(s), depending on the magnetic field geometry. We explore the full evolution and stability of these objects from the main sequence stage through the one-dimensional stellar evolution code STARS. In order to do so, we have appropriately modified the given codes by introducing magnetic effect and cooling. Our simulation confirms that massive WDs are possible in the presence of a magnetic field satisfying underlying stability.</description>

      <title>Elastic properties of nuclear pasta in neutron-star crusts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the relativistic mean field (RMF) model with Thomas-Fermi approximation, we investigate the elastic properties of neutron star matter. The elastic constants are estimated by introducing deformations on the nuclear pasta structures in $\beta$-equilibrium, where various crystalline configurations are considered in a fully three-dimensional geometry without the Wigner-Seitz approximation. Two scenarios with different symmetry energy slope ($L = 41.34$ and 89.39 MeV) are examined, where the the elastic constants can vary by ten times. By fitting to the numerical results, we improve the analytic formulae for the elastic properties of nuclear pasta by introducing damping factors.</description>

      <title>Can we detect super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs via continuous gravitational waves?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of massive white dwarfs (WDs) containing more than Chandrasekhar's maximum mass has been suggested via the detection of peculiar type Ia Supernovae. It had been crucial to directly detect those 'super' (more massive)-Chandrasekhar WDs to confirm their existence. The WD's small size and cold internal environment have been a great disadvantage for detecting them via electromagnetic surveys like GAIA and SDSS. Although many WDs are detected in optical observations, none of the super-Chandrasekhar WDs was observed directly. Mukhopadhyay and his group proposed a decade ago that one of the possibilities to explain the high mass of super-Chandrasekhar WD is to exercise the existence of a strong magnetic field in the WD interior. The group also recently proposed that a high magnetic field, in turn, can nontrivially deform the star from a spherical shape. In the presence of rotation and obliquity angle, such WDs can radiate continuous gravitational waves (CGW). This opens up the exciting possibility of detecting the super-Chandrasekhar WDs with the upcoming detector LISA. However, the gravitational wave (GW) amplitude will decay with time due to electromagnetic radiation and quadrupolar radiation. Altogether, those decay mechanisms will set a timescale for detecting WDs via CGW. Even with a timescale bound, we can expect to detect a few super-Chandrasekhar WDs with a couple of years of cumulative detection, leading to the direct detection of super-Chandrasekhar WDs.</description>

      <title>Can Neutron Star Tidal Effects Obscure Deviations from General Relativity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main goals of gravitational-wave astrophysics is to study gravity in the strong-field regime and constrain deviations from general relativity. Any such deviation affects not only binary dynamics and gravitational-wave emission but also the structure and tidal properties of compact objects. In the case of neutron stars, masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities can all differ significantly between different theories of gravity. Currently, the measurement uncertainties in neutron-star radii and tidal deformabilities are quite large. However, much less is known about how the large uncertainty in the nuclear equation of state might affect tests of general relativity using binary neutron-star mergers. Conversely, using the wrong theory of gravity might lead to incorrect constraints on the nuclear equation of state. Here we study this problem within scalar-tensor theory. We apply the recently derived $\ell = 2$ tidal love numbers in this theory to parameter estimation of GW170817. Correspondingly, we test if physics beyond general relativity could bias measurements of the nuclear equation of state and neutron-star radii. We find that parameter inference for both the general relativistic and scalar-tensor case return consistent component masses and tidal deformabilites. The radius and the equation of state posteriors, however, differ between the two theories, but neither is excluded by current observational limits. This indicates that measurements of the nuclear equation of state may be biased and that deviations from general relativity could go undetected when analyzing current binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>The dramatic transition of the extreme Red Supergiant WOH G64 to a Yellow Hypergiant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19329v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red Supergiants (RSGs) are cool, evolved massive stars in their final evolutionary stage before exploding as a supernova. However, the evolution and fate of the most luminous RSGs is uncertain. Observational evidence for luminous warm, post-RSG objects and the lack of luminous RSGs as supernova progenitors suggest a blueward evolution. In this work, we analyze WOH G64, considered since the 1980s as the most extreme RSG in the Large Magellanic Cloud in terms of its size, luminosity, and mass-loss rate. Time-series photometry over the last 30 years reveals a sudden, yet smooth change from semi-regular to irregular variability in 2014. Multi-epoch optical spectroscopy confirms the transition, as WOH~G64 now exhibits properties of a B[e] star in the optical, and warm-star features in the near-infrared. We discovered that WOH G64 is a rare, massive symbiotic system formed by a RSG, which transitioned to a Yellow Hypergiant, and a B-star companion. The dramatic transition can be explained by: a) binary interactions partially stripping the envelope, b) the return of WOH G64 to a quiescent state after an outstanding eruption exceeding 30 years, and c) the expulsion of its outer layers due to a pre-SN superwind phase, indicating its imminent explosion. WOH~G64 offers a unique opportunity to witness stellar evolution in real-time, providing crucial clues for the final phases of massive stars and their resulting supernovae.</description>

      <title>A New LISA-Detectable Type Ia Supernova Progenitor in the Southern Sky: SMSS J1138-5139</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery and analysis of a nearby eclipsing ultra-compact accreting binary at coordinates 11:38:10.91 $-$51:39:49.15 (SMSS J1138$-$5139), the first well-constrained LISA-detectable Type Ia supernova progenitor. Our time series optical spectroscopy identifies its orbital period through radial velocity monitoring at $P_{\rm orb,RV}=27.69\pm0.03~{\rm min}$; twice the photometric period seen in 2-minute cadence data from TESS Sector 37. We model our optical spectroscopy together with new simultaneous multi-band time series photometry from Gemini to place constraints on the binary parameters. Our light curve modeling finds that SMSS J1138$-$5139 contains an $M_2=0.24~{\rm M_\odot}$ pre-white dwarf donor with a massive $M_1=0.99~{\rm M_\odot}$ white dwarf accretor at orbital inclination $i=88.7~{\rm deg}$. Based on our photometrically derived system parameters, we expect that gravitational wave radiation will drive SMSS J1138$-$5139 to a merger within $\tau=5.7\pm0.3~{\rm Myr}$ and result in a Type Ia supernova. Even without a direct merger event, the component masses of SMSS J1138$-$5139 and active hydrogen accretion suggest that eventual helium accretion will likely also trigger a Type Ia supernova explosion through the dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) channel. We expect LISA to detect the gravitational wave emission from SMSS J1138$-$5139 with signal-to-noise $7-10$ after a 48-month mission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of the anisotropy in the gravitational wave (GW) background originating from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. We derive the distribution of the GW anisotropy power spectrum coefficients, $C_{l\geq1}/C_0$, in scenarios including environmental effects and eccentricities of the SMBH binaries. Although the mean of $C_{l\geq1}/C_0$ is the same for all multipoles, we show that their distributions vary, with the low $l$ distributions being the widest. We also find a strong correlation between spectral fluctuations and the anisotropy in the GW signal. We show that the GW anisotropy can break the degeneracy between the scenarios including environmental effects or eccentricity. In particular, we find that existing NANOGrav constraints on GW anisotropy begin to constrain SMBH scenarios with strong environmental effects.</description>

      <title>Applicability of multi-component study on Bayesian searches for targeted anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic background gravitational waves have not yet been detected by ground-based laser interferometric detectors, but recent improvements in detector sensitivity have raised considerable expectations for their eventual detection. Previous studies have introduced methods for exploring anisotropic background gravitational waves using Bayesian statistics. These studies represent a groundbreaking approach by offering physically motivated anisotropy mapping that is distinct from the Singular Value Decomposition regularization of the Fisher Information Matrix. However, they are limited by the use of a single model, which can introduce potential bias when dealing with complex data that may consist of a mixture of multiple models. Here, we demonstrate the bias introduced by a single-component model approach in the parametric interpretation of anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds, and we confirm that using multiple-component models can mitigate this bias.</description>

      <title>Searching for MeV-mass neutrinophilic Dark Matter with Large Scale Dark Matter Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The indirect detection of dark matter (DM) through its annihilation products is one of the primary strategies for DM detection. One of the least constrained classes of models is neutrinophilic DM, because the annihilation products, weakly interacting neutrinos, are challenging to observe. Here, we consider a scenario where MeV-mass DM exclusively annihilates to the third neutrino mass eigenstate, which is predominantly of tau and muon flavor. In such a scenario, the potential detection rate of the neutrinos originating from the DM annihilation in our galaxy in the conventional detectors would be suppressed by up to approximately two orders of magnitude. This is because the best sensitivity of such detectors for neutrinos with energies below approximately 100~MeV is for electron neutrino flavor. In this work, we highlight the potential of large-scale DM detectors in uncovering such signals in the tens of MeV range of DM masses. In addition, we discuss how coincident signals in direct detection DM experiments and upcoming neutrino detectors such as DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande, and JUNO could provide new perspectives on the DM problem.</description>

      <title>A gravitational wave detectable candidate Type Ia supernova progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19916v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae, critical for studying cosmic expansion, arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs, but their precise progenitor pathways remain unclear. Growing evidence supports the ``double-degenerate'' scenario, where two white dwarfs interact. The absence of other companion types capable of explaining the observed Ia rate, along with observations of hyper-velocity white dwarfs interpreted as surviving companions of such systems provide compelling evidence in favor of this scenario. Upcoming millihertz gravitational wave observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are expected to detect thousands of double-degenerate systems, though the most compact known candidate Ia progenitors produce only marginally detectable gravitational wave signals. Here, we report observations of ATLAS J1138-5139, a binary white dwarf system with an orbital period of 28 minutes. Our analysis reveals a 1 solar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting from a helium-core white dwarf. Given its mass, the accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarf is poised to trigger a typical-luminosity Type Ia supernova within a few million years, or to evolve into a stably mass-transferring AM CVn system. ATLAS J1138-5139 provides a rare opportunity to calibrate binary evolution models by directly comparing observed orbital parameters and mass transfer rates closer to merger than any previously identified candidate Type Ia progenitor. Its compact orbit ensures detectability by LISA, demonstrating the potential of millihertz gravitational wave observatories to reveal a population of Type Ia progenitors on a Galactic scale, paving the way for multi-messenger studies offering insights into the origins of these cosmologically significant explosions.</description>

Abstract: The recent discovery of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and first hints of coincident electromagnetic and neutrino emission herald the beginning of the era of multi-messenger astronomy. Due to their high power, transient sources are expected to supply a significant fraction of the observed energetic astroparticles, through enhanced particle acceleration and interactions. Here, we review theoretical expectations of neutrino emission from transient astrophysical sources and the current and upcoming experimental landscape, highlighting the most promising channels for discovery and specifying their detectability.</description>

      <title>Three dimensional end-to-end simulation for kilonova emission from a black-hole neutron-star merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study long-term evolution of the matter ejected in a black-hole neutron-star (BH-NS) merger employing the results of a long-term numerical-relativity simulation and nucleosynthesis calculation, in which both dynamical and post-merger ejecta formation is consistently followed. In particular, we employ the results for the merger of a $1.35\,M_\odot$ NS and a $5.4\,M_\odot$ BH with the dimensionless spin of 0.75. We confirm the finding in the previous studies that thermal pressure induced by radioactive heating in the ejecta significantly modifies the morphology of the ejecta. We then compute the kilonova (KN) light curves employing the ejecta profile obtained by the long-term evolution. We find that our present BH-NS model results in a KN light curve that is fainter yet more enduring than that observed in AT2017gfo. This is due to the fact that the emission is primarily powered by the lanthanide-rich dynamical ejecta, in which a long photon diffusion time scale is realized by the large mass and high opacity. While the peak brightness of the KN emission in both the optical and near-infrared bands is fainter than or comparable to those of binary NS models, the time-scale maintaining the peak brightness is much longer in the near-infrared band for the BH-NS KN model. Our result indicates that a BH-NS merger with massive ejecta can observationally be identified by the long lasting ($&gt;$two weeks) near-infrared emission.</description>

      <title>Joint gravitational wave detection by TianQin and LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the detection accuracy of double white dwarfs (DWDs), stellar-mass black hole binaries (SBHBs), light and heavy intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs), extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), and the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) of astronomical origin for TianQin, LISA, and joint detection. We use a Fisher matrix analysis and consider for each source the averaged detection accuracy over a realistic range of parameters. We find that on average TianQin obtains more accurate parameter estimation for DWDs and light IMRIs, LISA for heavy IMRIs, EMRIs, MBHBs, and the galactic foreground of the SGWB, and both contribute similarly to the detection of SBHBs and the extra-galactic SGWB. Nevertheless, for all sources joint detection allows setting tighter constraints on most parameters highlighting its importance for future detection.</description>

      <title>Long-term Monte Carlo-based neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics simulations for a black hole-torus system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present our new general relativistic Monte Carlo (MC)-based neutrino radiation hydrodynamics code designed to solve axisymmetric systems with several improvements. The main improvements are as follows: (i) the development of an extended version of the implicit MC method for multi-species radiation fields; (ii) modeling of neutrino pair process rates based on a new numerically efficient and asymptotically correct fitting function for the kernel function; (iii) the implementation of new numerical limiters on the radiation-matter interaction to ensure a stable and physically correct evolution of the system. We apply our code to a black hole (BH)-torus system with a BH mass of $3\,M_\odot$, BH dimmensionless spin of 0.8, and a torus mass of $0.1\,M_\odot$, which mimics a post-merger remnant of a binary neutron star merger in the case that the massive neutron star collapses to a BH within a short time scale ($\sim10\,{\rm ms}$). We follow the evolution of the BH-torus system up to more than $1\,{\rm s}$ with our MC-based radiation viscous-hydrodynamics code that dynamically takes into account non-thermal pair annihilation. We find that the system evolution and the various key quantities, such as neutrino luminosity, ejecta mass, torus $Y_e$, and pair annihilation luminosity, are broadly in agreement with the results of the previous studies. We also find that the $\nu_e{\bar \nu}_e$ pair annihilation can launch a relativistic outflow for a time scale of $\sim 0.1\,{\rm s}$, and it can be energetic enough to explain some of short-hard gamma-ray bursts and the precursors. Finally, we calculate the indicators of the fast flavor instability directly from the obtained neutrino distribution functions, which indicate that the instability can occur particularly near the equatorial region of the torus.</description>

      <title>A new potential method for the $X_{\rm max}$ measurement of extensive air showers based on backtracking radio signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: {Measurements of cosmic-ray composition based on air-shower measurements rely mostly on the determination of the position of the shower maximum ($X_\mathrm{max}$). One efficient technique is to image the development of the air shower using fluorescence telescopes. An alternative technique that has made significant advances in the recent years is to measure the radio emission from air shower. Common methods for $X_\mathrm{max}$ determination in the radio detection technique include fitting a two-dimensional radio intensity footprint at the ground with Monte-Carlo simulated showers which is computationally quite expensive, and others that are based on parameterizations obtained from simulations. In this paper, we present a new method which is computationally extremely efficient and has the potential to reconstruct $X_{\rm max}$ with minimal input from simulations. The method involves geometrical reconstruction of radio emission profile of air showers along the shower axis by backtracking radio signals recorded by an array of antennas at the ground. On implementing the method on simulated cosmic-ray proton and iron showers in the energy range of $\rm 10^{17}-10^{18}\,eV$, we find a strong correlation between the radio emission profile obtained with the method in the $20-80$~MHz frequency range and the shower longitudinal profile, implying a new potential way of measuring $X_\mathrm{max}$ using radio signals.}</description>

Abstract: Recently, the Hellings Downs correlation has been observed by different pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations, such as NANOGrav, European PTA, Parkes PTA, and Chinese PTA. These PTA measurements of the most precise pulsars within the Milky Way show the first evidence for the stochastic gravitational wave background of our Universe. We study the ultralight axion interpretation of the new discovery by investigating the gravitational wave from axion transitions between different energy levels of the gravitational atoms, which are composed of cosmic populated Kerr black holes and their surrounding axion clouds formed through the superradiant process. By Bayesian analysis, we demonstrate that this new observation naturally admits an ultralight axion interpretation around $10^{-21}$eV, which is consistent in magnitude with the typical mass of fuzzy dark matter.</description>

      <title>Transient Classifiers for Fink: Benchmarks for LSST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to detect a few million transients per night, which will generate a live alert stream during the entire ten years of the survey. This stream will be distributed via community brokers whose task is to select subsets of the stream and direct them to scientific communities. Given the volume and complexity of the anticipated data, machine learning algorithms will be paramount for this task. We present the infrastructure tests and classification methods developed within the Fink broker in preparation for LSST. This work aims to provide detailed information regarding the underlying assumptions and methods behind each classifier and enable users to make informed follow-up decisions from Fink photometric classifications. Using simulated data from ELAsTiCC, we showcase the performance of binary and multi-class ML classifiers available in Fink. These include tree-based classifiers coupled with tailored feature extraction strategies as well as deep learning algorithms. Moreover, we introduce CATS, a deep learning architecture specifically designed for this task. Our results show that Fink classifiers are able to handle the extra complexity that is expected from LSST data. CATS achieved $\geq 93\%$ precision for all classes except `long' (for which it achieved $\sim 83\%$), while our best performing binary classifier achieves $\geq 98\%$ precision and $\geq 99\%$ completeness when classifying the periodic class. ELAsTiCC was an important milestone in preparing the Fink infrastructure to deal with LSST-like data. Our results demonstrate that Fink classifiers are well prepared for the arrival of the new stream, but this work also highlights that transitioning from the current infrastructures to Rubin will require significant adaptation of the currently available tools. This work was the first step in the right direction.</description>

      <title>Fast wavelet basis search for generic gravitational wave bursts in Pulsar Timing Array data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As we move into an era of more sensitive pulsar timing array data sets, we may be able to resolve individual gravitational wave sources from the stochastic gravitational wave background. While some of these sources, like orbiting massive black hole binaries, have well-defined waveform models, there could also be signals present with unknown morphology. This motivates the search for generic gravitational-wave bursts in a signal-agnostic way. However, these searches are computationally prohibitive due to the expansive parameter space. In this paper we present QuickBurst, an algorithm with a re-defined likelihood that lets us expedite Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for a subset of the signal parameters by avoiding repeated calculations of costly inner products. This results in an overall speedup factor of $\sim$200 on realistic simulated datasets, which is sufficient to make generic gravitational-wave burst searches feasible on current and growing pulsar timing array datasets.</description>

      <title>A physically modelled selection function for compact binary mergers in the LIGO-Virgo O3 run and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the observation of nearly 100 compact binary coalescence (CBC) events up to the end of the Advanced gravitational-wave (GW) detectors' third observing run (O3), there remain fundamental open questions regarding their astrophysical formation mechanisms and environments. Population analysis should yield insights into these questions, but requires careful control of uncertainties and biases. GW observations have a strong selection bias: this is due first to the dependence of the signal amplitude on the source's (intrinsic and extrinsic) parameters, and second to the complicated nature of detector noise and of current detection methods. In this work, we introduce a new physically-motivated model of the sensitivity of GW searches for CBC events, aimed at enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of population reconstructions. In contrast to current methods which rely on re-weighting simulated signals (injections) via importance sampling, we model the probability of detection of binary black hole (BBH) mergers as a smooth, analytic function of source masses, orbit-aligned spins, and distance, fitted to accurately match injection results. The estimate can thus be used for population models whose signal distribution over parameter space differs significantly from the injection distribution. Our method has already been used in population studies such as reconstructing the BBH merger rate dependence on redshift.</description>

      <title>The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. II. Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first 2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays, and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of these observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time, rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately every month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the band-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are 0.3 to 1.0%, with longer-wavelength bands generally having larger uncertainties.</description>
