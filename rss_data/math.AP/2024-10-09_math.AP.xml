      <title>New type of bubbling solutions to a critical fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equation with double potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following critical fractional Schr\"odinger equation: \begin{equation} (-\Delta)^s u+V(|y'|,y'')u=K(|y'|,y'')u^{\frac{n+2s}{n-2s}},\quad u&gt;0,\quad y =(y',y'') \in \mathbb{R}^3\times\mathbb{R}^{n-3}, \qquad(0.1)\end{equation} where $n\geq 3$, $s\in(0,1)$, $V(|y'|,y'')$ and $K(|y'|,y'')$ are two bounded nonnegative potential functions. Under the conditions that $K(r,y'')$ has a stable critical point $(r_0,y_0'')$ with $r_0&gt;0$, $K(r_0,y_0'')&gt;0$ and $V(r_0,y_0'')&gt;0$, we prove that equation (0.1) has a new type of infinitely many solutions that concentrate at points lying on the top and the bottom of a cylinder. In particular, the bubble solutions can concentrate at a pair of symmetric points with respect to the origin. Our proofs make use of a modified finite-dimensional reduction method and local Pohozaev identities.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the Navier-Stokes equations and the Keller-Segel system in variable Fourier-Besov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem of the classical incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system in the framework of the Fourier-Besov spaces with variable regularity and integrability indices. By fully using some basic properties of these variable function spaces, we establish the linear estimates in variable Fourier-Besov spaces for the heat equation. Such estimates are fundamental for solving certain PDE's of parabolic type. As an applications, we prove global well-posedness in variable Fourier-Besov spaces for the 3D classical incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the 3D parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian Dysthe equation for hydroelastic waves in a compressed ice sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear hydroelastic waves along a compressed ice sheet lying on top of a two-dimensional fluid of infinite depth are investigated. Based on a Hamiltonian formulation of this problem and by applying techniques from Hamiltonian perturbation theory, a Hamiltonian Dysthe equation is derived for the slowly varying envelope of modulated wavetrains. This derivation is further complicated here by the presence of cubic resonances for which a detailed analysis is given. A Birkhoff normal form transformation is introduced to eliminate non-resonant triads while accommodating resonant ones. It also provides a non-perturbative scheme to reconstruct the ice-sheet deformation from the wave envelope. Linear predictions on the modulational instability of Stokes waves in sea ice are established, and implications for the existence of solitary wavepackets are discussed for a range of values of ice compression relative to ice bending. This Dysthe equation is solved numerically to test these predictions. Its numerical solutions are compared to direct simulations of the full Euler system, and very good agreement is observed.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Singular Solutions to the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger and the Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of radial self-similar singular solutions for the mass supercritical Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation far from the critical regime and, more generally, branches of such solutions for the Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equation. We are also able to control their monotone index (number of monotone intervals). In particular, we prove the existence of monotone radial self-similar singular solutions for the cubic Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation. The paper combines sharp analytic bounds of the solutions at infinity with computer assisted bounds for the solutions around zero and their matching at an intermediate value.</description>

      <title>Multi-component phase separation and small deformations of a spherical biomembrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the derivation and analysis of a model for multi-component phase separation occurring on biological membranes, inspired by observations of lipid raft formation. The model integrates local membrane composition with local membrane curvature, describing the membrane's geometry through a perturbation method represented as a graph over an undeformed Helfrich minimising surface, such as a sphere. The resulting energy consists of a small deformation functional coupled to a Cahn-Hilliard functional. By applying Onsager's variational principle, we obtain a multi-component Cahn-Hilliard equation for the vector $\boldsymbol\varphi$ of protein concentrations coupled to an evolution equation for the small deformation $u$ along the normal direction to the reference membrane. Then, in the case of a constant mobility matrix, we consider the Cauchy problem and we prove that it is (globally) well posed in a weak setting. We also demonstrate that any weak solution regularises in finite time and satisfies the so-called "strict separation property". This property allows usto show that any weak solution converges to a single stationary state by a suitable version of the Lojasiewicz-Simon inequality.</description>

      <title>Non-Uniform Dependence on Initial Data of Solutions to the logarithmically regularized 2D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the logarithmically regularized 2D Euler equations, which are derived by regularizing the Euler equation for the vorticity have been studied recently to get better understanding of the Euler equations. It was shown that the local well-posedness in the critical Sobolev space $H^1(\mathbb{R}^2)\cap H^{-1}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ can be derived for $\gamma&gt;\dfrac{1}{2}$, and the strong ill-posedness in this borderline space was yielded by Kwon for $0\le\gamma\le\frac{1}{2}$. In this paper, we show that the local well-posedness of the logarithmically regularized 2D Euler equations can be achieved in the subcritical space $H^s(\mathbb{T}^2)$ with $s&gt;2$ for $\gamma \ge 0$. Moreover, we prove that the data-to-solution map is not uniformly continuous in the Sobolev $H^s(\mathbb{T}^2)$ topology for any $s&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>A pathwise approach to the enhanced dissipation of passive scalars advected by shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for studying the enhanced dissipation of passive scalars advected by shear flows based on analyzing the particle trajectories of the stochastic differential equation associated with the governing drift-diffusion equation. We consider both shear flows on $\mathbb{T}^2$ and radially symmetric shears on $\mathbb{R}^2$ or the unit disk. Using our probabilistic approach, we are able to recover the well-known enhanced dissipation timescale for smooth shear flows on $\mathbb{T}^2$ with finite-order vanishing critical points [1, 5, 34, 36] and a generalized version of the results for radially symmetric shear flows from [42]. We also obtain results for shear flows with singularities and critical points where the derivative vanishes to infinite order. The proofs are all based on using Girsanov's theorem to reduce enhanced dissipation to a quantitative control problem that can be solved by leveraging the shearing across streamlines. Our method also has the feature that it is local in space, which allows us also to obtain estimates on the precise decay rate of solutions along each streamline in terms of the local shear profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the existence of forward self-similar solutions to the three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic-Boussinesq (MHD-Boussinesq) system with newtonian gravitational field. By employing a blow-up argument and the Leray-Schauder theorem, we construct a forward self-similar solution to this system without imposing any smallness assumptions on the self-similar initial value.</description>

      <title>A Hardy-H{\'e}non equation in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with sublinear absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider $m\&amp;gt;1$, $N\ge 1$ and $\max\{-2,-N\}\&lt;\sigma\&lt;0$. The Hardy-H\'enon equation with sublinear absorption\begin(equation*}- \Delta v(x) - |x|^\sigma v(x) + \frac{1}{m-1} v^{1/m}(x)= 0, \qquad x\in\mathbb{R}^N,\end{equation*}is shown to have at least one solution $v\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)\cap L^{(m+1)/m}(\mathbb{R}^N)$, which is non-negative and radially symmetric with a non-increasing profile. In addition, any such solution is compactly supported, bounded and enjoys the better regularity $v\in W^{2,q}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ for $q\in [1,N/|\sigma|)$. A key ingredient in the proof is a particular case of the celebrated Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities, for which we obtain the existence of an extremal function which is non-negative, bounded, compactly supported and radially symmetric with a non-increasing profile.A by-product of these results is the existence of compactly supported separate variables solutions to a porous medium equation with a spatially dependent source featuring a singular coefficient.</description>

      <title>Existence of normalized ground state solution to a mixed Schr\"odinger system in a plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of positive ground state solutions for a class of mixed Schr\"{o}dinger systems with concave-convex nonlinearities in $\mathbb{R}^2$, subject to $L^2$-norm constraints; that is, \[ \left\{ \begin{aligned}
  -\partial_{xx} u + (-\Delta)_y^s u + \lambda_1 u &amp;= \mu_1 u^{p-1} + \beta r_1 u^{r_1-1} v^{r_2}, &amp;&amp;
  -\partial_{xx} v + (-\Delta)_y^s v + \lambda_2 v &amp;= \mu_2 v^{q-1} + \beta r_2 u^{r_1} v^{r_2-1}, &amp;&amp; \end{aligned} \right. \] subject to the $L^2$-norm constraints: \[ \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} u^2 \,\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y = a \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} v^2 \,\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y = b, \] where $(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2$, $u, v \geq 0$, $s \in \left(1/2, 1 \right)$, $\mu_1, \mu_2, \beta &gt; 0$, $r_1, r_2 &gt; 1$, the prescribed masses $a, b &gt; 0$, and the parameters $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ appear as Lagrange multipliers. Moreover, the exponents $p, q, r_1 + r_2$ satisfy: \[ \frac{2(1+3s)}{1+s} &lt; p, q, r_1 + r_2 &lt; 2_s, \] where $2_s = \frac{2(1+s)}{1-s}$. To obtain our main existence results, we employ variational techniques such as the Mountain Pass Theorem, the Pohozaev manifold, Steiner rearrangement, and others, consolidating the works of Louis Jeanjean et al. \cite{jeanjean2024normalized}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we find a positive weak solution for a semipositone $p(\cdot )$- Laplacian problem. More precisely, we find a solution for the problem \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} -\Delta _{p(\cdot )}u=f(u)-\lambda &amp; \text{in }\Omega \\ u&gt;0 &amp; \text{in }\Omega \\ u=0 &amp; \text{on }\partial \Omega \end{array}% \right. , \]
  where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{N}$, $N\geq 2$ is a smooth bounded domain, $f$ is a contiuous function with subcritical growth, $\lambda &gt;0$ and $\Delta _{p(\cdot )}u=\text{div}(\left\vert \nabla u\right\vert ^{p(\cdot )-2}\nabla u)$. Also, we assume an Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz type of condition and using the Mountain Pass arguments, comparision principles and regularity principles we prove the existence of positive weak solution for $\lambda $ small enough.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive imaging involves recording waves generated by uncontrolled, random sources and utilizing correlations of such waves to image the medium through which they propagate. In this paper, we focus on passive inverse obstacle scattering problems governed by the Helmholtz equation in $\mathbb{R}^d\;(d=2,3)$. The random source is modelled by a Gaussian random process. Uniqueness results are established for the inverse problems to determine the source strength or shape and location of an obstacle, or both of them simultaneously from near-field correlation measurements. Finally, we present efficient methods for numerical reconstructions.</description>

      <title>An iterative method for solving elliptic BVP in one-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a decomposition method for solving elliptic boundary value problems in one-dimension. The method is an improvement to an existing technique for approximating elliptic systems. It is demonstrated to be computationally superior to the original formulation as less computations are required to obtain an approximation of the same accuracy. Convergence of the method is justified and supported by some theoretical results. We show that for a sufficiently smooth forcing data, the method always converge for a relatively small truncation order. The method is tested using some problems with exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Recovery of piecewise smooth parameters in an acoustic-gravitational system of equations from exterior Cauchy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an inverse problem for an acoustic-gravitational system whose principal symbol is identical to that of an acoustic wave operator. The displacement vector of a gas or liquid between the unperturbed and perturbed flow is denoted by $u(t,x)$. It satisfies a partial differential equation (PDE) system with a principal symbol corresponding to an acoustic wave operator, but with additional terms to account for a global gravitational field and self-gravitation. These factors make the operator nonlocal, as it depends on the wave speed and density of mass. We assume that all parameters are piecewise smooth in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (i.e., smooth everywhere except for jump discontinuities across closed hypersurfaces called interfaces) but unknown inside a bounded domain $\Omega$. We are given the solution operator for this acoustic-gravitational system, but only outside $\Omega$ and only for initial data supported outside $\Omega$. Using high-frequency waves, we prove that the piecewise smooth wave speed and density are uniquely determined by this map under certain geometric conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems with bistable nonlinearity are considered under general assumptions. The existence of stationary solutions with a single internal transition layer in such reaction-diffusion systems is shown using the analytical singular perturbation theory. Moreover, a stability criterion for the stationary solutions is provided by calculating the Evans function.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Analysis and Numerical Computation of String Vibration Equations with Elastic Supports for Bridge Cable Force Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on a critical aspect of bridge engineering -- the evaluation of cable forces, paying particular attention to the cables that are internally constrained by elastic supports. Detecting these cable forces is important for the safety and stability of bridges. The practical problem introduces a novel mathematical challenge: how to effectively address string vibration equations with one or multiple internal elastic supports,~which remains a theoretical issue not fully solved in engineering. To tackle this, it is necessary to firstly establish an appropriate mathematical model and accurately define initial-boundary value problems. We then formulate the well-posedness of the solution using both classical and weak solution approaches, supplementing the existing numerical results available in engineering. Meanwhile, we attempt to use PINNs (Physics-Informed Neural Networks) instead of traditional FEM (Finite Element Method) in engineering. Consequently, in contrast to the classical solution method, we demonstrate that for a string with finite elastic supports, the weak solution method not only improves mathematical modeling efficiency but also simplifies the process of explaining the well-posedness of the solution.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that the problem of moisture propagation in porous media with a nonlinear relation between the mass flux and the pressure gradient as a counterpart of the Darcy law exhibits the property of bounded speed of propagation even in the case of a hysteresis relation between the capillary pressure and the moisture content. The paper specifies conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions, and provides an upper bound for the moisture propagation speed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is dedicated to the study of a linear model arising in thermoelastic rod of homogeneous material. The system is resulting from a coupling of a heat and a wave equation in the interval $(0,1)$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions at the outer endpoints where the parabolic component is degenerating at the end point $x=0$. Two models are considered the first is with weak degeneracy and the second is with strong degeneracy. We aim to study the well-posedness and asymptotic stability of both systems using techniques from the $C_{0}$-semigroup theory and a use a frequency domain approach based on the well-known result of Pr\"uss in order to prove using some multiplier techniques that the energy of classical solutions decays uniformly as time goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic effects of an anisotropic Gaussian-type repulsive potential: nematic alignment and spatial effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elongated particles in dense systems often exhibit alignment due to volume exclusion interactions, leading to packing configurations. Traditional models of collective dynamics typically impose this alignment phenomenologically, neglecting the influence of volume exclusion on particle positions. In this paper, we derive nematic alignment from an anisotropic repulsive potential, focusing on a Gaussian-type potential and first-order dynamics for the particles. By analyzing larger particle systems and performing a hydrodynamic limit, we uncover the effects of anisotropy on both particle density and direction. Our findings reveal that while particle density evolves independently of direction, anisotropy slows down nonlinear diffusion. The direction dynamics are affected by the particles' position and involve complex transport and diffusion processes, with different behaviors for oblate and prolate particles. The key to obtaining these results lies in recent advancements in Generalized Collision Invariants offered by Degond, Frouvelle and Liu (KRM 2022).</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove the nonlinear instability of the shear flow in three dimensional inviscid non-conducting Boussinesq equations with rotation. We establish the nonlinear instability of the shear motion with respect to a general class of perturbation, by means of constructing an approximate solution containing the shear flow and an exponentially growing profile, which is deduced from the geostrophic limit model.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we examine some shape functionals, introduced by P\'olya and Makai, involving the torsional rigidity and the first Dirichlet-Laplacian eigenvalue for bounded, open and convex sets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We establish new quantitative bounds, which give us key properties and information on the behavior of the optimizing sequences. In particular, we consider two kinds of reminder terms that provide information about the structure of these minimizing sequences, such as information about the thickness.</description>

      <title>Rigidity for fixed angle inverse scattering for Riemannian metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fixed angle inverse scattering problem for a velocity consists in determining a sound speed, or a Riemannian metric up to diffeomorphism, from measurements obtained by probing the medium with a single plane wave. This is a formally determined inverse problem that is open in general. In this article we consider the rigidity question of distinguishing a sound speed or a Riemannian metric from the Euclidean metric. We prove that a general smooth metric that is Euclidean outside a ball can be distinguished from the Euclidean metric. The methods involve distorted plane waves and a combination of geometric, topological and unique continuation arguments.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue estimates and maximum principle for Lane-Emden systems, and applications to poly-Laplacian equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with explicit upper and lower bounds for principal eigenvalues and the maximum principle associated to generalized Lane-Emden systems (GLE systems, for short). Regarding the bounds, we generalize the upper estimate of Berestycki, Nirenberg and Varadhan [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. (1994), 47-92] for the first eigenvalue of linear scalar problems on general domains to the case of strongly coupled GLE systems with $m \geqslant 2$ equations on smooth domains. The explicit lower estimate we obtain is also used to derive a maximum principle to GLE systems relying in terms of quantitative ingredients. Furthermore, as applications of the previous results, upper and lower estimates for the first eigenvalue of weighted poly-Laplacian eigenvalue problems with $L^p$ weights $(p&gt;n)$ and Navier boundary condition are obtained. Moreover, a strong maximum principle depending on the domain and the weight function for scalar problems involving the poly-Laplacian operator is also established.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear interpolation and the flow map for quasilinear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an interpolation theorem for nonlinear functionals defined on scales of Banach spaces that generalize Besov spaces. It applies to functionals defined only locally, requiring only some weak Lipschitz conditions, extending those introduced by Lions and Peetre. Our analysis is self-contained and independent of any previous results about interpolation theory. It depends solely on the concepts of Friedrichs' mollifiers, seen through the formalism introduced by Hamilton, combined with the frequency envelopes introduced by Tao and used recently by two of the authors and others to study the Cauchy problem for various quasilinear evolutions in partial differential equations. Inspired by this latter work, our main application states that, for an abstract flow map of a quasilinear problem, both the continuity of the flow as a function of time and the continuity of the data to solution map follow automatically from the estimates that are usually proven when establishing the existence of solutions: propagation of regularity via tame a priori estimates for higher regularities and contraction for weaker norms.</description>

      <title>An obstacle approach to rate independent droplet evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a toy model of rate independent droplet motion on a surface with contact angle hysteresis based on the one-phase Bernoulli free boundary problem. We introduce a notion of solutions based on an obstacle problem. These solutions jump ``as late and as little as possible", a physically natural property that energy solutions do not satisfy. When the initial data is star-shaped, we show that obstacle solutions are uniquely characterized by satisfying the local stability and dynamic slope conditions. This is proved via a novel comparison principle, which is one of the main new technical results of the paper. In this setting we can also show the (almost) optimal $C^{1,1/2-}$-spatial regularity of the contact line. This regularity result explains the asymptotic profile of the contact line as it de-pins via tangential motion similar to de-lamination. Finally we apply our comparison principle to show the convergence of minimizing movements schemes to the same obstacle solution, again in the star-shaped setting.</description>

      <title>Sparsity of Fourier mass of passively advected scalars in the Batchelor regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1959, Batchelor gave a prediction for the power spectral density of a passive scalar advected by an incompressible fluid exhibiting shear-straining, a mechanism for the creation of small scales in the scalar [Bat59]. Recently, a `cumulative' version of this law, summing over Fourier modes below a given wavenumber $N$, was given for a broad class of passive scalars under incompressible advection, including by solutions to the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations [BBPS22c].
  This paper addresses to what extent Fourier mass of such passive scalars truly saturates the predicted power law scaling due to Batchelor. Via discrete-time pulsed-diffusion models of the advection-reaction equations, we exhibit situations compatible with the cumulative law but for which the distribution of Fourier mass among wavenumbers $|k| \leq N$ is relatively \emph{sparse} and much smaller than a `mode-wise' version of Batchelor's original prediction. In the same situations we also establish an `exponential radial shell' version of Batchelor's laws via a novel application of the method of spectral distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a CMC hypersurface with an isolated singular point at which the tangent cone is regular, and such that, in a neighbourhood of said point, the hypersurface is the boundary of a Caccioppoli set that minimises the standard prescribed-mean-curvature functional. We prove that in a ball centred at the singularity there exists a sequence of smooth CMC hypersurfaces, with the same prescribed mean curvature, that converge to the given one. Moreover, these hypersurfaces arise as boundaries of minimisers. In ambient dimension $8$ the condition on the cone is redundant. (When the mean curvature vanishes identically, the result is the well-known Hardt--Simon approximation theorem.)</description>

      <title>Zero entropy on entire Grauert tubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a real analytic Riemannian manifold a Grauert tube is an uniquely adapted complex structure defined on the tangent bundle. It is called entire if it may be defined on the whole tangent bundle. Here, we show that the geodesic flow of an analytic manifold with entire Grauert tube has zero topological entropy. Several consequences then follow. We find that Grauert tubes of convex analytic hypersurfaces of ${\bf R}^3$ are generically finite. We give a complete classification of 3-manifolds with entire Grauert tube, showing that these are precisely the 3-manifolds that admit good complexifications. Assuming a manifold has entire Grauert tube, we offer classification statements for several families of smooth 4-manifolds, determine all such simply connected 5-manifolds, and offer new topological restrictions for certain manifolds with infinite fundamental groups. Using these results we present an example of a simply connected and rationally elliptic 5-manifold which nonetheless does not admit any metric with entire Grauert tube.</description>

      <title>Numerical Algorithms for the Reconstruction of Space-Dependent Sources in Thermoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse problems of determining a space-dependent source for thermoelastic systems of type III under adequate time-averaged or final-in-time measurements and conditions on the time-dependent part of the sought source. Several numerical methods are proposed and examined, including a Landweber scheme and minimisation methods for the corresponding cost functionals, which are based on the gradient and conjugate gradient method. A shortcoming of these methods is that the values of the sought source are fixed ab initio and remain fixed during the iterations. The Sobolev gradient method is applied to overcome the possible inaccessibility of the source values at the boundary. Numerical examples are presented to discuss the different approaches and support our findings based on the implementation on the FEniCSx platform.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Approximations of Stochastic Linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation driven by additive Wiener noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we have analyzed semi-discrete finite element approximations of the Stochastic linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in a bounded convex polygonal domain driven by additive Wiener noise. We use the finite element method for spatial discretization and derive an error estimate with respect to the discretization parameter of the finite element approximation. Numerical experiments have also been performed to support theoretical bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study topological lower bounds on the number of small Laplacian eigenvalues on hyperbolic surfaces. We show there exist constants $a,b&gt;0$ such that when $(g+1)&lt;a\frac{n}{\log n}$, any hyperbolic surface of genus-$g$ with $n$ cusps has at least $b\frac{2g+n-2}{\log\left(2g+n-2\right)}$ Laplacian eigenvalues below $\frac{1}{4}$. We also show that, under certain additional constraints on the lengths of short geodesics, the lower bound can be improved to $b\left(2g+n-2\right)$ with the weaker condition $(g+1)&lt;an$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, given a path of Beltrami differentials on $\mathbb C$ that live in and vary holomorphically in the Sobolev space $W^{l,\infty}_{loc}(\Omega)$ of an open subset $\Omega\subset \mathbb C$, the canonical solutions to the Beltrami equation vary holomorphically in $W^{l+1,p}_{loc}(\Omega)$ for admissible $p &gt; 2$. This extends a foundational result of Ahlfors and Bers (the case $l = 0$). As an application, we deduce that Bers metrics on surfaces depend holomorphically on their input data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a class of area-preserving curvature flows of closed planar curves, we prove that every immortal solution becomes asymptotically circular without any additional assumptions on initial data. As a particular corollary, every solution of zero enclosed area blows up in finite time. This settles an open problem posed by Escher--Ito in 2005 for Gage's area-preserving curve shortening flow, and moreover extends it to the surface diffusion flow of arbitrary order. We also establish a general existence theorem for nontrivial immortal solutions under almost circularity and rotational symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture of Donaldson and Segal on the counts of monopoles and special Lagrangians in Calabi-Yau 3-folds, we prove a compactness theorem for Fueter sections of charge 2 monopole bundles over 3-manifolds: Let $u_k$ be a sequence of Fueter sections of the charge 2 monopole bundle over a closed oriented Riemannian 3-manifold $(M,g)$, with $L^\infty$-norm diverging to infinity. Then a renormalized sequence derived from $u_k$ subsequentially converges to a non-zero $\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic 1-form $\mathcal{V}$ on $M$ in the $W^{1,2}$-topology.</description>

      <title>Analytically weak and mild solutions to stochastic heat equation with irregular drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the stochastic heat equation \begin{equation*} \partial_t u_t(x)=\frac12 \partial^2_{xx}u_t(x) +b(u_t(x))+\dot{W}_{t}(x),\quad t\in(0,T],\, x\in [0,1], \end{equation*} where $b$ is a generalized function, and $\dot W$ is space-time white noise on ${\mathbb R}_+\times[0,1]$. If the drift $b$ is a sufficiently regular function, then it is well-known that any analytically weak solution to this equation is also analytically mild, and vice versa. We extend this result to drifts that are generalized functions, with an appropriate adaptation of the notions of mild and weak solutions. As a corollary of our results, we show that for $b\in L_p({\mathbb R})$, $p\ge1$, this equation has a unique analytically weak and mild solution, thus extending the classical results of Gy\"ongy and Pardoux (1993).</description>

      <title>Oppenheimer-Snyder type collapse for a collisionless gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1939, Oppenheimer and Snyder showed that the continued gravitational collapse of a self-gravitating matter distribution can result in the formation of a black hole, cf.~ \cite{OS}. In this paper, which has greatly influenced the evolution of ideas around the concept of a black hole, matter was modeled as dust, a fluid with pressure equal to zero. We prove that when the corresponding initial data are suitably approximated by data for a collisionless gas as modeled by the Vlasov equation, then a trapped surface forms before the corresponding solution to the Einstein-Vlasov system can develop a singularity and again a black hole arises. As opposed to the dust case the pressure does not vanish for such solutions. As a necessary starting point for the analysis, which is carried out in Painlev\'{e}-Gullstrand coordinates, we prove a local existence and uniqueness theorem for regular solutions together with a corresponding extension criterion. The latter result will also become useful when one perturbs dust solutions containing naked singularities in the Vlasov framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method to compute efficiently and with arbitrary precision a basis of harmonic functions with prescribed singularities on a general compact surface of genus two and more. This basis is obtained as a composition of theta functions and the Abel-Jacobi map, which is approximated at spectral speed by complex polynomials. We then implement this method to compute harmonic extensions on genus $2$ surfaces with boundary, that are described by their Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates and a smooth parametrization of the boundary. Finally, we prove the spectral convergence of the method for the harmonic extension.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of fluctuations of discretized SHE and KPZ equations in the subcritical weak disorder regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of discretized versions of the stochastic heat equation (SHE) and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in spatial dimensions $d&gt;2$ in the weak disorder regime. The discretization is defined using the directed polymer model. Previous research has identified the scaling limit of both equations under a suboptimal moment condition and, in particular, it was established that both converge to the same limit in law. We extend this result by showing that the fluctuations of both equations are close in probability in the subcritical weak disorder regime, indicating that they share the same scaling limit (the existence of which remains open). Our result applies under a moment condition that is expected to be valid throughout the interior of the weak disorder phase, which is currently only known under a technical assumption on the environment. We also prove a lower tail concentration of the partition functions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic metastability in the self-attention model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the self-attention model - an interacting particle system on the unit sphere, which serves as a toy model for Transformers, the deep neural network architecture behind the recent successes of large language models. We prove the appearance of dynamic metastability conjectured in [GLPR23] - although particles collapse to a single cluster in infinite time, they remain trapped near a configuration of several clusters for an exponentially long period of time. By leveraging a gradient flow interpretation of the system, we also connect our result to an overarching framework of slow motion of gradient flows proposed by Otto and Reznikoff [OR07] in the context of coarsening and the Allen-Cahn equation. We finally probe the dynamics beyond the exponentially long period of metastability, and illustrate that, under an appropriate time-rescaling, the energy reaches its global maximum in finite time and has a staircase profile, with trajectories manifesting saddle-to-saddle-like behavior, reminiscent of recent works in the analysis of training dynamics via gradient descent for two-layer neural networks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the global well-posedness and scattering of 3D defocusing, cubic Schr\"odinger equation. Recently, Dodson [arXiv:2004.09618] studied the global well-posedness in a critical Sobolev space $\dot{W}^{11/7,7/6}$. In this paper, we aim to show that if the initial data belongs to $\dot H^\frac12$ to guarantee the local existence, then some extra weak space which is subcritical, is sufficient to prove the global well-posedness. More precisely, we prove that if the initial data belongs to $\dot{H}^{1/2}\cap \dot{W}^{s,1}$ for $12/13&lt;s \leqslant 1$, then the corresponding solution exists globally and scatters.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with a variant of the optimal transportation problem. Given f $\in$ L 1 (R d , [0, 1]) and a cost function c $\in$ C(R d x R d) of the form c(x, y) = k(y -- x), we minimise $\int$ c d$\gamma$ among transport plans $\gamma$ whose first marginal is f and whose second marginal is not prescribed but constrained to be smaller than 1 -- f. Denoting by $\Upsilon$(f) the infimum of this problem, we then consider the maximisation problem sup{$\Upsilon$(f) : $\int$ f = m} where m \&amp;gt; 0 is given. We prove that maximisers exist under general assumptions on k, and that for k radial, increasing and coercive these maximisers are the characteristic functions of the balls of volume m.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landau-Coulomb equation is an important model in plasma physics featuring both nonlinear diffusion and reaction terms. In this manuscript we focus on the diffusion operator within the equation by dropping the potentially nefarious reaction term altogether. We show that the diffusion operator in the Landau-Coulomb equation provides a much stronger L^1 to L^\infty rate of regularization than its linear counterpart, the Laplace operator. The result is made possible by a nonlinear functional inequality of Gressman, Krieger, and Strain together with a De Giorgi iteration. This stronger regularization rate illustrates the importance of the nonlinear nature of the diffusion in the analysis of the Landau equation and raises the question of determining whether this rate also happens for the Landau-Coulomb equation itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of divergence-free vector fields on $\mathbb{R}^3$ obtained after a suitable localization of Beltrami fields. First, we use them as initial data to construct unique global smooth solutions of the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. The relevant fact here is that these initial data can be chosen to be large in any critical space for the Navier-Stokes problem, however they satisfy the nonlinear smallness assumption introduced in [10]. As a further application of the method, we use these vector fields to provide analytical example of vortex-reconnection for the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^3$. To do so, we exploit the ideas developed in [14] but differently from this latter we cannot rely on the non-trivial homotopy of the three-dimensional torus. To overcome this obstacle we use a different topological invariant, i.e. the number of hyperbolic critical points of the vector field.</description>

Abstract: We consider a *continuous* solution $u$ of the balance law \[ \partial_{\mathit t} u + \partial_{\mathit x} (f(u)) = g\] in one space dimension, where the flux function $f$ is of class $C^2$ and the source term $g$ is bounded. This equation admits an Eulerian intepretation (namely the distributional one) and a Lagrangian intepretation (which can be further specified). Since $u$ is only continuous, these interpretations do not necessessarily agree; moreover each interpretation naturally entails a different equivalence class for the source term $g$. In this paper we complete the comparison between these notions of solutions started in the companion paper [Alberti-Bianchini-Caravenna I], and analize in detail the relations between the corresponding notions of source term.</description>

      <title>Non-interpenetration of rods derived by $\Gamma$-limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring non-interpenetration of matter is a fundamental prerequisite when modeling the deformation response of solid materials. In this contribution, we thoroughly examine how this requirement, equivalent to the injectivity of deformations within bulk structures, manifests itself in dimensional-reduction problems. Specifically, we focus on the case of rods embedded in a two-dimensional plane. Our results focus on $\Gamma$-limits of energy functionals that enforce an admissible deformation to be a homeomorphism. These $\Gamma$-limits are evaluated along a passage from the bulk configuration to the rod arrangement. The proofs rely on the equivalence between the weak and strong closures of the set of homeomorphisms from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$, a result that is of independent interest and that we establish in this paper, too.</description>

      <title>Propagation of logarithmic regularity and inviscid limit for the 2D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to study the Cauchy problem for the 2D Euler equations under very low regularity assumptions on the initial datum. We prove propagation of regularity of logarithmic order in the class of weak solutions with $L^p$ initial vorticity, provided that $p\geq 4$. We also study the inviscid limit from the 2D Navier-Stokes equations for vorticity with logarithmic regularity in the Yudovich class, showing a rate of convergence of order $|\log\nu|^{-\alpha/2}$ with $\alpha&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>The Massless Dirac Equation in Three Dimensions: Dispersive estimates and zero energy obstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate dispersive estimates for the massless three dimensional Dirac equation with a potential. In particular, we show that the Dirac evolution satisfies a $\langle t\rangle^{-1}$ decay rate as an operator from $L^1$ to $L^\infty$ regardless of the existence of zero energy eigenfunctions. We also show this decay rate may be improved to $\langle t\rangle ^{-1-\gamma}$ for any $0\leq \gamma &lt; 1/2$ at the cost of spatial weights. This estimate, along with the $L^2$ conservation law allows one to deduce a family of Strichartz estimates in the case of a threshold eigenvalue. We classify the structure of threshold obstructions as being composed of zero energy eigenfunctions. Finally, we show the Dirac evolution is bounded for all time with minimal requirements on the decay of the potential and smoothness of initial data.</description>

      <title>Integro-differential diffusion equations on graded Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first study the existence, uniqueness and well-posedness of a general class of integro-differential diffusion equation on $L^p(\mathbb{G})$ $(1&lt;p&lt;+\infty$, $\mathbb{G}$ is a graded Lie group). We show the explicit solution of the considered equation by using the Fourier analysis of the group. The equation involves a nonlocal in time operator (with a general kernel) and a positive Rockland operator acting on $\mathbb{G}.$ Also, we provide $L^p(\mathbb{G})-L^q(\mathbb{G})$ $(1&lt;p\leqslant 2\leqslant q&lt;+\infty)$ norm estimates and time decay rate for the solutions. In fact, by using some contemporary results, one can translate the latter regularity problem to the study of boundedness of its propagator which strongly depends on the traces of the spectral projections of the Rockland operator. Moreover, in many cases, we can obtain time asymptotic decay for the solutions which depends intrinsically on the considered kernel. As a complement, we give some norm estimates for the solutions in terms of a homogeneous Sobolev space in $L^{2}(\mathbb{G})$ that involves the Rockland operator. We also give a counterpart of our results in the setting of compact Lie groups. Illustrative examples are also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Habitat loss, driven primarily by anthropogenic activity, significantly threatens ecosystem sustainability. While it is well understood that habitat loss is the leading contributor to declines in biodiversity worldwide, the connection between habitat degradation, destruction, and different locomotion strategies remains unclear. We use a reaction-diffusion framework to analyze the effects of habitat loss on population persistence and abundance. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an extinction threshold, beyond which further degradation of the environment predicts deterministic extirpation. Our results offer a robust analytical connection between habitat degradation and destruction, providing a mechanistic understanding of species persistence under varying environmental conditions and differing locomotion strategies.</description>

      <title>Singular limit of a chemotaxis model with indirect signal production and phenotype switching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convergence of solutions to a partially diffusive chemotaxis system with indirect signal production and  phenotype switching is shown in a two-dimensional setting when the switching rate increases to infinity, thereby providing a rigorous justification of formal computations performed in the literature. The expected limit system being the classical parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel system, the obtained convergence is restricted to a finite time interval for general initial conditions but valid for arbitrary bounded time intervals when the mass of the initial condition is appropriately small. Furthermore, if the solution to the limit system blows up in finite time, then neither of the two phenotypes in the partially diffusive system can be uniformly bounded with respect to the $L_2$-norm beyond that time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of forward self-similar solutions to the three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic equations (MHD equations) with arbitrarily large self-similar initial data. Using the so called blow-up argument, we establish the necessary a priori estimates. Subsequently, the Leray-Schauder theorem allows us to construct a global-time forward self-similar solutions of the MHD equations. Furthermore, we prove that this solution is smooth in $\R^{3}\times(0,\infty)$.</description>

Abstract: We consider perturbations of the one-dimensional cubic Schr\"odinger equation, of the form $i \, \partial_t \psi + \partial_x^2 \psi + |\psi|^2 \psi + g( |\psi|^2 ) \psi = 0$. Under hypotheses on the function $g$ that can be easily verified in some cases (such as $g(s) = s^\sigma$ with $\sigma &gt;1$), we show that the linearized problem around a small solitary wave presents a unique internal mode. Moreover, under an additional hypothesis (the Fermi golden rule) that can also be verified in the case of powers $g(s) = s^\sigma$, we prove the asymptotic stability of the solitary waves with small frequencies.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove new existence and multiplicity results for critical points of lower semicontinuous functionals in Banach spaces, complementing the nonsmooth critical point theory set forth by Szulkin and avoiding the need of the Palais-Smale condition. We apply our abstract results to get entire solutions with finite energy to Born-Infeld type autonomous equations. More precisely, under almost optimal conditions on the nonlinearity, we construct a positive solution and infinitely many solutions both in the classes of radially symmetric functions and nonradiallly symmetric ones.</description>

Abstract: We study the existence and concentration of positive and nodal solutions to a Schr\"odinger equation in the presence of a shrinking self-focusing core of arbitrary shape. Via a suitable rescaling, the concentration gives rise to a limiting profile that solves a nonautonomous elliptic semilinear equation with a sharp sign change in the nonlinearity. We characterize the (radial or foliated Schwarz) symmetries and the (polynomial) decay of the least-energy positive and nodal limiting profiles.</description>

Abstract: For every given $\beta&lt;0$, we study the problem of maximizing the first Robin eigenvalue of the Laplacian $\lambda_\beta(\Omega)$ among convex (not necessarily smooth) sets $\Omega\subset\mathbb{S}^{n}$ with fixed perimeter. In particular, denoting by $\sigma_n$ the perimeter of the $n$-dimensional hemisphere, we show that for fixed perimeters $P&lt;\sigma_n$, geodesic balls maximize the eigenvalue. Moreover, we prove a quantitative stability result for this isoperimetric inequality in terms of volume difference between $\Omega$ and the ball $D$ of the same perimeter.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider a competitive weakly coupled elliptic system in which each species is attracted to a small region and repelled from its complement. In this setting, we establish the existence of infinitely many solutions and of a nonnegative least energy solution. We show that, as the regions of attraction shrink, least energy solutions of the system concentrate. We study this behavior and characterize their limit profile. In particular, we show that if each component of a least energy solution is attracted to a different region, then the components decouple in the limit, whereas if all the components are attracted to the same region, they remain coupled.</description>

      <title>Radial 3D Focusing Energy Critical INLS equations with defocusing perturbation: Ground states, Scattering, and Blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the following inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with focusing energy critical nonlinearity and a defocusing perturbation in the radial regime, $$
  i \partial_t u +\Delta u =|x|^{-a} |u|^{p-2} u - |x|^{-b} |u|^{4-2b}u \quad \mbox{in} \quad \mathbb{R}_t \times \mathbb{R}_x^3, $$ where $0&lt;a$, $b&lt;2$ and ${ 2+\frac{4-2a}{3}&lt; p\leq 6-2a}$. First, we prove the existence/nonexistence and quantitative properties of ground states. Subsequently, we establish the scattering versus blow-up below the ground-state energy threshold. Our methodology hinges on Tao's scattering criterion and Dodson-Murphy's Virial/Morawetz inequalities.
  An intriguing aspect of our study is the absence of scaling invariance within the equation, attributed to the interplay of the competing inhomogeneous nonlinearities. Moreover, the presence of singular weights serves as a barrier to translation invariance in the spatial variable, adding more complexity to the analysis.
  To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the inaugural exploration of the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a leading-order focusing energy critical inhomogeneous nonlinearity and a defocusing perturbation.</description>

      <title>SBV regularity of Entropy Solutions for Hyperbolic Systems of Balance Laws with General Flux function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that vanishing viscosity solutions to smooth non-degenerate systems of balance laws having small bounded variation, in one space dimension, must be functions of special bounded variation. For more than one equation, this is new also in the case of systems of conservation laws out of the context of genuine nonlinearity. For general smooth strictly hyperbolic systems of balance laws, this regularity fails, as known for systems of balance laws: we generalize the SBV-like regularity of the eigenvalue functions of the Jacobian matrix of flux from conservation to balance laws. Proofs are based on extending Oleinink-type balance estimates, with the introduction of new source measures, localization arguments, and observations in real analysis. Preliminary version.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an area growth estimate for solutions that are bounded from above of the Liouville equation $\Delta u+K e^{2u}=0$ with a positive pinched curvature $0&lt;\lambda\leq K\leq\Lambda$. As an application, we provide a new proof of Eremenko-Gui-Li-Xu's result in [EGLX]. We also classify solutions with an upper bound in the half plane with the boundary having constant geodesic curvature.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures and their limiting behavior of the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation in unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the existence and limiting behavior of invariant measures of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation driven by linear multiplicative noise and additive noise defined in the entire space $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d=1,2$, which describes the phase spins in ferromagnetic materials around the Curie temperature. We first establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions by a domain expansion method. We then prove the existence of invariant measures by the weak Feller argument. In the case $d=1$, we show the uniform tightness of the set of all invariant measures of the stochastic equation, and prove any limit of a sequence of invariant measures of the perturbed equation must be an invariant measure of the limiting system. The cut-off arguments, stopping time techniques and uniform tail-ends estimates of solutions are developed to overcome the difficulty caused by the high-order nonlinearity and the non-compactness of Sobolev embeddings in unbounded domains.</description>

      <title>On the long-time statistical behavior of smooth solutions of the weakly damped, stochastically-driven KdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.12942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the damped periodic Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation in the presence of a white-in-time and spatially smooth stochastic source term and studies the long-time behavior of solutions. We show that the integrals of motion for KdV can be exploited to prove regularity and ergodic properties of invariant measures for damped stochastic KdV. First, by considering non-trivial modifications of the integrals of motion, we establish Lyapunov structure by proving that moments of Sobolev norms of solutions at all orders of regularity are bounded globally-in-time; existence of invariant measures follows as an immediate consequence. Next, we prove a weak Foias-Prodi type estimate for damped stochastic KdV, for which the synchronization occurs in expected value. This estimate plays a crucial role throughout our subsequent analysis. As a first novel application, we combine the Foias-Prodi estimate with the Lyapunov structure to establish that invariant measures are supported on smooth functions provided that the external driving forces are smooth. We then establish ergodic properties of invariant measures, treating the regimes of arbitrary damping and large damping separately. For arbitrary damping, we demonstrate that the framework of `asymptotic coupling' can be implemented for a compact proof of uniqueness of the invariant measure provided that sufficiently many directions in phase space are stochastically forced. Our proof is paradigmatic for SPDEs for which a weak Foias-Prodi type property holds. Lastly, for large damping, we establish the existence of a spectral gap with respect to a Wasserstein-like distance, and exponential mixing and uniqueness of the invariant measure follows.</description>

      <title>Exponential Stability and Design of Sensor Feedback Amplifiers for Fast Stabilization of Magnetizable Piezoelectric Beam Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamic partial differential equation (PDE) model governing longitudinal oscillations in magnetizable piezoelectric beams exhibits exponentially stable solutions when subjected to two boundary state feedback controllers. An analytically established exponential decay rate by the Lyapunov approach ensures stabilization of the system to equilibrium, though the actual decay rate could potentially be improved. The decay rate of the closed-loop system is highly sensitive to the choice of material parameters and the design of the state feedback amplifiers. This paper focuses on investigating the design of state feedback amplifiers to achieve a maximal exponential decay rate, which is essential for effectively suppressing oscillations in these beams. Through this design process, we explicitly determine the safe intervals of feedback amplifiers that ensure the theoretically found maximal decay rate, with the potential for even better rates. Our numerical results reaffirm the robustness of the decay rate within the chosen range of feedback amplifiers, while deviations from this range significantly impact the decay rate. To underscore the validity of our results, we present various numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Independent projections of diffusions: Gradient flows for variational inference and optimal mean field approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What is the optimal way to approximate a high-dimensional diffusion process by one in which the coordinates are independent? This paper presents a construction, called the \emph{independent projection}, which is optimal for two natural criteria. First, when the original diffusion is reversible with invariant measure $\rho_*$, the independent projection serves as the Wasserstein gradient flow for the relative entropy $H(\cdot\,|\,\rho_*)$ constrained to the space of product measures. This is related to recent Langevin-based sampling schemes proposed in the statistical literature on mean field variational inference. In addition, we provide both qualitative and quantitative results on the long-time convergence of the independent projection, with quantitative results in the log-concave case derived via a new variant of the logarithmic Sobolev inequality. Second, among all processes with independent coordinates, the independent projection is shown to exhibit the slowest growth rate of path-space entropy relative to the original diffusion. This sheds new light on the classical McKean-Vlasov equation and recent variants proposed for non-exchangeable systems, which can be viewed as special cases of the independent projection.</description>

      <title>Martingale Suitable Weak Solutions of $3$-D Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations with Vorticity Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct martingale suitable weak solutions for $3$-dimensional incompressible stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with generally non-linear noise. In deterministic setting, as widely known, ``suitable weak solutions'' are Leray-Hopf weak solutions enjoying two different types of local energy inequalities (LEIs). In stochastic setting, we apply the idea of ``martingale solution", avoid transforming to random system, and show new stochastic versions of the two local energy inequalities. In particular, in additive and linear multiplicative noise case, OU-processes and the exponential formulas DO NOT play a role in our formulation of LEIs. This is different to \cite{FR02,Rom10} where the additive noise case is dealt. Also, we successfully apply the concept of ``a.e. super-martingale'' to describe this local energy behavior. For further regularity of solutions, we are able to bound the $L^\infty\big([0,T];L^1(\Omega\times\mathbb T^3)\big)$ norm of the vorticity and $L^{\frac{4}{3+\delta}}\big(\Omega\times[0,T]\times\mathbb T^3\big)$ norm of the gradient of the vorticity, in case that the initial vorticity is a finite regular sign measure.</description>

      <title>A Variational Theory for The Area of Legendrian Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a new notion of critical point for the area of surfaces under the Legendrian constraint, called parametrized Hamiltonian stationary Legendrian varifolds (PHSLVs). We establish several fundamental properties of these objects, including their sequential compactness and an optimal regularity result, showing that they are smooth immersions away from a locally finite set of branch points and Schoen Wolfson conical singularities. This generalizes in particular the regularity theory of Schoen Wolfson for minimizers to general critical points. This theory can be used to show two new variational results: every minmax operation with the area of (closed, immersed) Legendrian surfaces in a closed Sasakian 5-dimensional manifold is achieved by a Hamiltonian stationary map with this regularity; also, the minimal area in any given exact isotopy class of Legendrian immersions of $S^2$ is realized by such a map. Along the way, we prove an effective monotonicity formula for general two-dimensional stationary varifolds in the Legendrian setting, as well as the closure of integral stationary varifolds among rectifiable ones, in spite of the lack of compactness of the latter.</description>

      <title>On Constructions of Fractal Spaces Using Replacement and the Combinatorial Loewner Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combinatorial Loewner property was introduced by Bourdon and Kleiner as a quasisymmetrically invariant substitute for the Loewner property for general fractals and boundaries of hyperbolic groups. While the Loewner property is somewhat restrictive, the combinatorial Loewner property is very generic -- Bourdon and Kleiner showed that many familiar fractals and group boundaries satisfy it. If $X$ is quasisymmetric to a Loewner space, it has the combinatorial Loewner property. Kleiner conjectured in 2006 that the converse to this holds for self-similar fractals -- the hope being that this would lead to the existence of many exotic Loewner spaces. We disprove this conjecture and give the first examples of spaces which are self-similar, combinatorially Loewner and which are not quasisymmetric to Loewner spaces.
  In the process we introduce a self-similar replacement rule, called iterated graph systems (IGS), which is inspired by the work of Laakso. This produces a new rich class of fractal spaces, where closed form computations of potentials and their conformal dimensions are possible. These spaces exhibit a rich class of behaviors from analysis on fractals in regards to diffusions, Sobolev spaces, energy measures and conformal dimensions. These behaviors expand on the known examples of Cantor sets, gaskets, Vicsek sets, and the often too difficult carpet-like spaces. Especially the counterexamples to Kleiner's conjecture that arise from this construction are interesting, since they open up the possibility to study the new realm of combinatorially Loewner spaces that are not quasisymmetric to Loewner spaces.</description>

      <title>The Steklov problem for exterior domains: asymptotic behavior and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of the Steklov problem for the modified Helmholtz equation $(p-\Delta) u = 0$ in the exterior of a compact set, for which the positive parameter $p$ ensures exponential decay of the Steklov eigenfunctions at infinity. We obtain the small-$p$ asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and discuss their features for different space dimensions. These results find immediate applications to the theory of stochastic processes and unveil the long-time asymptotic behavior of probability densities of various first-passage times in exterior domains. Theoretical results are validated by solving the exterior Steklov problem by a finite-element method with a transparent boundary condition.</description>

      <title>On the convergence rate of a numerical method for the Hunter-Saxton equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a robust error estimate for a recently proposed numerical method for $\alpha$-dissipative solutions of the Hunter-Saxton equation, where $\alpha \in [0, 1]$. In particular, if the following two conditions hold: i) there exist a constant $C &gt; 0$ and $\beta \in (0, 1]$ such that the initial spatial derivative $\bar{u}_{x}$ satisfies $\|\bar{u}_x(\cdot + h) - \bar{u}_x(\cdot)\|_2 \leq Ch^{\beta}$ for all $h \in (0, 2]$, and ii), the singular continuous part of the initial energy measure is zero, then the numerical wave profile converges with order $O(\Delta x^{\frac{\beta}{8}})$ in $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$.
  Moreover, if $\alpha=0$, then the rate improves to $O(\Delta x^{\frac{1}{4}})$ without the above assumptions, and we also obtain a convergence rate for the associated energy measure - it converges with order $O(\Delta x^{\frac{1}{2}})$ in the bounded Lipschitz metric. These convergence rates are illustrated by several examples.</description>
