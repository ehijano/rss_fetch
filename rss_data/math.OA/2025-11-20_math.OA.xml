      <title>Some Results on Bichon's Quantum Automorphism Group of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of the quantum automorphism group of a graph was introduced by J. Bichon in 2003 and T. Banica in 2005 respectively. This article explores primarily the quantum automorphism group of a graph $\Gamma$, denoted by $QAut_{Bic}(\Gamma)$, in Bichon's framework. First, we provide a sufficient condition for non-commutativity of Bichon's quantum automorphism group and discuss several applications of this criterion. Although it is known that $QAut_{Bic}(\Gamma) \cong QAut_{Bic}(\Gamma^c)$ does not hold in general, we identify a family of graphs for which this isomorphism enforces that the graph has no quantum symmetry. Moreover, we describe a few families of graphs having quantum symmetries whose quantum automorphism groups in Bichon's sense are commutative. Finally, we show that free product, tensor product and free wreath product constructions can arise as Bichon's quantum automorphism groups of connected graphs in the following sense: For a finite family of compact matrix quantum groups $\{Q_i\}_{i=1}^{m}$ arising as Bichon's quantum automorphism groups of certain graphs, there exist connected graphs $\Gamma_{free}$, $\Gamma_{ten}$ and $\Gamma_{wr}$ whose quantum automorphism groups are $*_{i=1}^{m} Q_{i}$, $\otimes_{i=1}^{m} Q_i$ and $Q_1 \wr_{*} Q_2$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Tracially lyriform $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metric Choquet simplices are special kinds of compact quantum metric spaces designed for distance measurement in and around the category of stably finite Elliott-classifiable $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras. The primary objective of this article is to introduce versions of these structures for which the associated tracial metrics need not be induced by Lipschitz seminorms and may induce strictly stronger topologies than the weak$^*$-topology. The resulting category of 'tracially lyriform $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras' behaves well with respect to sequential inductive limits and accommodates the full family of classical $p$-Wasserstein metrics on probability spaces, including $p=\infty$. Examples of projectionless, classifiable tracial Wasserstein spaces are built as noncommutative spaces of observables of certain compact length spaces, including: fractals like the Sierpi\'nski gasket, the Sierpi\'nski carpet and the Menger sponge; finite-dimensional Alexandrov spaces with two-sided curvature bounds; and metric spaces like simplicial spheres and balls that are Lipschitz equivalent to Riemannian. These simplicial structures are used as building blocks that furnish arbitrary simple inductive limits of prime dimension drop algebras with tracial lyriform structure. Appealing to optimal transport theory, we study the geometry and statistics of the spaces of embeddings of these building blocks and their limits into suitable classifiable $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras like the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$ or the universal UHF algebra $\mathcal{Q}$.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric noncommutative torus has vanishing Einstein tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explicitly compute the spectral metric, torsion and Einstein tensors for a nontrivial spectral triple on a noncommutative torus, with the Dirac operator related to the fully equivariant Dirac by a partial conformal rescaling (as introduced in [1]). The results show that the spectral triple has vanishing torsion and the Einstein tensor also identically vanishes.</description>

      <title>Hyperreflexivity of von Neumann algebras and similarity of finitely generated $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a $C^*$-algebra. We say that $A$ satisfies the SP if every bounded homomorphism $A\to B(K)$, with $K$ a Hilbert space, is similar to a $*$-homomorphism. We introduce three hypotheses that relate to extending hyperreflexive algebras by projections. We prove that our third hypothesis is equivalent to every finitely generated C*-algebra satisfying the SP.
  We show that to prove that every von Neumann algebra is hyperreflexive it is enough to show that when one extends a hyperreflexive algebra by a single projection it remains hyperreflexive.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-spectral triples and $p$-quantum compact metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $p \in [1, \infty)$, we generalize the concept of classical spectral triples by extending the framework from Hilbert spaces to $L^p$-spaces, and from C*-algebras to $L^p$-operator algebras. In addition, we define an $L^p$-spectral triple to be metric when the state space of the algebra has a $p$-quantum compact metric space structure. Specifically, we construct $L^p$-spectral triples for reduced $L^p$-group algebras of discrete groups with proper length functions and also for $L^p$ UHF-algebras of infinite tensor product type, the latter inspired by E.\ Christensen and C.\ Ivan's construction of a Dirac operator on AF C*-algebras. We prove that $L^p$-spectral triples associated with $L^p$-group algebras (provided that the length function is of bounded doubling) and those associated with $L^p$ UHF-algebras are always metric.</description>
