      <title>Resource Allocation under the Latin Square Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Latin square is an $n \times n$ matrix filled with $n$ distinct symbols, each of which appears exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. We introduce a problem of allocating $n$ indivisible items among $n$ agents over $n$ rounds while satisfying the Latin square constraint. This constraint ensures that each agent receives no more than one item per round and receives each item at most once. Each agent has an additive valuation on the item--round pairs. Real-world applications like scheduling, resource management, and experimental design require the Latin square constraint to satisfy fairness or balancedness in allocation. Our goal is to find a partial or complete allocation that maximizes the sum of the agents' valuations (utilitarian social welfare) or the minimum of the agents' valuations (egalitarian social welfare). For the problem of maximizing utilitarian social welfare, we prove NP-hardness even when the valuations are binary additive. We then provide $(1-1/e)$ and $(1-1/e)/4$-approximation algorithms for partial and complete settings, respectively. Additionally, we present fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms with respect to the order of Latin square and the optimum value for both partial and complete settings. For the problem of maximizing egalitarian social welfare, we establish that deciding whether the optimum value is at most $1$ or at least $2$ is NP-hard for both the partial and complete settings, even when the valuations are binary. Furthermore, we demonstrate that checking the existence of a complete allocation that satisfies each of envy-free, proportional, equitable, envy-free up to any good, proportional up to any good, or equitable up to any good is NP-hard, even when the valuations are identical.</description>

      <title>Equitable Allocations of Mixtures of Goods and Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equitable allocation of indivisible items involves partitioning the items among agents such that everyone derives (almost) equal utility. We consider the approximate notion of equitability up to one item (EQ1) and focus on the settings containing mixtures of items (goods and chores), where an agent may derive positive, negative, or zero utility from an item. We first show that -- in stark contrast to the goods-only and chores-only settings -- an EQ1 allocation may not exist even for additive $\{-1,1\}$ bivalued instances, and its corresponding decision problem is computationally intractable. We focus on a natural domain of normalized valuations where the value of the entire set of items is constant for all agents. On the algorithmic side, we show that an EQ1 allocation can be computed efficiently for (i) $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ normalized valuations, (ii) objective but non-normalized valuations, (iii) two agents with type-normalized valuations. We complement our study by providing a comprehensive picture of achieving EQ1 allocations under normalized valuations in conjunction with economic efficiency notions such as Pareto optimality and social welfare.</description>

      <title>Banzhaf Power in Hierarchical Voting Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Banzhaf Power Index (BPI) is a method of measuring the power of voters in determining the outcome of a voting game. Some voting games exhibit a hierarchical structure, including the US electoral college and ensemble learning methods; we call such games hierarchical voting games. It is generally understood that BPI in hierarchical voting games can be computed via a recursive decomposition of the hierarchy, which can substantially reduce the calculation's complexity. We identify a key (previously undocumented) assumption on which this decomposition is based, namely balance, meaning one group of voters has enough votes to win whenever the complementary group of voters does not, and vice versa. We then introduce a generalization of BPI that we call Extended BPI (EBPI) for all voting games, including those that are not balanced, which simplifies to BPI in balanced games. We show that BPI in unbalanced hierarchical voting games decomposes in terms of EBPI at each level in the hierarchy, which yields computational savings analogous to those achieved in the balanced case. As a sample application, we take advantage of the compositionality of language, and model the impact of individual words on a sentence's sentiment as a voting game. As the complement of a phrase in a sentence does not necessarily have the opposite sentiment, this voting game is unbalanced and requires our decomposition of BPI in terms of EBPI. Our results suggest that EBPI is an effective proxy for BPI (because the meaning of a sentence is not always 100\% compositional), and demonstrate a dramatic improvement in run time.</description>

      <title>Optimal Online Bookmaking for Binary Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In online betting, the bookmaker can update the payoffs it offers on a particular event many times before the event takes place, and the updated payoffs may depend on the bets accumulated thus far. We study the problem of bookmaking with the goal of maximizing the return in the worst-case, with respect to the gamblers' behavior and the event's outcome. We formalize this problem as the \emph{Optimal Online Bookmaking game}, and provide the exact solution for the binary case. To this end, we develop the optimal bookmaking strategy, which relies on a new technique called bi-balancing trees, that assures that the house loss is the same for all \emph{decisive} betting sequences, where the gambler bets all its money on a single outcome in each round.</description>

      <title>Improved Regret Bounds for Online Fair Division with Bandit Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study online fair division when there are a finite number of item types and the player values for the items are drawn randomly from distributions with unknown means. In this setting, a sequence of indivisible items arrives according to a random online process, and each item must be allocated to a single player. The goal is to maximize expected social welfare while maintaining that the allocation satisfies proportionality in expectation. When player values are normalized, we show that it is possible to with high probability guarantee proportionality constraint satisfaction and achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. To achieve this result, we present an upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm that uses two rounds of linear optimization. This algorithm highlights fundamental aspects of proportionality constraints that allow for a UCB algorithm despite the presence of many (potentially tight) constraints. This result improves upon the previous best regret rate of $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$.</description>

      <title>Simplifications to Guide Monte Carlo Tree Search in Combinatorial Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a type of modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for strategising in combinatorial games. The modifications are derived by analysing simplified strategies and simplified versions of the underlying game and then using the results to construct an ensemble-type strategy. We present some instances where relative algorithm performance can be predicted from the results in the simplifications, making the approach useful as a heuristic for developing strategies in highly complex games, especially when simulation-type strategies and comparative analyses are largely intractable.</description>

      <title>On Stability and Learning of Competitive Equilibrium in Generalized Fisher Market Models: A Variational Inequality Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a generalized Fisher market model that incorporates social influence. In this extended model, a buyer's utility depends not only on their own resource allocation but also on the allocations received by their competitors. We propose a novel competitive equilibrium formulation for this generalized Fisher market using a variational inequality approach. This framework effectively captures competitive equilibrium in markets that extend beyond the traditional assumption of homogeneous utility functions. We analyze key structural properties of the proposed variational inequality problem, including monotonicity, stability, and uniqueness. Additionally, we present two decentralized learning algorithms for buyers to achieve competitive equilibrium: a two-timescale stochastic approximation-based t{\^a}tonnement method and a trading-post mechanism-based learning method. Finally, we validate the proposed algorithms through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>CAMs as Shapley Value-based Explainers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely used to visualize neural network decisions, yet their underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. To enhance the understanding of CAM methods and improve their explainability, we introduce the Content Reserved Game-theoretic (CRG) Explainer. This theoretical framework clarifies the theoretical foundations of GradCAM and HiResCAM by modeling the neural network prediction process as a cooperative game. Within this framework, we develop ShapleyCAM, a new method that leverages gradients and the Hessian matrix to provide more precise and theoretically grounded visual explanations. Due to the computational infeasibility of exact Shapley value calculation, ShapleyCAM employs a second-order Taylor expansion of the cooperative game's utility function to derive a closed-form expression. Additionally, we propose the Residual Softmax Target-Class (ReST) utility function to address the limitations of pre-softmax and post-softmax scores. Extensive experiments across 12 popular networks on the ImageNet validation set demonstrate the effectiveness of ShapleyCAM and its variants. Our findings not only advance CAM explainability but also bridge the gap between heuristic-driven CAM methods and compute-intensive Shapley value-based methods. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/caihuaiguang/pytorch-shapley-cam}.</description>

      <title>Combined effect of incentives and coupling in multigames in two-layer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of cooperation can easily result in inequality among members of a society, which provides an increasing gap between individual incomes. To tackle this issue, we introduce an incentive mechanism based on individual strategies and incomes, wherein a portion of the income from defectors is allocated to reward low-income cooperators, aiming to enhance cooperation by improving the equitable distribution of wealth across the entire population. Moreover, previous research has typically employed network structures or game mechanisms characterized by homogeneity. In this study, we present a network framework that more accurately reflects real-world conditions, where agents are engaged in multiple games, including prisoner's dilemma games in the top-layer and public good games in the down-layer networks. Within this framework, we introduce the concept of ``external coupling'' which connects agents across different networks as acquaintances, thereby facilitating access to shared datasets. Our results indicate that the combined positive effects of external coupling and incentive mechanism lead to optimal cooperation rates and lower Gini coefficients, demonstrating a negative correlation between cooperation and inequality. From a micro-level perspective, this phenomenon primarily arises from the regular network, whereas suboptimal outcomes are observed within the scale-free network. These observations help to give a deeper insight into the interplay between cooperation and wealth disparity in evolutionary games in large populations.</description>

      <title>Contiguous Allocation of Indivisible Items on a Path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of allocating indivisible items on a path among agents. The objective is to find a fair and efficient allocation in which each agent's bundle forms a contiguous block on the line. We say that an instance is \emph{$(a, b)$-sparse} if each agent values at most $a$ items positively and each item is valued positively by at most $b$ agents. We demonstrate that, even when the valuations are binary additive, deciding whether every item can be allocated to an agent who wants it is NP-complete for the $(4,3)$-sparse instances. Consequently, we provide two fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for maximizing utilitarian social welfare, with respect to the number of agents and the number of items. Additionally, we present a $2$-approximation algorithm for the special case when the valuations are binary additive, and the maximum utility is equal to the number of items. Also, we provide a $1/a$-approximation algorithm for the $(a,b)$-sparse instances. Furthermore, we establish that deciding whether the maximum egalitarian social welfare is at least $2$ or at most $1$ is NP-complete for the $(6,3)$-sparse instances, even when the valuations are binary additive. We present a $1/a$-approximation algorithm for maximizing egalitarian social welfare for the $(a,b)$-sparse instances. Besides, we give two FPT algorithms for maximizing egalitarian social welfare in terms of the number of agents and the number of items. We also explore the case where the order of the blocks of items allocated to the agents is predetermined. In this case, we show that both maximum utilitarian social welfare and egalitarian social welfare can be computed in polynomial time. However, we determine that checking the existence of an EF1 allocation is NP-complete, even when the valuations are binary additive.</description>

      <title>Multi-Apartment Rent Division</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rent division is the well-studied problem of fairly assigning rooms and dividing rent among a set of roommates within a single apartment. A shortcoming of existing solutions is that renters are assumed to be considering apartments in isolation, whereas in reality, renters can choose among multiple apartments. In this paper, we generalize the rent division problem to the multi-apartment setting, where the goal is to both fairly choose an apartment among a set of alternatives and fairly assign rooms and rents within the chosen apartment. Our main contribution is a generalization of envy-freeness called negotiated envy-freeness. We show that a solution satisfying negotiated envy-freeness is guaranteed to exist and that it is possible to optimize over all negotiated envy-free solutions in polynomial time. We also define an even stronger fairness notion called universal envy-freeness and study its existence when values are drawn randomly.</description>

      <title>Strategic Network Creation for Enabling Greedy Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today we rely on networks that are created and maintained by smart devices. For such networks, there is no governing central authority but instead the network structure is shaped by the decisions of selfish intelligent agents. A key property of such communication networks is that they should be easy to navigate for routing data. For this, a common approach is greedy routing, where every device simply routes data to a neighbor that is closer to the respective destination.
  Networks of intelligent agents can be analyzed via a game-theoretic approach and in the last decades many variants of network creation games have been proposed and analyzed. In this paper we present the first game-theoretic network creation model that incorporates greedy routing, i.e., the strategic agents in our model are embedded in some metric space and strive for creating a network among themselves where all-pairs greedy routing is enabled. Besides this, the agents optimize their connection quality within the created network by aiming for greedy routing paths with low stretch.
  For our model, we analyze the existence of (approximate)-equilibria and the computational hardness in different underlying metric spaces. E.g., we characterize the set of equilibria in 1-2-metrics and tree metrics and show that Nash equilibria always exist. For Euclidean space, the setting which is most relevant in practice, we prove that equilibria are not guaranteed to exist but that the well-known $\Theta$-graph construction yields networks having a low stretch that are game-theoretically almost stable. For general metric spaces, we show that approximate equilibria exist where the approximation factor depends on the cost of maintaining any link.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Stable Matches in Decentralized Markets with Unknown Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04669v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matching algorithms have demonstrated great success in several practical applications, but they often require centralized coordination and plentiful information. In many modern online marketplaces, agents must independently seek out and match with another using little to no information. For these kinds of settings, can we design decentralized, limited-information matching algorithms that preserve the desirable properties of standard centralized techniques? In this work, we constructively answer this question in the affirmative. We model a two-sided matching market as a game consisting of two disjoint sets of agents, referred to as proposers and acceptors, each of whom seeks to match with their most preferable partner on the opposite side of the market. However, each proposer has no knowledge of their own preferences, so they must learn their preferences while forming matches in the market. We present a simple online learning rule that guarantees a strong notion of probabilistic convergence to the welfare-maximizing equilibrium of the game, referred to as the proposer-optimal stable match. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first completely decoupled, communication-free algorithm that guarantees probabilistic convergence to an optimal stable match, irrespective of the structure of the matching market.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Envy-free and Exchange-stable Seat Arrangement Problems on Grid Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Seat Arrangement Problem is a problem of finding a desirable seat arrangement for given preferences of agents and a seat graph that represents a configuration of seats. In this paper, we consider decision problems of determining if an envy-free arrangement exists and an exchange-stable arrangement exists, when a seat graph is an $\ell \times m$ grid graph. When $\ell=1$, the seat graph is a path of length $m$ and both problems have been known to be NP-complete. In this paper, we extend it and show that both problems are NP-complete for any integer $\ell \geq 2$.</description>
