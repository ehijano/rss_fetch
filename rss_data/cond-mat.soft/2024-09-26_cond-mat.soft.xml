      <title>Universality of Dynamic and Thermodynamic Behavior of Polymers near their Glass Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing the dynamics and thermodynamics of amorphous materials near the glass transition is a major challenge in soft-matter physics and polymer engineering. The relaxation time changes many orders of magnitude as the temperature approaches the glass transition, Tg. The glass transition, in turn, depends on the cooling rate (in DSC or dilatometry experiments) and the pressure. While there are several empirical rules relating the thermal expansion, density, relaxation time, temperature, and pressure (Boyer-Spencer, Simha-Boyer, and the Casalini-Roland thermodynamical scaling), there has been no unified theoretical model linking them together. Here, we apply the principle of corresponding states within the dynamic Sanchez-Lacombe two-state, two-(time)scale (SL-TS2) theory to derive a universal polymer equation of state (EoS). The proposed EoS describes the alpha-relaxation time (dynamic EoS) and specific volume of amorphous polymers (volume EoS) using five material parameters - dynamic fragility (m), glass transition temperature, elementary relaxation time, bulk modulus, and specific volume at the glass transition point. The model is compared to experimental data for nine amorphous polymers with varying values of Tg and m, and a good qualitative and quantitative agreement is found. The new EoS could serve as a bridge to connect experimental data (measured at low cooling rates) with computer simulations (done at very high cooling rates).</description>

      <title>Fatigue failure in glasses under cyclic shear deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solids subjected to repeated cycles of stress or deformation can fail after several cycles, a phenomenon termed fatigue failure. Although intensely investigated for a wide range of materials owing to its obvious practical importance, a microscopic understanding of the initiation of fatigue failure continues to be actively pursued, in particular for soft and amorphous materials. We investigate fatigue failure for glasses subjected to cyclic shear deformation through computer simulations. We show that, approaching the so-called fatigue limit, failure times display a power law divergence, at variance with commonly used functional forms, and exhibit strong dependence on the degree of annealing of the glasses. We explore several measures of damage, based on quantification of plastic rearrangements and on dissipated energy. Strikingly, the fraction of particles that undergo plastic rearrangements, and a percolation transition they undergo, are predictive of failure. We also find a robust power law relationship between accumulated damage, quantified by dissipated energy or non-affine displacements, and the failure times, which permits prediction of failure times based on behavior in the initial cycles. These observations reveal salient new microscopic features of fatigue failure and suggest approaches for developing a full microscopic picture of fatigue failure in amorphous solids.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Conformations and Dynamics of Active Block Copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous distribution of passive and active domains in the chromosome plays a crucial role for its dynamic organization within the cell nucleus. Motivated by that here we investigate the steady-state conformation and dynamics of a model active-block copolymer using numerical simulations. Our results show that depending on the relative arrangements of the active and passive blocks, the polymer shows an unusual swelling, even larger than the corresponding fully active polymer. On the one hand, the dynamics of the full polymer show usual enhanced diffusion and Rouse-like scaling behavior. On the other hand, individual passive and active blocks show anomalous transient super- and sub-diffusive dynamics. We characterize this anomalous dynamics in terms of the dependence of a generalized diffusion constant with the polymer length and activity strength.</description>

      <title>Nature of the activity-mediated unjamming transition in confluent cell monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activity-mediated unjamming transition in confluent systems is crucial for embryogenesis, wound healing, cancer metastasis, etc. During these processes, the cells progressively change their junction properties, characterized by an interaction parameter $p_0$, and become motile. How does activity affect this unjamming transition? Using molecular dynamics simulations of the active Vertex model and analytical mode-coupling theory (MCT), we show that the nature of the transition in the presence of activity remains similar to that in equilibrium. The agreement of the simulation results with the MCT predictions demonstrates that the structure-dynamics feedback mechanism controls the relaxation dynamics. In addition, we present the first computation of a dynamic length scale, $\xi_d$, and show that the growing relaxation time accompanies an increasing $\xi_d$. Furthermore, unlike particulate glasses, the static length is proportional to $\xi_d$. Our results highlight the unique nature of the glassy dynamics in confluent systems and rationalize the existing experimental data.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic statistical regularity of topological charges revealed in dynamical disk model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying ordered structures hidden in the packings of particles is a common scientific question in multiple fields. In this work, we investigate the dynamical organizations of a large number of initially randomly packed repulsive particles confined on a disk under the Hamiltonian dynamics by the recently developed algorithm called the random batch method. This algorithm is specifically designed for reducing the computational complexity of long-range interacting particle systems. We highlight the revealed intrinsic statistical regularity of topological charges that is otherwise unattainable by the continuum analysis of particle density. We also identify distinct collective dynamics of the interacting particles under short- and long-range repulsive forces. This work shows the robustness and effectiveness of the concept of topological charge for characterizing the convoluted particle dynamics, and demonstrates the promising potential of the random batch method for exploring fundamental scientific questions arising in a variety of long-range interacting particle systems in soft matter physics and other relevant fields.</description>

      <title>Identifying Bridges from Asymmetric Load-Bearing Structures in Tapped Granular Packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using high-resolution x-ray tomography, we experimentally investigate the bridge structures in tapped granular packings composed of particles with varying friction coefficients. We find that gravity can induce subtle structural changes on the load-bearing contacts, allowing us to identify the correct load-bearing contacts based on structural information alone. Using these identified load-bearing contacts, we investigate the cooperative bridge structures which are mechanical backbones of the system. We characterize the geometric properties of these bridges and find that their cooperativity increases as the packing fraction decreases. The knowledge of bridges can enhance our understanding of the rheological properties of granular materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model for a colloidal heat engine driven by a feedback protocol that is able to fully convert the net heat absorbed by the hot bath into extracted work. The feedback protocol, inspired by gambling strategies, executes a sudden quench at zero work cost when the particle position satisfies a specific first-passage condition. As a result, the engine enhances both power and efficiency with respect to a standard Carnot cycle, surpassing Carnot's efficiency at maximum power. Using first-passage and martingale theory, we derive analytical expressions for the power and efficiency far beyond the quasistatic limit and provide scaling arguments for their dependency with the cycle duration. Numerical simulations are in perfect agreement with our theoretical findings, and illustrate the impact of the data acquisition rate on the engine's performance.</description>

      <title>Measuring Entanglement by Exploiting its Anti-symmetric Nature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in experimental quantum sciences, measuring entanglement entropy remains challenging. Through a geometric perspective, we reveal the intrinsic anti-symmetric nature of entanglement. We prove that most entanglement measures, such as von Neumann and Renyi entropies, can be expressed in terms of exterior products, which are fundamentally anti-symmetric. Leveraging this, we propose utilizing the anti-symmetric nature of fermions to measure entanglement entropy efficiently, offering a resource-efficient approach to probing bipartite entanglement.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Geared Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of mechanical machines is critical for advancing nanotechnology and reducing device footprints. Traditional efforts to downsize gears and micromotors have faced limitations at around 0.1 mm for over thirty years due to the complexities of constructing drives and coupling systems at such scales. Here, we present an alternative approach utilizing optical metasurfaces to locally drive microscopic machines, which can then be fabricated using standard lithography techniques and seamlessly integrated on the chip, achieving sizes down to tens of micrometers with movements precise to the sub-micrometer scale. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate the construction of microscopic gear trains powered by a single driving gear with a metasurface activated by a plane light wave. Additionally, we develop a versatile pinion and rack micromachine capable of transducing rotational motion, performing periodic motion, and controlling microscopic mirrors for light deflection. Our on-chip fabrication process allows for straightforward parallelization and integration. Using light as a widely available and easily controllable energy source, these miniaturized metamachines offer precise control and movement, unlocking new possibilities for micro- and nanoscale systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the existence of capillary waves propagating along the boundary between miscible co-flowing fluids. We unveil that the interplay between transient interfacial stresses and confinement drives the progressive transition from the well-known inertial regime, characterized by a wavenumber independent of frequency, $k\sim\omega^{0}$, to an unexpected capillary-wave scaling, $k\sim\omega^{2/3}$. This allows us to measure the effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids and its rapid decay on time scales never probed so far, which we rationalize with a model going beyond square gradient theories.</description>

      <title>Microscopic description of the intermittent dynamics driving logarithmic creep</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered materials under an imposed forcing can display creep and aging effects, accompanied by intermittent, spatially heterogeneous dynamics. We propose a unifying microscopic description of these phenomena, based on the notion that as the system ages, the density of local barriers that enable relaxation displays a slowly evolving gap. As a result, the relaxation dynamics is dominated by the activation of the lowest, extremal tail of the distribution. This framework predicts logarithmic creep, as well as correlated bursts of slow activated rearrangements, or 'thermal avalanches', whose size grows logarithmically with their duration. The time interval between events within avalanches obeys a universal power-law distribution, with a cut-off that is simply proportional to the age of the system. We show that these predictions hold both in numerical models of amorphous solids, as well as in experiments with thin crumpled sheets. This analysis suggests that the heterogeneous dynamics occurring during logarithmic creep is related to other phenomena, including dynamical heterogeneities characterising the glass transition.</description>

      <title>Small Leidenfrost droplet dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An isolated Leidenfrost droplet levitating over its own vapor above a superheated flat substrate is considered theoretically, the superheating for water being up to several hundred degrees above the boiling temperature. The focus is on the limit of small, practically spherical droplets of several tens of micrometers or less. This may occur when the liquid is sprayed over a hot substrate, or just be a late life stage of an initially large Leidenfrost droplet. A rigorous numerically-assisted analysis is carried out within verifiable assumptions such as quasi-stationarities and small Reynolds/P\'{e}clet numbers. It is considered that the droplet is surrounded by its pure vapor. Simple fitting formulas of our numerical data for the forces and evaporation rates are preliminarily obtained, all respecting the asymptotic behaviors (also investigated) in the limits of small and large levitation heights. They are subsequently used within a system of ODEs to study the droplet dynamics and take-off (drastic height increase as the droplet vaporizes). A previously known quasi-stationary inverse-square root law for the droplet height as a function of its radius (at the root of the take-off) is recovered, although we point out different prefactors in the two limits. Deviations of a dynamic nature therefrom are uncovered as the droplet radius further decreases due to evaporation, improving the agreement with experiment. Furthermore, we reveal that, if initially large enough, the droplets vanish at a universal finite height (just dependent on the superheat and fluid properties). Scalings in various distinguished cases are obtained in the way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unraveling the connections between microscopic structure, emergent physical properties, and slow dynamics has long been a challenge when studying the glass transition. The absence of clear visible structural order in amorphous configurations complicates the identification of the key physical mechanisms underpinning slow dynamics. The difficulty in sampling equilibrated configurations at low temperatures hampers thorough numerical and theoretical investigations. This perspective article explores the potential of machine learning (ML) techniques to face these challenges, building on the algorithms that have revolutionized computer vision and image recognition. We present recent successful ML applications, as well as many open problems for the future, such as transferability and interpretability of ML approaches. We highlight new ideas and directions in which ML could provide breakthroughs to better understand the fundamental mechanisms at play in glass-forming liquids. To foster a collaborative community effort, this article also introduces the ``GlassBench" dataset, providing simulation data and benchmarks for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional glass-formers. We propose critical metrics to compare the performance of emerging ML methodologies, in line with benchmarking practices in image and text recognition. The goal of this roadmap is to provide guidelines for the development of ML techniques in systems displaying slow dynamics, while inspiring new directions to improve our theoretical understanding of glassy liquids.</description>

      <title>Modified Debye-H\"uckel-Onsager Theory for Electrical Conductivity in Aqueous Electrolyte Solutions. Account of Ionic Charge Nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper presents a mean field theory of electrolyte solutions, extending the classical Debye-H\"{u}ckel-Onsager theory to provide a detailed description of the electrical conductivity in strong electrolyte solutions. The theory systematically incorporates the effects of ion specificity, such as steric interactions, hydration of ions, and their spatial charge distributions, into the mean-field framework. This allows for calculation of ion mobility and electrical conductivity, while accounting for relaxation and hydrodynamic phenomena. At low concentrations, the model reproduces the well-known Kohlrausch's limiting law. Using the exponential (Slater-type) charge distribution function for solvated ions, we demonstrate that experimental data on the electrical conductivity of aqueous 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 electrolyte solutions can be approximated over a broad concentration range by adjusting a single free parameter representing the spatial scale of the nonlocal ion charge distribution. Using the fitted value of this parameter at 298.15 K, we obtain good agreement with available experimental data when calculating the electrical conductivity across different temperatures. We also analyze the effects of temperature and electrolyte concentration on the relaxation and electrophoretic contributions to total electrical conductivity, explaining the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the observed behavior.</description>

      <title>Understanding Dynamics in Coarse-Grained Models: IV. Connection of Fine-Grained and Coarse-Grained Dynamics with the Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye Relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying an excess entropy scaling formalism to the coarse-grained (CG) dynamics of liquids, we discovered that missing rotational motions during the CG process are responsible for artificially accelerated CG dynamics. In the context of the dynamic representability between the fine-grained (FG) and CG dynamics, this work introduces the well-known Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations to unravel the rotational dynamics underlying FG trajectories, thereby allowing for an indirect evaluation of the effective rotations based only on the translational information at the reduced CG resolution. Since the representability issue in CG modeling limits a direct evaluation of the shear stress appearing in the Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations, we introduce a translational relaxation time as a proxy to employ these relations, and we demonstrate that these relations hold for the ambient conditions studied in our series of work. Additional theoretical links to our previous work are also established. First, we demonstrate that the effective hard sphere radius determined by the classical perturbation theory can approximate the complex hydrodynamic radius value reasonably well. Also, we present a simple derivation of an excess entropy scaling relationship for viscosity by estimating the elliptical integral of molecules. In turn, since the translational and rotational motions at the FG level are correlated to each other, we conclude that the "entropy-free" CG diffusion only depends on the shape of the reference molecule. Our results and analyses impart an alternative way of recovering the FG diffusion from the CG description by coupling the translational and rotational motions at the hydrodynamic level.</description>
