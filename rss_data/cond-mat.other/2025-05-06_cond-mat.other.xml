      <title>Role of Noise on Defect Formation and Correlations in a Long-Range Ising Model Under Adiabatic Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an exactly solvable long-range (LR) transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with a power-law decaying interaction characterized by a decay exponent {\alpha}. In the thermodynamic limit, the system is adiabatically driven in the presence of noise, from a paramagnetic phase with all spins down to one with all spins up. Our study examines the role of long-range interactions on the defect density, its distribution, and spin correlations, comparing noisy and noiseless scenarios. In the noiseless case, within the long-range regime, the steady-state properties are primarily influenced by modes near the k = {\pi} region. However, in the presence of noise, the dominant contributions shift to the modes near k = 0. This differs from the SR model, where previous studies have shown that modes around k = {\pi}/2 play a significant role under noisy conditions. In the absence of noise, defect density scales as $n\propto \tau_Q^{-1/2}$, implying scaling exponent independent of decay exponent. However, we find that decreasing the value of {\alpha} (i.e., increasing the range) enhances the defect density, whereas in the presence of noise, it is suppressed. In the LR regime, two-point fermionic correlators initially exhibit Gaussian decay, followed by quadratic suppression instead of power-law decay for both noisy and noiseless scenarios. Meanwhile, spin correlators, expressed as a string of fermionic operators, undergo purely exponential decay with no crossover behavior. Furthermore, our analysis of defect formation reveals the influence of LR interaction on the kink-number distribution and its cumulants.</description>

      <title>Simple scaling rules governing work functions of two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that values of work functions W for a variety of planar and buckled two-dimensional (2D) materials scale linearly as a function of the quantity 1/r_{WS}, where r_{WS} is the Wigner-Seitz radius for a 2D material. Simple procedures are prescribed for estimating r_{WS}. Using them, this linear scaling relation, which is founded in electrostatics, provides a quick and easy method for calculating values of W from basic, readily available structural information about the materials. These easily determined values of W are seen to be very accurate when compared to values from the literature. Those derive from experiment or from challenging, computationally intensive density-functional-theory calculations. Values from those sources also conform to the linear scaling rules. Since values of W predicted by the rules so closely match known values of W, the simple scaling methods described here also are applied to predict W for 2D materials (TiN, BSb, SiGe, and GaP) for which no values have appeared previously in the literature.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Nodal and Nodeless Pairing Symmetry in Superconducting 6R-SnNbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majorana fermions, a fundamental idea to fault-tolerant quantum computing, can emerge in systems where superconductivity coexists with nontrivial band topology. One promising route to realizing such topological superconductors (TSCs) involves inducing superconductivity in topological materials, particularly in systems lacking inversion symmetry. In this study, we report the synthesis and detailed characterization of Sn-intercalated NbSe2, forming a new polytype, 6R-SnNbSe2. This compound crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric space group R3m and exhibits bulk superconductivity below Tc around 4 K. Structural, electronic, and magnetic measurements confirm the emergence of a superconducting phase derived from Sn intercalation into the non-superconducting 3R-NbSe2. Temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth and superfluid density measurements down to 1.5 K are performed using the tunnel diode oscillator technique. The findings suggest the mixing of nodal and nodeless superconductivity in 6R-SnNbSe2. Given the non-centrosymmetric nature of the crystal structure and the theoretical prediction of topological nodal-line features in SnNbSe2, it is an interesting candidate to investigate unconventional pairing mechanisms. Our findings highlight the potential of this material to host nontrivial superconducting states among the transition-metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Non-linear photoconductivity of strongly driven graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13217v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the non-linear DC photoconductivity of graphene under strong infra-red (IR) radiation. The photoconductivity is obtained as the response to a strong DC electric field, with field strengths outside of the linear-response regime, while the IR radiation is described by a strong AC electric field. The conductivity displays two distinct regimes in which either the DC or the AC field dominates. We explore these regimes and associate them with the dynamics of driven Landau-Zener quenches in the case of a large DC field. In the limit of large AC field, we describe the conductivity in a Floquet picture and compare the results to the closely related Tien-Gordon effect. We present analytical calculations for the non-linear differential photoconductivity, for both regimes based on the corresponding mechanisms. As part of this discussion of the non-equilibrium state of graphene, we present analytical estimates of the conductivity of undriven graphene as a function of temperature and DC bias field strength that show very good agreement with our simulations.</description>

      <title>Fractonic Coset Construction for Spontaneously Broken Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the homogeneous breaking of spatial translation symmetry concomitantly with the spontaneous breaking of other internal and spacetime symmetries, including dilations. We use the symmetry-breaking pattern as the only input to derive, via the coset construction, general effective field theories for the symmetry-originated modes associated with Goldstone's theorem, namely the Nambu-Goldstone candidates. Through explicit computations, we show that integrating out the explicit massive Nambu-Goldstone candidates or imposing symmetric constraints, namely the inverse Higgs constraints, to express massive modes in terms of the massless ones leads to physically distinct effective field theories. This sensitivity to the chosen method can be traced back to the homogeneous breaking of translations, the homogeneous aspect of the breaking induces a mixing between internal and spacetime symmetries at the level of the Lie algebra. This, in turn, leads to subtle discussions about the inverse Higgs constraints, in particular that they lead to a loss of generality in our specific examples. The derived general effective field theories also give rise to a broad class of theories exhibiting emergent enhanced shift symmetries, which constrain the mobility of the modes. The latter are referred to as fractonic modes.</description>
