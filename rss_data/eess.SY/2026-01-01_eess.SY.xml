      <title>Distributed Beamforming in Massive MIMO Communication for a Constellation of Airborne Platform Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial base stations (NTBSs), including high-altitude platform stations (HAPSs) and hot-air balloons (HABs), are integral to next-generation wireless networks, offering coverage in remote areas and enhancing capacity in dense regions. In this paper, we propose a distributed beamforming framework for a massive MIMO network with a constellation of aerial platform stations (APSs). Our approach leverages an entropy-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, where each APS operates as an independent agent using imperfect channel state information (CSI) in both training and testing phases. Unlike conventional methods, our model does not require CSI sharing among APSs, significantly reducing overhead. Simulations results demonstrate that our method outperforms zero forcing (ZF) and maximum ratio transmission (MRT) techniques, particularly in high-interference scenarios, while remaining robust to CSI imperfections. Additionally, our framework exhibits scalability, maintaining stable performance over an increasing number of users and various cluster configurations. Therefore, the proposed method holds promise for dynamic and interference-rich NTBS networks, advancing scalable and robust wireless solutions.</description>

      <title>Hardware Acceleration for Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have become a dominant computational workload across cloud and edge platforms, but rapid growth in model size and deployment diversity has exposed hardware bottlenecks increasingly dominated by memory movement, communication, and irregular operators rather than peak arithmetic throughput. This survey reviews the technology landscape for hardware acceleration of deep learning, spanning GPUs and tensor-core architectures; domain-specific accelerators (e.g., TPUs/NPUs); FPGA-based designs; ASIC inference engines; and emerging LLM-serving accelerators such as LPUs (language processing units), alongside in-/near-memory computing and neuromorphic/analog approaches. We organize the space using a unified taxonomy across (i) workloads (CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers/LLMs), (ii) execution settings (training vs.\ inference; datacenter vs.\ edge), and (iii) optimization levers (reduced precision, sparsity and pruning, operator fusion, compilation and scheduling, and memory-system/interconnect design). We synthesize key architectural ideas including systolic arrays, vector and SIMD engines, specialized attention and softmax kernels, quantization-aware datapaths, and high-bandwidth memory, and we discuss how software stacks and compilers bridge model semantics to hardware. Finally, we highlight open challenges -- including efficient long-context LLM inference (KV-cache management), robust support for dynamic and sparse workloads, energy- and security-aware deployment, and fair benchmarking -- and point to promising directions for the next generation of neural acceleration.</description>

      <title>Economic and Technical Feasibility of V2G in Non-Road Mobile Machinery sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the economic and technical feasibility of integrating Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology in the Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) sector. These often-idling assets, with their substantial battery capacities, present a unique opportunity to participate in energy markets, providing grid services and generating additional revenue. A novel methodology is introduced that integrates Bayesian Optimization (BO) to optimize the energy infrastructure together with an operating strategy optimization to reduce the electricity costs while enhancing grid interaction. While the focus lies on the methodology, the financial opportunities for the use-case of an electric NRMM rental service will be presented. However, the study is limited by the availability of real-world data on the usage of electric NRMM and does not address regulatory challenges of V2G. Further research is needed to extend the model accuracy and validate these findings.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Voltage and Current Control Method for Harmonic Mitigation of Single-Phase AC Loads in DC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DC microgrids provide an efficient framework for the interconnection of DC distributed energy resources (DERs) and DC loads. To continue to supply legacy single-phase AC loads, DC/AC converters can be integrated in the DC microgrid. The oscillatory instantaneous power of the single-phase AC load translates into a harmonic current on the converter's DC side, which increases the losses and causes unwanted voltage harmonics in the DC microgrid. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid voltage and current control method (HCM) for DERs. This scheme consists of an inner current control loop and an outer control layer which determines the reference for the inner loop. The outer control layer combines the DC voltage control loop with an output harmonic current control loop. This hybrid structure enables simultaneous regulation of the DC components of the DER output voltage and control of the harmonic component of the DER output current in accordance with the local single-phase AC load's demand. Frequency-domain analysis of the proposed method is presented to demonstrate the DC voltage and harmonic current loops are decoupled and there is no unwanted interaction between them. Additionally, time-domain response of the proposed scheme is validated through hardware-in-the-loop test results.</description>

      <title>Now or Never: Continuous Surveillance AIoT System for Ephemeral Events in Intermittent Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wilderness monitoring tasks, such as poaching surveillance and forest fire detection, require pervasive and high-accuracy sensing. While AIoT offers a promising path, covering vast, inaccessible regions necessitates the massive deployment of maintenance-free, battery-less nodes with limited computational resources. However, these constraints create a critical `Availability Gap.' Conventional intermittent operations prioritize computation throughput, forcing sensors to sleep during energy buffering. Consequently, systems miss ephemeral, `now-or-never' events (e.g., Vocalizations of natural monuments or Fire), which is fatal for detecting rare but high-stakes anomalies. To address this, we propose an Energy-aware Elastic Split Computing Algorithm that prioritizes continuous sensing by dynamically offloading tasks to energy-rich neighbors. Preliminary results demonstrate stable monitoring of an additional $2,496\;\text{m}^2$ and the capture of approximately 103 more critical events per day. Ultimately, this algorithm establishes a robust foundation for building resilient, fail-safe surveillance systems even on resource-constrained nodes.</description>

      <title>Safe Sliding Mode Control for Marine Vessels Using High-Order Control Barrier Functions and Fast Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel safe control framework that integrates Sliding Mode Control (SMC), High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) with state-dependent adaptiveness and a lightweight projection for collision-free navigation of an over-actuated 3-DOF marine surface vessel subjected to strong environmental disturbances (wind, waves, and current). SMC provides robustness to matched disturbances common in marine operations, while HOCBFs enforce forward invariance of obstacle-avoidance constraints. A fast half-space projection method adjusts the SMC control only when needed, preserving robustness and minimizing chattering. The approach is evaluated on a nonlinear marine platform model that includes added mass, hydrodynamic damping, and full thruster allocation. Simulation results show robust navigation, guaranteed obstacle avoidance, and computational efficiency suitable for real-time embedded use. For small marine robots and surface vessels with limited onboard computational resources-where execution speed and computational efficiency are critical-the SMC-HOCBF framework constitutes a strong candidate for safety-critical control.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Cascaded Geometric Flight Control: From Performance Guarantees to Practical Pitfalls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new stability proof for cascaded geometric control used by aerial vehicles tracking time-varying position trajectories. Our approach uses sliding variables and a recently proposed quaternion-based sliding controller to demonstrate that exponentially convergent position trajectory tracking is theoretically possible. Notably, our analysis reveals new aspects of the control strategy, including how tracking error in the attitude loop influences the position loop, how model uncertainties affect the closed-loop system, and the practical pitfalls of the control architecture.</description>

      <title>Multipliers for forced Lurye systems with slope-restricted nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic multipliers can be used to guarantee the stability of Lurye systems with slope-restricted nonlinearities, but give no guarantee that the closed-loop system has finite incremental gain. We show that multipliers guarantee the closed-loop power gain to be bounded and quantifiable. Power may be measured about an appropriate steady state bias term, provided the multiplier does not require the nonlinearity to be odd. Hence dynamic multipliers can be used to guarantee such Lurye systems have low sensitivity to noise, provided other exogenous signals have constant steady state. For periodic excitation, the closed-loop response can apparently have a subharmonic or chaotic response. We revisit a class of multipliers that can guarantee a unique, attractive and period-preserving solution. We show the multipliers can be derived using classical tools and reconsider assumptions required for their application. Their phase limitations are inherited from those of discrete-time multipliers. The multipliers cannot be used at all frequencies unless the circle criterion can also be applied; this is consistent with known results about dynamic multipliers and incremental stability.</description>

      <title>Design of Linear Residual Generators for Combined Fault Detection and Estimation in Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic method for the design of linear residual generators for combined fault detection and estimation in nonlinear systems is developed. The proposed residual generator is a linear functional observer built for an extended system that incorporates the fault dynamics from a linear exo-system, and in addition possesses disturbance-decoupling properties. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such residual generators for nonlinear systems are derived. As long as these conditions are satisfied, we obtain explicit design formulas for the residual generator. The results are illustrated through a chemical reactor case study, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Bayesian Control Barrier Functions for Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study safe control for dynamical systems whose continuous-time dynamics are learned with Gaussian processes (GPs), focusing on mechanical and port-Hamiltonian systems where safety is naturally expressed via energy constraints. The availability of a GP Hamiltonian posterior naturally raises the question of how to systematically exploit this structure to design an energy-aware control barrier function with high-probability safety guarantees. We address this problem by developing a Bayesian-CBF framework and instantiating it with energy-aware Bayesian-CBFs (EB-CBFs) that construct conservative energy-based barriers directly from the Hamiltonian and vector-field posteriors, yielding safety filters that minimally modify a nominal controller while providing probabilistic energy safety guarantees. Numerical simulations on a mass-spring system demonstrate that the proposed EB-CBFs achieve high-probability safety under noisy sampled GP-learned dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Graph Neural Network with Auxiliary Task Learning for Missing PMU Data Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wide-area measurement systems (WAMS), phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurement is prone to data missingness due to hardware failures, communication delays, and cyber-attacks. Existing data-driven methods are limited by inadaptability to concept drift in power systems, poor robustness under high missing rates, and reliance on the unrealistic assumption of full system observability. Thus, this paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method for reconstructing missing PMU data. First, a K-hop graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to enable direct learning on the subgraph consisting of PMU nodes, overcoming the limitation of the incompletely observable system. Then, an auxiliary learning framework consisting of two complementary graph networks is designed for accurate reconstruction: a spatial-temporal GNN extracts spatial-temporal dependencies from PMU data to reconstruct missing values, and another auxiliary GNN utilizes the low-rank property of PMU data to achieve unsupervised online learning. In this way, the low-rank properties of the PMU data are dynamically leveraged across the architecture to ensure robustness and self-adaptation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior offline and online performance of the proposed method under high missing rates and incomplete observability.</description>

      <title>Decentralized No-Regret Frequency-Time Scheduling for FMCW Radar Interference Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars are indispensable to modern ADAS and autonomous-driving systems, but their increasing density has intensified the risk of mutual interference. Existing mitigation techniques, including reactive receiver-side suppression, proactive waveform design, and cooperative scheduling, often face limitations in scalability, reliance on side-channel communication, or degradation of range-Doppler resolution. Building on our earlier work on decentralized Frequency-Domain No-Regret hopping, this paper introduces a unified time-frequency game-theoretic framework that enables radars to adapt across both spectral and temporal resources. We formulate the interference-avoidance problem as a repeated anti-coordination game, in which each radar autonomously updates a mixed strategy over frequency subbands and chirp-level time offsets using regret-minimization dynamics. We show that the proposed Time-Frequency No-Regret Hopping algorithm achieves vanishing external and swap regret, and that the induced empirical play converges to an $\varepsilon$-coarse correlated equilibrium or a correlated equilibrium. Theoretical analysis provides regret bounds in the joint domain, revealing how temporal adaptation implicitly regularizes frequency selection and enhances robustness against asynchronous interference. Numerical experiments with multi-radar scenarios demonstrate substantial improvements in SINR, collision rate, and range-Doppler quality compared with time-frequency random hopping and centralized Nash-based benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Taking Advantage of Rational Canonical Form for Faster Ring-LWE based Encrypted Controller with Recursive Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to provide an efficient implementation of encrypted linear dynamic controllers that perform recursive multiplications on a Ring-Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE) based cryptosystem. By adopting a system-theoretical approach, we significantly reduce both time and space complexities, particularly the number of homomorphic operations required for recursive multiplications. Rather than encrypting the entire state matrix of a given controller, the state matrix is transformed into its rational canonical form, whose sparse and circulant structure enables that encryption and computation are required only on its nontrivial columns. Furthermore, we propose a novel method to ``pack'' each of the input and the output matrices into a single polynomial, thereby reducing the number of homomorphic operations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design enables a remarkably fast implementation of encrypted controllers.</description>

      <title>Waste-to-Energy-Coupled AI Data Centers: Cooling Efficiency and Grid Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI data-center expansion is increasingly constrained by the coupled availability of deliverable electricity and heat-rejection (cooling) capacity. We propose and evaluate an integrated Waste-to-Energy-AI Data Center configuration that treats cooling as a first-class energy service rather than an unavoidable electricity burden. The coupled system is modeled as an input-output 'black box' with transparent boundaries and a standalone benchmark in which mechanical chilling is powered by grid electricity. The central mechanism is energy-grade matching: low-grade WtE thermal output drives absorption cooling to deliver chilled service, thereby displacing baseline cooling electricity. We show that thermoeconomic superiority is governed by three first-order determinants, (i) cooling coverage of IT heat load, (ii) parasitic electricity for transport and auxiliaries, and (iii) distance-driven delivery decay, yielding a break-even corridor beyond which net benefits vanish. Comparative statics characterize sensitivity to IT utilization, feedstock quality (waste LHV and throughput), climate parameterization, and corridor distance. We translate these accounting gains into decision language through a computable prototype for Levelized Cost of Computing (LCOC) and an ESG valuation channel grounded in measurable mechanisms, without re-deriving full lifecycle inventories. The framework provides siting-ready feasibility conditions for WtE-AIDC coupling in urban AI corridors under grid stress.</description>

      <title>Average Consensus with Dynamic Quantization Framing and Finite-Time Termination over Limited-Bandwidth Directed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a deterministic distributed algorithm, referred to as PP-ACDC, that achieves exact average consensus over possibly unbalanced directed graphs using only a fixed and a priori specified number of quantization bits. The method integrates Push-Pull (surplus) consensus dynamics with a dynamic quantization framing scheme combining zooming and midpoint shifting, enabling agents to preserve the true global average while progressively refining their quantization precision. We establish a rigorous convergence theory showing that PP-ACDC achieves asymptotic (exact) average consensus on any strongly connected digraph under appropriately chosen quantization parameters. Moreover, we develop a fully distributed and synchronized finite-time termination mechanism, and we provide a formal proof on the detection of $\epsilon$-convergence to the average within a finite number of iterations. Numerical simulations corroborate the theoretical results and demonstrate that PP-ACDC achieves reliable, communication-efficient, and precise average consensus even under very tight bit budgets, underscoring its suitability for large-scale and resource-constrained multi-agent systems operating over directed networks.</description>

      <title>Exact compensation of communication delays for discrete-time heterogeneous multi-agent linear systems with applications to SIR epidemic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the output synchronization problem for discrete-time heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs) subject to distinct communication delays. The presence of such delays prevents the instantaneous delivery of information from neighboring nodes, thereby severely degrading the performance of standard distributed control schemes. To overcome this, we propose a prediction-based framework for exact delay compensation. Specifically, we introduce predictors combined with a mechanism of distributed predictors, which enables the recursive reconstruction of future state information across the communication network. Building upon these predictors, we construct prediction-based distributed observers and formulate both prediction-based distributed state-feedback and dynamic output-feedback controllers. Theoretical analysis confirms that the proposed strategy eliminates the impact of delays after a finite number of steps, ensuring output synchronization. The effectiveness of the methods is validated through a numerical example and a Koopman operator-based linear Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model. Notably, for a population of 4 million, the proposed delay compensation strategy achieves a reduction of over 200,000 infected individuals at the peak, underscoring its potential significance in epidemic mitigation.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Equipment Monitoring via Cascaded Anomaly Detection and Thermal Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive maintenance demands accurate anomaly detection and trustable explanations. Although multimodal fusion of sensor time-series and thermal imagery shows promise, we demonstrate that naive fusion strategies can paradoxically degrade performance. This paper introduces a Cascaded Anomaly Detection framework that decouples detection and localization. Stage 1 employs an LSTM-based sensor encoder with temporal attention for high-accuracy detection, while Stage 2 activates a CNN-based thermal encoder for post-detection fault localization. Our results reveal that sensor-only detection outperforms full fusion by 8.3 percentage points (93.08% vs. 84.79% F1-score), challenging the assumption that additional modalities invariably improve performance. We further contribute an explainability pipeline integrating SHAP, temporal/spatial attention, and gate weight analysis. This analysis uncovers a "modality bias" where fusion models assign 65-87% weight to the weaker thermal modality. Validated on a real-world bearing dataset (78,397 samples), our cascaded approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing actionable diagnostics for maintenance decision-making.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Multi-Target Tracking using Cellular Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent target tracking in the presence of nonlinear dynamics and agent heterogeneity, where state-space dimensions may differ, is a challenging problem that traditional graph Laplacian methods cannot easily address. This work leverages the framework of cellular sheaves, a mathematical generalization of graph theory, to natively model such heterogeneous systems. While existing coordination sheaf frameworks focus on cooperative problems like consensus, this work extends them to the non-cooperative target-tracking problem. The tracking of multiple, unknown targets is formulated as a harmonic extension problem on a cellular sheaf, accommodating nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances for all agents. A decentralized control law is developed using the sheaf Laplacian, and a corresponding Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to guarantee tracking error convergence, with results validated by simulation.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Camera-Based Extrusion Optimization for High Speed Fused Filament Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Off-the-shelf fused filament fabrication 3D printers are widely accessible and convenient, yet they exhibit quality loss at high speeds due to dynamic mis-synchronization between printhead motion and material extrusion systems, notably corner over-extrusion. Existing methods require specialized hardware, extensive calibration, or firmware modifications that are inaccessible to most users. This work presents a practical, end-to-end optimization framework that enhances high-speed printing using only standard 3D printers and a phone camera, without requiring additional complex setup. The method employs a one-shot calibration approach in which two simple printed patterns, captured by a phone camera, enable identification of extrusion dynamics and cornering behavior. The identified systems enable a model-based constrained optimal control strategy that generates optimized G-code, synchronizing motion and extrusion. Experiments show reduced width tracking error, mitigated corner defects, and lower surface roughness, achieving surface quality at 3600 mm/min comparable to conventional printing at 1600 mm/min, effectively doubling production speed while maintaining print quality. This accessible, hardware-minimal approach enables a wide range of fused filament fabrication users to achieve high-quality, high-speed additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>ROBOPOL: Social Robotics Meets Vehicular Communications for Cooperative Automated Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the way towards full autonomy, sharing roads between automated vehicles and human actors in so-called mixed traffic is unavoidable. Moreover, even if all vehicles on the road were autonomous, pedestrians would still be crossing the streets. We propose social robots as moderators between autonomous vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRU). To this end, we identify four enablers requiring integration: (1) advanced perception, allowing the robot to see the environment; (2) vehicular communications allowing connected vehicles to share intentions and the robot to send guiding commands; (3) social human-robot interaction allowing the robot to effectively communicate with VRUs and drivers; (4) formal specification allowing the robot to understand traffic and plan accordingly. This paper presents an overview of the key enablers and report on a first proof-of-concept integration of the first three enablers envisioning a social robot advising pedestrians in scenarios with a cooperative automated e-bike.</description>

      <title>Discovering Optimal Robust Minimum Redundancy Arrays (RMRAs) through Exhaustive Search and Algebraic Formulation of a New Sub-Optimal RMRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern sparse arrays are maximally economic in that they retain just as many sensors required to provide a specific aperture while maintaining a hole-free difference coarray. As a result, these are susceptible to the failure of even a single sensor. Contrarily, two-fold redundant sparse arrays (TFRSAs) and robust minimum redundancy arrays (RMRAs) ensure robustness against single-sensor failures due to their inherent redundancy in their coarrays. At present, optimal RMRA configurations are known only for arrays with sensor counts N=6 to N=10. To this end, this paper proposes two objectives: (i) developing a systematic algorithm to discover optimal RMRAs for N&gt;10, and (ii) obtaining a new family of near-/sub-optimal RMRA that can be completely specified using closed-form expressions (CFEs). We solve the combinatorial optimization problem of finding RMRAs using an exhaustive search technique implemented in MATLAB. Optimal RMRAs for N = 11 to 14 were successfully found and near/sub-optimal arrays for N = 15 to 20 were determined using the proposed technique. As a byproduct of the exhaustive search, a large catalogue of valid near- and sub-optimal RMRAs was also obtained. In the second stage, CFEs for a new TFRSA were obtained by applying pattern mining and algebraic generalizations to the arrays obtained through exhaustive search. The proposed family enjoys CFEs for sensor positions, available aperture, and achievable degrees of freedom (DOFs). The CFEs have been thoroughly validated using MATLAB and are found to be valid for $N\geq8$. Hence, it can be concluded that the novelty of this work is two-fold: extending the catalogue of known optimal RMRAs and formulating a sub-optimal RMRA that abides by CFEs.</description>

      <title>Fast and Realistic Automated Scenario Simulations and Reporting for an Autonomous Racing Stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the automated simulation and reporting pipeline implemented for our autonomous racing stack, ur.autopilot. The backbone of the simulation is based on a high-fidelity model of the vehicle interfaced as a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU). The pipeline can execute the software stack and the simulation up to three times faster than real-time, locally or on GitHub for Continuous Integration/- Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). As the most important input of the pipeline, there is a set of running scenarios. Each scenario allows the initialization of the ego vehicle in different initial conditions (position and speed), as well as the initialization of any other configuration of the stack. This functionality is essential to validate efficiently critical modules, like the one responsible for high-speed overtaking maneuvers or localization, which are among the most challenging aspects of autonomous racing. Moreover, we describe how we implemented a fault injection module, capable of introducing sensor delays and perturbations as well as modifying outputs of any node of the stack. Finally, we describe the design of our automated reporting process, aimed at maximizing the effectiveness of the simulation analysis.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Learning Guided by Bias-Noise-Alignment Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning systems deployed in nonstationary and safety-critical environments often suffer from instability, slow convergence, or brittle adaptation when learning dynamics evolve over time. While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to temporal-difference error structure. Overall, this work elevates error evolution to a first-class object in adaptive learning and provides an interpretable, lightweight foundation for reliable learning in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>VLA-RAIL: A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker for VLA Models and Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in robotics, with the action chunk playing a dominant role in these advances. Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates, which will become a key infrastructure for the large-scale deployment of VLA models.</description>

      <title>BatteryAgent: Synergizing Physics-Informed Interpretation with LLM Reasoning for Intelligent Battery Fault Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries is critical for system safety. While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their "black-box" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a "numerical-semantic" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from "passive detection" to "intelligent diagnosis" for battery safety management.</description>

      <title>Control of Microrobots with Reinforcement Learning under On-Device Compute Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important function of autonomous microrobots is the ability to perform robust movement over terrain. This paper explores an edge ML approach to microrobot locomotion, allowing for on-device, lower latency control under compute, memory, and power constraints. This paper explores the locomotion of a sub-centimeter quadrupedal microrobot via reinforcement learning (RL) and deploys the resulting controller on an ultra-small system-on-chip (SoC), SC$\mu$M-3C, featuring an ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller running at 5 MHz. We train a compact FP32 multilayer perceptron (MLP) policy with two hidden layers ($[128, 64]$) in a massively parallel GPU simulation and enhance robustness by utilizing domain randomization over simulation parameters. We then study integer (Int8) quantization (per-tensor and per-feature) to allow for higher inference update rates on our resource-limited hardware, and we connect hardware power budgets to achievable update frequency via a cycles-per-update model for inference on our Cortex-M0. We propose a resource-aware gait scheduling viewpoint: given a device power budget, we can select the gait mode (trot/intermediate/gallop) that maximizes expected RL reward at a corresponding feasible update frequency. Finally, we deploy our MLP policy on a real-world large-scale robot on uneven terrain, qualitatively noting that domain-randomized training can improve out-of-distribution stability. We do not claim real-world large-robot empirical zero-shot transfer in this work.</description>

      <title>MSACL: Multi-Step Actor-Critic Learning with Lyapunov Certificates for Exponentially Stabilizing Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving provable stability in model-free reinforcement learning (RL) remains a challenge, particularly in balancing exploration with rigorous safety. This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $\lambda$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems. By linking Lyapunov theory with off-policy actor-critic frameworks, MSACL provides a foundation for verifiably safe learning-based control. Source code and benchmark environments will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Myopically Verifiable Probabilistic Certificates for Safe Control and Learning</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses the design of safety certificates for stochastic systems, with a focus on ensuring long-term safety through fast real-time control. In stochastic environments, set invariance-based methods that restrict the probability of risk events in infinitesimal time intervals may exhibit significant long-term risks due to cumulative uncertainties/risks. On the other hand, reachability-based approaches that account for the long-term future may require prohibitive computation in real-time decision making. To overcome this challenge involving stringent long-term safety vs. computation tradeoffs, we first introduce a novel technique termed `probabilistic invariance'. This technique characterizes the invariance conditions of the probability of interest. When the target probability is defined using long-term trajectories, this technique can be used to design myopic conditions/controllers with assured long-term safe probability. Then, we integrate this technique into safe control and learning. The proposed control methods efficiently assure long-term safety using neural networks or model predictive controllers with short outlook horizons. The proposed learning methods can be used to guarantee long-term safety during and after training. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed techniques in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Robust Optimal Operation of Distribution Networks Considering Renewable Energy and Demand Asymmetric Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a confidence level-based distributionally information gap decision theory (CL-DIGDT) framework for the two-stage robust optimal operation of distribution networks, aiming at deriving an optimal operational scheme capable of addressing asymmetric uncertainties related to renewable energy and load demands. Building on conventional IGDT, the proposed framework utilizes the confidence level to capture the asymmetric characteristics of uncertainties and maximize the risk-averse capability of the solution in a probabilistic manner. To account for the probabilistic consideration, the imprecise Dirichlet model is employed to construct the ambiguity sets of uncertainties, reducing reliance on precise probability distributions. Consequently, a two-stage robust optimal operation model for distribution networks using CL-DIGDT is developed. An iterative method is proposed to solve the model and determine the upper and lower bounds of the objective function. Case study demonstrates that the proposed approach yields a more robust and statistically optimized solution with required accuracy compared to existing method, contributing to a reduction in first-stage cost by 0.84%, second-stage average cost by 6.7%, and significantly increasing the reliability of the solution by 8%.</description>

      <title>Hybrid dynamical systems modeling of power systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has introduced complex dynamic behavior in power systems that challenge the adequacy of traditional continuous-time modeling approaches. These developments call for modeling frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between continuous dynamics and discrete events characterizing modern grid operations. Hybrid dynamical systems offer a rigorous foundation for representing such mixed dynamics and have emerged as a valuable tool in power system analysis. Despite their potential, existing studies remain focused on isolated applications or case-specific implementations, offering limited generalizability and guidance for model selection. This paper addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of hybrid modeling approaches relevant to power systems. It critically examines key formalisms, including hybrid automata, switched systems, and piecewise affine models, evaluating their respective strengths, limitations, and suitability across control, stability, and system design tasks. In doing so, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to support the systematic application of hybrid methods in renewable-rich, converter-dominated power systems</description>

      <title>Agentic AI Systems in Electrical Power Systems Engineering: Current State-of-the-Art and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems have recently emerged as a critical and transformative approach in artificial intelligence, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional AI agents and contemporary generative AI models. This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for "agentic AI," with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on stochastic converse Lyapunov theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this brief note, we investigate some constructions of Lyapunov functions for stochastic discrete-time stabilizable dynamical systems, in other words, controlled Markov chains. The main question here is whether a Lyapunov function in some statistical sense exists if the respective controlled Markov chain admits a stabilizing policy. We demonstrate some constructions extending on the classical results for deterministic systems. Some limitations of the constructed Lyapunov functions for stabilization are discussed, particularly for stabilization in mean. Although results for deterministic systems are well known, the stochastic case was addressed in less detail, which the current paper remarks on. A distinguishable feature of this work is the study of stabilizers that possess computationally tractable convergence certificates.</description>

      <title>Value of Multi-pursuer Single-evader Pursuit-evasion Game with Terminal Cost of Evader's Position: Relaxation of Convexity Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we consider a multi-pursuer single-evader quantitative pursuit-evasion game with payoff function that includes only the terminal cost. The terminal cost is a function related only to the terminal position of the evader. This problem has been extensively studied in target defense games. Here, we prove that a candidate for the value function generated by geometric method is the viscosity solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs partial differential equation (HJI PDE) Dirichlet problem. Therefore, the value function of the game at each point can be computed by a mathematical program. In our work, the convexity of the terminal cost or the target is not required. The terminal cost only needs to be locally Lipschitz continuous. The cases in which the terminal costs or the targets are not convex are covered. Therefore, our result is more universal than those of previous studies, and the complexity of the proof is improved. We also discuss the optimal strategies in this game and present an intuitive explanation of this value function.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems via Event-Triggered Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15735v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.</description>

      <title>Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) for Communicationless Cooperative Collision Avoidance in Robot Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative collision avoidance between robots, or `agents,' in swarm operations remains an open challenge. Assuming a decentralized architecture, each agent is responsible for making its own decisions and choosing its control actions. Most existing approaches rely on a (wireless) communication network between (some of) the agents. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, and transmission faults. Moreover, it is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC), a decentralized cooperative approach that does not rely on communication. Instead, the control algorithm is based on consensual rules that are designed for all agents offline, similar to traffic rules. For CMC, this includes the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and perpendicular bisecting planes as collision avoidance constraints. The setup permits a full guarantee of recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. CMC naturally satisfies the plug &amp; play paradigm, i.e., new robots may enter the swarm dynamically. The effectiveness of the CMC regime is demonstrated in two numerical examples, showing that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and the robot swarm operates smoothly in a constrained environment.</description>

      <title>Leveraging High-Fidelity Digital Models and Reinforcement Learning for Mission Engineering: A Case Study of Aerial Firefighting Under Perfect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As systems engineering (SE) objectives evolve from design and operation of monolithic systems to complex System of Systems (SoS), the discipline of Mission Engineering (ME) has emerged which is increasingly being accepted as a new line of thinking for the SE community. Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective.</description>
