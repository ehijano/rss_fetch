      <title>Wasserstein Stability of Persistence Landscapes and Barcodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barcodes form a complete set of invariants for interval decomposable persistence modules and are an important summary in topological data analysis. The set of barcodes is equipped with a canonical one-parameter family of metrics, the $p-$Wasserstein distances. However, the $p-$Wasserstein distances depend on a choice of a metric on the set of interval modules, and there is no canonical choice. One convention is to use the length of the symmetric difference between 2 intervals, which equals to the 1-norm of the difference between their Hilbert functions. We propose a new metric for interval modules based on the rank invariant instead of the dimension invariant. Our metric is topologically equivalent to the metrics induced by the $p-$norms on $\R^2$. We establish stability results from filtered CW complexes to barcodes, as well as from barcodes to persistence landscapes. In particular, we show that vectorization via persistence landscapes is 1-Lipschitz with a sharp bound, with respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance on barcodes and the 1-norm on persistence landscapes.</description>

      <title>Graphical configuration spaces, Contractads and Formality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite simple connected graph $\Gamma$, the graphical configuration space $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(X)$ is the space of collections of points in $X$ indexed by the vertices of $\Gamma$, where points corresponding to adjacent vertices must be distinct. When $X=\mathbb{R}^d$ and the points are replaced by small disks, the resulting spaces for all possible graphs fit together into an algebraic structure that extends the little disks operad, called the little disks contractad $\mathcal{D}_d$. In this paper, we investigate the homotopical and algebraic properties of the little disks contractad $\mathcal{D}_d$. We construct and study Fulton-MacPherson compactifications of graphical configuration spaces, which provide a convenient model for $\mathcal{D}_d$ within the class of compact manifolds with boundary. Using these and wonderful compactifications, we prove that $\mathcal{D}_d$ is formal in the category of (Hopf) contractads for $d=1$, $d=2$, and for chordal graphs for any $d$. We also identify the first obstructions to coformality in the case of cyclic graphs. In addition, we give a combinatorial description of the cell structure of $\mathcal{D}_2$ and present applications to the study of graphical configuration spaces $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(X)$ using the language of twisted algebras.</description>

      <title>The Euler class of infinite-type surface bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Euler class of smooth orientable infinite-type surface bundles with a section. For many such surfaces, we show that this cohomology class is nontrivial, and that the behavior of its powers depends on the genus and the type of ends. As an application, we extend Morita's non-lifting theorem to many infinite-type surfaces, including surfaces of infinite genus.</description>

      <title>A minimal model for prestacks and morphisms of operadic algebras via Koszul duality for box operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prestacks are algebro-geometric objects whose defining relations are far from quadratic. Indeed, they are cubic and quartic, and moreover inhomogeneous. Similarly, a morphism of $P$-algebras for a (nonsymmetric) Koszul operad $P$ has inhomogeneous relations possibly of any arity. We show that box operads, a rectangular type of operads introduced in arXiv:2305.20036, constitute the correct framework to encode them and resolve their relations up to homotopy. Our first main result is a Koszul duality theory for box operads, extending the duality for (nonsymmetric) operads. In this new theory, the classical restriction of being quadratic is replaced by the notion of being \emph{thin-quadratic}, a condition referring to a particular class of ``thin'' operations. Our main cases of interest are the box operad $Morph(P)$ encoding morphisms of $P$-algebras and the box operad $Lax$ encoding lax prestacks. We show that both $Morph(P)$ and $Lax$ are not Koszul. We then go on to remedy the situation by suitably restricting the respective Koszul dual box cooperads $Morph(P)^{\antishriek}$ and $Lax^{\antishriek}$ to obtain our two main applications. As our second main result we establish a minimal model $Morph(P)_\infty$ for the box operad $Morph(P)$ as the cobar construction on a box subcooperad $Morph(P)^{\antishriek}_{p\leq 1}$ of $Morph(P)^{\antishriek}$, hereby answering an open question by Markl in arXiv:math/0103052 (Problem 9). As expected, it encodes $\infty$-morphisms of $P_\infty$-algebras. As our third main result we establish a minimal model $Lax_{\infty}$ for the box operad $Lax$ encoding lax prestacks. This sheds new light on Markl's question on the existence of an explicit cofibrant model for the operad encoding presheaves of algebras from arXiv:math/0103052 (Conjecture 31). Indeed, we answer the parallel question with presheaves viewed as prestacks in the positive.</description>

      <title>Morse-Bott-Smale chain complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Banyaga and Hurtubise defined the Morse-Bott-Smale chain complex as a quotient of a large chain complex by introducing five degeneracy relations. However, their five degeneracy relations are in fact redundant. In the present paper, we unify these five conditions into a single degeneracy condition and resolve the issue of the well-definedness of the Morse-Bott-Smale chain complex. This provides an appropriate definition of the Morse-Bott homology and more computable examples. Moreover, we show that our chain complex for a Morse-Smale function is quasi-isomorphic to the usual Morse-Smale-Witten chain complex. As a consequence, we obtain an alternative proof of the Morse Homology Theorem.</description>

      <title>Splittings of truncated motivic Brown--Peterson cooperations algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct spectrum-level splittings of $BPGL \langle 1 \rangle \wedge BPGL \langle 1 \rangle$ at all primes $p$, where $BPGL \langle 1 \rangle$ is the first truncated motivic Brown--Peterson spectrum. Classically, $BP\langle 1 \rangle \wedge BP\langle 1 \rangle$ was first described by Kane and Mahowald in terms of Brown-Gitler spectra. This splitting was subsequently reinterpreted by Lellman and Davis-Gitler-Mahowald in terms of Adams covers. In this paper, we give motivic lifts of these splittings in terms of Adams covers, over the base fields $\mathbb{C}, \, \mathbb{R},$ and $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $\mathbb{F}_q \neq p$. As an application, we compute the $E_1$-page of the $BPGL\langle 1 \rangle$-based Adams spectral sequence as a module over $BPGL\langle 1 \rangle$, both in homotopy and in terms of motivic spectra. We also record analogous splittings for $BPGL \langle 0 \rangle \wedge BPGL \langle 0 \rangle$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize proarrow equipments from strict category theory to the $\infty$-categorical setting, introducing the concept of $\infty$-equipments. These are specific double $\infty$-categories that support an internal higher category theory. This paper explores several examples of $\infty$-equipments, including the prototypical example of the $\infty$-equipment of $\infty$-categories and the more general $\infty$-equipments of internal $\infty$-categories. The ultimate objective of this article is to study the basic concepts of category theory within an arbitrary $\infty$-equipment, such as colimits and Kan extensions.</description>

      <title>A Quotient Homology Theory of Representation in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous research has proven that the set of maps implemented by neural networks with a ReLU activation function is identical to the set of piecewise linear continuous maps. Furthermore, such networks induce a hyperplane arrangement splitting the input domain of the network into convex polyhedra $G_J$ over which a network $\Phi$ operates in an affine manner.
  In this work, we leverage these properties to define an equivalence class $\sim_\Phi$ on top of an input dataset, which can be split into two sets related to the local rank of $\Phi_J$ and the intersections $\cap \text{Im}\Phi_{J_i}$. We refer to the latter as the \textit{overlap decomposition} $\mathcal{O}_\Phi$ and prove that if the intersections between each polyhedron and an input manifold are convex, the homology groups of neural representations are isomorphic to quotient homology groups $H_k(\Phi(\mathcal{M})) \simeq H_k(\mathcal{M}/\mathcal{O}_\Phi)$. This lets us intrinsically calculate the Betti numbers of neural representations without the choice of an external metric. We develop methods to numerically compute the overlap decomposition through linear programming and a union-find algorithm.
  Using this framework, we perform several experiments on toy datasets showing that, compared to standard persistent homology, our overlap homology-based computation of Betti numbers tracks purely topological rather than geometric features. Finally, we study the evolution of the overlap decomposition during training on several classification problems while varying network width and depth and discuss some shortcomings of our method.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of Frobenius twisted de Rham cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short paper, we prove that the moduli of automorphisms of Frobenius twisted de Rham cohomology functor is given by $\mathbb{G}_m$. Our method is to use the notion of $\mathbb{G}_a^{\mathrm{perf}}$-modules and its connection to the de Rham cohomology functor introduced in \cite{M22}. As an application of the induced $\mathbb{G}_m$-action, we reprove a result of Bhatt, Petrov, and Vologodsky on the decomposition of the Frobenius twisted de Rham complex.</description>
