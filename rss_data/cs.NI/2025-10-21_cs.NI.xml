      <title>Agentic AI for Ultra-Modern Networks: Multi-Agent Framework for RAN Autonomy and Assurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of Beyond 5G and 6G networks necessitates new paradigms for autonomy and assur- ance. Traditional O-RAN control loops rely heavily on RIC- based orchestration, which centralizes intelligence and exposes the system to risks such as policy conflicts, data drift, and unsafe actions under unforeseen conditions. In this work, we argue that the future of autonomous networks lies in a multi-agentic architecture, where specialized agents collaborate to perform data collection, model training, prediction, policy generation, verification, deployment, and assurance. By replacing tightly- coupled centralized RIC-based workflows with distributed agents, the framework achieves autonomy, resilience, explainability, and system-wide safety. To substantiate this vision, we design and evaluate a traffic steering use case under surge and drift conditions. Results across four KPIs: RRC connected users, IP throughput, PRB utilization, and SINR, demonstrate that a naive predictor-driven deployment improves local KPIs but destabilizes neighbors, whereas the agentic system blocks unsafe policies, preserving global network health. This study highlights multi- agent architectures as a credible foundation for trustworthy AI- driven autonomy in next-generation RANs.</description>

      <title>Traffic Prioritization Mechanisms for Mission and Time Critical Applications in Industrial Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promises to revolutionize industrial operations and productions through utilizing Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. Since each node in such environments generates various types of data with diverse service requirements, MAC protocol holds crucial importance to ensure efficient delivery. In this context, simple to complex MAC schemes are found in literature. This paper focuses on evaluating the performance of two major techniques "slot stealing" and "packet fragmentation" for the IIoT; representative protocols SS-MAC and FROG-MAC have been chosen from each category respectively. We conducted realistic simulations for the two protocols using Contiki. Delay and packet loss comparison for SS-MAC and FROG-MAC indicates the superiority of FROG-MAC due to reduction in the waiting time for urgent traffic. Thus, a simple fragmentation scheme could be deployed for efficient scheduling of heterogenous traffic in the industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Mamba4Net: Distilled Hybrid Mamba Large Language Models For Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in networking research to address domain-specific challenges. However, their quadratic time complexity and substantial model sizes often result in significant computational overhead and memory constraints, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Drawing inspiration from the efficiency and performance of the Deepseek-R1 model within the knowledge distillation paradigm, this paper introduces Mamba4Net, a novel cross-architecture distillation framework. Mamba4Net transfers networking-specific knowledge from transformer-based LLMs to student models built on the Mamba architecture, which features linear time complexity. This design substantially enhances computational efficiency compared to the quadratic complexity of transformer-based models, while the reduced model size further minimizes computational demands, improving overall performance and resource utilization. To evaluate its effectiveness, Mamba4Net was tested across three diverse networking tasks: viewport prediction, adaptive bitrate streaming, and cluster job scheduling. Compared to existing methods that do not leverage LLMs, Mamba4Net demonstrates superior task performance. Furthermore, relative to direct applications of transformer-based LLMs, it achieves significant efficiency gains, including a throughput 3.96 times higher and a storage footprint of only 5.48% of that required by previous LLM-based approaches. These results highlight Mamba4Net's potential to enable the cost-effective application of LLM-derived knowledge in networking contexts. The source code is openly available to support further research and development.</description>

      <title>AoA Services in 5G Networks: A Framework for Real-World Implementation and Systematic Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate positioning is a key enabler for emerging 5G applications. While the standardized Location Management Function (LMF) operates centrally within the core network, its scalability and latency limitations hinder low-latency and fine-grained localization. A practical alternative is to shift positioning intelligence toward the radio access network (RAN), where uplink sounding reference signal (SRS)-based angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation offers a lightweight, network-native solution. In this work, we present the first fully open-source 5G testbed for AoA estimation, enabling systematic and repeatable experimentation under realistic yet controllable channel conditions. The framework integrates the NVIDIA Sionna RT with a Keysight PROPSIM channel emulator and includes a novel phase calibration procedure for USRP N310 devices. Experimental results show sub-degree to few-degree accuracy, validating the feasibility of lightweight, single-anchor, network-native localization within next-generation 5G systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing 5G V2X Mode 2 for Sporadic Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging road safety and autonomous vehicle applications require timely and reliable data delivery between vehicles and between vehicles and infrastructure. To satisfy this demand, 3GPP develops a 5G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology. Depending on the served traffic type, 5G V2X specifications propose two channel access methods: (i) Mode 1, according to which a base station allocates resources to users, and (ii) Mode 2, according to which users autonomously select resources for their transmissions. In the paper, we consider a scenario with sporadic traffic, e.g., a vehicle generates a packet at a random time moment when it detects a dangerous situation, which imposes strict requirements on delay and reliability. To satisfy strict delay requirements, vehicles use Mode 2. We analyze the performance of Mode 2 for sporadic traffic and propose several approaches to improve it. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches can increase the system capacity by up to 40% with a low impact on complexity.</description>

      <title>Is It Worth to Use Feedback Channel in 5G V2X Platoon Scenarios?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 5G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) is a new technology developed by 3GPP to support inter-vehicle communication. In contrast to 4G V2X which allows only broadcast communication, 5G V2X enables groupcast and unicast communication. Such types of communication are needed for new V2X scenarios: platooning, extended sensors, remote driving, etc. To improve the data transmission reliability and assist in the selection of the transmission parameters in these scenarios, 5G V2X introduces a feedback channel that allows receivers to send acknowledgments in response to data packets. However, some part of the overall resource shall be allocated for the feedback channel, which reduces the amount of channel resources available for data transmission. In this paper, we consider a scenario with a platoon, which generates groupcast traffic, and surrounding vehicles, which generate legacy broadcast traffic. Using extensive simulations in NS-3, we analyze how the usage of the feedback channel influences the overall system capacity. Our results show that depending on the platoon size, groupcast, and broadcast traffic intensities, and their quality of service requirements, the usage of the feedback channel can in some cases significantly increase the system capacity (up to 2x), while in other cases it almost halves the system capacity. We explain the reasons for such effects and discuss how to adaptively select the feedback channel parameters.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Local Combining with Decentralized Decoding for Distributed Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major bottleneck in uplink distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output networks is the sub-optimal performance of local combining schemes, coupled with high fronthaul load and computational cost inherent in centralized large scale fading decoding (LSFD) architectures. This paper introduces a decentralized decoding architecture that fundamentally breaks from the conventional LSFD, by allowing each AP calculates interference-suppressing local weights independently and applies them to its data estimates before transmission. Furthermore, two generalized local zero-forcing (ZF) framework, generalized partial full-pilot ZF (G-PFZF) and generalized protected weak PFZF (G-PWPFZF), are introduced, where each access point (AP) adaptively and independently determines its combining strategy through a local sum spectral efficiency optimization that classifies user equipments (UEs) as strong or weak using only local information, eliminating the fixed thresholds used in PFZF and PWPFZF. To further enhance scalability, pilot-dependent combining vectors instead of user-dependent ones are introduced and are shared among users with the same pilot. The corresponding closed-form spectral efficiency expressions are derived. Numerical results show that the proposed generalized schemes consistently outperform fixed-threshold counterparts, while the introduction of local weights yields lower overhead and computation costs with minimal performance penalty compared to them.</description>

      <title>Pointing-Error-Induced Fading in an Open-Loop THz Uplink with Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the open-loop mechanical tracking performance of a sub-Terahertz (sub-THz) and Terahertz (THz) uplink communication system. These high-frequency bands enable multi-gigabit links through large bandwidths and narrow beams, but require precise pointing to overcome spreading loss. A tracking system can be used to orient horn antennas toward mobile targets. We develop a mathematical model that captures the mechanical dynamics of a real tracking system, which includes motion latency and acceleration and velocity limits, to quantify pointing errors during satellite passes and integrate these effects into the link budget. We evaluate the trade-offs between beam directionality and pointing tolerance across different Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite trajectories and control strategies. The results link the hardware limitations to the communications performance, providing design guidelines for high-frequency Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) uplink under practical mechanical constraints.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Cloud Framework for Zero-Trust Workload Authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Static, long-lived credentials for workload authentication create untenable security risks that violate Zero-Trust principles. This paper presents a multi-cloud framework using Workload Identity Federation (WIF) and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for secretless authentication. Our approach uses cryptographically-verified, ephemeral tokens, allowing workloads to authenticate without persistent private keys and mitigating credential theft. We validate this framework in an enterprise-scale Kubernetes environment, which significantly reduces the attack surface. The model offers a unified solution to manage workload identities across disparate clouds, enabling future implementation of robust, attribute-based access control.</description>

      <title>Heimdallr: Fingerprinting SD-WAN Control-Plane Architecture via Encrypted Control Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) has emerged as a new paradigm for steering a large-scale network flexibly by adopting distributed software-defined network (SDN) controllers. The key to building a logically centralized but physically distributed control-plane is running diverse cluster management protocols to achieve consistency through an exchange of control traffic. Meanwhile, we observe that the control traffic exposes unique time-series patterns and directional relationships due to the operational structure even though the traffic is encrypted, and this pattern can disclose confidential information such as control-plane topology and protocol dependencies, which can be exploited for severe attacks. With this insight, we propose a new SD-WAN fingerprinting system, called Heimdallr. It analyzes periodical and operational patterns of SD-WAN cluster management protocols and the context of flow directions from the collected control traffic utilizing a deep learning-based approach, so that it can classify the cluster management protocols automatically from miscellaneous control traffic datasets. Our evaluation, which is performed in a realistic SD-WAN environment consisting of geographically distant three campus networks and one enterprise network shows that Heimdallr can classify SD-WAN control traffic with $\geq$ 93%, identify individual protocols with $\geq$ 80% macro F-1 scores, and finally can infer control-plane topology with $\geq$ 70% similarity.</description>

      <title>Reimagining RDMA Through the Lens of ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As distributed machine learning (ML) workloads scale to thousands of GPUs connected by ultra-high-speed inter-connects, tail latency in collective communication has emerged as a primary bottleneck. Prior RDMA designs, like RoCE, IRN, and SRNIC, enforce strict reliability and in-order delivery, relying on retransmissions and packet sequencing to ensure correctness. While effective for general-purpose workloads, these mechanisms introduce complexity and latency that scale poorly, where even rare packet losses or delays can consistently degrade system performance. We introduce Celeris, a domain-specific RDMA transport that revisits traditional reliability guarantees based on ML's tolerance for lost or partial data. Celeris removes retransmissions and in-order delivery from the RDMA NIC, enabling best-effort transport that exploits the robustness of ML workloads. It retains congestion control (e.g., DCQCN) and manages communication with software-level mechanisms such as adaptive timeouts and data prioritization, while shifting loss recovery to the ML pipeline (e.g., using the Hadamard Transform). Early results show that Celeris reduces 99th-percentile latency by up to 2.3x, cuts BRAM usage by 67%, and nearly doubles NIC resilience to faults -- delivering a resilient, scalable transport tailored for ML at cluster scale.</description>

      <title>FIRE: A Failure-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Framework for Edge Computing Migrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14399v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In edge computing, users' service profiles are migrated due to user mobility. Reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks have been proposed to do so, often trained on simulated data. However, existing RL frameworks overlook occasional server failures, which although rare, impact latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving and real-time obstacle detection. Nevertheless, these failures (rare events), being not adequately represented in historical training data, pose a challenge for data-driven RL algorithms. As it is impractical to adjust failure frequency in real-world applications for training, we introduce FIRE, a framework that adapts to rare events by training a RL policy in an edge computing digital twin environment. We propose ImRE, an importance sampling-based Q-learning algorithm, which samples rare events proportionally to their impact on the value function. FIRE considers delay, migration, failure, and backup placement costs across individual and shared service profiles. We prove ImRE's boundedness and convergence to optimality. Next, we introduce novel deep Q-learning (ImDQL) and actor critic (ImACRE) versions of our algorithm to enhance scalability. We extend our framework to accommodate users with varying risk tolerances. Through trace driven experiments, we show that FIRE reduces costs compared to vanilla RL and the greedy baseline in the event of failures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous AI agents now operate across cloud, enterprise, and decentralized domains, creating demand for registry infrastructures that enable trustworthy discovery, capability negotiation, and identity assurance. We analyze five prominent approaches: (1) MCP Registry (centralized publication of mcp.json descriptors), (2) A2A Agent Cards (decentralized self-describing JSON capability manifests), (3) AGNTCY Agent Directory Service (IPFS Kademlia DHT content routing extended for semantic taxonomy-based content discovery, OCI artifact storage, and Sigstore-backed integrity), (4) Microsoft Entra Agent ID (enterprise SaaS directory with policy and zero-trust integration), and (5) NANDA Index AgentFacts (cryptographically verifiable, privacy-preserving fact model with credentialed assertions). Using four evaluation dimensions: security, authentication, scalability, and maintainability, we surface architectural trade-offs between centralized control, enterprise governance, and distributed resilience. We conclude with design recommendations for an emerging Internet of AI Agents requiring verifiable identity, adaptive discovery flows, and interoperable capability semantics.</description>

Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offload computationally intensive tasks to multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, enabling applications within the vehicular metaverse, which transforms physical environment into the digital space enabling advanced analysis or predictive modeling. A core challenge is physical-to-virtual (P2V) synchronization through digital twins (DTs), reliant on MEC networks and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). To address this, we introduce radiance field (RF) delta video compression (RFDVC), which uses RF-encoder and RF-decoder architecture using distributed RFs as DTs storing photorealistic 3D urban scenes in compressed form. This method extracts differences between CAV-frame capturing actual traffic and RF-frame capturing empty scene from the same camera pose in batches encoded and transmitted over the MEC network. Experiments show data savings up to 71% against H.264 codec and 44% against H.265 codec under different conditions as lighting changes, and rain. RFDVC also demonstrates resilience to transmission errors, significantly outperforming the standard codec in non-rainy conditions with up to a +0.26 structural similarity index measure (SSIM) improvement over H.264 codec, and maintaining a +0.18 SSIM improvement even in challenging rainy conditions, both measured at a block error rate (BLER) of 0.25.</description>
