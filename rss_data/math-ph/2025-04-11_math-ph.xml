      <title>Scenarios for magnetic X-point collapse in 2D incompressible dissipationless Hall magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equations of 2D incompressible dissipationless Hall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD), which couple the fluid velocity ${\bf V} = \wh{\sf z}\btimes\nabla\phi + V_{z}\,\wh{\sf z}$ with the magnetic field ${\bf B} = \nabla\psi\btimes\wh{\sf z} + B_{z}\,\wh{\sf z}$, are known to support solutions that exhibit finite-time singularities associated with magnetic X-point collapse in the plane $(B_{x} = \partial\psi/\partial y, B_{y} = -\,\partial\psi/\partial x)$. Here, by adopting a 2D self-similar model for the four HMHD fields $(\phi,\psi,V_{z},B_{z})$, which retains finite electron inertia, we obtain five coupled ordinary differential equations that are solved in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions based on an orbital classification associated with particle motion in a quartic potential. Excellent agreement is found when these analytical solutions are compared with numerical solutions, including the precise time of a magnetic X-point collapse.</description>

      <title>Mass-subcritical Half-Wave Equation with mixed nonlinearities: existence and non-existence of ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of existence of constrained minimizers for the focusing mass-subcritical Half-Wave equation with a defocusing mass-subcritical perturbation. We show the existence of a critical mass such that minimizers do exist for any mass larger than or equal to the critical one, and do not exist below it. At the dynamical level, in the one dimensional case, we show that the ground states are orbitally stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, for general convolution approximations to a large class of log-correlated Gaussian fields, the properly normalised supercritical Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures converge stably to a nontrivial limit. This limit depends on the choice of regularisation only through a multiplicative constant and can be characterised as an integrated atomic measure with a random intensity expressed in terms of the critical Gaussian multiplicative chaos.</description>

      <title>Four-loop renormalization with a cutoff in a sextic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum action for a three-dimensional real sextic model using the background field method is considered. Four-loop renormalization of this model is performed with a cutoff regularization in the coordinate representation. The coefficients for the renormalization constants are found, the applicability of the $\mathcal{R}$-operation within the proposed regularization is explicitly demonstrated, and the absence of nonlocal contributions is proved. Additionally, the explicit form of the singularities, power and logarithmic, as well as their dependence on the deformation of the Green's function are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new class of mock Eisenstein series, describe their modular properties, and write the partition rank generating function in terms of so-called partition traces of these. Moreover, we show the Fourier coefficients of the mock Eisenstein series are integral and we obtain a holomorphic anomaly equation for their completions.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram for intermittent maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the phase diagram for potentials in the space of H\"older continuous functions of a given exponent and for the dynamical system generated by a Pomeau--Manneville, or intermittent, map. There is always a phase where the unique Gibbs state exhibits intermittent behavior. It is the only phase for a specific range of values of the H\"older exponent. For the remaining values of the H\"older exponent, a second phase with stationary behavior emerges. In this case, a co-dimension 1 submanifold separates the intermittent and stationary phases. It coincides with the set of potentials at which the pressure function fails to be real-analytic. We also describe the relationship between the phase transition locus, (persistent) phase transitions in temperature, and ground states.</description>

      <title>SKK groups of manifolds and non-unitary invertible TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work considers the computation of controllable cut-and-paste groups $\mathrm{SKK}^{\xi}_n$ of manifolds with tangential structure $\xi:B_n\to BO_n$. To this end, we apply the work of Galatius-Madsen-Tillman-Weiss, Genauer and Schommer-Pries, who showed that for a wide range of structures $\xi$ these groups fit into a short exact sequence that relates them to bordism groups of $\xi$-manifolds with kernel generated by the disc-bounding $\xi$-sphere. The order of this sphere can be computed by knowing the possible values of the Euler characteristic of $\xi$-manifolds. We are thus led to address two key questions: the existence of $\xi$-manifolds with odd Euler characteristic of a given dimension and conditions for the exact sequence to admit a splitting. We resolve these questions in a wide range of cases.
  $\mathrm{SKK}$ groups are of interest in physics as they play a role in the classification of non-unitary invertible topological quantum field theories, which classify anomalies and symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of matter. Applying our topological results, we give a complete classification of non-unitary invertible topological quantum field theories in the tenfold way in dimensions 1-5.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic sine-Gordon model beyond the first threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, with a parameter $\beta^2 &gt; 0$, and its associated Gibbs dynamics on the two-dimensional torus. By introducing a physical space approach to the Fourier restriction norm method and establishing nonlinear dispersive smoothing for the imaginary multiplicative Gaussian chaos, we construct invariant Gibbs dynamics for the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model beyond the first threshold $\beta^2 = 2\pi$. The deterministic step of our argument hinges on establishing key bilinear estimates, featuring weighted bounds for a cone multiplier. Moreover, the probabilistic component involves a careful analysis of the imaginary Gaussian multiplicative chaos and reduces to integrating singularities along space-time light cones. As a by-product of our proof, we identify $\beta^2 = 6\pi$ as a critical threshold for the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, which is quite surprising given that the associated parabolic model has a critical threshold at $\beta^2 =8\pi$.</description>

      <title>Embezzlement of entanglement, quantum fields, and the classification of von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07299v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum information theoretic task of embezzlement of entanglement in the setting of von Neumann algebras. Given a shared entangled resource state, this task asks to produce arbitrary entangled states using local operations without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. We quantify the performance of a given resource state by the worst-case error. States for which the latter vanishes are 'embezzling states' as they allow to embezzle arbitrary entangled states with arbitrarily small error. The best and worst performance among all states defines two algebraic invariants for von Neumann algebras. The first invariant takes only two values. Either it vanishes and embezzling states exist, which can only happen in type III, or no state allows for nontrivial embezzlement. In the case of factors not of finite type I, the second invariant equals the diameter of the state space. This provides a quantitative operational interpretation of Connes' classification of type III factors within quantum information theory. Type III$_1$ factors are 'universal embezzlers' where every state is embezzling. Our findings have implications for relativistic quantum field theory, where type III algebras naturally appear. For instance, they explain the maximal violation of Bell inequalities in the vacuum. Our results follow from a one-to-one correspondence between embezzling states and invariant probability measures on the flow of weights. We also establish that universally embezzling ITPFI factors are of type III$_1$ by elementary arguments.</description>

      <title>A Convenient Representation Theory of Lorentzian Pseudo-Tensors: $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ in $\operatorname{O}(1,3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel approach to the finite dimensional representation theory of the entire Lorentz group $\operatorname{O}(1,3)$ is presented. It is shown how the entire Lorentz group may be understood as a semi-direct product between its identity component and the Klein four group of spacetime reflections: $\operatorname{O}(1,3) = \operatorname{SO}^+(1,3) \rtimes \operatorname{K}_4$. This gives way to a convenient classification of tensors transforming under $\operatorname{O}(1,3)$, namely that there are four representations of $\operatorname{O}(1,3)$ for each representation of $\operatorname{SO}^+(1,3)$, and it is shown how the representation theory of the Klein group $\operatorname{K}_4$ allows for simple book keeping of the spacetime reflection properties of general Lorentzian tensors, and combinations thereof, with several examples given. There is a brief discussion of the time reversal of the electromagnetic field, concluding in agreement with standard texts such as Jackson, and works by Malament.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Scattering Relation for the Toda Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Toda lattice $(\boldsymbol{p}(t); \boldsymbol{q}(t))$ at thermal equilibrium, meaning that its variables $(p_i)$ and $(e^{q_i-q_{i+1}})$ are independent Gaussian and Gamma random variables, respectively. We justify the notion from the physics literature that this model can be thought of as a dense collection of ``quasiparticles'' that act as solitons by, (i) precisely defining the locations of these quasiparticles; (ii) showing that local charges and currents for the Toda lattice are well-approximated by simple functions of the quasiparticle data; and (iii) proving an asymptotic scattering relation that governs the dynamics of the quasiparticle locations. Our arguments are based on analyzing properties about eigenvector entries of the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix, particularly, their rates of exponential decay and their evolutions under inverse scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Toda lattice $(\boldsymbol{p}(t); \boldsymbol{q}(t))$ at thermal equilibrium, meaning that its variables $(p_i)$ and $(e^{q_i-q_{i+1}})$ are independent Gaussian and Gamma random variables, respectively. This model can be thought of a dense collection of many ``quasiparticles'' that act as solitons. We establish a law of large numbers for the trajectory of these quasiparticles, showing that they travel with approximately constant velocities, which are explicit. Our proof is based on a direct analysis of the asymptotic scattering relation, an equation (proven in previous work of the author) that approximately governs the dynamics of quasiparticles locations. This makes use of a regularization argument that essentially linearizes this relation, together with concentration estimates for the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix.</description>

      <title>Long-Moody construction of braid group representations and Haraoka's multiplicative middle convolution for KZ-type equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a correspondence between algebraic and analytic approaches to constructing representations of the braid group $B_n$, namely Katz-Long-Moody construction and multiplicative middle convolution for Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ)-type equations, respectively. The Katz-Long-Moody construction yields an infinite sequence of representations of $F_n \rtimes B_n$. On the other hand, the fundamental group of the domain of the $n$-valued KZ-type equation is isomorphic to the pure braid group $P_n$. The multiplicative middle convolution for the KZ-type equation provides an analytical framework for constructing (anti-)representations of $P_n$. Furthermore, we show that this construction preserves unitarity relative to a Hermitian matrix and establish an algorithm to determine the signature of the Hermitian matrix.</description>

      <title>Intertwining the Busemann process of the directed polymer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10531v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Busemann process and competition interfaces of the planar directed polymer model with i.i.d.\ weights on the vertices of the planar square lattice, in both the general case and the solvable inverse-gamma case. We prove new regularity properties of the Busemann process without reliance on unproved assumptions on the shape function. For example, each nearest-neighbor Busemann function is strictly monotone and has the same random set of discontinuities in the direction variable. When all Busemann functions on a horizontal line are viewed together, the Busemann process intertwines with an evolution that obeys a version of the geometric Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence. When specialized to the inverse-gamma case, this relationship enables an explicit distributional description: the Busemann function on a nearest-neighbor edge has independent increments in the direction variable, and its distribution comes from an inhomogeneous planar Poisson process. The distribution of the asymptotic competition interface direction of the inverse-gamma polymer is discrete and supported on the Busemann discontinuities which -- unlike in zero-temperature last-passage percolation -- are dense. Further implications follow for the eternal solutions and the failure of the one force -- one solution principle of the discrete stochastic heat equation solved by the polymer partition function.</description>

Abstract: We study the distribution of overlaps with the computational basis of a quantum state generated under generic quantum many-body chaotic dynamics, without conserved quantities, for a finite time $t$. We argue that, scaling time logarithmically with the system size $t \propto \log L$, the overlap distribution converges to a universal form in the thermodynamic limit, forming a one-parameter family that generalizes the celebrated Porter-Thomas distribution. The form of the overlap distribution only depends on the spatial dimensionality and, remarkably, on the boundary conditions. This picture is justified in general by a mapping to Ginibre ensemble of random matrices and corroborated by the exact solution of a random quantum circuit. Our results derive from an analysis of arbitrary overlap moments, enabling the reconstruction of the distribution. Our predictions also apply to Floquet circuits, i.e., in the presence of mild quenched disorder. Finally, numerical simulations of two distinct random circuits show excellent agreement, thereby demonstrating universality.</description>

Abstract: Time crystals are many-body systems that spontaneously break time-translation symmetry, and thus exhibit long-range spatiotemporal order and robust periodic motion. Recent results have demonstrated how to build time-crystal phases in driven diffusive fluids using an external packing field coupled to density fluctuations. Here we exploit this mechanism to engineer and control on-demand custom continuous time crystals characterized by an arbitrary number of rotating condensates, which can be further enhanced with higher-order modes. We elucidate the underlying critical point, as well as general properties of the condensates density profiles and velocities, demonstrating a scaling property of higher-order traveling condensates in terms of first-order ones. We illustrate our findings by solving the hydrodynamic equations for various paradigmatic driven diffusive systems, obtaining along the way a number of remarkable results, e.g. the possibility of explosive time crystal phases characterized by an abrupt, first-order-type transition. Overall, these results demonstrate the versatility and broad possibilities of this promising route to time crystals.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Classical Dynamics with Random Permutation Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is among the most enduring problems in modern physics. A particularly interesting question concerns the role played by quantum mechanics in this process, i.e. whether thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is fundamentally different from that in classical many-body systems and, if so, which of its features are genuinely quantum. Here we study this question in minimally structured many-body systems which are only constrained to have local interactions, i.e. local random circuits. We introduce a class of random permutation circuits (RPCs), where the gates locally permute basis states modelling generic microscopic classical dynamics, and compare them to random unitary circuits (RUCs), a standard toy model for generic quantum dynamics. We show that, like RUCs, RPCs permit the analytical computation of several key quantities such as out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs), or entanglement entropies. RPCs can be interpreted both as quantum or classical dynamics, which we use to find similarities and differences between the two. Performing the average over all random circuits, we discover a series of exact relations, connecting quantities in RUC and (quantum) RPCs. In the classical setting, we obtain similar exact results relating (quantum) purity to (classical) growth of mutual information and (quantum) OTOCs to (classical) decorrelators. Our results indicate that despite of the fundamental differences between quantum and classical systems, their dynamics exhibits qualitatively similar behaviours.</description>

      <title>A reduction theorem for good basic invariants of finite complex reflection groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a sequel to our previous article arXiv:2307.07897. We describe a certain reduction process of Satake's good basic invariants. We show that if the largest degree $d_1$ of a finite complex reflection group $G$ is regular and if $\delta$ is a divisor of $d_1$, a set of good basic invariants of $G$ induces that of the reflection subquotient $G_{\delta}$. We also show that the potential vector field of a duality group $G$, which gives the multiplication constants of the natural Saito structure on the orbit space, induces that of $G_{\delta}$. Several examples of this reduction process are also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an explicit expression for the inverse of the symmetric bilinear form of Virasoro Verma modules, the so-called Shapovalov form, in terms of singular vector operators and their conformal dimensions. Our proposed expression also determines the resolution of the identity for Verma modules of the Virasoro algebra, and can be thus employed in the computation of Virasoro conformal blocks via the sewing procedure.</description>

      <title>Harmonic, Holomorphic and Rational Maps from Self-Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the so-called rational map ansatz on the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$, for any compact simple Lie group $G$ such that $G/{\widehat K}\otimes U(1)$ is an Hermitian symmetric space, for some subgroup ${\widehat K}$ of $G$. It generalizes the rational maps on the two-sphere $SU(2)/U(1)$, and also on $CP^N=SU(N+1)/SU(N)\otimes U(1)$, and opens up the way for applications of such ans\"atze on non-linear sigma models, Skyrme theory and magnetic monopoles in Yang-Mills-Higgs theories. Our construction is based on a well known mathematical result stating that stable harmonic maps $X$ from the two-sphere $S^2$ to compact Hermitian symmetric spaces $G/{\widehat K}\otimes U(1)$ are holomorphic or anti-holomorphic. We derive such a mathematical result using ideas involving the concept of self-duality, in a way that makes it more accessible to theoretical physicists. Using a topological (homotopic) charge that admits an integral representation, we construct first order partial differential self-duality equations such that their solutions also solve the (second order) Euler-Lagrange associated to the harmonic map energy $E=\int_{S^2} \mid dX\mid^2 d\mu$. We show that such solutions saturate a lower bound on the energy $E$, and that the self-duality equations constitute the Cauchy-Riemann equations for the maps $X$. Therefore, they constitute harmonic and (anti)holomorphic maps, and lead to the generalization of the rational map ans\"atze in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We apply our results to construct approximate Skyrme solutions for the $SU(N)$ Skyrme model.</description>

      <title>Probability Distribution for Vacuum Energy Flux Fluctuations in Two Spacetime Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The probability distribution for vacuum fluctuations of the energy flux in two dimensions will be constructed, along with the joint distribution of energy flux and energy density. Our approach will be based on previous work on probability distributions for the energy density in two dimensional conformal field theory. In both cases, the relevant stress tensor component must be averaged in time, and the results are sensitive to the form of the averaging function. Here we present results for two classes of such functions, which include the Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. The distribution for the energy flux is symmetric, unlike that for the energy density. In both cases, the distribution may possess an integrable singularity. The functional form of the flux distribution function involves a modified Bessel function, and is distinct from the shifted Gamma form for the energy density. By considering the joint distribution of energy flux and energy density, we show that the distribution of energy flux tends to be more centrally concentrated than that of the energy density. We also determine the distribution of energy fluxes, conditioned on the energy density being negative. Some applications of the results will be discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider finite-dimensional many-body quantum systems described by time-independent Hamiltonians and Markovian master equations, and present a systematic method for constructing smaller-dimensional, reduced models that exactly reproduce the time evolution of a set of initial conditions or observables of interest. Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers. Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.</description>

      <title>Manifolds of exceptional points and effective Zeno limit of an open two-qubit system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically investigate the Liouvillian exceptional point manifolds (LEPMs) of a two-qubit open system, where one qubit is coupled to a dissipative polarization bath. Exploiting a Z_2 symmetry, we block-diagonalize the Liouvillian and show that one symmetry block yields two planar LEPMs while the other one exhibits a more intricate, multi-sheet topology. The intersection curves of these manifolds provide a phase diagram for effective Zeno transitions at small dissipation. These results are consistent with a perturbative extrapolation from the strong Zeno regime. Interestingly, we find that the fastest relaxation to the non-equilibrium steady state occurs on LEPMs associated with the transition to the effective Zeno regime.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish new Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact Riemannian manifolds in the case of wave, Klein-Gordon and fractional Schr\"odinger equations. Our results generalize the classical (single-function) Strichartz estimates on compact manifolds by Kapitanski, Burq-G\'erard-Tzvetkov, Dinh, and extend the Euclidean orthonormal version by Frank-Lewin-Lieb-Seiringer, Frank-Sabin, Bez-Lee-Nakamura. On the flat torus, our new results for the Schr\"odinger equation cover prior work of Nakamura, which exploits the dispersive estimate of Kenig-Ponce-Vega. We achieve sharp results on compact manifolds by combining the frequency localized dispersive estimates for small time intervals with the duality principle due to Frank-Sabin. We construct examples to show these results can be saturated on the sphere, and we can improve them on the flat torus by establishing new decoupling inequalities for certain non-smooth hypersurfaces. As an application, we obtain the well-posedness of infinite systems of dispersive equations with Hartree-type nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Logging the conformal life of Ramanujan's $\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1914, Ramanujan presented 17 infinite series for $1/\pi$. We examine the physics origin of these remarkable formulae by connecting them to 2D logarithmic conformal field theories (LCFTs) which arise in various contexts such as the fractional quantum hall effect, percolation and polymers. In light of the LCFT connection, we investigate such infinite series in terms of the physics data, i.e., the operator spectrum and OPE coefficients of the CFT and the conformal block expansion. These considerations lead to novel approximations for $1/\pi$. The rapid convergence of the Ramanujan series motivates us to take advantage of the crossing symmetry of the LCFT correlators to find new and efficient representations. To achieve this, we use the parametric crossing symmetric dispersion relation which was recently developed for string amplitudes. Quite strikingly, we find remarkable simplifications in the new representations, where, in the Legendre relation, the entire contribution to $1/\pi$ comes from the logarithmic identity operator, hinting at a universal property of LCFTs. Additionally, the dispersive representation gives us a new handle on the double-lightcone limit.</description>

      <title>Universal inverse Radon transforms: Inhomogeneity, angular restrictions and boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An alternative method to invert the Radon transforms without the use of Courant-Hilbert's identities has been proposed and developed independently from the space dimension. For the universal representation of inverse Radon transform, we study the consequences of inhomogeneity of outset function without the restrictions on the angular Radon coordinates. We show that this inhomogeneity yields a natural evidence for the presence of the extra contributions in the case of the full angular region. In addition, if the outset function is well-localized in the space, we demonstrate that the corresponding boundary conditions and the angular restrictions should be applied for both the direct and inverse Radon transforms. Besides, we relate the angular restrictions on the Radon variable to the boundary exclusion of outset function and its Radon image.</description>
