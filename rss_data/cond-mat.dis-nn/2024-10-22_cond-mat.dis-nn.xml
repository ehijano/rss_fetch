      <title>Many-body enhancement of energy storage in a waveguide-QED quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum batteries have demonstrated remarkable charging properties, showing that a quantum advantage is possible in the realm of quantum thermodynamics. However, finding an effective strategy to store energy for long periods remains crucial in these systems. Here, we investigate different configurations of a waveguide-QED system acting as a quantum battery and show that, in this context, collective effects can slow down the self-discharging time of the battery, thus improving the storage time. Specifically, when the artificial atoms of the array are arranged randomly, the energy and ergotropy of the optical system are shown to decay at a subexponential rate over long periods, in contrast to the energy decay of a single atom in a waveguide. In the case of atoms arranged in an ordered lattice, collective effects slow down dissipative discharging only for a specific lattice spacing. Thus, in both configurations, collective effects can be used to boost the energy-protection properties of optical systems.</description>

      <title>Global Topological Dirac Synchronization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is a fundamental dynamical state of interacting oscillators, observed in natural biological rhythms and in the brain. Global synchronization which occurs when non-linear or chaotic oscillators placed on the nodes of a network display the same dynamics as received great attention in network theory. Here we propose and investigate Global Topological Dirac Synchronization on higher-order networks such as cell and simplicial complexes. This is a state where oscillators associated to simplices and cells of arbitrary dimension, coupled by the Topological Dirac operator, operate at unison. By combining algebraic topology with non-linear dynamics and machine learning, we derive the topological conditions under which this state exists and the dynamical conditions under which it is stable. We provide evidence of 1-dimensional simplicial complexes (networks) and 2-dimensional simplicial and cell complexes where Global Topological Dirac Synchronization can be observed. Our results point out that Global Topological Dirac Synchronization is a possible dynamical state of simplicial and cell complexes that occur only in some specific network topologies and geometries, the latter ones being determined by the weights of the higher-order networks</description>

      <title>Nanothermodynamics: There's plenty of room on the inside</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanothermodynamics provides the theoretical foundation for understanding stable distributions of statistically independent subsystems inside larger systems. In this review it is emphasized that adapting ideas from nanothermodynamics to simplistic models improves agreement with the measured properties of many materials. Examples include non-classical critical scaling near ferromagnetic transitions, thermal and dynamic behavior near liquid-glass transitions, and the 1/f-like noise in metal films and qubits. A key feature in several models is to allow separate time steps for distinct conservation laws: one type of step conserves energy and the other conserves momentum (e.g. dipole alignment). This "orthogonal dynamics" explains how the relaxation of a single parameter can exhibit multiple responses such as primary, secondary, and microscopic peaks in the dielectric loss of supercooled liquids, and the crossover in thermal fluctuations from Johnson-Nyquist (white) noise at high frequencies to 1/f-like noise at low frequencies. Nanothermodynamics also provides new insight into three basic questions. First, it gives a novel solution to Gibbs' paradox for the entropy of the semi-classical ideal gas. Second, it yields the stable equilibrium of Ising's original model for finite-sized chains of interacting binary degrees of freedom ("spins"). Third, it confronts Loschmidt's paradox for the arrow of time, showing that an intrinsically irreversible step is required for maximum entropy and the second law of thermodynamics, not only in the thermodynamic limit but also in systems as small as N=2 particles</description>

      <title>Interplay of Quantum and Thermal Fluctuations in Two-Dimensional Randomly Pinned Charge Density Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations in the presence of quenched random disorder is a long-standing open theoretical problem which has been made more urgent by advances in modern experimental techniques. The fragility of charge density wave order to impurities makes this problem of particular interest in understanding a host of real materials, including the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. To address this question, we consider the quantum version of an exactly solvable classical model of two-dimensional randomly pinned incommensurate charge density waves first introduced by us in a recent work, and use the large-$N$ technique to obtain the phase diagram and order parameter correlations. Our theory considers quantum and thermal fluctuations and disorder on equal footing by accounting for all effects non-perturbatively, which reveals a novel crossover between under-damped and over-damped dynamics of the fluctuations of the charge density wave order parameter.</description>

      <title>Neural network distillation of orbital dependent density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) offers a desirable balance between quantitative accuracy and computational efficiency in practical many-electron calculations. Its central component, the exchange-correlation energy functional, has been approximated with increasing levels of complexity ranging from strictly local approximations to nonlocal and orbital-dependent expressions with many tuned parameters. In this work, we formulate a general way of rewriting complex density functionals using deep neural networks in a way that allows for simplified computation of Kohn-Sham potentials as well as higher functional derivatives through automatic differentiation, enabling access to highly nonlinear response functions and forces. These goals are achieved by using a recently developed class of robust neural network models capable of modeling functionals, as opposed to functions, with explicitly enforced spatial symmetries. Functionals treated in this way are then called global density approximations and can be seamlessly integrated with existing DFT workflows. Tests are performed for a dataset featuring a large variety of molecular structures and popular meta-GGA density functionals, where we successfully eliminate orbital dependencies coming from the kinetic energy density, and discover a high degree of transferability to a variety of physical systems. The presented framework is general and could be extended to more complex orbital and energy dependent functionals as well as refined with specialized datasets.</description>

      <title>Building Conformal Prediction Intervals with Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction has emerged as a powerful tool for building prediction intervals that are valid in a distribution-free way. However, its evaluation may be computationally costly, especially in the high-dimensional setting where the dimensionality and sample sizes are both large and of comparable magnitudes. To address this challenge in the context of generalized linear regression, we propose a novel algorithm based on Approximate Message Passing (AMP) to accelerate the computation of prediction intervals using full conformal prediction, by approximating the computation of conformity scores. Our work bridges a gap between modern uncertainty quantification techniques and tools for high-dimensional problems involving the AMP algorithm. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real data, and show that it produces prediction intervals that are close to the baseline methods, while being orders of magnitude faster. Additionally, in the high-dimensional limit and under assumptions on the data distribution, the conformity scores computed by AMP converge to the one computed exactly, which allows theoretical study and benchmarking of conformal methods in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Critical Phase Transition in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance. To understand their behaviors, we need to consider the fact that LLMs sometimes show qualitative changes. The natural world also presents such changes called phase transitions, which are defined by singular, divergent statistical quantities. Therefore, an intriguing question is whether qualitative changes in LLMs are phase transitions. In this work, we have conducted extensive analysis on texts generated by LLMs and suggested that a phase transition occurs in LLMs when varying the temperature parameter. Specifically, statistical quantities have divergent properties just at the point between the low-temperature regime, where LLMs generate sentences with clear repetitive structures, and the high-temperature regime, where generated sentences are often incomprehensible. In addition, critical behaviors near the phase transition point, such as a power-law decay of correlation and slow convergence toward the stationary state, are similar to those in natural languages. Our results suggest a meaningful analogy between LLMs and natural phenomena.</description>

      <title>Estimating predictability of depinning dynamics by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the future behaviour of complex systems exhibiting critical-like dynamics is often considered to be an intrinsically hard task. Here, we study the predictability of the depinning dynamics of elastic interfaces in random media driven by a slowly increasing external force, a paradigmatic complex system exhibiting critical avalanche dynamics linked to a continuous non-equilibrium depinning phase transition. To this end, we train a variety of machine learning models to infer the mapping from features of the initial relaxed line shape and the random pinning landscape to predict the sample-dependent staircase-like force-displacement curve that emerges from the depinning process. Even if for a given realization of the quenched random medium the dynamics are in principle deterministic, we find that there is an exponential decay of the predictability with the displacement of the line, quantifying how the system forgets its initial state as it nears the depinning transition from below. Our analysis on how the related displacement scale depends on the system size and the dimensionality of the input descriptor reveals that the onset of the depinning phase transition gives rise to fundamental limits to predictability.</description>

      <title>The Persian Rug: solving toy models of superposition using large-scale symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a complete mechanistic description of the algorithm learned by a minimal non-linear sparse data autoencoder in the limit of large input dimension. The model, originally presented in arXiv:2209.10652, compresses sparse data vectors through a linear layer and decompresses using another linear layer followed by a ReLU activation. We notice that when the data is permutation symmetric (no input feature is privileged) large models reliably learn an algorithm that is sensitive to individual weights only through their large-scale statistics. For these models, the loss function becomes analytically tractable. Using this understanding, we give the explicit scalings of the loss at high sparsity, and show that the model is near-optimal among recently proposed architectures. In particular, changing or adding to the activation function any elementwise or filtering operation can at best improve the model's performance by a constant factor. Finally, we forward-engineer a model with the requisite symmetries and show that its loss precisely matches that of the trained models. Unlike the trained model weights, the low randomness in the artificial weights results in miraculous fractal structures resembling a Persian rug, to which the algorithm is oblivious. Our work contributes to neural network interpretability by introducing techniques for understanding the structure of autoencoders.
