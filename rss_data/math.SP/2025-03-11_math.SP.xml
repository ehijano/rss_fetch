      <title>Some results on semiclassical spectral analysis of magnetic Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our recent papers, we studied semiclassical spectral problems for the Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator on a manifold of bounded geometry. We survey some results of these papers in the setting of the magnetic Schr\"odinger operator in the Euclidean space and describe some ideas of the proofs.</description>

      <title>The second Dirichlet eigenvalue over any non-equilateral triangle is simple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a triangle that collapses into a line segment diverge to infinity. In this paper, to track the behavior of the eigenvalues during the collapsing process of a triangle, we establish a quantitative error estimate for the Dirichlet eigenvalues on collapsing triangles. As an application, we solve the open problem concerning the simplicity of the second Dirichlet eigenvalue for nearly degenerate triangles, offering a complete solution to Conjecture 6.47 posed by R. Laugesen and B. Siudeja in A. Henrot's book ``Shape Optimization and Spectral Theory".</description>

      <title>A Spectral Theory of Scalar Volterra Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volterra integral and integro-differential equations have been extensively studied in both pure mathematics and applied science. In one direction, developments in analysis have yielded far-ranging existence, uniqueness, and regularity results. In the other, applications in science have inspired a substantial library of practical techniques to deal with such equations.
  The present work connects these research areas by examining five large classes of linear Volterra equations: integral and integro-differential equations with completely monotone (CM) kernels, corresponding to linear viscoelastic models; those with positive definite (PD) kernels, corresponding to partially-observed quantum systems; difference equations with PD kernels; a class of generalized delay differential equations; and a class of generalized fractional differential equations. We develop a system of correspondences between these problems, showing that all five can be understood within the same, spectral theory. We leverage this theory to recover practical, closed-form solutions of all five classes, and we show that interconversion yields a natural, continuous involution within each class. Our work unifies several results from science: the interconversion formula of Gross, recent results in viscoelasticity and operator theory for integral equations of the second type, classical formulas for Prony series and fractional differential equations, and the convergence of Prony series to CM kernels. Finally, our theory yields a novel, geometric construction of the regularized Hilbert transform, extends it to a wide class of infinite measures, and reveals a natural connection to delay and fractional differential equations.
  We leverage our theory to develop a powerful, spectral method to handle scalar Volterra equations numerically, and illustrate it with a number of practical examples.</description>

      <title>Rigorous estimation for the difference quotients of multiple eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14063v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spectral theory, the multiplicity of nearly degenerate eigenvalues presents significant challenges. This paper introduces a new difference quotient formula to capture the behavior of nearly degenerate Laplacian eigenvalues resulting from domain perturbations. Additionally, we propose a novel numerical algorithm for rigorously estimating the difference quotient of these multiple eigenvalues in response to domain deformation, using a recently developed guaranteed computation method for eigenvalue problems. As an application, we solve the open problem of the simplicity of the second Dirichlet eigenvalue for nearly equilateral triangles, offering a partial solution to Conjecture 6.47 in A. Henrot's book ``Shape Optimization and Spectral Theory."</description>

      <title>Eventually positive semigroups: spectral and asymptotic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral theory of semigroup generators is a crucial tool for analysing the asymptotic properties of operator semigroups. Typically, Tauberian theorems, such as the ABLV theorem, demand extensive information about the spectrum to derive convergence results. However, the scenario is significantly simplified for positive semigroups on Banach lattices. This observation extends to the broader class of eventually positive semigroups -- a phenomenon observed in various concrete differential equations. In this paper, we investigate the spectral and asymptotic properties of eventually positive semigroups, focusing particularly on the persistently irreducible case. Our findings expand upon the existing theory of eventual positivity, offering new insights into the cyclicity of the peripheral spectrum and asymptotic trends. Notably, several arguments for positive operators and semigroups do not apply in our context, necessitating the use of ultrapower arguments to circumvent these challenges.</description>
