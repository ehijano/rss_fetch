      <title>Improved Quantum Sensing by Spectral Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how unitary control can improve parameter estimation by designing the effective spectrum of the imprinting Hamiltonian. We show that, for commuting Hamiltonians, the general problem of spectral manipulation via unitary control simplifies to a finite sequence of elementary switching operations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that any desired relative spacing of energy levels can be achieved. We also show that any modified spectrum can be expressed as a convex combination of the original eigenvalues, with the convex weights forming a bi-stochastic matrix. Through several single-parameter estimation examples, we demonstrate that our spectral engineering method substantially enhances estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Resource-Efficient Simulations of Particle Scattering on a Digital Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and demonstrate methods for simulating the scattering of particle wave packets in the interacting Thirring model on digital quantum computers, with hardware implementations on up to 80 qubits. We identify low-entanglement time slices of the scattering dynamics and exploit their efficient representation by tensor networks. Circuit compression based on matrix product state techniques yields on average a reduction by a factor of 3.2 in circuit depth compared to conventional approaches, allowing longer evolution times to be evaluated with higher fidelity on contemporary quantum processors. Utilizing zero-noise extrapolation in combination with Pauli twirling, on quantum hardware we accurately simulate the full scattering dynamics on 40 qubits, and further demonstrate the wave packet state-preparation on 80 qubits.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of colored-noise-driven stochastic Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effect of colored stochastic noise as a source of fluctuations in the dynamics of a two-level system, e.g. the states of a qubit system or two local sites in a transfer problem. We derive the stochastic Schr\"odinger equations (SSE) and related quantum master equations (QME) for the average density matrix for different stochastic potentials. We compare the case of memory and memoryless processes, which reflect different short-time behaviors and, in some cases, can lead to different stationary distributions of the average system state. Focusing on the use of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck coloured noise driving the dynamics, in the same fashion as the white noise is the formal derivative of a Wiener process, we shed light on how different dissipative terms of a generic QME arise depending on the nature of the stochastic potential involved, and their effect on the short and long time evolution of the system. We rationalize the emergence of the different terms in terms of the time- and frequency-dependent coefficients Redfield QME. Within this framework, we explicitly derive a closure model for the open terms in the QME derived from the SSE approach, and clarify how colored noise impacts the coherence relaxation time scales</description>

      <title>Shallow quantum circuit for generating O(1)-entanged approximate state designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information science, including quantum cryptography, quantum simulation, and benchmarking quantum devices. In this work, we discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. We show that those resources such quantum states can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\Omega\left(\log (t/\epsilon)\right)$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\epsilon$, those resources do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$ in the system. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states. To this end, we develop an algorithm that transforms $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones through a sequence of multi-controlled gates, without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit is $O\left(t [\log t]^3 \log n \log(1/\epsilon)\right)$, which is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of shallow quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in various quantum information processing tasks. As a concrete example for demonstrating utility of our algorithm, we propose classical shadow tomography using an $O(1)$-entangled estimator, which can achieve shorter runtime compared to conventional schemes.</description>

      <title>Stability of Continuous Time Quantum Walks in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of continuous time quantum walks (CTQWs) in a range of network topologies under different decoherence mechanisms, defining stability as the system's ability to preserve quantum properties over time. The networks studied range from homogeneous to heterogeneous structures, including cycle, complete, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, small-world, scale-free, and star topologies. The decoherence models considered are intrinsic decoherence, Haken-Strobl noise, and quantum stochastic walks (QSWs). To assess quantum stability, we employ several metrics: node occupation probabilities, the $\ell_1$-norm of coherence, fidelity with the initial state, quantum-classical distance, and von Neumann entropy. Our results reveal that the interplay of both network topology and decoherence model influences coherence preservation. Intrinsic decoherence results in the slowest decay of coherence, followed by Haken-Strobl noise, while QSW causes the most rapid loss of coherence. The stability ranking among network topologies varies depending on the decoherence model and quantifier used. For example, under Haken-Strobl and intrinsic decoherence, the quantum-classical distance ranks the cycle network more stable than scale-free networks, although other metrics consistently favour scale-free topologies. In general, heterogeneous networks, such as star and scale-free networks, exhibit the highest stability, whereas homogeneous topologies, such as cycle and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks, are more vulnerable to decoherence. The complete graph, despite its homogeneity, remains highly stable due to its dense connectivity. Furthermore, in heterogeneous networks, the centrality of the initialised node, measured by degree or closeness, has a pronounced impact on stability, underscoring the role of local topological features in quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher Information in Curved Spacetime: Dirac Particles in Noisy Channels around a Schwarzschild Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information processing promises significant advantages over classical methods but remains vulnerable to decoherence induced by environmental interactions and spacetime effects. This work investigates the behavior of Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) as a diagnostic tool for entanglement and parameter estimation in a three-qubit entangled Dirac system subjected to dissipative noisy channels in the curved spacetime of a Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, we examine the influence of the squeezed generalized amplitude damping (SGAD) channel, along with its subchannels -- generalized amplitude damping (GAD) and amplitude damping (AD) -- on the QFI with respect to entanglement weight ($\theta$) and phase ($\phi$) parameters. Our results show that under strong squeezing ($r = 1$), the QFI with respect to $\theta$ becomes completely resistant to variations in the Hawking temperature ($T_H$), while still exhibiting degradation with increasing channel temperature ($T_C$). The QFI decay is significantly slower at $r = 1$ compared to $r = 0$, suggesting that squeezing can function as an error mitigation strategy. For QFI with respect to $\phi$, a transient spike is observed at $T_C = 2$, potentially due to thermal resonance or non-monotonic decoherence, and this behavior is unaffected by $T_H$. Similar patterns are noted in the GAD and AD channels, where $T_C$ consistently dominates as the principal source of decoherence. Overall, the results highlight the intricate interplay between environmental noise, relativistic effects, and quantum error resilience in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Tensorial Spin-Phonon Relaxation Reveals Mode-Selective Relaxation Pathways in a Single-Molecule Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling spin relaxation in molecular qubits is essential for developing chemically tunable quantum information platforms. We present a fully first-principles framework for computing the spin relaxation tensor in a single-molecule magnet, \ce{VOPc(OH)8}, by combining density functional theory with a mode-resolved open-system formalism. By expanding the spin Hamiltonian in vibrational normal modes and evaluating both linear and quadratic spin-phonon coupling tensors via finite differences of the $g$-tensor, we construct a relaxation tensor that enters a Lindblad-type quantum master equation. Our formalism captures both direct (one-phonon) and resonant-Raman (two-phonon) relaxation processes. Numerical analysis reveals a highly mode-selective structure: only three vibrational modes dominate longitudinal ($T_1$) decoherence, while a single mode accounts for the majority of transverse ($T_2$) relaxation. The computed relaxation times show excellent agreement with experimental measurements, without any empirical fitting. These results demonstrate that first-principles spin-phonon tensors can provide predictive insight into decoherence pathways and guide the rational design of molecular qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces an innovative interactive visualization tool designed to demystify quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms. Our work is inspired by the success of classical machine learning visualization tools, such as TensorFlow Playground, and aims to bridge the gap in visualization resources specifically for the field of QML. The article includes a comprehensive overview of relevant visualization metaphors from both quantum computing and classical machine learning, the development of an algorithm visualization concept, and the design of a concrete implementation as an interactive web application. By combining common visualization metaphors for the so-called data re-uploading universal quantum classifier as a representative QML model, this article aims to lower the entry barrier to quantum computing and encourage further innovation in the field. The accompanying interactive application is a proposal for the first version of a quantum machine learning playground for learning and exploring QML models.</description>

      <title>Qubit encodings for lattices of dipolar planar rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near term quantum devices have recently garnered significant interest as promising candidates for investigating difficult-to-probe regimes in many-body physics. To this end, various qubit encoding schemes targeting second quantized Hamiltonians have been proposed and optimized. In this work, we investigate two qubit representations of the planar rotor lattice Hamiltonian. The first representation is realized by decomposing the rotor Hamiltonian projectors in binary and mapping them to spin-1/2 projectors. The second approach relies on embedding the planar rotor lattice Hilbert space in a larger space and recovering the relevant qubit encoded system as a quotient space projecting down to the physical degrees of freedom. This is typically called the unary mapping and is used for bosonic systems. We establish the veracity of the two encoding approaches using sparse diagonalization on small chains and discuss quantum phase estimation resource requirements to simulate small planar rotor lattices on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pushing the boundaries of measurement precision is central for sensing and metrology, pursued by nonclassical resources such as squeezing, and non-Hermitian degeneracies with distinct spectral response. Their convergence, however, remains challenging. We find extraordinary enhancement of sensitivity by unifying both effects in a general framework for quantum sensing in open systems. At the parametric oscillation threshold and an exceptional point, the sensing precision exhibits a unique quartic scaling with the perturbation strength. The result generalizes to multimode squeezed-state sensors with higher-order exceptional points catered to various quantum sensing platforms.</description>

      <title>Spatial correlations in four-wave mixing with structured light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed theoretical treatment of four-wave mixing (FWM) in a quantized paraxial framework, capturing the multi-spatial-mode nature of the biphoton state generated in the process. By analyzing the biphoton state both in position and momentum representations, we identify the conditions under which these descriptions become equivalent. We also highlight formal and physical similarities between FWM and spontaneous parametric down-conversion (PDC), showing that the transfer of pump structure to the spatial coincidence profile, an important and well-known characteristic of the biphoton state, carries over naturally to FWM. In addition, our treatment captures the transition from position correlations in the near field to momentum correlations in the far field, reflecting the underlying spatial entanglement. The measures of entanglement, including the spiral bandwidth and the Schmidt rank, are discussed. Our work consolidates known and new results on spatial correlations in FWM and provides a theoretical framework that may support future studies in nonlinear and quantum optics with structured light.</description>

      <title>Molecular Properties in Quantum-Classical Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo: Correlated Sampling with Application to Accurate Nuclear Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend correlated sampling from classical auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo to the quantum-classical (QC-AFQMC) framework, enabling accurate nuclear force computations crucial for geometry optimization and reaction dynamics. Stochastic electronic structure methods typically encounter prohibitive statistical noise when computing gradients via finite differences. To address this, our approach maximizes correlation between nearby geometries by synchronizing random number streams, aligning orbitals, using deterministic integral decompositions, and employing a consistent set of classical shadow measurements defined at a single reference geometry. Crucially, reusing this single, reference-defined shadow ensemble eliminates the need for additional quantum measurements at displaced geometries. Together, these methodological choices substantially reduce statistical variance in computed forces. We validate the method across hydrogen chains, confirming accuracy throughout varying correlation regimes, and demonstrate significant improvements over single-reference methods in force evaluations for N$_2$ and stretched linear H$_4$, particularly in strongly correlated regions where conventional coupled cluster approaches qualitatively fail. Orbital-optimized trial wave functions further boost accuracy for demanding cases such as stretched CO$_2$, without increasing quantum resource requirements. Finally, we apply our methodology to the MEA-CO$_2$ carbon capture reaction, employing quantum information metrics for active space selection and matchgate shadows for efficient overlap evaluations, establishing QC-AFQMC as a robust framework for exploring complex reaction pathways.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-polarized electron beam sources enable studies of spin-dependent electric and magnetic effects at the nanoscale. We propose a method of creating spin-polarized electrons on an integrated photonics chip by laser driven nanophotonic fields. A two-stage interaction separated by a free space drift length is proposed, where the first stage and drift length introduces spin-dependent characteristics into the probability distribution of the electron wavefunction. The second stage uses an adjusted optical near-field to rotate the spin states utilizing the spin-dependent wavepacket distribution to produce electrons with high ensemble average spin expectation values. This platform provides an integrated and compact method to generate spin-polarized electrons, implementable with millimeter scale chips and table-top lasers.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-based quantum key distribution with non-Gaussian continuous variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addition of single photons to two-mode-squeezed-vacuum states has the effect of distilling quantum entanglement, and, when deployed in quantum key distribution, should lead also to an increase in the secret key rate. However, the extraction of secret keys from non-Gaussian entangled states is a complex issue and is at present not fully understood. In this paper we describe a technique for adding photons to entangled states, and demonstrate how it leads to an increase in secret key rates and the maximal distance for which keys can be distributed assuming asymptotic conditions. The quantum correlations thus produced were found to be of a highly non-Gaussian character, such that the Gaussian extremity principle returns a negative keyrate and effectively kills the protocol; we have therefore developed methods of analysis that do not require prior assumptions about the state. Although it could have been that the addition of single photons would make the system more fragile, this turned out not to be the case. Rather, the addition of a single photon was found to protect the protocol against both passive and active decoherence.</description>

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a promising approach to secure communications, with continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) offering compatibility with existing telecommunication infrastructure. Despite this advantage, CV-QKD is limited by challenges such as losses in terrestrial fibres and atmospheric scintillation in free-space channels. We introduce a QKD protocol that surpasses the optimal Gaussian modulated CV-QKD (GG02) protocol by utilising probabilistic filters without known physical representation. Our approach employs a Gaussian filter at Alice's station and a non-Gaussian notch-like filter at Bob's station. Alice's filter optimises modulation variance to achieve key rates near the optimal GG02 performance, while Bob's filter adapts the effective channel conditions, which can result in higher key rates than the optimal GG02 protocol. Our security analysis avoids Gaussian extremality, accurately bounding Eve's information. The protocol dynamically optimises the secret-key rate for rapidly changing channels, such as terrestrial links and satellite-to-ground communications, and can extract keys in regions deemed non-secure by parameter estimation. Implemented at software level, our protocol requires no hardware modifications and can be integrated into existing QKD systems. Experimental results show a threefold increase in key rates over the optimal GG02 protocol, while simulations for Low Earth Orbit satellite quantum communications indicate a 400-fold increase compared to the non-optimised counterpart.</description>

Abstract: Reliable entanglement manipulation is key to quantum networks. This paper presents a practical approach to entanglement verification based on Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality violation. We establish mathematical bounds relating the CHSH measure to entanglement fidelity and develop statistical methods that optimize resource usage while maintaining verification reliability. Our main contributions include tight bounds on entanglement fidelity using the CHSH measure, a statistical framework for estimating sample complexity, and practical verification protocols with quantifiable confidence. Using NetSquid simulations, we comprehensively evaluated our protocols under various network conditions, demonstrating the key trade-offs between verification accuracy, resource efficiency, and operational parameters. Our results provide concrete guidance for implementing efficient entanglement verification in resource-constrained quantum networks, balancing security requirements with practical limitations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Memory and Hysteresis from Quantum Transitions: Theory and Experiments on Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing leverages quantum tunneling for non-local searches, thereby minimizing memory effects that typically arise from metastabilities. Nonetheless, recent work has demonstrated robust hysteresis in large-scale transverse-field Ising systems implemented on D-Wave's analog quantum hardware. The quantum nature of these intriguing results remains to be understood at a deeper level. Here, we present a conceptual framework that explains the observed behavior by combining two-level Landau-Zener transitions via a first-order piecewise-constant propagator with semiclassical domain-wall kinetics. We test this approach experimentally on a quantum annealer, where we observe clear coercivity even in one-dimensional rings with periodic boundary conditions comprising up to 4,906 qubits-regimes where classical hysteresis is forbidden, but quantum hysteresis is not. Our framework reproduces the measured kink densities, hysteresis loop shapes, and longitudinal sweep-rate scaling trends observed in data from three different D-Wave quantum annealers. In particular, it captures striking non-monotonic features and transiently negative susceptibilities, identifying them as genuine quantum memory effects. These results establish programmable quantum annealers as powerful testbeds for exploring memory-endowed non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>An Initialization-free Quantum Algorithm for General Abelian Hidden Subgroup Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hidden Subgroup Problem(HSP) seeks to identify an unknown subgroup H of a group G for a given injective function f defined on cosets of H. Here we present an initialization-free quantum algorithm for solving HSP in the case where G is a finite abelian group. Our algorithm can adopt an arbitrary unknown mixed state as the auxiliary register and removes the need for initialization while preserving computational cost comparable to existing methods. Our algorithm also restores the state of the auxiliary register to its original form after completing the computations. Since the recovered state can be utilized for other operations, a single preparation of the auxiliary register in an arbitrarily unknown mixed state is sufficient to execute the iterative procedure in solving hidden subgroup problems. This approach provides a promising direction for improving quantum algorithm efficiency by reducing operational time of initialization.</description>

      <title>Advancing the hBN Defects Database through Photophysical Characterization of Bulk hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant attention due to a wide range of defects that offer high quantum efficiency and single-photon purity at room temperature. Most theoretical studies on hBN defects simulate monolayers, as this is computationally cheaper than calculating bulk structures. However, most experimental studies are carried out on multilayer to bulk hBN, which creates additional possibilities for discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, we present an extended database of hBN defects that includes a comprehensive set of bulk hBN defects along with their excited-state photophysical properties. The database features over 120 neutral defects, systematically evaluated across charge states ranging from -2 to 2 (600 defects in total). For each defect, the most stable charge and spin configurations are identified and used to compute the zero-phonon line, photoluminescence spectrum, absorption spectrum, Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, interactive radiative lifetimes, transition dipole moments, and polarization characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the electron-phonon coupling strength is primarily influenced by the presence of vacancies, which tend to induce stronger lattice distortions and broaden phonon sidebands. Additionally, correlation analysis shows that while most properties are independent, the HR factor strongly correlates with the configuration coordinates. All data are publicly available at https://h-bn.info, along with a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate integration with machine learning workflows. This database is therefore designed to bridge the gap between theory and experiment, aid in the reliable identification of quantum emitters, and support the development of machine-learning-driven approaches in quantum materials research.</description>

      <title>Silicon single-photon detector achieving over 84% photon detection efficiency with flexible operation modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon single-photon detectors (Si SPDs) play a crucial role in detecting single photons in the visible spectrum. For various applications, photon detection efficiency (PDE) is the most critical characteristic for effectively collecting photons. Here, we present a Si SPD with a remarkable PDE of up to 84.4% at 785 nm, supporting multiple operation modes. We design and fabricate a thick-junction Si single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) that enhances the avalanche probability through a backside-illumination structure, while minimizing noise through the design of a doping-compensated avalanche region. To maximize PDE, we implement a readout circuit with a 50 V quenching voltage, enabling operation in free-running, gating, or hybrid modes. The SPAD, along with its readout circuits and affiliated circuits, is integrated into a compact SPD module. In free-running mode, the module achieves a maximum PDE of 84.4%, with a dark count rate of 260 cps, and an afterpulse probability of 2.9% at 268 K. This work provides a practical solution for applications requiring ultra-high-efficiency Si SPD with multiple operation modes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantum $(r,\delta)$-Locally Repairable Codes via Classical Ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locally repairable codes (LRCs) play a crucial role in mitigating data loss in large-scale distributed and cloud storage systems. This paper establishes a unified decomposition theorem for general optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs. Based on this, we obtain that the local protection codes of general optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs are MDS codes with the same minimum Hamming distance $\delta$. We prove that for general optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs, their minimum Hamming distance $d$ always satisfies $d\geq \delta$. We fully characterize the optimal quantum $(r,\delta)$-LRCs induced by classical optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs that admit a minimal decomposition. We construct three infinite families of optimal quantum $(r,\delta)$-LRCs with flexible parameters.</description>

      <title>Real-time analog circuit for auto-correlative weak-value amplification in the time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The auto-correlative weak-value amplification (AWVA) technique demonstrates distinct advantages over standard weak-value amplification (SWVA) for quantum parameter estimation. To achieve enhanced precision in real-time parameter estimation, the AWVA requires additional resources compared to SWVA, namely real-time multiplication and integrator modules. We implemented a real-time analog circuit for AWVA using an AD835 multiplier and an NE5532 operational amplifier for the integrator. The circuit was tested using Gaussian pointers in the AWVA scheme, exhibiting sufficient sensitivity for Gaussian pointers with frequencies 200 Hz &lt; f &lt; 20kHz. Compared to SWVA, AWVA achieves higher accuracy and superior robustness against noise at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of -12 dB &lt; SNR &lt; -4 dB. Beyond quantum metrology, the circuit is applicable to diverse detection schemes for correlated signals.</description>

      <title>Data Transmission over a Bosonic Arbitrarily Varying Quantum Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arbitrarily varying channels offer a powerful framework for analyzing the robustness of quantum communication systems, especially for classical-quantum models, where the analysis displays strengths or weaknesses of specific signal constellations under generic attacks. In this work, we provide a coding theorem for a large class of practically relevant arbitrarily varying channel models. Namely, we give an explicit capacity formula for the lossy bosonic channel subject to semi-classical attacks, where an adversary injects semi-classical states into the transmission line. Mathematically, this is modeled via a beam-splitter setup, with transmitter and jammer controlling different input ports and the receiver observing one output port. We show how a recently conjectured new quantum entropy power inequality relates to our capacity formula.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Dynamics of Three-Level Absorption Refrigerator at Third-Order Liouvillian Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the influence of Liouvillian exceptional points (LEPs) in the three-level quantum absorption refrigerator, putting emphasis on the non-equilibrium process before the convergence to the steady state. We search for the second-order and third-order LEPs in the system with two types of couplings. Focusing on the third-order LEPs, we analyze the damping of the system state in the long term analytically and numerically. In addition, we analyze the damping of heat currents and the influence of the non-equilibrium process in the heat extraction from the cold bath. Critical damping at LEPs of both the system state and the heat currents is achieved, implying the fastest convergence to the equilibrium system. During the non-equilibrium process, we find that much heat transfer from the cold bath to the hot bath with less energy cost of the work bath is achieved at the third-order LEP, leading to better performance of the refrigerator.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between partial traces and their dilations for general complex matrices, focusing on two main aspects: the existence of (joint) dilations and norm inequalities relating partial traces and their dilations. Throughout our analysis, we pay particular attention to rank constraints. We find that every pair of matrices of equal size and trace admits dilations of any rank larger than one. We generalize Audenaert's subadditivity inequality to encompass general matrices, multiple tensor factors, and different norms. A central ingredient for this is a novel majorization relation for Kronecker sums. As an application, we extend the interval of Werner states in which they are provably 2-undistillable in any dimension $d\geq4$. We also prove new Schmidt-number witnesses and $k$-positive maps.</description>

      <title>Certifying non-classicality and non-Gaussianity through optical parametric amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian states of light are essential for numerous quantum information protocols; thus, certifying non-Gaussianity is crucial. Full quantum state tomography achieves this, but it implies observing the Wigner function negativity, which requires efficient detection. Certifying non-Gaussianity through directly measurable parameters is a simpler alternative, typically achieved by measuring photon-number probabilities - either directly using photon-number resolving detectors or through Hanbury Brown-Twiss type measurements with single-photon detectors. Here, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that optical parametric amplification combined with conventional intensity detectors can effectively replace this approach without the need for photon-number resolution. In our method, we measure the mean photon number and the second-order correlation function for the amplified state. Using it, we successfully certify the non-Gaussianity of a heralded quasi-single-photon state. Since optical parametric amplification is a multimode process, our method provides a foundation for developing high-dimensional quantum technologies utilizing multimode non-Gaussian states.</description>

      <title>Probing metric fluctuations with the spin of a particle: a quantum simulation with bimodal optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring potential empirical manifestations of quantum gravity is a challenging pursuit. In this study, we utilise a lattice representation of a (2+1)D massive gravity toy model interacting with Dirac fermions that can support specific spacetime fluctuations. We focus on the evolution of the fermion's spin due to its coupling to spacetime fluctuations. To monitor their dynamics a minimal model is required that comprises two bosonic modes describing spacetime geometry fluctuations coupled with the spin of the fermion. A possible emulation of this system involves encoding spin degrees of freedom in an atom coupled with a bimodal optical cavity that provides the two bosonic modes. We observe diverse spin evolution patterns based on its interaction with fluctuating spacetime geometry. Our proposal introduces a novel approach for modelling the effect of interactions between quantum gravity and matter that can be probed with current technology.</description>

      <title>Observation of period doubling and higher multiplicities in a driven single-spin system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the prime features of quantum systems strongly driven by external time-periodic fields is the subharmonic response with integer multiples of the drive period $k\, T_d$. Here we demonstrate experimentally based on a careful theoretical analysis period doubling and higher multiplicities ($k=2,\ldots 5$) for one of the most fundamental systems, namely, an individual spin-$1/2$. Realized as a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond, the particular coherence properties under ambient conditions, strong field sensitivity, and optical addressability allow to monitor coherent $k$-tupling oscillations over a broad set of driving parameters in the vicinity of the ideal manifolds. We verify an enhanced sensitivity within this domain which provides new means for improved sensing protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The driven quantum harmonic oscillator is fundamental to a number of important physical systems. Here, we consider the quantum harmonic oscillator under non-Hermitian, PT-symmetric driving, showing that the resulting set of Wigner-space trajectories of an initial coherent state is identical to the set of real-space trajectories of the classical Foucault pendulum. Remarkably, in the case mapped from the trivial 1D pendulum, the corresponding quantum dynamics are those of an oscillator with periodically evolving momentum but fixed position, a novel type of dynamics which are forbidden in classical systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning for Predicting Binding Free Energies in Structure-Based Virtual Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In structure-based virtual screening, it is often necessary to evaluate the binding free energy of protein-ligand complexes by considering not only molecular conformations but also how these structures shift and rotate in space. The number of possible combinations grows rapidly and can become overwhelming. While classical computing has limitations in this context, quantum computing offers a promising alternative due to its inherent parallelism. In this study, we introduce a quantum machine learning approach that encodes molecular information into quantum states and processes them using parameterized quantum gates. The model is implemented and trained using PyTorch, and its performance is evaluated under three settings: ideal simulation, limited-shot sampling, and simulations with quantum noise. With six quantum circuit units, the model achieves an RMSD of 2.37 kcal/mol and a Pearson correlation of 0.650. Even when using 100,000 shots, the predictions remain consistent, indicating that the model is compatible with near-term quantum hardware. Although noise slightly reduces accuracy, the ranking of ligand affinities remains largely unchanged. These findings point to a practical and scalable strategy that balances robustness and predictive power, offering a viable path to accelerate virtual screening through moderately deep quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Three-qubit encoding in ytterbium-171 atoms for simulating 1+1D QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating nuclear matter described by quantum chromodynamics using quantum computers is notoriously inefficient because of the assortment of quark degrees of freedom such as matter/antimatter, flavor, color, and spin. Here, we propose to address this resource efficiency challenge by encoding three qubits within individual ytterbium-171 atoms of a neutral atom quantum processor. The three qubits are encoded in three distinct sectors: an electronic "clock" transition, the spin-1/2 nucleus, and the lowest two motional states in one radial direction of the harmonic trapping potential. We develop a family of composite sideband pulses and demonstrate a universal gate set and readout protocol for this three-qubit system. We then apply it to single-flavor quantum chromodynamics in 1+1D axial gauge for which the three qubits directly represent the occupancy of quarks in the three colors. We show that two atoms are sufficient to simulate both vacuum persistence oscillations and string breaking. We consider resource requirements and connections to error detection/correction. Our work is a step towards resource-efficient digital simulation of nuclear matter and opens new opportunities for versatile qubit encoding in neutral atom quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Geometric Measures of Complexity for Open and Closed Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unitary dynamics of quantum systems can be modeled as a trajectory on a Riemannian manifold. This theoretical framework naturally yields a purely geometric interpretation of computational complexity for quantum algorithms, a notion originally developed by Michael Nielsen (Circa, 2007). However, for nonunitary dynamics, it is unclear how one can recover a completely geometric characterization of Nielsen-like geometric complexity. The main obstacle to overcome is that nonunitary dynamics cannot be characterized by Lie groups (which are Riemannian manifolds), as is the case for unitary dynamics. Building on Nielsen's work, we present a definition of geometric complexity for a fairly generic family of quantum channels. These channels are useful for modeling noise in quantum circuits, among other things, and analyze the geometric complexity of these quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Generalised state space geometry in Hermitian and non-Hermitian quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key features of information geometry in the classical setting is the existence of a metric structure and a family of connections on the space of probability distributions. The uniqueness of the Fisher--Rao metric and the duality of these connections is at the heart of classical information geometry. However, these features do not carry over straightforwardly to quantum systems, where a Hermitian inner product structure on the Hilbert space induces a metric on the complex projective space of pure states -- the Fubini-Study tensor, which is preserved under the unitary evolution. In this work, we explore how modifying the Hermitian tensor structure on the projective space may affect the geometry of pure quantum states, and whether such generalisations can be used to define dual connections with a direct correspondence to classical probability distribution functions, modified by the presence of a non-trivial phase. We show that it is indeed possible to construct a family of connections that are dual to each other in a generalised sense with respect to the real-valued sector of the Fubini--Study tensor. Using this biorthogonal formalism, we systematically classify the four types of tensors that can arise when the dynamics of a quantum system are governed by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, identifying both the complex-valued metric and the Berry curvature. Finally, we elucidate the role of the metric in a quantum natural gradient descent optimisation problem, generalised to the non-Hermitian case for a suitable choice of cost function.</description>

      <title>The hidden subgroup problem for infinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the example of Shor's algorithm for period-finding in the integers, we explore the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) for discrete infinite groups. On the hardness side, we show that HSP is NP-hard for the additive group of rational numbers, and for normal subgroups of non-abelian free groups. We also indirectly reduce a version of the short vector problem to HSP in $\mathbb{Z}^k$ with pseudo-polynomial query cost. On the algorithm side, we generalize the Shor-Kitaev algorithm for HSP in $\mathbb{Z}^k$ (with standard polynomial query cost) to the case where the hidden subgroup has deficient rank or equivalently infinite index. Finally, we outline a stretched exponential time algorithm for the abelian hidden shift problem (AHShP), extending prior work of the author as well as Regev and Peikert. It follows that HSP in any finitely generated, virtually abelian group also has a stretched exponential time algorithm.</description>

      <title>Tunable Non-Gaussian Mechanical States in a Strongly Coupled Hybrid Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum states of motion are critical components in the second quantum revolution. We investigate the generation and control of non-Gaussian motional states in a tripartite hybrid quantum system consisting of a collection of qubits coupled to a mechanical resonator, which in turn interacts with an externally driven photonic cavity. This hybrid architecture provides a versatile platform for quantum control by integrating nonlinear interactions and multiple control parameters. Operating in the strong coupling regime, we study the transient dynamics resulting from a time-dependent external drive that has a boxcar profile. Starting from coherent states in both the mechanical and cavity subsystems, we show that this drive protocol, combined with time-independent interaction and frequency configurations, leads to the emergence of highly non-Gaussian quantum states in the intermediary mechanical degree of freedom. These states are characterized by a pronounced negative volume in the Wigner quasi-probability distribution and enhanced quantum Fisher information, indicative of their quantum utility. We systematically analyze the impact of the qubit phase, interaction strengths, and drive parameters on the degree of non-Gaussianity. Our findings underscore the tunability and richness of this hybrid platform, paving the way for advanced quantum state engineering and applications in quantum sensing, metrology, and information processing.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for near-optimal planning in POMDPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for decision-making in partially observable environments, which can be modeled as Markov decision processes and compactly represented through dynamic decision Bayesian networks. Recent advances demonstrate that inference on sparse Bayesian networks can be accelerated using quantum rejection sampling combined with amplitude amplification, leading to a computational speedup in estimating acceptance probabilities.\\ Building on this result, we introduce Quantum Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical look-ahead algorithm for model-based RL in partially observable environments. We present a rigorous, oracle-free time complexity analysis under fault-tolerant assumptions for the quantum device. Unlike standard treatments that assume a black-box oracle, we explicitly specify the inference process, allowing our bounds to more accurately reflect the true computational cost. We show that, for environments whose dynamics form a sparse Bayesian network, horizon-based near-optimal planning can be achieved sub-quadratically faster through quantum-enhanced belief updates.
  Furthermore, we present numerical experiments benchmarking QBRL against its classical counterpart on simple yet illustrative decision-making tasks. Our results offer a detailed analysis of how the quantum computational advantage translates into decision-making performance, highlighting that the magnitude of the advantage can vary significantly across different deployment settings.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Theories, Wigner's Function, Compactification, and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23887v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global symmetry data of a $D$-dimensional absolute quantum field theory can sometimes be packaged in terms of a $(D+1)$-dimensional bulk system obtained by extending along an interval, with a relative QFT$_D$ at one end and suitable gapped / free boundary conditions at the other end. The partition function of the QFT$_D$ can then be interpreted as a wavefunction depending on background fields. However, in some cases, it is not possible or simply cumbersome to fix an absolute form of the symmetry data. Additionally, it is also of interest to consider entangled and mixed states of relative QFTs as well as entangled and mixed states of gapped / free boundary conditions. We argue that Wigner's quasi-probabilistic function on phase space provides a physical interpretation of the symmetry data in all such situations. We illustrate these considerations in the case of string compactifications and holographic systems.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of PyTorch, JAX, SciPy, and Neal for Solving QUBO Problems at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is a versatile framework for modeling combinatorial optimization problems. This study benchmarks five software-based QUBO solvers: Neal, PyTorch (CPU), PyTorch (GPU), JAX, and SciPy, on randomly generated QUBO matrices ranging from 1000x1000 to 45000x45000, under six convergence thresholds from 10^-1 to 10^-6. We evaluate their performance in terms of solution quality (energy) and computational time. Among the solvers tested, Neal achieved the lowest energy values but was limited to problems with up to 6000 variables due to high memory consumption. PyTorch produced slightly higher energy results than Neal but demonstrated superior scalability, solving instances with up to 45000 variables. Its support for GPU acceleration and CPU multi-threading also resulted in significantly shorter runtimes. JAX yielded energy values slightly above those of PyTorch and was limited to 25000 variables, with runtimes comparable to PyTorch on GPU. SciPy was the most constrained solver, handling only up to 6000 variables and consistently producing the highest energy values with the longest computation times. These findings highlight trade-offs between solution quality, scalability, and runtime efficiency, and suggest that PyTorch is the most balanced choice for large-scale QUBO problems when computational resources permit.</description>

      <title>Ultralight dark matter detection with trapped-ion interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore how recent advances in the manipulation of single-ion wave packets open new avenues for detecting weak magnetic fields sourced by ultralight dark matter. A trapped ion in a ``Schr\"odinger cat'' state can be prepared with its spin and motional degrees of freedom entangled and be used as a matter-wave interferometer that is sensitive to the Aharonov-Bohm-like phase shift accumulated by the ion over its trajectory. The result of the spin-motion entanglement is a parametrically-enhanced sensitivity to weak magnetic fields as compared with an un-entangled ion in a trap. Taking into account the relevant boundary conditions, we demonstrate that a single trapped ion can probe unexplored regions of kinetically-mixed dark-photon dark matter parameter space in the $10^{-15}~\text{eV} \lesssim m_{A'} \lesssim 10^{-14}$~eV mass window. We also show how such a table-top quantum device will also serve as a complementary probe of axion-like particle dark matter in the same mass window.</description>

      <title>Temporal Entanglement from Holographic Entanglement Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, several notions of entanglement in time have emerged as a novel frontier in quantum many-body physics, quantum field theory and gravity. We propose a systematic prescription to characterize temporal entanglement in relativistic quantum field theory in a general state for an arbitrary subregion on a flat, constant-time slice in a flat spacetime. Our prescriptions starts with the standard entanglement entropy of a spatial subregion and amounts to transporting the unchanged subregion to boosted time slices all the way across the light cone when it becomes in general a complex characterization of the corresponding temporal subregion. For holographic quantum field theories, our prescription amounts to an analytic continuation of all codimension-two bulk extremal surfaces satisfying the homology constraint and picking the one with the smallest real value of the area as the leading saddle point. We implement this prescription for the holographic conformal field theories in thermal states on both a two-dimensional Lorentzian cylinder and three-dimensional Minkowski space, and show that it leads to results with self-consistent physical properties of temporal entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals in sensitive optomechanical experiments. Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) were functionalized using ZnCl$_2$ and 25-mers of single-stranded deoxyadenosine and deoxythymidine monophosphate which were optically trapped by a 1550 nm wavelength laser in vacuum. In the optical trap, SiNPs behave as harmonic oscillators, and their oscillation frequency and amplitude can be precisely detected by optical interferometry. The data was compared across particle types, revealing differences in frequency, width and amplitude of peaks with respect to motion of the SiNPs which can be explained by a theoretical model. Data obtained from this platform was analyzed by fitting Lorentzian curves to the spectra. Linear discriminant analysis detected differences between the functionalized and non-functionalized SiNPs. Random forest modeling provided further evidence that the fitted data were different between the groups. Transmission electron microscopy was carried out, but did not reveal any visual differences between the particle types</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modelling of nerve impulse propagation requires accounting for strong higher-order nonlinearities in membrane dynamics, as incorporated in the extended Heimburg-Jackson model. By introducing third- and fourth-order polynomial terms into the membrane density equation, we derive a generalized Duffing-type equation that better captures the complex biophysical states involved in signal transmission. Applying the factorization method, we construct exact travelling wave solutions, including a novel class of Lambert W-Kink-type solitons. These findings provide new analytical insight into the nonlinear electromechanical behaviour of nerve membranes and contribute to the theoretical foundation for understanding pulse propagation in biomembranes.</description>

      <title>Black-box optimization using factorization and Ising machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) is used in materials design, drug discovery, and hyperparameter tuning in machine learning. The world is experiencing several of these problems. In this review, a factorization machine with quantum annealing or with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA) algorithm to realize fast computations of BBO using Ising machines (IMs) is discussed. The FMQA algorithm uses a factorization machine (FM) as a surrogate model for BBO. The FM model can be directly transformed into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization model that can be solved using IMs. This makes it possible to optimize the acquisition function in BBO, which is a difficult task using conventional methods without IMs. Consequently, it has the advantage of handling large BBO problems. To be able to perform BBO with the FMQA algorithm immediately, we introduce the FMQA algorithm along with Python packages to run it. In addition, we review examples of applications of the FMQA algorithm in various fields, including physics, chemistry, materials science, and social sciences. These successful examples include binary and integer optimization problems, as well as more general optimization problems involving graphs, networks, and strings, using a binary variational autoencoder. We believe that BBO using the FMQA algorithm will become a key technology in IMs including quantum annealers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging quantum technologies based on the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond require carefully engineered material with controlled defect density, optimised NV formation processes, and minimal crystal strain. The choice of NV generation technique plays a crucial role in determining the quality and performance of these centres. In this work, we investigate NV centre formation in nitrogen-doped diamond using femtosecond (fs) laser processing. We systematically examine the effect of laser pulse energy on NV production and quality using photoluminescence and optically detected magnetic resonance measurements. We also probe the role of pre-existing lattice defects formed by electron irradiation and consider defect evolution over extended dwell times. Finally, we are able to identify a regime where the main action of the fs-laser is to diffuse rather than create vacancies. This local annealing capability expands the toolkit for tailored NV production and presents opportunities for fine tuning defect populations.</description>

      <title>Indirect multiphoton scattering between light and bulk plasmons via ultrafast free electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient coupling between light and bulk plasmons (BPs) remains a central challenge because of their inherent mode mismatch, limited penetration depth, and pronounced resonant energy mismatch between visible-range photons and BPs. In this work, we demonstrate that ultrafast free electrons can coherently mediate an interaction between electromagnetic fields and BPs at the nanoscale. An electron pulse emitted from the photocathode of ultrafast transmission electron microscope, functions as a quantum intermediary that is capable of simultaneously interacting with the laser field by multiphoton processes and BPs by perturbative scattering. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy can capture this indirect interaction, the final electron energy distribution encodes both quantum pathways arising from distinct combinations of multiphoton absorption and emission and BP scattering events. Interference among these pathways gives rise to characteristic spectral modulations, directly revealing the exchange of energy and information between photons and BPs via the electron delivery. Our results show that femtosecond-driven, ultrafast electrons provide a viable route to modulate and even control bulk plasmon excitations in a volume, thereby extending beyond the conventional nanoplasmonics schemes on manipulating surface plasmons by light. This indirect light-BP interaction paves the promising way for exploring fundamental light-matter interaction at ultrafast and nanometer scales.</description>

      <title>An Improved ChaCha Algorithm Based on Quantum Random Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the merits of high efficiency and strong security against timing and side-channel attacks, ChaCha has been widely applied in real-time communication and data streaming scenarios. However, with the rapid development of AI-assisted cryptanalysis and quantum computing technologies, there are serious challenges to the secure implementation of ChaCha cipher. To further strengthen the security of ChaCha cipher, we propose an improved variant based on quantum random numbers, i.e., Quantum Random Number Enhanced ChaCha (QRE-ChaCha). Specifically, the design XORs the initial constants with quantum random numbers and periodically injects quantum random numbers into selected state words during odd rounds to enhance diffusion. Compared with the original ChaCha, the present variant shows stronger resistance to differential attacks and generates a keystream with statistical randomness, thereby offering increased robustness against both classical and quantum attacks. To evaluate the security and performance of the present ChaCha, our analysis proceeds in three main parts. Firstly, we analyze its theoretical security in terms of quantum randomness and attack testing, and conduct differential cryptanalysis with an automated search method based on the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Secondly, we subject the keystream generated by the cipher to randomness tests using the NIST statistical test suite and the GM/T 0005-2021 randomness testing standard. Finally, we assess its encryption and decryption performance by measuring its encryption speed on files of various sizes. According to the results, the present ChaCha is significantly improved to resist differential attacks while maintaining the high efficiency of the original ChaCha cipher, and its keystream successfully passes statistical randomness tests using the NIST and GM/T 0005-2021 standards, meeting cryptographic application requirements.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Dynamics in Atomic-Molecular Bose Condensates in the Presence of Gaussian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of atomic and molecular bosons weakly coupled via Feshbach detuning in the presence of Gaussian white noise. The time-evolution of the population imbalance between the two species, as well as the coherence of the system are analyzed using a Bloch sphere model. We observe that the system exhibits relaxation of the Bloch vector components towards a stable equilibrium. In the population imbalance dynamics, the relaxation rates predicted by the Bogoliubov Born Green Kirkwood Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy are found to be smaller than those calculated with a simple the mean field approximation. As for the coherence dynamics, the inclusion of correlations and fluctuations in the system can either increase or decrease the relaxation time, depending on the initial conditions. We attribute the increase in the relaxation time to the emergence of a structured noise, and the subsequent suppression of certain dephasing channels. We also study the impact of correlations and fluctuations on time-averaged quantities like the drift speed, the fringe visibility, the phase entanglement etc., and find the results to be in perfect agreement with the properties of the relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum droplets have been recently observed in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and in BEC mixtures. This forms the motivation for us to explore the dynamics of these droplets. We make use of the Extended Gross-Pitaevski equation which apart from the effective mean field (MF) interaction, also includes a beyond mean field interaction. The competition of these two interactions in the context of droplet formation is explored. Further, the conditions for droplet formation are studied.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Thermalization of a Localized Chain Interacting with an Ergodic Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of many-body localized (MBL) phases intrinsically links spectral properties with eigenstate characteristics: localized systems exhibit Poisson level statistics and area-law entanglement entropy, while ergodic systems display volume-law entanglement and follow random matrix theory predictions, including level repulsion. Here, we introduce the interacting Anderson Quantum Sun model, which significantly deviates from these conventional expectations. In addition to standard localized and ergodic phases, we identify a regime that exhibits volume-law entanglement coexisting with intermediate spectral statistics. We also identify another nonstandard regime marked by Poisson level statistics, sub-volume entanglement growth, and rare-event-dominated correlations, indicative of emerging ergodic instabilities. These results highlight unconventional routes of ergodicity breaking and offer fresh perspectives on how Anderson localization may be destabilized.</description>

      <title>On decoherence in surface hopping: the nonadiabaticity threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a strategy to efficiently and safely account for decoherence in the fewest switches surface hopping method. Standard decoherence corrections often lead to too strong coherence suppression. A simple and general solution to this problem is to restrict decoherence to regions of low nonadiabaticity measured by the dimensionless Massey parameter. The same threshold values are suitable for a variety of systems, regardless of their size and absolute energy scale. When restricted to uncoupled regions, a Gaussian overlap decoherence correction consistently leads to more accurate populations than using no correction. The article also examines under what circumstances it is appropriate to decohere instantaneously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a Hall effect driven by effective gravitational fields arising from quantum geometry. We develop four mechanisms for this ''emergent-gravity Hall effect" : real-space gravity, momentum-space gravity, gravitional anomalous velocity, and gravitational Lorentz force which are described by the Christoffel symbols in real, momentum, and time spaces. We construct a unified theoretical framework to systematically investigate the effects of emergent gravity in these spaces on transport phenomena based on the semiclassical theory. We demonstrate these effects by model calculations and clarify the conditions under which a finite Hall response can arise. Our findings open a new avenue for exploring gravitational effects in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Three-flavor neutrino oscillations using the Phase Space Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Phase-Space Approximation (PSA) approach, originally applied in [Phys. Rev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino oscillations from a stellar object in the two-flavor limit, is extended here to describe the more realistic case where neutrinos can oscillate between three different flavors. The approach is successfully validated against the exact solutions up to eight neutrinos. In all cases where the exact solution is feasible, the PSA provides excellent reproduction of the neutrino oscillation dynamics. By replacing the full problem with a set of simple mean-field equations, the PSA offers a versatile, predictive, and easily parallelizable approach for tackling three-flavor problems. This enables the simulation of large-scale neutrino oscillations, as illustrated here with simulations involving up to 300 neutrinos. Additionally, the method provides insight into the system's equilibration properties.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast coherent magnon spin currents in antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating coherent magnon spin currents with the highest frequencies and shortest wavelengths is a key challenge in ultrafast spintronics and magnonics. A promising route is to excite counter-propagating magnon pairs. In antiferromagnets, such pairs can be accessed in the ultrafast regime, where coherent dynamics are dominated by magnons at the edge of the Brillouin zone. However, it has seemed impossible to generate a net spin current from coherent magnon pairs. Here we show that a coherent superposition of multiple magnon-pair modes can produce such a current in parity-time symmetric antiferromagnets. The ultrafast coherent spin currents are excited with linearly polarized light, with the light polarization steering the current direction. Finally, by superposing two orthogonal spin currents, circular spin currents can be generated, which have not been discussed for steady-state currents.</description>

Abstract: A preselection-free fiber-optic weak measurement sensing framework is proposed and experimentally verified in this paper. In view of the limitation that fiber-optic weak measurement require specific preselection, this scheme innovates theoretically and achieves high sensitivity sensing by optimizing the post-selection when single-mode optical fiber is used to generate random polarization state. The experimental results show that the sensing performance is two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of traditional optical fiber sensing technology.</description>

      <title>Orbital-rotated Fermi-Hubbard model as a benchmarking problem for quantum chemistry with the exact solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry is a key target for quantum computing, but benchmarking quantum algorithms for large molecular systems remains challenging due to the lack of exactly solvable yet structurally realistic models. In particular, molecular Hamiltonians typically contain $O(N^4)$ Pauli terms, significantly increasing the cost of quantum simulations, while many exactly solvable models, such as the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard (1D FH) model, contain only $O(N)$ terms. In this work, we introduce the orbital-rotated Fermi-Hubbard (ORFH) model as a scalable and exactly solvable benchmarking problem for quantum chemistry algorithms. Starting from the 1D FH model, we apply a spin-involved orbital rotation to construct a Hamiltonian that retains the exact ground-state energy but exhibits a Pauli term count scaling as $O(N^4)$, similar to real molecular systems. We analyze the ORFH Hamiltonian from multiple perspectives, including operator norm and electronic correlation. We benchmark variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) optimizers and Pauli term grouping methods, and compare their performance with those for hydrogen chains. Furthermore, we show that the ORFH Hamiltonian increases the computational difficulty for classical methods such as the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), offering a nontrivial benchmark beyond quantum algorithms. Our results demonstrate that the ORFH model provides a versatile and scalable testbed for benchmarking quantum chemistry algorithms under realistic structural conditions, while maintaining exact solvability even at large system sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18647v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A non-local quantum computation (NLQC) replaces an interaction between two quantum systems with a single simultaneous round of communication and shared entanglement. We study two classes of NLQC, $f$-routing and $f$-BB84, which are of relevance to classical information theoretic cryptography and quantum position-verification. We give the first non-trivial lower bounds on entanglement in both settings, but are restricted to lower bounding protocols with perfect correctness. Within this setting, we give a lower bound on the Schmidt rank of any entangled state that completes these tasks for a given function $f(x,y)$ in terms of the rank of a matrix $g(x,y)$ whose entries are zero when $f(x,y)=0$, and strictly positive otherwise. This also leads to a lower bound on the Schmidt rank in terms of the non-deterministic quantum communication complexity of $f(x,y)$. Because of a relationship between $f$-routing and the conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) primitive studied in information theoretic cryptography, we obtain a new technique for lower bounding the randomness complexity of CDS.</description>

      <title>Quantum querying based on multicontrolled Toffoli gates for causal Feynman loop configurations and directed acyclic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms are a promising framework for unfolding the causal configurations of multiloop Feynman diagrams, which is equivalent to querying the \textit{directed acyclic graph} (DAG) configurations of undirected graphs in graph theory. In this paper, we present a quantum algorithm for querying in both types of applications, using a systematic and sparing logic in the design of an oracle operator. The construction of the quantum oracle is based exclusively on multicontrolled Toffoli (MCX) gates and quantum NOT (Pauli-$X$) gates. The efficiency of the algorithm is evaluated by comparison with a quantum algorithm based on binary clauses. Furthermore, we analyse the impact of traspilation and introduce an appropriate metric to assess the complexity of the algorithm, the \emph{quantum circuit area}. We explicitly analyse three-, four- and five-eloop topologies, which have not previously been explored due to their higher complexity and the current limitations of quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Conservation Laws For Every Quantum Measurement Outcome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paradigmatic example of quantum measurements, whenever one measures a system which starts in a superposition of two states of a conserved quantity, it jumps to one of the two states, implying different final values for the quantity that should have been conserved. The standard law of conservation for quantum mechanics handles this jump by stating only that the total distribution of the conserved quantity over repeated measurements is unchanged, but states nothing about individual cases. Here however we show that one can go beyond this and have conservation in each individual instance. We made our arguments in the case of angular momentum of a particle on a circle, where many technicalities simplify, and bring arguments to show that this holds in full generality. Hence we argue that the conservation law in quantum mechanics should be rewritten, to go beyond its hitherto statistical formulation, to state that the total of a conserved quantity is unchanged in every individual measurement outcome. As a further crucial element, we show that conservation can be localised at the level of the system of interest and its relevant frame of reference, and is independent on any assumptions on the distribution of the conserved quantity over the entire universe.</description>

Abstract: The identification of physical subsystems in quantum mechanics as compared to classical mechanics poses significant conceptual challenges, especially in the context of quantum gravity. Traditional approaches associate quantum systems with classical ones localized in spacetime, using either Hilbert space factors for finite-dimensional systems or local operator algebras in algebraic quantum field theory. These methods ensure statistical independence for state preparations and measurements. However, covariant linearized quantum gravity disrupts this framework by preventing the formation of gauge-invariant local algebras, thereby undermining statistical independence. This presents a major obstacle for modeling early universe cosmology and gravity-induced entanglement experiments, and poses a significant roadblock toward a comprehensive theory of quantum gravity. A pivotal shift is proposed: the identification between classical and quantum systems should be dynamically evolving rather than fixed, opening the possibility of a single-world unitary quantum mechanics. This perspective aligns with the broader aim of understanding how classical spatiotemporal existence emerges from quantum mechanics and connects the measurement problem with quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical systems are usually assumed to evolve relative to an external time parameter, which is problematic because in quantum theory that parameter is not a physical observable. Page &amp; Wootters (1984) solved this by proposing that the universe is in a stationary state, eliminating the need for the external time parameter. Instead, their model contains an isolated subsystem, a 'clock', with which other subsystems are entangled, making the latter appear to evolve relative to different states of the clock. While this resolves the problem of the time parameter, the assumption that the clock is isolated prevents it from being measured, as this requires an interaction with another system. We prove that the clock can be measured while preserving the core features of the Page-Wootters construction. We also discuss clock synchronisation.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Quantum Information Scrambling</title>

Abstract: Quantum Information scrambling (QI-scrambling) is a pivotal area of inquiry within the study of quantum many-body systems. This research derives mathematical upper and lower bounds for the scrambling rate by applying the Maligranda inequality. Our results indicate that the upper bounds, lower bounds, and scrambling rates coincide precisely when local operators exhibit to be unitary-Hermitian. Crucially, the convergence or divergence of these upper and lower bounds relative to the scrambling rate is contingent upon the system's initial state. The spin-star model to validate this theoretical framework is investigated, considering thermal and pure initial states. The implantation of the ancilla or external qubit aligns the scrambling rate with the established bounds. The upper and lower bounds may diverge from the scrambling rate based on the system's initial state when both local operators are multi-quit systems. The scrambling rate found grows with the increase of the qubit number in local operators.</description>

      <title>Weakly Fault-Tolerant Computation in a Quantum Error-Detecting Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many current quantum error-correcting codes that achieve full fault tolerance suffer from having low ratios of logical to physical qubits and significant overhead. This makes them difficult to implement on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers and results in the inability to perform quantum algorithms at useful scales with near-term quantum processors. As a result, calculations are generally done without encoding. We propose a middle ground between these two approaches: constructions in the $[[n,n-2,2]]$ quantum error-detecting code that can detect any error from a single faulty gate by measuring the stabilizer generators of the code and additional ancillas at the end of the computation. This achieves weak fault tolerance. As we show, this yields a significant improvement over no error correction for small computations with low enough physical error probabilities and requires much less overhead than codes that achieve full fault tolerance. We give constructions for a set of gates that achieve universal quantum computation in this error-detecting code, while satisfying weak fault tolerance up to analog imprecision on the physical rotation gate.</description>

      <title>Phase-selective tripartite entanglement and asymmetric Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in squeezed optomechanics</title>

Abstract: The generation and manipulation of multipartite entanglement and EPR steering in macroscopic systems not only play a fundamental role in exploring the nature of quantum mechanics, but are also at the core of current developments of various nascent quantum technologies. Here we report a theoretical method using squeezing-phase-controlled quantum noise flows to selectively generate and manipulate quantum entanglement and asymmetric EPR steering in a nonlinear $\chi^{(2)}$ whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) optomechanical resonator. We show that by pumping the $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear medium with two-photon optical fields and broadband squeezed lights, a pair of counterpropagating squeezed optical modes could be introduced to the WGM resonator, each coupled with an independent squeezed vacuum reservoir. This configuration could enable squeezing-phase-controlled light-reservoir interaction for each squeezed optical mode, providing a flexible tool for tailoring asymmetric optical noise flows in the counterpropagating modes. Based on this unique feature, it is found that with the injection of asymmetric noise flows, the generation of various types of bipartite and tripartite entanglement become phase-dependent and thus they can be produced in an asymmetric way. More excitingly, it is also found that by further properly adjusting the squeezing parameters, the overall asymmetry of EPR steering can also be stepwise driven from no-way regime, one-way regime to two-way regime. These findings, holding promise for preparing rich types of entangled quantum resources with asymmetric features, may have potential applications in the area of secure quantum information processing such as quantum secure direct communication and one-way quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Decoy state and purification protocols for superior quantum key distribution with imperfect quantum-dot based single photon sources: Theory and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The original proposal of quantum key distribution (QKD) was based on ideal single photon sources, which 40 years later, are still challenging to develop. Therefore, the development of decoy state protocols using weak coherent states (WCS) from lasers, set the frontier in terms of secure key rates and distances. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate two simple-to-implement QKD protocols that allow practical, far from ideal sub-Poissonian photon sources to outperform state-of-the-art WCS. By engineering the photon statistics of a biexciton-exciton cascade in room temperature single photon sources based on giant colloidal quantum dots coupled to nanoantennas, we show that either a truncated decoy state protocol or a heralded purification protocol can be employed to achieve a significantly increased performance in terms of the maximal allowed channel loss for secure key creation, which can exceed even that of ideal WCS by more than 3dB. We then experimentally emulate a BB84 QKD using such a quantum dot source, verifying the superiority of our protocols over the best possible BB84 WCS performance. These protocols can be utilized efficiently on a host of various quantum emitters having controllable photon statistics with a finite photon-number basis, offering a practical approach to QKD without the hindering requirements on the single photon purity of the photon source.</description>

Abstract: I carry out numerical scattering calculations against a family of finite-length one-dimensional point-like arrangements of atoms, $\chi(x)$, related to the distribution of prime numbers by a shift operation making the atomic density approximately constant.

      <description>arXiv:2410.10750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor components based on silicon carbide (SiC) are a key component for high-power electronics. Their behavior is determined by the interplay of charges and electric fields, which is typically described by modeling and simulations that are calibrated by nonlocal electric properties. So far, there are no experimental methods that allow for the 3D mapping of both the electric field and the concentrations of free charge carriers inside an electronic device. To fulfill this information gap, we propose an operando method that utilizes single silicon vacancy (VSi) centers in 4H-SiC. The VSi centers are at various positions in the intrinsic region of a pin-diode. To monitor the local static electric field, we perform Stark shift measurements based on photoluminescence excitation (PLE), which allows us to infer the expansion of the depletion zone and therefore to determine the local concentration of dopants. Besides this, we show that our measurements allow us to additionally obtain the local concentration of free charge carriers. The method presented here therefore paves the way for a new quantum-enhanced electronic device technology, capable of mapping the interplay of mobile charges and electric fields in a working semiconductor device with nanometer precision.</description>

Abstract: Analysis of quantum processes, especially in the context of noise, errors, and decoherence is essential for the improvement of quantum devices. An intuitive representation of those processes modeled by quantum channels are Pauli transfer matrices. They display the action of a linear map in the $n$-qubit Pauli basis in a way, that is more intuitive, since Pauli strings are more tangible objects than the standard basis matrices. We set out to investigate classical algorithms that convert the various representations into Pauli transfer matrices. We propose new algorithms that make explicit use of the tensor product structure of the Pauli basis. They convert a quantum channel in a given representation (Chi or process matrix, Choi matrix, superoperator, or Kraus operators) to the corresponding Pauli transfer matrix. Moreover, the underlying principle can also be used to calculate the Pauli transfer matrix of other linear operations over $n$-qubit matrices such as left-, right-, and sandwich multiplication as well as forming the (anti-)commutator with a given operator. Finally, we investigate the runtime of these algorithms, derive their asymptotic scaling and demonstrate improved performance using instances with up to seven qubits.</description>

Abstract: The Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph (PBR) no go theorem provides arguments for the reality of quantum states, indicating that quantum states ought to be ontic. For $\psi$-ontology, a $n$-qubits system is specified by $2^n$ complex parameters. However, subject to the Holevo bound, an $n$-qubits system can only encode at most $n$ bits of classical information. The two form an inexplicable contradiction. Therefore, based on a posterior statistical inference framework compatible with the $\psi$-ontology perspective, we generally proved the information upper bound of the 2-qubits system by analyzing the fundamental correlation structure among the parameters of quantum systems. And we extended it to the $n$-qubits system based on the convex optimization process. Our core conclusion is: the information-carrying capacity (information upper bound) of an $n$-qubits system is $n$ classical bits. The reason of the scale contrast is that the high degree of correlation among the parameters of the quantum system causes the amount of information that the system can carry to only reach the order of $O(n)$.</description>

      <title>Scalable Parameter Design for Superconducting Quantum Circuits with Graph Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: To demonstrate supremacy of quantum computing, increasingly large-scale superconducting quantum computing chips are being designed and fabricated. However, the complexity of simulating quantum systems poses a significant challenge to computer-aided design of quantum chips, especially for large-scale chips. Harnessing the scalability of graph neural networks (GNNs), we here propose a parameter designing algorithm for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits. The algorithm depends on the so-called 'three-stair scaling' mechanism, which comprises two neural-network models: an evaluator supervisedly trained on small-scale circuits for applying to medium-scale circuits, and a designer unsupervisedly trained on medium-scale circuits for applying to large-scale ones. We demonstrate our algorithm in mitigating quantum crosstalk errors. Frequencies for both single- and two-qubit gates (corresponding to the parameters of nodes and edges) are considered simultaneously. Numerical results indicate that the well-trained designer achieves notable advantages in efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. For example, for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits consisting of around 870 qubits, our GNNs-based algorithm achieves 51% of the errors produced by the state-of-the-art algorithm, with a time reduction from 90 min to 27 sec. Overall, a better-performing and more scalable algorithm for designing parameters of superconducting quantum chips is proposed, which initially demonstrates the advantages of applying GNNs in superconducting quantum chips.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum criticality of open many-body systems has attracted lots of interest for emergent phenomena and universality. Here we present the exact steady state of the quantum van der Pol oscillator using the complex $P$-representation. We show the threshold corresponds to a dissipative phase transition with abrupt changes of steady-state properties and enhanced metrology. The critical behaviors and finite-size effects are investigated through the analytical steady state. Moreover, we obtain divergent quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the thermodynamic limit both at the critical point and in the time crystal phase, but only the QFI at the critical point approaches the Heisenberg limit. We further prove that the steady-state photon number is the optimized estimated observable with the largest signal-to-noise ratio. We show that the Heisenberg-limited metrology originates from the larger enhancement of the susceptibility than the standard deviation of the photon number. Our work reveals the underlying relation between the time crystal, dissipative phase transition, and enhanced metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving hard optimization problems is one of the most promising application domains for quantum computers due to the ubiquity of such problems in industry and the availability of broadly applicable quantum speedups. However, the ability of near-term quantum computers to tackle industrial-scale optimization problems is limited by their size and the overheads of quantum error correction. Quantum Random Access Optimization (QRAO) has been proposed to reduce the space requirements of quantum optimization. However, to date QRAO has only been implemented using variational algorithms, which suffer from the need to train instance-specific variational parameters, making them difficult to scale. We propose and benchmark a non-variational approach to QRAO based on the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) for the MaxCut problem. We show that instance-independent ``fixed" parameters achieve good performance, removing the need for variational parameter optimization. Additionally, we evaluate different design choices, such as various mixers, initial states, and QRAO-specific implementations of the QAOA cost operator, and identify a strategy that performs well in practice. Our results pave the way for the practical execution of QRAO on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Over the past several decades, the proliferation of global classical communication networks has transformed various facets of human society. Concurrently, quantum networking has emerged as a dynamic field of research, driven by its potential applications in distributed quantum computing, quantum sensor networks, and secure communications. This prompts a fundamental question: rather than constructing quantum networks from scratch, can we harness the widely available classical fiber-optic infrastructure to establish hybrid quantum-classical networks? This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of ongoing research endeavors aimed at integrating quantum communication protocols, such as quantum key distribution, into existing lightwave networks. This approach offers the substantial advantage of reducing implementation costs by allowing classical and quantum communication protocols to share optical fibers, communication hardware, and other network control resources, arguably the most pragmatic solution in the near term. In the long run, classical communication will also reap the rewards of innovative quantum communication technologies, such as quantum memories and repeaters. Accordingly, our vision for the future of the Internet is that of heterogeneous communication networks thoughtfully designed for the seamless support of both classical and quantum communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of identifying a 2+1d topologically ordered phase using measurements on the ground-state wavefunction. For non-chiral topological order, we describe a series of bulk multipartite entanglement measures that extract the invariants $\sum_a d_a^2 \theta_a^r$ for any $r \geq 2$, where $d_a$ and $\theta_a$ are the quantum dimension and topological spin of an anyon $a$, respectively. These invariants are obtained as expectation values of permutation operators between $2r$ replicas of the wavefunction, applying different permutations on four distinct regions of the plane. Our proposed measures provide a refined tool for distinguishing topological phases, capturing information beyond conventional entanglement measures such as the topological entanglement entropy. We argue that any operator capable of extracting the above invariants must act on at least $2r$ replicas, making our procedure optimal in terms of the required number of replicas. We discuss the generalization of our results to chiral states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tightly-focused laser beams, or optical tweezers, are essential for analogue and digital quantum simulation with neutral atoms and trapped ions. Despite this, most of the current intuition and theoretical treatment utilizes the paraxial approximation, which breaks down at the focus of optical tweezers. We develop an analytic model, which we use in tandem with numerical simulations, to quantify how non-paraxial effects will manifest in the next-generation of scalable quantum hardware, where tightly focused beams are used for individual qubit control. In particular, we calculate the light potentials of Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian beams driving the quadrupole $^2$S$_{1/2}\rightarrow$ $^2$D$_{5/2}$ transition in $^{40}$Ca$^+$. Longitudinal field components in the beam center cause spatially-dependent Rabi frequencies and AC Stark shifts, leading to unexpected qubit-motion coupling. We characterize single- and two-qubit gate infidelities due to this effect with an analytic model and numerical simulation. We identify regimes where non-paraxial effects should be taken into account for high-precision quantum control. Finally, we highlight that non-paraxial effects are potentially more severe in the case of neutral atom and molecule addressing.</description>

Abstract: Black-box separations are a cornerstone of cryptography, indicating barriers to various goals. A recent line of work has explored black-box separations for quantum cryptographic primitives. Namely, a number of separations are known in the Common Haar Random State (CHRS) model, though this model is not considered a complete separation, but rather a starting point. A few very recent works have attempted to lift these separations to a unitary separation, which are considered complete separations. Unfortunately, we find significant errors in some of these lifting results.
  We prove general conditions under which CHRS separations can be generically lifted, thereby giving simple, modular, and bug-free proofs of complete unitary separations between various quantum primitives. Our techniques allow for simpler proofs of existing separations as well as new separations that were previously only known in the CHRS model.</description>

      <title>A heralded single-photon source implemented with second-order nonlinear photonic crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study implementing a heralded single-photon source with second-order nonlinear photonic crystals. Injecting pump and signal light beams into a one-dimensional photonic crystal composed of a material with a large second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$, we can transform the coherent incident signal light into squeezed light. Preparing two squeezed light beams by this method and input them into two ports of a 50-50 beam splitter independently, we can transform them into a two-mode squeezed state. Because those two modes of photons share entanglement, a single photon of the one mode is emitted with a high probability on the condition of the single-photon detection of the other mode as a heralding signal. We evaluate the efficiency and the second-order intensity correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ for this heralded single-photon source. Moreover, we examine changes in the efficiency and $g^{(2)}(0)$ when we assume that the single-photon detector for the heralding signal is imperfect. For a specific concrete example, we consider a case where the nonlinear medium is lithium niobate $\mbox{LiNbO}_{3}$ and the frequency of the incident signal light is on the order of $10^{14}$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Learning entanglement from tomography data: contradictory measurement importance for neural networks and random forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effectiveness of two distinct machine learning techniques, neural networks and random forests, in the quantification of entanglement from two-qubit tomography data. Although we predictably find that neural networks yield better accuracy, we also find that the way that the two methods reach their prediction is starkly different. This is seen by the measurements which arthe most important for the classification. Neural networks follow the intuitive prediction that measurements containing information about non-local coherences are most important for entanglement, but random forests signify the dominance of information contained in occupation measurements. This is because occupation measurements are necessary for the extraction of data about all other density matrix elements from the remaining measurements. The same discrepancy does not occur when the models are used to learn entanglement directly from the elements of the density matrix, so it is the result of the scattering of information and interdependence of measurement data. As a result, the models behave differently when noise is introduced to various measurements, which can be harnessed to obtain more reliable information about entanglement from noisy tomography data.</description>

      <title>Is Circuit Depth Accurate for Comparing Quantum Circuit Runtimes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although quantum circuit depth is commonly used to approximate circuit runtimes, it overlooks a prevailing trait of current hardware implementation: different gates have different execution times. Recognizing the potential for discrepancies, we investigate depth's accuracy for comparing runtimes between compiled versions of the same circuit. In particular, we assess the accuracy of traditional and multi-qubit depth for (1) predicting relative differences in runtime and (2) identifying compiled circuit version(s) with the shortest runtime. Finding that circuit depth is not accurate for either task, we introduce a new metric, gate-aware depth, that weights gates' contributions to runtime using an architecture's average gate execution times. Using average gate times allows gate-aware depth to capture variations by gate type without requiring exact knowledge of all gate times, increasing accuracy while maintaining portability across devices of the same architecture. Compared to traditional and multi-qubit depth, gate-aware depth reduces the average relative error of predictions in task (1) by 68 and 18 times and increases the average number of correct identifications in task (2) by 20 and 43 percentage points, respectively. Finally, we provide gate-aware depth weight configurations for current IBM Eagle and Heron architectures.</description>

      <title>Role of Nonstabilizerness in Quantum Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum optimization has emerged as a promising approach for tackling complicated classical optimization problems using quantum devices. However, the extent to which such algorithms harness genuine quantum resources and the role of these resources in their success remain open questions. In this work, we investigate the resource requirements of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) through the lens of the resource theory of nonstabilizerness. We demonstrate that the nonstabilizerness in QAOA increases with circuit depth before it reaches a maximum, to fall again during the approach to the final solution state -- creating a barrier that limits the algorithm's capability for shallow circuits. We find curves corresponding to different depths to collapse under a simple rescaling, and we reveal a nontrivial relationship between the final nonstabilizerness and the success probability. Finally, we identify a similar nonstabilizerness barrier also in adiabatic quantum annealing. Our results provide deeper insights into how quantum resources influence quantum optimization.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Memory Effects in the Dynamics of Two-Level System Defect Ensembles Using Broadband, Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-level system (TLS) defects in dielectrics are a major source of decoherence in superconducting circuits, yet their atomistic origin, frequency distribution, and dipole moments remain poorly understood. Current probes, which are predominantly based on qubits or resonators, require complex fabrication and only measure defects within a narrow frequency band and limited mode volume, hindering direct insight into TLS defect behaviour in isolated materials and interfaces. Here, we introduce a broadband 3D waveguide spectroscopy technique that enables cryogenic probing of ensembles of TLS defects that we call Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS). Complementary to the dielectric dipper method, this approach probes a broader spectrum and reveals interference of drive-induced sidebands of the ensembles of TLS defects. The broadband and power-tunable nature of BCTDS makes it especially well-suited to the study of dressed-state physics in driven ensembles of TLS defects, including multi-photon processes and sideband-resolved dynamics. Additionally, BCTDS enables the identification of eigenmode frequencies of the undriven ensembles of TLS defects through characteristic V-shaped features obtained via Fourier analysis of time-domain signals, and shows evidence of memory effects arising from interactions and the broadband nature of our approach. Crucially, our method is modular and can be applied throughout the device fabrication process, informing mitigation strategies and advancing the design of low-loss materials with broad implications for quantum technologies and materials science.</description>

      <title>Efficient QAOA Architecture for Solving Multi-Constrained Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel combination of constraint encoding methods for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Ansatz (QAOA). Real-world optimization problems typically consist of multiple types of constraints. To solve these optimization problems with quantum methods, normally, all constraints are added as quadratic penalty terms to the objective, which expands the search space and increases problem complexity. This work proposes a general workflow that extracts and encodes specific constraints directly into the circuit of QAOA: One-hot constraints are enforced through $XY$-mixers that restrict the search space to the feasible sub-space naturally. Inequality constraints are implemented through oracle-based Indicator Functions (IF). This paper focuses on the numerical benchmarks of the combined approach for solving the Multi-Knapsack (MKS) and the Prosumer Problem (PP), a modification of the MKS in the domain of electricity optimization. To this end, we introduce computational techniques that efficiently simulate the two presented constraint architectures. Since $XY$-mixers restrict the search space, specific state vector entries are always zero and can be omitted from the simulation, saving valuable memory and computing resources. We benchmark the combined method against the established QUBO formulation, yielding a better solution quality and probability of sampling the optimal solution. Despite more complex circuits, the time-to-solution is more than an order of magnitude faster compared to the baseline methods and exhibits more favorable scaling properties.</description>

      <title>Erasure cost of a quantum process: A thermodynamic meaning of the dynamical min-entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The erasure of information is fundamentally an irreversible logical operation, carrying profound consequences for the energetics of computation and information processing. We investigate the thermodynamic costs associated with erasing (and preparing) quantum processes. Specifically, we analyze an arbitrary bipartite unitary gate acting on logical and ancillary input-output systems, where the ancillary input is always initialized in the ground state. We focus on the adversarial erasure cost of the reduced dynamics -- that is, the minimal thermodynamic work cost to erase the logical output of the gate for any logical input, assuming full access to the ancilla but no access to any purifying reference of the logical input state. We determine that this adversarial erasure cost is directly proportional to the negative min-entropy of the reduced dynamics, thereby giving the dynamical min-entropy a clear operational meaning. The dynamical min-entropy can take positive and negative values, depending on the underlying quantum dynamics. The negative value of the erasure cost implies that the extraction of thermodynamic work is possible instead of its consumption during the process. A key foundation of this result is the quantum process decoupling theorem, which quantitatively relates the decoupling ability of a process with its min-entropy. This insight bridges thermodynamics, information theory, and the fundamental limits of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Entropic Dynamics approach to Relational Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The general framework of Entropic Dynamics (ED) is used to construct non-relativistic models of relational quantum mechanics from well known inference principles - probability, entropy and information geometry. Although only partially relational - the absolute structures of simultaneity and Euclidean geometry are still retained - these models provide a useful testing ground for ideas that will prove useful in the context of more realistic relativistic theories. The fact that in ED the positions of particles have definite values, just as in classical mechanics, has allowed us to adapt to the quantum case some intuitions from Barbour and Bertotti's classical framework. Here, however, we propose a new measure of the mismatch between successive states that is adapted to the information metric and the symplectic structures of the quantum phase space. We make explicit that ED is temporally relational and we construct non-relativistic quantum models that are spatially relational with respect to rigid translations and rotations. The ED approach settles the longstanding question of what form should the constraints of a classical theory take after quantization: the quantum constraints that express relationality are to be imposed on expectation values. To highlight the potential impact of these developments, the non-relativistic quantum model is parametrized into a generally covariant form and we show that the ED approach evades the analogue of what in quantum gravity has been called the problem of time.</description>

Abstract: While quantum annealers have emerged as versatile and controllable platforms for experimenting on correlated spin systems, the important phenomenology of magnetic memory and hysteresis remain unexplored on hardware designed to escape metastable states via quantum tunneling. Here, we present the first general protocol to experiment on magnetic hysteresis on programmable quantum annealers, and implement it on three D-Wave superconducting qubit quantum annealers, using up to thousands of spins, for both ferromagnetic and disordered Ising models, and across different graph topologies. We observe hysteresis loops whose area depends non-monotonically on quantum fluctuations, exhibiting both expected and unexpected features, such as disorder-induced steps and non-monotonicities. Our work establishes quantum annealers as a platform for probing non-equilibrium emergent magnetic phenomena, thereby broadening the role of analog quantum computers into foundational questions in condensed matter physics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for security analysis against the Trojan-horse attacks (THA) launched to a practical fiber-based quantum key distribution (QKD) system across a wide spectral range. To achieve this, we utilize optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR) for the spectral reflectance analysis in the near-infrared range 1100 - 1800 nm with centimeter-level resolution and with a noise floor down to -80 dB. Finally, the total theoretical-security analysis against the THA side channel considering the spectral reflectance and transmittance data over this spectral range is conducted. To the best of our knowledge, our OTDR setup and the corresponding results are the first of their kind in a wide spectral range.</description>

      <title>All entangled states can be certified by a violation of noncontextuality inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By combining the assumption of Bell locality with that of generalized noncontextuality, we define different classes of noncontextuality inequalities for correlations in a bipartite Bell scenario. These classes are distinguished by which operational identities are enforced, where certain natural subsets form a hierarchy and provide a new way to understand and classify different forms of quantum correlations. Specifically, we show that violations of inequalities at different levels of this hierarchy can serve as witnesses to determine whether a bipartite quantum state exhibits entanglement, steering, or nonlocality, thereby giving a systematic and unified method for certifying these distinct bipartite quantum resources. To illustrate the power of this approach, we demonstrate the violation of one such inequality in an experiment with polarization-entangled photons. This experimental implementation enables us to certify entanglement in certain two-qubit isotropic states for which certification by Bell or steering inequalities is known to be impossible. Our entanglement certification scheme is the first to combine all of the following desirable features: it requires no prior characterization of the measurements, it delivers a verdict based on quantities that are independent of the tomographic gauge freedom, and it is able to certify {\em any} entangled state without requiring any auxiliary entangled sources.</description>

      <title>Computational Study of the Spectral Behaviour of Different Isospectrally Patterned Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a computational spectral analysis of different isospectrally patterned lattices (IPL). Having been introduced very recently, the lattice Hamiltonian of IPL consist of coupled cells which possess all the same set of eigenvalues. The latter is achieved in a controllable manner by parametrizing the cells via the phases of the involved orthogonal (or unitary) transformations. This opens the doorway of systematically designing lattice Hamiltonians with unique properties by choosing correspondingly varying phases across the lattice. Here we focus on two-dimensional cells and explore symmetric as well as asymmetric IPL w.r.t. a given center. A tunable fraction of localized vs. delocalized eigenstates belonging to the three subdomains of the corresponding energy bands is demonstrated and analyzed with different measures of localization. In the asymmetric case the center of localization can be shifted arbitrarily by shifting the underlying phase grid. Introducing a complete phase revolution leads for low and high energies to two well-separated branches of localized states which finally merge with increasing energy into the branch of delocalized states. Remarkably, the localized states appear in near-degenerate pairs and this near-degeneracy is lifted upon entering the delocalization regime. A corresponding generalization to several phase revolutions is provided showing a characteristic nodal pattern among the near-degenerate eigenstates.</description>

      <title>A Modular PyTheus Quantum Network Interpreter: Automated Analysis and Visualization of Optimized Quantum Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a modular interpreter for PyTheus-optimized quantum networks that automatically analyzes and visualizes complex quantum architectures discovered through automated optimization. The interpreter addresses the critical challenge of understanding machine-designed quantum networks by providing robust algorithms for functional role identification, graph-theoretical analysis, and physically meaningful visualization across the major classes of PyTheus-generated networks. Our interpreter accepts both file-based and in-memory network representations, automatically identifies sources, detectors, beam splitters, and ancillas through priority-based classification, and generates coordinated native graph plots and optical table representations. We demonstrate the interpreter's capabilities through two complementary approaches: (1) analysis of a newly developed five-node quantum key distribution network that reveals distributed source architecture and dual-role node functionality, and (2) comprehensive validation using existing PyTheus examples including W4 state generation, heralded Bell state preparation, and GHZ state networks. The interpreter successfully handles complex connectivity patterns across diverse quantum network architectures within the tested classes, avoids visualization artifacts, and provides validation mechanisms for architectural consistency. Our primary contribution is the development of robust modular interpretation algorithms that can analyze the major classes of PyTheus-generated quantum networks, enabling better understanding of automated quantum architecture design.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emission in dipole approximation -- revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous emission in dipole approximation is studied theoretically using both source-field theory and a Schrodinger picture approach. Using source-field theory we obtain formal equations for the Poynting vector and energy density without making the rotating wave approximation (RWA) and Weisskopf-Wigner approximation (WWA). The initial condition at t=0 is one in which the atom is in an excited state and the field in the vacuum state. The source-field expressions are evaluated within the the RWA and WWA and are found to satisfy Poynting's theorem. To explore the consequences of not making the RWA and WWA, the Poynting vector and energy density are calculated using perturbation theory. We use a Schrodinger picture approach and essentially reproduce and complement the results of Compagno, Passante, and Persico [J. Mod. Optics 37:8, 1377 (2007)] and those of Power and Thirunamachandran [Phys. Rev. A 45, 54 (1992)] obtained using a Heisenberg picture approach. The theory involves a sum over field mode frequencies and both finite cutoffs and convergence factors are used to carry out the sums. It is shown that the perturbation theory calculation leads to unphysical values for atomic state populations for all times when a sum over all field frequencies is taken, even if a convergence factor is used. It is also proved that the fields calculated using source-field theory always satisfy Poynting's theorem for ct not equal to R, where R is the distance from the atom.</description>

Abstract: The Wigner's Friend thought experiment stands as one of the most intellectually provocative and challenging conceptual puzzles in quantum mechanics. It compels us to confront profound questions concerning the fundamental nature of reality, the very act of observation, and the possible role that consciousness might play within the quantum measurement process. This article gives a general presentation, beginning with Eugene Wigner's seminal proposal of the original thought experiment. In this paper, we explore its initial implications, which shook the foundations of classical physics, and then progress to an examination of the recent theoretical advancements and the ingenious extended versions of the experiment. The recent versions seem to imply that it is no more possible to consider events as absolute.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks reveal topological flat bands, robust edge states and topological phase transitions in cyclic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological phases, edge states, and flat bands in synthetic quantum systems are a key resource for topological quantum computing and noise-resilient information processing. We introduce a scheme based on step-dependent quantum walks on cyclic graphs, termed cyclic quantum walks (CQWs), to simulate exotic topological phenomena using discrete Fourier transforms and an effective Hamiltonian. Our approach enables the generation of both gapped and gapless topological phases, including Dirac cone-like energy dispersions, topologically nontrivial flat bands, and protected edge states, all without resorting to split-step or split-coin protocols. Odd and even-site cyclic graphs exhibit markedly different spectral characteristics, with rotationally symmetric flat bands emerging exclusively in $4n$-site graphs ($n\in \mathbf{N}$). We analytically establish the conditions for the emergence of topological, gapped flat bands and show that gap closings in rotation space imply the formation of Dirac cones in momentum space. Further, we engineer protected edge states at the interface between distinct topological phases in both odd and even cycle graphs. We numerically demonstrate that the edge states are robust against moderate static and dynamic gate disorder and remain stable against phase-preserving perturbations. This scheme serves as a resource-efficient and versatile platform for engineering topological phases, transitions, edge states, and flat bands in quantum systems, opening new avenues for fault-tolerant quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Mobile Impurity in a Two-Leg Bosonic Ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a mobile impurity in a two-leg bosonic ladder. The impurity moves both along and across the legs and interacts with a bath of interacting bosonic particles present in the ladder. We use both analytical (Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid - TLL) and numerical (Density Matrix Renormalization Group - DMRG) methods to compute the Green's function of the impurity. We find that for a small impurity-bath interaction, the bonding mode of the impurity effectively couples only to the gapless mode of the bath while the anti-bonding mode of the impurity couples to both gapped and gapless mode of the bath. We compute the time dependence of the Green's function of the impurity, for impurity created either in the anti-bonding or bonding mode with a given momentum. The later case leads to a decay as a power-law below a critical momentum and exponential above, while the former case always decays exponentially. We compare the DMRG results with analytical results using the linked cluster expansion and find a good agreement. In addition we use DMRG to extract the lifetime of the quasi-particle, when the Green's function decays exponentially. We also treat the case of an infinite bath-impurity coupling for which both the bonding and antibonding modes are systematically affected. For this case the impurity Green's function in the bonding mode decays as a power-law at zero momentum.The corresponding exponent increases with increasing transverse-tunneling of the impurity. We compare our results with the other impurity problems for which the motion of either the impurity or the bath is limited to a single chain. Finally we comments on the consequences of our findings for experiments with the ultracold gasses.</description>

      <title>Pauli spin blockade at room temperature in double-quantum-dot tunneling through individual deep dopants in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pauli spin blockade (PSB) is a spin-dependent charge transport process that typically appears in double quantum dot (QD) devices and is employed in fundamental research on single spins in nanostructures to read out semiconductor qubits. The operating temperature of PSB is limited by that of the QDs and remains below 10 K, limiting wide application development. Herein, we confirm that a single deep dopant in the channel of a silicon field effect transistor functions as a room-temperature QD; consequently, transport through two different deep dopants exhibits PSB up to room temperature. The characteristic magnetoconductance provides a means to identify PSB and enables the PSB device to function as a magnetic sensor with a sensitivity below geomagnetic field. Lifting in PSB caused by magnetic resonance (50 K) and Rabi oscillations (10 K) are also observed. Further development of this unique system may lead to room-temperature quantum technologies based on silicon technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent currents flowing in spatially closed tracks define one of the most iconic concepts in mesoscopic physics. They have been studied in solid-state platforms such as superfluids, superconductors and metals. Cold atoms trapped in magneto-optical toroidal circuits and driven by suitable artificial gauge fields allow us to study persistent currents with unprecedented control and flexibility of the system's physical conditions. Here, we review persistent currents of ultracold matter. Capitalizing on the remarkable progress in driving different atomic species to quantum degeneracy, persistent currents of single or multicomponent bosons/fermions, and their mixtures can be addressed within the present experimental know-how. This way, fundamental concepts of quantum science and many-body physics, like macroscopic quantum coherence, solitons, vortex dynamics, fermionic pairing and BEC-BCS crossover can be studied from a novel perspective. Finally, we discuss how persistent currents can form the basis of new technological applications like matter-wave gyroscopes and interferometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the complex frequency fingerprint (CFF), an experimentally accessible method for detecting the complex frequency Green's function (GF). Unlike the real frequency GF, where $\omega$ is real, this complex frequency GF is shown to play a necessary role in both non-Hermitian and quantum many-body systems. For non-Hermitian systems, we will prove that our method detects complex energy spectra, eigenstates, and complex frequency GFs throughout the complex plane, providing necessary identification of the non-Hermitian skin effect. For quantum many-body systems, our method reveals quasiparticle peaks across the complex plane and intuitively illustrates interaction effects. This information is difficult to obtain with real frequency detection. Our method paves the way for exploring exotic phenomena in both non-Hermitian and quantum many-body systems, bridging theory and experiment across diverse physical areas.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, $S$-duality, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. In essence, this work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new avenues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, suggests the existence of an $S$-duality of spacetime curvatures, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11783v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. Yet, generic principles linking lattice architecture, strain, and band topology remain scarce. Here, using a unified graph-theoretic framework we generate entire families of two-dimensional lattices and, using analytical tight-binding calculations, demonstrate that a single mechanical knob -- uniform in-plane strain -- drives universal transitions between trivial insulating, Dirac semimetal, and quantum spin-Hall phases across all lattices. The framework yields several flat band lattices that were hitherto absent or largely unexplored in the literature -- for example, the checkerboard split-graph and triangular-Kagome lattices -- whose strain-driven topological phase diagrams we establish here for the first time. The design rules implied by our studies provide a blueprint for engineering topological states in a wide variety of 2D materials, photonic crystals, and circuit lattices, and are anticipated to accelerate the discovery of strain-programmable quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning in Precision Medicine and Drug Discovery -- A Game Changer for Tailored Treatments?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The digitization of healthcare presents numerous challenges, including the complexity of biological systems, vast data generation, and the need for personalized treatment plans. Traditional computational methods often fall short, leading to delayed and sometimes ineffective diagnoses and treatments. Quantum Computing (QC) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offer transformative advancements with the potential to revolutionize medicine. This paper summarizes areas where QC promises unprecedented computational power, enabling faster, more accurate diagnostics, personalized treatments, and enhanced drug discovery processes. However, integrating quantum technologies into precision medicine also presents challenges, including errors in algorithms and high costs. We show that mathematically-based techniques for specifying, developing, and verifying software (formal methods) can enhance the reliability and correctness of QC. By providing a rigorous mathematical framework, formal methods help to specify, develop, and verify systems with high precision. In genomic data analysis, formal specification languages can precisely (1) define the behavior and properties of quantum algorithms designed to identify genetic markers associated with diseases. Model checking tools can systematically explore all possible states of the algorithm to (2) ensure it behaves correctly under all conditions, while theorem proving techniques provide mathematical (3) proof that the algorithm meets its specified properties, ensuring accuracy and reliability. Additionally, formal optimization techniques can (4) enhance the efficiency and performance of quantum algorithms by reducing resource usage, such as the number of qubits and gate operations. Therefore, we posit that formal methods can significantly contribute to enabling QC to realize its full potential as a game changer in precision medicine.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature quantum topological order in three dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a three-dimensional system that exhibits long-range entanglement at sufficiently small but nonzero temperature--it therefore constitutes a quantum topological order at finite temperature. The model of interest is known as the fermionic toric code, a variant of the usual 3D toric code, which admits emergent fermionic point-like excitations. The fermionic toric code, importantly, possesses an anomalous 2-form symmetry, associated with the space-like Wilson loops of the fermionic excitations. We argue that it is this symmetry that imbues low-temperature thermal states with a novel topological order and long-range entanglement. Based on the current classification of three-dimensional topological orders, we expect that the low-temperature thermal states of the fermionic toric code belong to an equilibrium phase of matter that only exists at nonzero temperatures. We conjecture that further examples of topological orders at nonzero temperatures are given by discrete gauge theories with anomalous 2-form symmetries. Our work therefore opens the door to studying quantum topological order at nonzero temperature in physically realistic dimensions.</description>

Abstract: A tunable magnetic field at low temperatures is essential for numerous applications, including spintronics, magnetic resonance imaging, and condensed matter physics. While commercial superconducting vector magnets are available, they are complex, expensive, and often not adaptable to specific experimental needs. As a result, simple in-house designs are often being used in research environments. However, no comprehensive step-by-step guide for their construction currently exists. In this work, we provide a detailed manual for designing and building a cryogenically compatible three-axis vector magnet. The system is tested at the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator at temperatures ranging from 15 mK to 4 K, with no significant increase in base temperature. Safety measures are implemented to mitigate heating from quenching. The coils are successfully driven with DC currents as high as 3 A, generating magnetic fields of up to 2.5 T in the bobbin's bore and 0.4 T at the sample position. Magnetic field measurements using Hall sensors demonstrate good agreement with the predictions of the designed performance.</description>

      <title>Compact vacuum levitation and control platform with a single 3D-printed fiber lens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Levitated dielectric particles in a vacuum have emerged as a new platform in quantum science, with applications ranging from precision acceleration and force sensing to testing quantum physics beyond the microscopic domain. Traditionally, particle levitation relies on optical tweezers formed by tightly focused laser beams, which typically require multiple bulk optical elements aligned in free space, limiting robustness and scalability of the system. To address these challenges, we employ a single optical fiber equipped with a high numerical aperture (NA) lens directly printed onto the fiber facet. This enables a compact yet robust optical levitation and detection system composed entirely of fiber-based components, eliminating the need for complex alignment. The high NA of the printed lens allows stable single-beam trapping of a dielectric nanoparticle in a vacuum, even while the fiber is in controlled motion. The high NA also allows for collecting scattered light from the particle with excellent collection efficiency, thus enabling efficient detection and feedback stabilization of the particle's motion. Our platform paves the way for practical and portable sensors based on levitated particles and provides simple yet elegant solutions to complex experiments requiring the integration of levitated particles.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hypothesis Testing Lemma for Deterministic Identification over Quantum Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous work, we presented the \emph{Hypothesis Testing Lemma}, a key tool that establishes sufficient conditions for the existence of good deterministic identification (DI) codes for memoryless channels with finite output, but arbitrary input alphabets. In this work, we provide a full quantum analogue of this lemma, which shows that the existence of a DI code in the quantum setting follows from a suitable packing in a modified space of output quantum states. Specifically, we demonstrate that such a code can be constructed using product states derived from this packing. This result enables us to tighten the capacity lower bound for DI over quantum channels beyond the simultaneous decoding approach. In particular, we can now express these bounds solely in terms of the Minkowski dimension of a certain state space, giving us new insights to better understand the nature of the protocol, and the separation between simultaneous and non-simultaneous codes. We extend the discussion with a particular channel example for which we can construct an optimum code.</description>

Abstract: This study explores the correlation between iron mass on cell surfaces and the resultant magnetic field. Human colorectal cancer cells (HT29 line) were labeled with varying concentrations of SPIONs and imaged via a NV center widefield magnetic microscope. To assess the labeling efficacy, a convolutional neural network trained on simulated magnetic dipole data was utilized to reconstruct key labeling parameters on a cell-by-cell basis, including cell diameter, sensor proximity, and the iron mass associated with surface-bound SPIONs. Our analysis provided quantitative metrics for these parameters across a range of labeling concentrations. The findings indicated that increasing SPION concentration enhances both the cell-surface iron mass and magnetic field strength, demonstrating a saturation effect. This methodology offers a coherent framework for the quantitative, high-throughput characterization of magnetically labeled cells, presenting significant implications for the fields of cell biology and magnetic sensing applications.</description>

Abstract: Doppler-broadening thermometry (DBT) can be used as a calibration-free primary reference suitable for practical applications, e.g. reliably measuring temperatures over long periods of time in environments where sensor retrieval is impractical. We report on our proof-of-concept investigations into DBT with alkali metal vapour cells, with a particular focus on both absorption and frequency accuracy during scans. We reach sub-kelvin temperature accuracy, and experimental absorption fit residuals below $0.05\,\%$, in a simple setup. The outlook for portable, practical devices is bright, with clear prospects for future improvement.</description>

      <title>The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solutions to many problems in the mathematical, computational, and physical sciences often involve multidimensional integrals. A direct numerical evaluation of the integral incurs a computational cost that is exponential in the number of dimensions, a phenomenon called the curse of dimensionality. The problem is so substantial that one usually employs sampling methods, like Monte Carlo, to avoid integration altogether. Here, we derive and implement a quantum algorithm to compress a multidimensional integrand into a product of matrix-valued functions - a spectral tensor train - changing the computational complexity of integration from exponential to polynomial. The algorithm compresses the integrand by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an unentangled quantum state, where each term corresponds to a body-ordered term in the potential. Because it allows for the systematic elimination of small contributions to the integral through decimation, we call the method integral decimation. The functions in the spectral basis are analytically differentiable and integrable, and in applications to the partition function, integral decimation numerically factorizes an interacting system into a product of noninteracting ones. We illustrate integral decimation by evaluating the absolute free energy and entropy of a chiral XY model as a continuous function of temperature. We also compute the nonequilibrium time-dependent reduced density matrix of a quantum chain with between two and forty levels, each coupled to colored noise. When other methods provide numerical solutions to these models, they quantitatively agree with integral decimation. When conventional methods become intractable, integral decimation can be a powerful alternative.</description>

      <title>Operator Ordering in the Relativistic Quantization: Specific Heat in the Rindler Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17362</link>

Abstract: We introduce a covariant canonical quantization for a particle in curved spacetime that tracks operator-ordering ambiguities. Parameterizing spatial and temporal ordering, we derive a Hermitian Hamiltonian with leading quantum-relativistic corrections. In a uniformly accelerated frame, we show the semiclassical heat-capacity approximation misses these effects and then develop a perturbative quantum treatment using Airy-function modes to obtain analytical first- and second-order energy shifts. Including these shifts in the partition function yields nontrivial, ordering-dependent specific-heat corrections. Numerical studies for electrons in extreme electric fields and ultra-light particles in strong gravitational fields demonstrate that these corrections become significant at intermediate temperatures. Enforcing the Tolman-Ehrenfest relation for spatial temperature variation further modulates the heat-capacity profile. Our results suggest that precision calorimetry in laser-acceleration or analogue gravity setups could probe quantum-ordering effects in relativistic regimes.</description>
