      <title>Hydrostatic bubbles of compressible fluid in an incompressible fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stationary configurations of compressible barotropic fluids lying inside an incompressible fluid and acted upon by a constant gravitational field. Without gravity, it is a simple matter to construct solutions consisting of perfectly spherical bubbles of compressible fluid, but with gravity the stratification of the compressible fluid's density prevents the existence of solutions with such simple geometries. We construct smooth solutions with nontrivial gravity and nearly spherical, axisymmetric geometry by means of a bifurcation argument in an appropriate weighted Sobolev space, defined in terms of the Legendre operator. Along the way, we develop a number of essential linear and nonlinear functional analytic tools for this scale of spaces, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of globally hypoelliptic pseudo-differential operators on $\mathbb{R}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the stability of the global regularity for a class of pseudo-differential operators under lower-order perturbations. We establish that if an operator has a globally hypoelliptic symbol, its global regularity (in the sense of Schwartz functions and tempered distributions) is preserved when perturbed by operators of sufficiently lower order. This result applies in particular to operators within the Shubin and SG classes. Furthermore, we discuss why this stability result does not hold in the standard H\"ormander classes.</description>

      <title>Comparison Principle, A.B.P.-type estimates for solutions of quasi-linear elliptic equations in non-divergence form and some implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish global gradient estimates to solutions of quasilinear elliptic models in non-divergence form with general degeneracy law and a Hamiltonian term, given by $$ -\Psi(x, |\nabla u|)\Delta_p^{\mathrm{N}}u(x)+\mathscr{H}(x,\nabla u)=f(x) \quad \mathrm{in} \quad \Omega, \quad \mathrm{for} \,\,\,1&lt;p&lt; \infty, $$ under suitable assumptions on the data of the problem. Particularly, our results are relevant for a class of quasi-linear models with Hamiltonian terms. Additionally, we address non-degeneracy estimates for such solutions and present a couple of applications.</description>

      <title>$(H,H^2)$-smoothing effect of Navier-Stokes equations with additive white noise on two-dimensional torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the regularity of Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with additive white noise on two-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^2$. Under the conditions that the external force $f(x)$ belongs to the phase space $ H$ and the noise intensity function $h(x)$ satisfies $\|\nabla h\|_{L^\infty} \leq \sqrt \pi \nu \lambda_1$, where $ \nu $ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and $\lambda_1$ is the first eigenvalue of the Stokes operator, it was proved that the random NS equations possess a tempered $(H,H^2)$-random attractor whose (box-counting) fractal dimension in $H^2$ is finite. This was achieved by establishing, first, an $H^2$ bounded absorbing set and, second, an $(H,H^2)$-smoothing effect of the system which lifts the compactness and finite-dimensionality of the attractor in $H$ to that in $H^2$. Since the force $f$ belongs only to $H$, the $H^2$-regularity of solutions as well as the $H^2$-bounded absorbing set was constructed by an indirect approach of estimating the $H^2$-distance between the solution of the random NS equations and that of the corresponding deterministic equations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic limit of a vector-valued Allen-Cahn equation for phase transition dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic limit, as $\varepsilon\to 0$, of solutions to a vector-valued Allen-Cahn equation $$ \partial_t u = \Delta u - \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \partial_u F(u), $$ where $u: \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$ and $F(u): \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is a nonnegative radial function which vanishes precisely on two concentric spheres. This equation, proposed and studied by Bronsard and Stoth [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 1998] for the case $n=2$, serves as a typical example for a general reaction-diffusion equation introduced by Rubinstein, Sternberg, and Keller to model chemical reactions and diffusions as well as phase transitions. We establish that the sharp interface limit is a two-phase flow system: (i) The interface evolves by mean curvature flow; (ii) Within the bulk phase regions, the solution follows the harmonic map heat flow into $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$; (iii) Across the interface, the $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$-valued vectors on the two sides satisfy a mixed boundary condition.
  Furthermore, we rigorously justify this limit using the matched asymptotic expansion method. First, we employ the idea of ``quasi-minimal connecting orbits'' developed in Fei, Lin, Wang, and Zhang [Invent. Math. 2023] to construct approximated solutions up to arbitrary order. Second, we derive a uniform spectral lower bound for the linearized operator around the approximate solution, which relies on a novel application of the boundary condition. To achieve this, we introduce a suitable decomposition which can reduce the problem to spectral analysis of two scalar one-dimensional linear operators and some singular product estimates.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic limit for the dynamic isotropic-nematic phase transition with anisotropic elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the isotropic-nematic phase transition with anisotropic elasticity governed by the Landau-de Gennes dynamics of liquid crystals. For $-\frac{3}{2}&lt; L&lt;0,$ we rigorously justify the limit from the Landau-de Gennes flow to a sharp interface system characterized by a two-phase flow: The interface evolves via motion by mean curvature; In the isotropic region, $Q=0$; In the nematic region, $Q=s_+(nn-\frac{1}{3}I)$ with $n\in \mathbb{S}^2$ and $s_+&gt;0$, where the alignment vector field $n$ satisfies $$(2s_+^2\partial_t n+h)\times n=0$$ and $h=-\frac{\delta E(n,\nabla n)}{\delta n}$ with $E(n,\nabla n)$ denoting the Oseen-Frank energy; On the interface, the strong anchoring condition $n=\nu$ is satisfied. This result rigorously verifies a claim made by de Gennes [Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst. 1971] regarding the surface tension strength of isotropic-nematic interfaces in dynamical settings.
  Furthermore, we rigorously justify this limit using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. First, we employ the idea of ``quasi-minimal connecting orbits'' developed by Fei-Lin-Wang-Zhang [Invent.math. 2023] to construct approximated solutions up to arbitrary order. Second, we derive a uniform spectral lower bound for the linearized operator around the approximate solution. To achieve this, we introduce a suitable basis decomposition and a coordinate transformation to reduce the problem to spectral analysis of two scalar one-dimensional linear operators and some singular product estimates. To address the difficulties arising from anisotropic elasticity and the strong anchoring boundary condition, we introduce a div-curl decomposition and, when estimating the cross terms, combine these with the anisotropic elastic terms to close the energy estimates.</description>

      <title>On restricted-type Strichartz estimates and the applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a rigorous framework for the Zakharov system on waveguide manifolds $\mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{T}^n$ ($m,n\geq 1$), which models the nonlinear coupling between optical and acoustic modes in confined geometries such as optical fibers. Our analysis reveals that the sharp \textit{shell-type Strichartz estimate} for $\mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{T}$ is globally valid in time and exhibits no derivative loss via the measure estimate of semi-algebraic sets, unlike the periodic case studied in \cite{MR4665720}. In addition, we demonstrate that such an estimate fails on the product space $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}^2$ by constructing a counter-example.
  Moreover, we derive analogues of these shell-type estimates in other dimensions, both in the waveguide and Euclidean settings. As a direct application, we establish, for the first time, a local well-posedness theory for the partially periodic Zakharov system. To summarize, we compare shell-type Strichartz estimates in different settings (the Euclidean, the periodic, and the waveguide).
  Numerical verification on $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}$ reveals a uniform $L^4$-spacetime bound, while $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}^2$ exhibits sublinear growth, quantitatively confirming the theoretical dichotomy between geometries with different dimensional confinement.
  These findings advance the understanding of dispersive effects in hybrid geometries and provide mathematical foundations for efficient waveguide design and signal transmission.
  Finally, for the Euclidean case, we establish well-posedness theory for supercritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with \textit{strip-type} frequency-restricted initial data, revealing a trade-off between dispersion and confinement, which is of independent mathematical interest. This provides a deterministic analogue to random data theory of NLS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the discrete fractional logarithmic Kirchhoff equation $$ \left(a+b \int_{\mathbb{Z}^d}|\nabla^s u|^{2} d \mu\right) (-\Delta)^s u+h(x) u=|u|^{p-2}u \log u^{2}, \quad x\in \mathbb{Z}^d, $$ where $a,\,b&gt;0$ and $0&lt;s&lt;1$. Under suitable assumptions on $h(x)$, we first prove the existence of ground state solutions by the mountain-pass theorem for $p&gt;4$; then we verify the existence of ground state sign-changing solutions based on the method of Nehari manifold for $p&gt;6$. Finally, we establish the multiplicity of nontrivial weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Euler's elastica functional as a large mass limit of a two-dimensional non-local isoperimetric problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a large mass limit of the non-local isoperimetric problem with a repulsive Yukawa potential in two space dimensions. In this limit, the non-local term concentrates on the boundary, resulting in the existence of a critical regime in which the perimeter and the non-local terms cancel each other out to leading order. We show that under appropriate scaling assumptions the next-order $\Gamma$-limit of the energy with respect to the $L^1$ convergence of the rescaled sets is given by a weighted sum of the perimeter and Euler's elastica functional, where the latter is understood via the lower-semicontinuous relaxation and is evaluated on the system of boundary curves. As a consequence, we prove that in the considered regime the energy minimizers always exist and converge to either disks or annuli, depending on the relative strength of the elastica term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study positivity-preserving properties for the elastic flow of non-compact, complete curves in Euclidean space. Despite the fact that the canonical elastic energy is infinite in this context, we extend our recent work based on the adapted elastic energy to derive nontrivial optimal thresholds for maintaining planar embeddedness and graphicality, respectively. We also obtain a new Li--Yau type inequality for complete planar curves.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Angular Viscosity Limit For Micropolar Fluid Model In $\mathbb{R}_+^2$: Boundary Layer And Optimal Convergence Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the initial-boundary value problem for the incompressible two-dimensional micropolar fluid model with angular viscosity in the upper half-plane. This model describes the motion of viscous fluids with microstructure. The global well-posedness of strong solutions for this problem with positive angular viscosity can be established via the standard energy method, as presented in the classical monograph [\L kaszewicz, {\it Micropolar fluids: Theory and applications.} Birkh\"auser, 1999]. Corresponding results for the zero angular viscosity case were established recently in [Liu, Wang, {\it Commun. Math. Sci.} 16 (2018), no. 8, 2147-2165]. However, the link between the positive angular viscosity model (the full diffusive system) and the zero angular viscosity model (the partially diffusive system) via the vanishing diffusion limit remains unknown. In this work, we first construct Prandtl-type boundary layer profiles. We then provide a rigorous justification for the vanishing angular viscosity limit of global strong solutions, without imposing smallness assumptions on the initial data. Our analysis reveals the emergence of a strong boundary layer in the angular velocity field (micro-rotation velocity of the fluid particles) during this vanishing viscosity process. Moreover, we also obtain the optimal $L^\infty$ convergence rate as the angular viscosity tends to zero. Our approach combines anisotropic Sobolev spaces with careful energy estimates to address the nonlinear interaction between the velocity and angular velocity fields.</description>

      <title>Explicit Inversion of the Attenuated Photoacoustic Operator in General Observation Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive explicit reconstruction formulas for two common measurement geometries: a plane and a sphere. The problem is formulated as inverting the forward operator $R^a$, which maps the initial source to the measured wave data. Our first result pertains to planar observation surfaces. By extending the domain of $R^a$ to tempered distributions, we provide a complete characterization of its range and establish that the inverse operator $(R^a)^{-1}$ is uniquely defined and "almost" continuous in the distributional topology. Our second result addresses the case of a spherical observation geometry. Here, with the operator acting on $L^2$ spaces, we derive a stable reconstruction formula of the filtered backprojection type.</description>

      <title>Existence and long-time behavior of global strong solutions to a nonlinear model of tumor growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study a nonlinear model of tumor growth, described by a coupled hyperbolic-elliptic system of partial differential equations. In this model, the compressible flow of tumor cells is modeled by a transport equation for the cell density, which takes into account transport via a background flow (given by a potential solving a Brinkman-type equation), and which has a source term modeling cell growth and death. In this manuscript, we show that for sufficiently large viscosity, the tumor growth system admits nontrivial global strong solutions for positive initial data having a gradient with sufficiently small norm. This illustrates the regularizing effects of the source term representing tumor cell growth and death on the resulting transport dynamics of the equation. Furthermore, we characterize the long-time behavior of global strong solutions to the tumor growth system using a level-set analysis, in which we analyze how level sets evolve as they are transported by the flow, in terms of expansion/contraction and accretion/depletion of cells. While there has been past work on global existence of weak solutions for this tumor growth system, this manuscript opens the study of well-posedness in terms of more regular strong/classical solutions, which exist globally in time.</description>

      <title>Momentum-mass normalized dark-bright solitons to one dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously establish the existence of dark-bright solitons as traveling wave solutions to a one dimensional defocusing Gross-Pitaevskii system, a widely used model for describing mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates and nonlinear optical systems. These solitons are shown to exhibit symmetry and radial monotonicity in modulus, and to propagate at subsonic speed. Our method relies on minimizing an energy functional subject to two constraints: the mass of the bright component and a modified momentum of the dark component. The compactness of minimizing sequences is obtained via a concentration-compactness argument, which requires some novel estimates based on symmetric decreasing rearrangements.</description>

      <title>An online-adaptive hyperreduced reduced basis element method for parameterized component-based nonlinear systems using hierarchical error estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an online-adaptive hyperreduced reduced basis element method for model order reduction of parameterized, component-based nonlinear systems. The method, in the offline phase, prepares a library of hyperreduced archetype components of various fidelity levels and, in the online phase, assembles the target system using instantiated components whose fidelity is adaptively selected to satisfy a user-prescribed system-level error tolerance. To achieve this, we introduce a hierarchical error estimation framework that compares solutions at successive fidelity levels and drives a local refinement strategy based on component-wise error indicators. We also provide an efficient estimator for the system-level error to ensure that the adaptive strategy meets the desired accuracy. Component-wise hyperreduction is performed using an empirical quadrature procedure, with the training accuracy guided by the Brezzi--Rappaz--Raviart theorem. The proposed method is demonstrated on a family of nonlinear thermal fin systems comprising up to 225 components and 68 parameters. Numerical results show that the hyperreduced basis element model achieves O(100) computational reduction at 1% error level relative to the truth finite-element model. In addition, the adaptive refinement strategy provides more effective error control than uniform refinement by selectively enriching components with higher local errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the time-periodic solutions to the nonlinear wave and beam equations and uncover their intricate, fractal-like structure. In particular, we identify a new class of large-energy solutions with complex mode compositions and propose a systematic framework for their analysis. A Floquet stability study reveals that this class contains solutions that are linearly stable, suggesting that they may play a significant role in the nonlinear dynamics of the systems.</description>

      <title>Monge-Kantorovich distance for PDEs: the coupling method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.11349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We informally review a few PDEs for which the Monge-Kantorovich distance between pairs of solutions, possibly with some judicious cost function, decays: heat equation, Fokker-Planck equation, heat equation with varying coefficients, fractional heat equation with varying coefficients, homogeneous Boltzmann equation for Maxwell molecules, and some nonlinear integro-differential equations arising in neurosciences. We always use the same method, that consists in building a coupling between two solutions. This amounts to solve a well-chosen PDE posed on the Euclidian square of the physical space, i.e. doubling the variables. Finally, although the above method fails, we recall a simple idea to treat the case of the porous media equation. We also introduce another method based on the dual Monge-Kantorovich problem.</description>

      <title>Quantitative multiscale operator-type approximations for asymptotically degenerating spectral problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13151v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an abstract family of asymptotically degenerating variational problems. Those are natural generalisations of families of problems emerging upon application of a rescaled Floquet-Bloch-Gelfand transform to resolvent problems for high-contrast elliptic PDEs with highly oscillatory periodic coefficients. An asymptotic analysis of these models leads us to a hierarchy of approximation results with uniform operator-type error estimates under various assumptions, satisfied by specific examples. We provide approximations for the resolvents in terms of a certain `bivariate' operator which appears an abstract generalisation of the two-scale limit operators for highly oscillatory high-contrast PDEs. The resulting approximating self-adjoint operator, providing tight operator error estimates, is the bivariate operator sandwiched by a connecting operator which for a broad class of periodic problems specialises to a new two-scale version of the classical Whittaker-Shannon interpolation. An explicit description of the limit spectrum in the abstract setting is provided, and new tight error estimates on the distance between the original and limit spectra are established. Our generic approach allows us to readily consider a wide class of asymptotically degenerating problems including but also going beyond high-contrast highly oscillatory PDEs. The obtained results are illustrated by various examples.</description>

Abstract: We obtain asymptotically sharp identification of fractional Sobolev spaces $ W^{s}_{p,q}$, extension spaces $E^{s}_{p,q}$, and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces $\dot{F}^s_{p,q}$. In particular we obtain for $W^{s}_{p,q}$ and $E^{s}_{p,q}$ a stability theory a la Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu as $s \to 1$, answering a question raised by Brazke--Schikorra--Yung. Part of the results are new even for $p=q$.</description>

      <title>Weak stability of the sum of two solitary waves for Half-wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01919v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the subcritical half-wave equation in one dimension. Let $R_k(t,x)$, $k=1,2$, represent two-solitary wave solutions of the half-wave equation, each with different translations $x_1,x_2$. We prove that if the relative distance $x_2-x_1$ between the two solitary waves is large enough, then the sum of $R_k(t)$ is weakly stable. Our proof relies on an energy method and the local mass monotonicity property. Unlike the single-solitary wave or NLS cases, the interactions between different waves are significantly stronger here. To establish the local mass monotonicity property, as well as to analyze non-local effects on localization functions and non-local operator $D$, we utilize the Carlder\'on estimate and the integral representation formula of the half-wave operator.</description>

      <title>Solitary wave formation in the compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of perturbations in a compressible one-dimensional inviscid gas with an ambient state consisting of constant pressure and periodically-varying density. We show through asymptotic analysis that long-wavelength perturbations approximately obey a system of dispersive nonlinear wave equations. Computational experiments demonstrate that solutions of the 1D Euler equations agree well with this dispersive model, with solutions consisting mainly of solitary waves. Shock formation seems to be avoided for moderate-amplitude initial data, while shock formation occurs for larger initial data. We investigate the threshold for transition between these behaviors, validating a previously-proposed criterion based on further computational experiments. These results support the existence of large-time non-breaking solutions to the 1D compressible Euler equations, as hypothesized in previous works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the rich structure of spherically symmetric time-periodic solutions of the cubic conformal wave equation on $\mathbb{S}^{3}$. We discover that the families of solutions bifurcating from the eigenmodes of the linearised equation form patterns similar to the ones observed for the cubic wave equation. Alongside the Galerkin approaches, we study them using the new method based on the Pad\'{e} approximants. To do so, we provide a rigorous perturbative construction of solutions. Due to the conformal symmetry, the solutions presented in this work serve as examples of large time-periodic solutions of the conformally coupled scalar field on the anti-de Sitter background.</description>

      <title>Muckenhoupt-weighted $L_q(L_p)$ boundedness for time-space fractional nonlocal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the $\phi(\Delta)$-operator introduced by Kim \cite{Kim2}, where $\phi$ is a Bernstein function, we establish weighted $L_q(L_p)$-estimates for solutions to the fractional evolution equation $$ \partial_t^\alpha w(t,x) = \phi(\Delta) w(t,x) + h(t,x), \quad w(0,\cdot) = w_0, \quad t &gt; 0, \; x \in \mathbb{R}^d, $$ where $\partial_t^\alpha$ denotes the Caputo derivative of order $\alpha \in (0,1)$. Specifically, for all $p, q \in (1, \infty)$ and $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}$, we prove that $$ \left\| \partial_t^\alpha w \right\|_{L_q(0,T,\mu_2dt; H^{\phi,\gamma}_p(\mu_1))} + \left\| \phi(\Delta) w \right\|_{L_q(0,T,\mu_2dt; H^{\phi,\gamma}_p(\mu_1))} \leq C \left( \left\| h \right\|_{L_q(0,T,\mu_2dt; H^{\phi,\gamma}_p(\mu_1))} + \left\| w_0 \right\|_{N_{\alpha,p,\phi}} \right), $$ where $\mu_1(x) \in A_p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and $\mu_2(t) \in A_q(\mathbb{R})$ are Muckenhoupt weights, and $N_{\alpha,p,\phi}$ is a suitably defined Banach space capturing the initial data $w_0$. For instance, when $\mu_2 \equiv 1$ and $\alpha q &gt; 1$, we have $N_{\alpha,p,\phi} \sim B^{\phi,\gamma+2-\frac{2}{\alpha q}}_{p,q}(\mu_1)$.
  Our approach relies on tools from harmonic analysis, including the Fefferman--Stein inequality, Hardy--Littlewood maximal estimates in weighted mixed-norm spaces, and sharp function techniques for estimating solution operators. These results extend earlier work by Han and Kim \cite[\emph{J.~Differ.~Equ.}]{Han,Kim1} and complement those of Dong \cite[\emph{Calc.~Var.~Partial~Differ.~Equ.}]{Dong}.</description>

      <title>Continuous limits of large plant-pollinator random networks and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a stochastic individual-based model of interacting plant and pollinator species through a bipartite graph: each species is a node of the graph, an edge representing interactions between a pair of species. The dynamics of the system depends on the between- and within-species interactions: pollination by insects increases plant reproduction rate but has a cost which can increase plant death rate, depending on the densities of pollinators. Pollinators reproduction is increased by the resources harvested on plants. Each species is characterized by a trait corresponding to its degree of generalism. This trait determines the structure of the interaction graph and the quantities of resources exchanged between species. Our model includes in particular nested or modular networks. Deterministic approximations of the stochastic measure-valued process by systems of ordinary differential equations or integro-differential equations are established and studied, when the population is large or when the graph is dense and can be replaced with a graphon. The long-time behaviors of these limits are studied and central limit theorems are established to quantify the difference between the discrete stochastic individual-based model and the deterministic approximations. Finally, studying the continuous limits of the interaction network and the resulting PDEs, we show that nested plant-pollinator communities are expected to collapse towards a coexistence between a single pair of species of plants and pollinators.</description>

Abstract: We study the distribution of resonances for discrete Hamiltonians of the form $H_0+V$ near the thresholds of the spectrum of $H_0$. Here, the unperturbed operator $H_0$ is a multichannel Laplace type operator on $\ell^2(\mathbb Z; \mathbb C^N) \cong \ell^2(\mathbb Z)\otimes \mathbb C^N$ and $V$ is a non-selfadjoint compact perturbation. We compute the exact number of resonances and give a precise description on their location in clusters around some special points in the complex plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the dynamics of mean curvature flow as it approaches a cylindrical singularity. We proved that the rescaled mean curvature flow converging to a smooth generalized cylinder can be written as a graph over the cylinder in a ball of radius $K\sqrt{t}$, and a normal form of the asymptotics. Using the normal form, we can define the nondegeneracy of cylindrical singularities, and we show that nondegenerate cylindrical singularities are isolated in space, have a mean convex neighborhood, and are type-I.</description>

      <title>Bushfires and Balance: Proactive versus Reactive Policies in Prescribed Burning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new mathematical model to explore the dynamic relationship between prescribed burning and bushfire occurrence, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations. The model admits a unique steady-state, and its stability is shown to depend critically on the policy framework governing prescribed burning. In particular, reactive policies, where prescribed burning is increased in response to bushfire events, can lead to system instability unless augmented with appropriate feedback control. Conversely, proactive policies that implement moderate, consistent prescribed burning are more effective at stabilizing the system and mitigating the frequency of bushfires. Additionally, higher vegetation regeneration rates contribute positively to equilibrium stability. While this model does not capture the full complexity of fire management, it highlights the potential risks of emotionally driven, reactive responses and underscores the value of preventive, stability-focused strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first mathematical analysis of preventive burning strategies and their long-term impact on bushfire mitigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a numerical method for simulation of wall-bounded incompressible turbulent flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core idea of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Specifically, we utilize the filtering function in LES, interpreted as spatial averaging, along with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations, to achieve a closure numerical scheme which may be used for calculating solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This approach circumvents the challenge associated with handling the non-locally integrable 3-dimensional integral kernel in the random vortex method and facilitates the computation of numerical solutions for flow systems via Monte-Carlo method. Comprehensive numerical simulations, along with systematic comparisons against other numerical approaches, are conducted for both turbulent and laminar flows in unbounded and wall-bounded domains, considering two- and three-dimensional cases. These results collectively demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $3+1$ dimensions, we study the stability of Kasner solutions for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field-Vlasov system. This system incorporates gravity, electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions for the initial stage of our universe. Due to the presence of the Vlasov field, various new challenges arise. By observing detailed mathematical structures and designing new delicate arguments, we identify a new strong sub-critical regime and prove the nonlinear stability with Kasner exponents lying in this full regime. This extends the result of Fournodavlos-Rodnianski-Speck [8] from the Einstein-scalar field system to the physically more complex system with the Vlasov field.</description>

Abstract: In the first Heisenberg group, we study entire, locally Sobolev intrinsic graphs that are stable for the sub-Riemannian area. We show that, under appropriate integrability conditions for the derivatives, the intrinsic graph must be an intrinsic plane, i.e., a coset of a two dimensional subgroup. This result extends \cite{arXiv:1809.04586} beyond the Lipschitz class.</description>
