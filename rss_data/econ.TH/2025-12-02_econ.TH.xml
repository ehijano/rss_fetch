      <title>Optimizing Information Asset Investment Strategies in the Exploratory Phase of the Oil and Gas Industry: A Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our work investigates the economic efficiency of the prevailing "ladder-step" investment strategy in oil and gas exploration, which advocates for the incremental acquisition of geological information throughout the project lifecycle. By employing a multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework, we model an alternative strategy that prioritizes the early acquisition of high-quality information assets. We simulate the entire upstream value chain-comprising competitive bidding, exploration, and development phases-to evaluate the economic impact of this approach relative to traditional methods. Our results demonstrate that front-loading information investment significantly reduces the costs associated with redundant data acquisition and enhances the precision of reserve valuation. Specifically, we find that the alternative strategy outperforms traditional methods in highly competitive environments by mitigating the "winner's curse" through more accurate bidding. Furthermore, the economic benefits are most pronounced during the development phase, where superior data quality minimizes capital misallocation. These findings suggest that optimal investment timing is structurally dependent on market competition rather than solely on price volatility, offering a new paradigm for capital allocation in extractive industries.</description>

      <title>Nepal Engagement with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) A Philosophical and Economic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), started in 2004 by the United States Congress, focuses on development initiatives involving good governance, sustainable economic growth, and poverty reduction. Since its inception, it has invested over 13 billion US dollars in 30 countries. Nepal is a recent beneficiary, signing a compact valued at 500 million US dollars in 2017, ratified in 2022. The compact mainly invests in road infrastructure and electricity transmission, including construction of 315 kilometers of high-voltage transmission lines, three substations, and upgrading 100 kilometers of the East-West highway. By supporting commercialization of Nepals 40 gigawatt hydropower potential, the MCC aims to enhance Nepals structural economic prosperity. Beyond economics, the compact influences Nepals foreign policy by diversifying partnerships and reducing overdependence on neighbors China and India. The establishment of the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA)-Nepal fosters host-country ownership, mitigating geopolitical concerns. Building on International Relations scholar Shiping Tangs Institutional Foundations for Economic Development (IFED) framework, this paper shows how the MCC addresses Nepals infrastructure development capacity. Success stories from Ghana and other MCC countries highlight transformative progress toward prosperity, positioning Nepal to leverage both development and diplomatic opportunities. Drawing from multiple sources, this paper argues that the MCC compact provides Nepal with opportunities to overcome infrastructural barriers to growth.</description>

      <title>Monopolistic Data Dumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A profit-maximizing monopolist curates a database for users seeking to learn a parameter. There are two user types: "Nowcasters" wish to learn the parameter's current value, while "forecasters" target its long-run value. Data storage involves a constant marginal cost. The monopolist designs a menu of contracts described by fees and data-access levels. The profit-maximizing menu offers full access to historical data, while current data is fully provided to nowcasters but may be withheld from forecasters. Compared to the social optimum, the monopolist keeps too much historical data, too little current data, and may store too much data overall.</description>

      <title>Implicit Incentive Provision with Misspecified Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study misspecified Bayesian learning in principal-agent relationships, where an agent is assessed by an evaluator and rewarded by the market. The agent's outcome depends on their innate ability, costly effort -- whose effectiveness is governed by a productivity parameter -- and noise. The market infers the agent's ability from observed outcomes and rewards them accordingly. The evaluator conducts costly assessments to reduce outcome noise, which shape the market's inferences and provide implicit incentives for effort.
  Society -- including the evaluator and the market -- holds dogmatic, inaccurate beliefs about ability, which distort learning about effort productivity and effort choice. This, in turn, shapes the evaluator's choice of assessment. We describe a feedback loop linking misspecified ability, biased learning about effort, and distorted assessment. We characterize outcomes that arise in stable steady states and analyze their robust comparative statics and learning foundations. Applications to education and labor market reveal how stereotypes can reinforce across domains -- sometimes disguised as narrowing or even reversals of outcome gaps -- and how policy interventions targeting assessment can help.</description>

      <title>The Polarization Effect of Monopsonistic Lobbying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical spatial models predict platform convergence, yet empirical polarization persists. This paper proposes a non-electoral mechanism: lobbying as a monopsonistic market for legislative support. Here, extreme benefactors must pay more to attract distant politicians, creating a rent gradient that rewards platform differentiation. We find that the unique equilibrium places politicians at $(\frac{1}{4},\frac{3}{4})$ for any monotone policy-production cost. Thus, polarization can arise solely from lobbying-market structure, independent of electoral incentives.</description>

      <title>Stable Voting and the Splitting of Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms for resolving majority cycles in preference aggregation have been studied extensively in computational social choice. Several sophisticated cycle-resolving methods, including Tideman's Ranked Pairs, Schulze's Beat Path, and Heitzig's River, are refinements of the Split Cycle (SC) method that resolves majority cycles by discarding the weakest majority victories in each cycle. Recently, Holliday and Pacuit proposed a new refinement of Split Cycle, dubbed Stable Voting, and a simplification thereof, called Simple Stable Voting (SSV). They conjectured that SSV is a refinement of SC whenever no two majority victories are of the same size. In this paper, we prove the conjecture up to 6 alternatives and refute it for more than 6 alternatives. While our proof of the conjecture for up to 5 alternatives uses traditional mathematical reasoning, our 6-alternative proof and 7-alternative counterexample were obtained with the use of SAT solving. The SAT encoding underlying this proof and counterexample is applicable far beyond SC and SSV: it can be used to test properties of any voting method whose choice of winners depends only on the ordering of margins of victory by size.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for a Class of Quarrels: The Quarrelling Paradox Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If a measure of voting power assigns players greater voting power because they no longer effectively cooperate, then it displays the quarrelling paradox and violates the quarrel postulate. However, we prove that certain types of quarrel increase some quarrellers' voting power on any proposed measure. On the one hand, such quarrels are politically significant because they incentivize players to strategically join coalitions in order to sabotage them from within; on the other, a postulate based on them cannot provide a reasonable normative criterion for evaluating measures of voting power. We therefore formalize a general framework of quarrels -- comprising twelve conceptions distinguished according to symmetry, reciprocality, and strength -- and provide criteria for whether a conception provides a suitable basis for a reasonable quarrel postulate. Although the two existing conceptions, proposed by Felsenthal and Machover and by Laruelle and Valenciano, do not, our framework's symmetric, weak conception does.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08781v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A designer distributes goods while considering the perceived equity of the resulting allocation. Such concerns are modeled through an equity constraint requiring that equally deserving agents receive equal allocations. I ask what forms of screening are compatible with equity and show that while the designer cannot equitably screen with a single instrument (e.g., payments or ordeals), combining multiple instruments, which on their own favor different groups, allows her to screen while still producing an equitable allocation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on finite-player incomplete information games where players may hold mutually inconsistent beliefs without a common prior. We introduce absolute continuity of beliefs, extending the classical notion of absolutely continuous information in Milgrom and Weber (1985), and prove that Bayesian equilibria exist under broad conditions. Examples illustrate practical applications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Entropy Regularized Belief Reporting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a model of partition dependence, a widely reported experimental finding where the agent's reported beliefs depend on how the states are grouped. In the model, called Entropy Regularized Belief Reporting (ERBR), the agent is endowed with a latent benchmark prior that is unobserved by the analyst. When presented with a partition, the agent reports a prior that minimizes Kullback-Leibler divergence from the latent benchmark prior subject to entropy regularization. This captures the intuition that while the agent would like to report a prior that is close to her latent benchmark prior, she may also have a preference to remain noncommittal. I provide the structural properties of the model that allow for identification of the latent benchmark prior and apply the model to the experimental data from Benjamin et al. (2017).</description>

      <title>Endogenous Network Structures with Precision and Dimension Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a social learning model where the network structure is endogenously determined by signal precision and dimension choices. Agents not only choose the precision of their signals and what dimension of the state to learn about, but these decisions directly determine the underlying network structure on which social learning occurs. We show that under a fixed network structure, the optimal precision choice is sublinear in the agent's stationary influence in the network, and this individually optimal choice is worse than the socially optimal choice by a factor of $n^{1/3}$. Under a dynamic network structure, we specify the network by defining a kernel distance between agents, which then determines how much weight agents place on one another. Agents choose dimensions to learn about such that their choice minimizes the squared sum of influences of all agents: a network with equally distributed influence across agents is ideal.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Arrow--Debreu: A New Framework for Exchange, Time, and Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits the Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium framework through the lens of effective trade, emphasizing the distinction between theoretical and realizable market interactions. We develop the Effective Trade Model (ETM), where transactions arise from bilateral feasibility rather than aggregate supply and demand desires. Within this framework, we establish the main properties of the price-demand correspondence and prove the existence of Nash equilibria, incorporating production, money, and network topology. The analysis extends to time, uncertainty, and open economies, revealing how loanable funds and exchange rates emerge endogenously. Our results show that equilibrium is shaped by transaction constraints, subjective pricing, and decentralized negotiation, rather than by universal market-clearing conditions, and thereby call into question the foundations of welfare theory. Anticipation is modeled via the conditional mode, capturing bounded rationality and information limitations in contrast to the rational expectations hypothesis. The ETM thus offers a behaviorally and structurally grounded alternative to classical general equilibrium, bridging microfoundations, monetary dynamics, and temporal consistency within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>When and what to learn in a changing world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A decision-maker periodically acquires information about a changing state, controlling both the timing and content of updates. I characterize optimal policies using a decomposition of the dynamic problem into optimal stopping and static information acquisition. Eventually, information acquisition either stops or follows a simple cycle in which updates occur at regular intervals to restore prescribed levels of relative certainty. This enables precise analysis of long run dynamics across environments. As fixed costs of information vanish, belief changes become lumpy: it is optimal to either wait or acquire information so as to exactly confirm the current belief until rare news prompts a sudden change. The long run solution admits a closed-form characterization in terms of the "virtual flow payoff". I highlight an illustrative application to portfolio diversification.</description>
