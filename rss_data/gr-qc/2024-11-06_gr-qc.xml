      <title>Stability of Extremal Black Holes and Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture in Kiselev Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) and Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) for a quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"om Anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole embedded in Kiselev spacetime. By making small perturbations to the action and using WGC, we investigate the stability of black holes and predict the existence of lighter particles in the spectrum. Using the scattering of a charged scalar field, we study the WCCC. We verify under certain conditions on the temperature of the black hole, the second law holds for near-extremal black holes. Finally, we demonstrate that the WCCC holds for both extremal and near-extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>Time dependent black holes and gravitational wave in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with two scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores time-varying black holes within the framework of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with two scalar fields, examining the propagation of gravitational waves (GW). In reconstructed models, ghosts frequently emerge but can be eliminated by applying certain constraints. We investigate the behavior of high-frequency gravitational waves by examining the effects of varying Gauss-Bonnet coupling during their propagation. The speed of transmission is altered by the coupling in the creation of black holes. The speed of gravitational waves varies as they enter a black hole compared to when they exit.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution without High-Resolution Labels for Black Hole Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high-resolution simulations is key for advancing our understanding of one of the universe's most violent events: Black Hole mergers. However, generating Black Hole simulations is limited by prohibitive computational costs and scalability issues, reducing the simulation's fidelity and resolution achievable within reasonable time frames and resources. In this work, we introduce a novel method that circumvents these limitations by applying a super-resolution technique without directly needing high-resolution labels, leveraging the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints-fundamental equations in general relativity that govern the dynamics of spacetime. We demonstrate that our method achieves a reduction in constraint violation by one to two orders of magnitude and generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution simulations.</description>

      <title>Exact model of gravitational wave and pure radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact non-perturbative model of a gravitational wave with pure radiation is constructed. It is shown that the presence of dust matter in this model contradicts Einstein's field equations. Exact solution of Einstein equations for gravitational wave and pure radiation is obtained. The trajectories of propagation and characteristics of radiation are found. For the considered exact model of a gravitational wave, a retardet time equation for radiation is obtained. The obtained results are used to construct an exact model of gravitational wave and pure radiation for Bianchi type IV universe.</description>

      <title>Darkness cannot bind them: a no-bound theorem for $d=5$ Myers-Perry null geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radially bound null geodesics are expected to cause a build up of energy possibly triggering non-linear spacetime instabilities. It is known, due to Wilkins that such geodesics do not occur in the Kerr spacetime, the archetypal black hole solution of $d=4$ vacuum Einstein's equation. This letter aims to generalise this result to the higher dimensional counterpart of the Kerr solution, the $d=5$ Myers-Perry black hole. Using the integrability of the equations of motion it was possible to establish the following theorem: no radially bound null geodesics are possible outside the event horizon of a $d=5$ MP black hole, for any values of the spin parameters that do not yield a naked singularity.</description>

      <title>Buchdahl bound, photon ring, ISCO and radial acceleration in Einstein-\ae{}ther theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherically symmetric Einstein-{\ae}ther (E{\AE}) theory with a Maxwell-like kinetic term is revisited. We consider a general choice of the metric and the \ae{}ther field, finding that:~(i) there is a gauge freedom allowing one always to use a diagonal metric; and~(ii) the nature of the Maxwell equation forces the \ae{}ther field to be time-like in the coordinate basis. We derive the vacuum solution and confirm that the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and photon ring are enlarged relative to general relativity (GR). Buchdahl's theorem in E\AE{} theory is derived. For a uniform physical density, we find that the upper bound on compactness is always lower than in GR. Additionally, we observe that the Newtonian and E\AE{} radial acceleration relations run parallel in the low pressure limit. Our analysis of E\AE{} theory may offer novel insights into its interesting phenomenological generalization: \AE{}ther--scalar--tensor theory ({\AE}ST).</description>

      <title>Distinguishing the Demographics of Compact Binaries with Merger Entropy Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coalescence of binary black holes and neutron stars increases the entropy in the universe. The release of entropy from the inspiral stage to the merger depends primarily on the mass and spin vectors of the compact binary. In this study, we report a novel application of entropy to study the demographics of the compact binaries reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration. We compute an astrophysical distribution of the Merger Entropy Index ($\mathcal{I}_\mathrm{BBH}$) - a mass-independent measure of the efficiency of entropy transfer for black hole binaries - for all the events reported in the LVK Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalogs. We derive $\mathcal{I}_\mathrm{BBH}$ for six astrophysically motivated population models describing dynamical and isolated formation channels. We find that $\mathcal{I}_\mathrm{BBH}$ offers a new criterion to probe the formation channels of LVK events with compact objects in the upper $(\gtrsim 60~M_\odot)$ and lower ($\lesssim 5~M_\odot$) mass-gaps. For GW190521, an event with both objects in the upper mass gap, $\mathcal{I}_\mathrm{BBH}$ distribution strongly favors second-generation mergers. For GW230529, a new event with the primary object in the lower mass gap, we note that $\mathcal{I}_\mathrm{BBH}$ mildly favors it with neutron star - black holes events. Our work provides a new framework to study the underlying demographics of compact binaries in the data-rich era of gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of an Unruh-DeWitt battery performance through quadratic environmental coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate relativistic effects on the performance of a quantum battery in an open quantum framework. We consider an Unruh-DeWitt detector driven by a coherent classical pulse as a quantum battery that is interacting with a massless scalar field through a quadratic coupling. The battery follows a trajectory composed of uniform acceleration along one direction, combined with constant four-velocity components in the orthogonal plane to the acceleration. Accelerated motion degrades the performance of the quantum battery rapidly in the absence of the orthogonal velocity component. We show that the quadratic scalar field coupling enhances coherence and stability in the presence of orthogonal velocity. We observe that decoherence is mitigated significantly, resulting in remarkable improvement in the battery capacity and efficiency compared to the case of the usual linear field coupling. This opens up the possibility of nonlinear environmental coupling enabling stored energy to be retained over longer durations, leading to more efficient operation of quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Universal Relations with the Non-Extensive Entropy Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in black hole thermodynamics have introduced corrections to elucidate the relationship between entropy and extremality bound of black holes. Traditionally, this relationship has been studied in the context of black holes characterized by Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. However, this study extends the investigation to encompass non-extensive generalizations of entropy. We introduce a minor constant correction, denoted as $(\varepsilon)$, and examine the universal relations for a charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole. Our findings indicate that these universal relations do not hold for the charged AdS black hole when described by the non-extensive generalizations of entropy. Of course, with some adjustments, the universality relations are met. In contrast, the universal relations remain compatible when the black hole is described by Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and emission rate of ModMax (A)dS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By considering a new model of nonlinear electrodynamics, known as the modified Maxwell (ModMax), and taking into account the topological and the cosmological constants in Einstein's gravity, we extract black hole solutions called Topological ModMax (A)dS black holes. The next step is to study the thermodynamic properties, quasinormal modes, and emission rates of these black holes in order to examine the impact of ModMax's parameter and the cosmological constant on these systems. To achieve this, we obtain the quasinormal spectra for massless scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac perturbations. Additionally, we calculate null geodesics and determine the radius of the critical orbit. We then apply this information to derive the angular velocity and the Lyapunov exponent, which represent the real and imaginary terms of the quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit, respectively. Furthermore, we investigate the energy emission rate based on the discussion of null geodesics and the shadow radius.</description>

      <title>Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space (ACES) mission is developing high performance clocks and links for space to test Einstein's theory of general relativity. From the International Space Station, the ACES payload will distribute a clock signal with fractional frequency stability and accuracy of 1E-16 establishing a worldwide network to compare clocks in space and on the ground. ACES will provide an absolute measurement of Einstein's gravitational redshift, it will search for time variations of fundamental constants, contribute to test topological dark matter models, and perform Standard Model Extension tests. Moreover, the ground clocks connected to the ACES network will be compared over different continents and used to measure geopotential differences at the clock locations. After solving some technical problems, the ACES flight model is now approaching its completion. System tests involving the laser-cooled Cs clock PHARAO, the active H-maser SHM and the on-board frequency comparator FCDP have measured the performance of the clock signal delivered by ACES. The ACES microwave link MWL is currently under test. The single-photon avalanche detector of the optical link ELT has been tested and will now be integrated in the ACES payload. The ACES mission concept, its scientific objectives, and the recent test results are discussed here together with the major milestones that will lead us to the ACES launch.</description>

      <title>Absorption and scattering of charged scalar waves by charged Horndeski black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the absorption and scattering of a charged massive scalar field by a charged Horndeski black hole using both the classical geometric method and the partial wave method and compare the numerical and analytical results, which are found to agree with each other very well. We observe that an increase in either the BH charge $Q$ or the field charge $q$ when $qQ&gt;0$ leads to a smaller absorption cross section and a widening of the interference fringes in the scattering cross section, while the increase in the field mass enlarges the absorption cross section and the width of the interference fringes. Compared to the Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{\rm{o}}$m BH with the same charge and other parameter settings, the absorption and scattering cross sections of the charged Horndeski BH are higher, and its interference fringes are narrower. We also investigate the effect of the field charge $q$ on the absorption and scattering cross sections when superradiance is triggered. It is shown that the total absorption cross section can be negative, and the scattering intensity can be significantly enhanced by superradiance.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Primordial Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review delves into the pivotal primordial stage of the universe, a period that holds the key to understanding its current state. To fully grasp this epoch, it is essential to consider three fundamental domains of physics: gravity, particle physics, and thermodynamics. The thermal history of the universe recreates the extreme high-energy conditions that are critical for exploring the unification of the fundamental forces, making it a natural laboratory for high-energy physics. This thermal history also offers valuable insights into how the laws of thermodynamics have governed the evolution of the universe's constituents, shaping them into the forms we observe today. Focusing on the Standard Cosmological Model (SCM) and the Standard Model of Particles (SM), this paper provides an in-depth analysis of thermodynamics in the primordial universe. The structure of the study includes an introduction to the SCM and its strong ties to thermodynamic principles. It then explores equilibrium thermodynamics in the context of the expanding universe, followed by a detailed analysis of out-of-equilibrium phenomena that were pivotal in shaping key events during the early stages of the universe's evolution.</description>

      <title>Semi-Symmetric Metric Gravity: A Brief Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a review of the Semi-Symmetric Metric Gravity (SSMG) theory, representing a geometric extension of standard general relativity, based on a connection introduced by Friedmann and Schouten in 1924. The semi-symmetric connection is a connection that generalizes the Levi-Civita one, by allowing for the presence of a simple form of the torsion, described in terms of a torsion vector. The Einstein field equations are postulated to have the same form as in standard general relativity, thus relating the Einstein tensor constructed with the help of the semi-symmetric connection, with the energy-momentum tensor. The inclusion of the torsion contributions in the field equations has intriguing cosmological implications, particularly during the late-time evolution of the Universe. Presumably, these effects also dominate under high-energy conditions, and thus SSMG could potentially address unresolved issues in General Relativity and cosmology, such as the initial singularity, inflation, or the $^7$Li problem of the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis. The explicit presence of torsion in the field equations leads to the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor, which can be interpreted within the irreversible thermodynamics of open systems, as describing particle creation processes. We also review in detail the cosmological applications of the theory, and investigate the statistical tests for several models, by constraining the model parameters via comparison with several observational datasets.</description>

      <title>Linear response in a charged gas in curved spacetime and covariant heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the linear response of a near-equilibrium charged relativistic gas in the presence of electromagnetic and gravitational field in a generic stationary spacetime up to the second order of relaxation time and calculate the tensorial kinetic coefficients introduced by the presence of the strong electromagnetic and/or gravitational field. Using the covariant transfer equations thus developed, a covariant heat equation governing the relativistic heat conduction is derived, which, in Minkowski spacetime, reduces into a form which is remarkably similar to the well-known Cattaneo equation but with a different sign in front of the second-order time derivative term. We also perform a comparative analysis on the different behaviors of our heat equation and the Cattaneo equation in Minkowski spacetime. Furthermore, the effect of gravity on the heat conduction predicted by our heat equation is illustrated around Schwarzschild black hole, which makes a sharp contrast to the Minkowski case.</description>

      <title>Effects of black hole environments on extreme mass-ratio hyperbolic encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio hyperbolic encounters (EMRHEs) around the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) will be observable at the future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji. Here we consider such EMRHEs in the presence of surrounding matter distribution including baryonic accretion disk and dark matter (DM) spike, and estimate their effects on the orbital evolution and GW waveforms. We find that large possible impacts come from the gravitational potential of accretion disk, while the influence of DM spike is small. We also illustrate that environments can leave distinctive imprints on the GW waveforms, but resolving such modifications is found to be challenging for LISA-like detectors in the near future.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Evolution of unstable Charged de Sitter Black Holes with Hyperboloidal Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the hyperboloidal framework, we research the dynamical process of charged de Sitter black holes scattered by a charged scalar field. From the linear perturbation analysis, with the coupling strength within a critical interval, the charged scalar field with a superradiance frequency can induce the instability of the system. To reveal the real-time dynamics of such an instability, the nonlinear numerical simulation is implemented. The results show that the scalar field grows exponentially in the early stages and drastically extracts the charge from the black hole due to the superradiance, analogous to the charged black hole in a closed system. Differently, after saturation, the scalar field can not coexist with the central black hole stably and dissipates beyond the cosmological horizon slowly, leaving behind a bald black hole.</description>

      <title>GWtuna: Trawling through the data to find Gravitational Waves with Optuna and Jax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GWtuna is a fast gravitational-wave search prototype built on Optuna (optimisation software library) and JAX (accelerator-orientated array computation library) [1, 2]. Using Optuna, we introduce black box optimisation algorithms and evolutionary strategy algorithms to the gravitational-wave community. Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) and Covariance Matrix Adaption Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) have been used to create the first template bank free search and used to identify binary neutron star mergers. TPE can identify a binary neutron star merger in 1 second (median value) and less than 1000 matched-filter evaluations when 512 seconds of data is searched over. A stopping algorithm is used to curtail the TPE search if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold has been reached, or the SNR has not improved in 500 evaluations. If the SNR threshold is surpassed, CMA-ES is used to recover the SNR and the template parameters in 9,000 matched filter iterations taking 48 seconds (median value). GWtuna showcases alternatives to the standard template bank search and therefore has the potential to revolutionise the future of gravitational-wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>Recent Developments in Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18234v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor (DHOST) theories are the most general scalar-tensor theories whose Lagrangian depends on the metric tensor and a single scalar field and its derivatives up to second order. They propagate only one scalar degree of freedom, without being plagued by Ostrogradsky instabilities. This is achieved through certain degeneracies of the functions forming their Lagrangian. They generalise the Horndeski and beyond-Horndeski theories. Originally proposed to describe the late-time acceleration of the expansion of the universe, generalising the cosmological constant, they can also be used to build models of the early universe, to describe inflation or alternatives to standard inflation. In the late universe, they modify the standard Vainstein screening mechanism from Horndeski theories (which can have observable consequences) and are suited to build black hole models, featuring non-stealth Kerr black hole solutions. In this work their phenomenology is reviewed, looking at their basic properties, their parameterisations and classifications, focusing on solutions in the early and the late universe and at cosmological and astrophysical constraints.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations in a generalised axion-like dark energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the cosmological evolution of a generalised axion-like field that drives the late-time acceleration of the Universe. This model can exhibit tracking behaviour which alleviates the coincidence problem. The cosmological perturbations are carried within a multi-fluid approach where the scalar field is described by a non-adiabatic fluid, i.e., whose speed of sound at the rest frame is different from the adiabatic one. The cosmological perturbations are solved since the radiation-dominated epoch and imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter, radiation and the dark energy component, for modes well outside the Hubble horizon in the past. We analyse the homogeneous curvature perturbation, gravitational potential and dark energy perturbations in this model, as well as the matter power spectrum and f{\sigma}8. We discuss which parameters of the model are more favoured observationally.</description>

Abstract: The clustering dipole in the 2MASS galaxy survey converges on a scale of ~400Mpc to the local peculiar velocity inferred from the Cosmic-Microwave-Background dipole. I show that this limits the graviton mass in Yukawa theories of gravity to less than 5x10^{-32}eV. The new limit is 2.5x10^8 times tighter than the latest constraint from gravitational waves detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration.</description>

      <title>Model-independent cosmology with joint observations of gravitational waves and $\gamma$-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-messenger (MM) observations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers provide a promising approach to trace the distance-redshift relation, crucial for understanding the expansion history of the Universe and, consequently, testing the nature of Dark Energy (DE). While the gravitational wave (GW) signal offers a direct measure of the distance to the source, high-energy observatories can detect the electromagnetic counterpart and drive the optical follow-up providing the redshift of the host galaxy. In this work, we exploit up-to-date catalogs of $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) supposedly coming from BNS mergers observed by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, to construct a large set of mock MM data. We explore how combinations of current and future generations of GW observatories operating under various underlying cosmological models would be able to detect GW signals from these GRBs. We achieve the reconstruction of the GW parameters by means of a novel prior-informed Fisher matrix approach. We then use these mock data to perform an agnostic reconstruction of the DE phenomenology, thanks to a machine learning method based on forward modeling and Gaussian Processes (GP). Our study highlights the paramount importance of observatories capable of detecting GRBs and identifying their redshift. In the best-case scenario, the GP constraints are 1.5 times more precise than those produced by classical parametrizations of the DE evolution. We show that, in combination with forthcoming cosmological surveys, fewer than 40 GW-GRB detections will enable unprecedented precision on $H_\mathrm{0}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, and accurately reconstruct the DE density evolution.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Binary Neutron Stars: Does the Redshift Evolution of the Mass Function Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors are expected to detect millions of compact binary mergers across cosmological distances. The features of the mass distribution of these mergers, combined with gravitational wave distance measurements, will enable precise cosmological inferences, even without the need for electromagnetic counterparts. However, achieving accurate results requires modeling the mass spectrum, particularly considering possible redshift evolution. Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are thought to be less influenced by changes in metallicity compared to binary black holes (BBH) or neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This stability in their mass spectrum over cosmic time reduces the chances of introducing biases in cosmological parameters caused by redshift evolution. In this study, we use the population synthesis code COMPAS to generate astrophysically motivated catalogs of BNS mergers and explore whether assuming a non-evolving BNS mass distribution with redshift could introduce biases in cosmological parameter inference. Our findings demonstrate that, despite large variations in the BNS mass distribution across binary physics assumptions and initial conditions in COMPAS, the mass function remains redshift-independent, allowing a 2% unbiased constraint on the Hubble constant - sufficient to address the Hubble tension. Additionally, we show that in the fiducial COMPAS setup, the bias from a non-evolving BNS mass model is less than 0.5% for the Hubble parameter measured at redshift 0.4. These results establish BNS mergers as strong candidates for spectral siren cosmology in the era of next-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>The empirical laws of galaxy dynamics: from gas kinematics to weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxies obey a set of strict dynamical laws, which imply a close coupling between the visible matter (stars and gas) and the observed dynamics (set by dark matter in the standard cosmological context). Here we review recent results from weak gravitational lensing, which allows studying the empirical laws of galaxy dynamics out to exceedingly large radii in both late-type galaxies (LTGs) and early-type galaxies (ETGs). We focus on three laws: (1) the circular velocity curves of both LTGs and ETGs remain indefinitely flat out to several hundreds of kpc; (2) the same baryonic Tully-Fisher relation is followed by LTGs and ETGs; (3) the same radial acceleration relation (RAR) is followed by LTGs and ETGs. Combining galaxy data with Solar System data, the RAR covers about 16 orders of magnitude in the Newtonian baryonic acceleration. Remarkably, these empirical facts were predicted a priori by MOND.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a formalism for computing the scattering amplitudes in maximally symmetric de Sitter spacetime with compact spatial dimensions. We describe quantum states by using the representation theory of de Sitter symmetry group and link the Hilbert space to geodesic observers. The positive and negative ``energy'' wavefunctions are uniquely determined by the requirement that in observer's neighborhood, short wavelengths propagate as plane waves with positive and negative frequencies, respectively. By following the same steps as in Minkowski spacetime, we show that the scattering amplitudes are given by a generalized Dyson's formula. Compared to the flat case, they describe the scattering of wavepackets with the frequency spectrum determined by geometry. The frequency spread shrinks as the masses and/or momenta become larger than the curvature scale. Asymptotically, de Sitter amplitudes agree with the amplitudes evaluated in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Local Well-posedenss of the Bartnik Static Extension Problem near Schwarzschild spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the local well-posedness of the Bartnik static metric extension problem for arbitrary Bartnik data that perturb that of any sphere in a Schwarzschild $\{t=0\}$ slice. Our result in particular includes spheres with arbitrary small mean curvature. We introduce a new framework to this extension problem by formulating the governing equations in a geodesic gauge, which reduce to a coupled system of elliptic and transport equations. Since standard function spaces for elliptic PDEs are unsuitable for transport equations, we use certain spaces of Bochner-measurable functions traditionally used to study evolution equations. In the process, we establish existence and uniqueness results for elliptic boundary value problems in such spaces in which the elliptic equations are treated as evolutionary equations, and solvability is demonstrated using rigorous energy estimates. The precise nature of the expected difficulty of solving the Bartnik extension problem when the mean curvature is very small is identified and suitably treated in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Generally covariant evolution equations from a cognitive treatment of time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The treatment of time in relativity does not conform to that in quantum theory. To resolve the discrepancy, a formalization of time is introduced in an accompanying paper, starting from the assumption that the treatment of time in physics must agree with our cognition. The formalization has two components: sequential time $n$ and relational time $t$. The evolution of physical states is described in terms of $n$. The role of $t$ is to quantify distances between events in space-time. There is a space-time associated with each $n$, in which $t$ represents the knowledge at time $n$ about temporal distances between present and past events. This approach leads to quantum evolution equations expressed in terms of a continuous evolution parameter $\sigma$, which interpolates between discrete sequential times $n$. Rather than describing the evolution of the world at large, these evolution equations provide probabilites of a set of predefined outcomes in well-defined experimental contexts. When the context is designed to measure spatio-temporal position $(x,t)$, time $t$ becomes an observable with Heisenberg uncertainty $\Delta t$ on the same footing as $x$. The corresponding evolution equation attains the same symmetric form as that suggested by Stueckelberg in 1941. When the context is such that the metric of space-time is measured, the corresponding evolution equation may be seen as an expression of quantum gravity. In short, the aim of this paper is to propose a coherent conceptual basis for the treatment of time in evolution equations, in so doing clarifying their meaning and domain of validity.</description>

      <title>Constraining ultralight scalar dark matter couplings with the European Pulsar Timing Array second data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) offer an independent method for searching for ultralight dark matter (ULDM), whose wavelike nature induces periodic oscillations in the arrival times of radio pulses. In addition to this gravitational effect, the direct coupling between ULDM and ordinary matter results in pulsar spin fluctuations and reference clock shifts, leading to observable effects in PTAs. The second data release from the European PTA (EPTA) indicates that ULDM cannot account for all dark matter in the mass range $m_{\phi} \in [10^{-24.0}, 10^{-23.3}] \text{ eV}$ based solely on gravitational effects. In this work, we derive constraints on the coupling coefficients by considering both gravitational and coupling effects. Our results demonstrate that EPTA provides stronger constraints on these couplings than previous PTA experiments, and it establishes similar or even tighter constraints compared to other precise experiments, such as atomic clock experiments.</description>

      <title>Influence of field mass and acceleration on entanglement generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the entanglement dynamics of two detectors undergoing uniform acceleration and circular motion within a massive scalar field, while also investigating the influence of the anti-Unruh effect on entanglement harvesting. Contrary to the conventional understanding of the weak anti-Unruh effect, where entanglement typically increases, we observe that the maximum entanglement between detectors does not exhibit a strict monotonic dependence on detector acceleration. Particularly at low accelerations, fluctuations in the entanglement maxima show a strong correlation with fluctuations in detector transition rates.We also find that the maximum entanglement of detectors tends to increase with smaller field mass. Novelly, our findings indicate the absence of a strong anti-Unruh effect in (3+1)-dimensional massive scalar fields. Instead, thermal effects arising from acceleration contribute to a decrease in the detector entanglement maximum.</description>

      <title>Multivariate hypergeometric solutions of cosmological (dS) correlators by $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give the analytic expression for homogeneous part of solutions of arbitrary tree-level cosmological correlators, including massive propagators and time-derivative interactions cases. The solutions are given in the form of multivariate hypergeometric functions. It is achieved by two step. Firstly, we indicate the factorization of the homogeneous part of solutions, i.e., the homogeneous part of solutions of multiple vertices is the product of the solutions of the single vertex. Secondly, we give the solution to the $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations of arbitrary single vertex integral family. We also show how to determine the boundary conditions for the differential equations. There are two techniques we developed for the computation. Firstly, we analytically solve $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations via power series expansion. Secondly, we handle degenerate multivariate poles in power series expansion of differential equations by blow-up. They could also be useful in the evaluation of multi-loop Feynman integrals in flat spacetime.</description>

      <title>Combining strongly lensed and unlensed fast radio bursts: to be a more precise late-universe probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Macquart relation and time-delay cosmography are now two promising ways to fast radio burst (FRB) cosmology. In this work, we propose a joint method that combines strongly lensed and unlensed FRBs for improving cosmological parameter estimation by using simulated FRB data from the future sensitive coherent all-sky monitor survey, which is expected to detect a large number of FRBs including galaxy-galaxy strongly lensed events. We find that using a detectable sample of 100,000 localized FRBs including $40$ lensed events can simultaneously constrain the Hubble constant and the equation of state of dark energy, with high precision of $\varepsilon(H_0)=0.4\%$ and $\varepsilon(w)=4.5\%$ in the simplest dynamical dark energy model. The joint analysis of unlensed and lensed FRBs significantly improves the constraint on $H_0$, which could be more effective than combining either the unlensed FRBs with future gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens or the lensed FRBs with CMB. Furthermore, combining the full FRB sample with the CMB+BAO+SNe data yields $\sigma(H_0)=0.29~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, $\sigma(w_0)=0.046$, and $\sigma(w_a)=0.15$ in the two-parameter dynamical dark energy model, which outperform the results from the CMB+BAO+SNe+GW data. This reinforces the cosmological implications of a multi-wavelength observational strategy in optical and radio bands. We conclude that the future FRB observations will shed light on the nature of dark energy and also the Hubble tension if enough events with long-duration lensing are incorporated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear stability of global Anti-de Sitter space in the presence of multitrace deformations utilizing an Einstein-Klein-Gordon system with a top-down scalar potential. Our numerical simulations show that marginal and irrelevant deformations retain the nonlinear instability originally found by Bizo\'n and Rostworowski, while relevant deformations disrupt it. We show that the nonlinear impact of multitrace deformations is in one-to-one correspondence with how they affect the resonant character of the global Anti-de Sitter normal mode eigenfrequency spectrum.</description>

Abstract: This is an unconventional review article on spectral problems in black hole perturbation theory. Our purpose is to explain how to apply various known techniques in quantum mechanics to such spectral problems. The article includes analytical/numerical treatments, semiclassical perturbation theory, the (uniform) WKB method and useful mathematical tools: Borel summations, Pad\'e approximants, etc. The article is not comprehensive, but rather looks into a few examples from various points of view. The techniques in this article are widely applicable to many other examples.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Instability of Magnetic Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole superradiance has proven being very valuable in several realms of gravitational physics, and holds a promising discovery potential. In this paper, we consider the superradiant instability of magnetically-charged, rotating black holes and find a number of important differences with respect to neutral ones. Considering massive charged bosonic fields, we find that the instability timescale is much shorter, and this is true even if the black hole contains an order-one number of magnetic monopoles, or merely a single one, and possesses either low, moderate or large values of angular momentum. In particular, the instability is drastically faster than the radiative decay time of charged pions, potentially making it physically relevant. Furthermore, our analysis identifies the most unstable modes as a class of monopole spheroidal harmonics, that we dub north and south monopole modes, whose morphology is markedly different from the ones in standard superradiance since they extend along the rotational axis. For completeness, we also study the quasinormal mode spectrum and amplification factors of charged massless fields, finding no evidence of instabilities in that case.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the blackbody radiation problem in the presence of quantum gravity effects encoded in modified dispersion relations. The spectral radiance and the generalized Stefan-Boltzmann law are studied in this context. Furthermore, the regime of low temperatures is also contemplated, where features related to the blackbody thermal laws and the thermodynamic quantities such as energy, pressure, entropy, and specific heat are obtained. Possible implications in compact objects such as neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Renormalizable Cosmology Based on Gauss-Bonnet Theory with Torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on renormalizable cosmology based on the Gauss-Bonnet theory with torsion. Within the framework of renormalizable quantum field theory, we study the matter field containing the Gauss-Bonnet correction term. By modifying the gauge model, which includes a charged scalar field and two families of fermions, and introducing torsion and Gauss-Bonnet corrections, we analyze the field equations in the super-symmetric hybrid inflation model, investigate the properties of torsion in a flat universe, the characteristics of the energy-momentum tensor, and the sensitivity of the theoretical model to correction parameters. This study shows that the Gauss-Bonnet correction term can directly affect the Hubble constant through the Einstein equations, providing a new observational perspective. This paper proposes a cosmological model that can be adjusted according to different Gauss-Bonnet correction models, providing a theoretical reference for future observational verification of various Gauss-Bonnet models.</description>

      <title>ExaGRyPE: Numerical General Relativity Solvers Based upon the Hyperbolic PDEs Solver Engine ExaHyPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ExaGRyPE describes a suite of solvers for numerical relativity, based upon ExaHyPE 2, the second generation of our Exascale Hyperbolic PDE Engine. The presented generation of ExaGRyPE solves the Einstein equations in the CCZ4 formulation under a 3+1 foliation and focuses on black hole spacetimes. It employs a block-structured Cartesian grid carrying a higher-order order Finite Difference scheme with adaptive mesh refinement, it facilitates massive parallelism combining message passing, domain decomposition and task parallelism, and it supports the injection of particles into the grid as data probes or tracers. We introduce the ExaGRyPE-specific building blocks within ExaHyPE 2, and discuss its software architecture and compute-n-feel:
  For this, we formalize the creation of any specific simulation with ExaGRyPE as a sequence of lowering operations, where abstract logical tasks are successively broken into finer tasks until we obtain an abstraction level that can be mapped onto a C++ executable. The overall program logic is fully specified via a domain-specific Python interface, we map this logic onto a more detailed set of numerical tasks, subsequently lower this representation onto technical tasks that the underlying ExaHyPE engine uses to parallelize the application, before eventually the technical tasks are mapped onto task graphs including the actual PDE term evaluations, initial conditions, boundary conditions, and so forth. We end up with a rigorous separation of concerns which shields ExaGRyPE users from technical details and hence simplifies the development of novel physical models. We present the simulations and data for the gauge wave, static single black holes and rotating binary black hole systems, demonstrating that the code base is mature and usable. However, we also uncover domain-specific numerical challenges that need further study by the community in future work.</description>

      <title>Gravitational field and lensing of a circular chiral vorton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the metric of a circular chiral vorton in the weak field limit. The object is self-supporting by means of its chiral current. A conical singularity with deficit angle, identical to that of straight string with the same linear mass density, is present at the vorton's core. We find that the metric is akin to the electromagnetic $4$-potential of a circular current wire loop, illustrating the concept of gravito-electromagnetism. Surprisingly we find that the solution asymptotically mimics a Kerr-like naked singularity with mass $M_v=4\pi R\mu$ and spin parameter $a=R/2$. Finally, we also simulate the gravitational lensing images by solving the corresponding null geodesic equations. This reveals interesting properties of the images, such as the simultaneous creation of a minimally distorted source image and its Einstein ring, as well as the formation of double images on the back side of the ring.</description>

      <title>Enhancing search pipelines for short gravitational wave transients with Gaussian mixture modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an enhanced method for the application of Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM) to the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) algorithm in the search for short-duration gravitational wave (GW) transients. The supervised Machine Learning method of GMM allows for the multi-dimensional distributions of noise and signal to be modelled over a set of representative attributes, which aids in the classification of GW signals against noise transients (glitches) in the data. We demonstrate that updating the approach to model construction eliminates bias previously seen in the GMM analysis, increasing the robustness and sensitivity of the analysis over a wider range of burst source populations. The enhanced methodology is applied to the generic burst all-sky short search in the LIGO-Virgo full third observing run (O3), marking the first application of GMM to the 3 detector Livingston-Hanford-Virgo network. For both 2- and 3- detector networks, we observe comparable sensitivities to an array of generic signal morphologies, with significant sensitivity improvements to waveforms in the low Quality factor parameter space at false alarm rates of 1 per 100 years. This proves that GMM can effectively mitigate blip glitches, which are one of the most problematic sources of noise for un-modelled GW searches. The cWB-GMM search recovers similar numbers of compact binary coalescence (CBC) events as other cWB post-production methods, and concludes on no new gravitational wave detection after known CBC events are removed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, theoretical studies on the bumblebee gravity model, a nonminimally-coupled vector-tensor theory that violates the Lorentz symmetry, have flourished, with a simultaneous increase in the utilization of observations to impose constraints. The static spherical solutions of neutron stars (NSs) in the bumblebee theory are calculated comprehensively in this work. These solutions with different coupling constants reveal a rich theoretical landscape for NSs, including vectorized NSs and NSs with finite radii but divergent masses. With these solutions, preliminary constraints on the asymptotic vector field values are obtained through restrictions on the stellar radius.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? Electromagnetic and Gravitational Mode Mixing in NSBH Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of electromagnetic fields leaving imprints on gravitational wave (GW) signals from Neutron Star-Black hole (NSBH) mergers, specifically in the context of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Using black hole perturbation theory (BHPT) in the context of a minimally coupled Einstein-Maxwell system, we demonstrate that electromagnetic quasi normal modes(QNMs) can excite gravitational QNMs with frequencies that are linear or quadratic in the electromagnetic QNMs, at first level of mixing. Moreover, We then study the electromagnetism-gravity coupling by approximating the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli potentials with Dirac delta functions. In this example, we examine gravitational perturbations induced by the electromagnetic field of an ideal dipole radially free fall towards the blackhole, building on calculations from a companion paper [1]. Our results show that both linear and quadratic electromagnetic QNMs appear in gravitational perturbations. In addition, linear gravitational QNMs are also excited due to the electromagnetic source, with their amplitudes depending on the details of the electromagnetic and gravitational potentials, analogous to gravitational mode mixing analysis. Furthermore, at late stages, gravitational perturbations might exhibit polynomial tails induced by electromagnetic perturbations. This article sets the stage for future numerical investigations aimed at identifying such modes in various scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The orbit-averaged fluxes of energy and angular momentum generated by a compact binary system of nonspinning particles are obtained in a popular class of massless scalar-tensor theories with first-and-a-half post-Newtonian (1.5PN) accuracy, i.e., 2.5PN accuracy beyond the leading -1PN dipolar radiation. The secular evolution of the orbital elements (frequency and eccentricity) are then also obtained with 1.5PN accuracy. Three technical advances were necessary to obtain these results: (i) the decomposition of the scalar dipole moment as a Fourier series at 1PN order, along with the other moments at Newtonian order, (ii) the derivation of the formula for the passage to the center-of-mass frame at 2.5PN, including a novel hereditary term arising from the contribution of the radiation, and (iii) the complete treatment of the memory-like term appearing in the angular momentum flux. Moreover, as a byproduct of this work, I revisit in the Appendix the treatment in general relativity of the memory integral appearing at 2.5PN order in the angular momentum flux [arXiv:0908.3854], and find that the spurious divergence in the initial eccentricity $e_1$ found there is cured by a careful split between AC and DC terms.</description>

Abstract: In this work, the Unruh temperature formula is generalized to the case of hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration, implying the existence of a maximal value for the Unruh temperature. We discuss this result for an electrodynamic model with maximal proper acceleration, showing that the maximal Unruh temperature must be of order $10^5\, K$ for current high acceleration gradient laser-plasma acceleration experiments.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? II. A Short Guide of First- and Second-Order Electromagnetic Perturbations in the Schwarzschild Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study second-order electromagnetic perturbations in the Schwarzschild background and derive the effective source terms for Regge-Wheeler equation which are quadratic in first-order gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations. In addition to the induced mixed quadratic modes, we find that linear gravitational modes are also excited, with amplitudes dependent on the electromagnetic potential. A toy model involving a Dirac delta function potential demonstrates mixing of linear gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations with frequencies \( \omega^{(1)} \) and \( \Omega^{(1)} \), resulting in the second-order QNM mixing in the electromagnetic field at \( \Omega^{(2)} =\Omega^{(1)} + \omega^{(1)} \). This complements prior work in [1] on the second-order gravitational perturbation mixing and highlights potential applications in multi-messenger astrophysics for systems observed by LIGO and upcoming LISA. We also study first-order perturbations due to a point charge and show it could be reduced to a one-dimensional path integral. Within the toy model, we investigate the first-order electromagnetic perturbation due to a radially free-falling single charge \( q \) and radial dipole moment \( p = q \eta \), employing semi-analytical and numerical methods. For the dipole case, we show that the QNM perturbation is excited with a nearly constant amplitude. Future work will focus on incorporating mixing in more realistic potentials and exploring numerical approach in the context of rotating spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of regular black holes with sub-Planckian curvature and Minkowskian core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the perturbation of the scalar field as well as the electromagnetic field over a sort of regular black holes which are characterized by the sub-Planckian curvature and the Minkowskian core. Specifically, we compute the quasinormal modes(QNMs) by employing the pseudo-spectral method. The outburst of overtones is manifestly observed in the QNMs of these regular black holes, which can be attributed to the deviation of the Schwarzschild black hole by quantum effects of gravity. Furthermore, the QNMs under the perturbation of electromagnetic field exhibit smaller real and imaginary parts than those under scalar field perturbation. By comparing the QNMs of the regular black hole featured by Minkowskian core with those of Bardeen black hole featured by de Sitter core, we find they may be an effective tool to distinguish these BHs.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and gravitational wave radiation in short hair black hole spacetimes for an extreme mass ratio system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a short hair black hole(BH) which circumvents the "no-short-hair" theorem, it manifests intense hair behavior in the vicinity of the event horizon, accompanied by remarkable quantum effects. These effects may carry important information about the internal structure and dynamical evolution of BHs, thereby providing a new perspective on the problem of black hole information loss. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the influence of the hair parameter $Q_m$ and the structural parameter $k$ of the short hair BH in an extreme mass ratio(EMR) system on the periodic orbits of particles and gravitational wave radiation. The results show that as $Q_m$ increases, the radius and angular momentum of the bound orbit decrease, and the $E-L$ space shifts to the left. An increase in $k$ weakens this trend. When $k$ takes a larger value, the short hair BH and the Schwarzschild BH tend to be degenerate. Compared with the Schwarzschild BH, the bound orbit energy and angular momentum of the short hair black hole are reduced. Under the conditions of higher $Q_m$ and lower $k$, the gravitational wave period is suppressed and the signal amplitude is significantly increased. These results provide new observational means for distinguishing short hair BH from classical BH and offer new insights for verifying the no-hair theorem and understanding the physical behavior near the event horizon.</description>

      <title>Dynamical String Tension Theories with target space scale invariance SSB and restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.08875v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The string and brane tensions do not have to be put in by hand, they can be dynamically generated, as in the case when we formulate string and brane theories in the modified measure formalism. Then string and brane tensions appears, but as an additional dynamical degree of freedom . It can be seen however that these string or brane tensions are not universal, but rather each string and each brane generates its own tension, which can have a different value for each string or brane. There should be also a considerable effect for the effective gravity theories derived from these theories. We consider new background fields that can couple to these new types of extended objects, one of them, the tension scalar is capable of changing locally along the world sheet the value of the tension of the extended object. When many strings probing the same region of space are considered this tension scalar is constrained by the requirement of quantum conformal invariance. For the case of two strings probing the same region of space with different dynamically generated tensions, there are two different metrics, associated to the different strings, that have to satisfy vacuum Einsteins equations and the consistency of these two Einsteins equation determines the tension scalar. We also find that the construction of brane world scenarios in the context of these dynamical tension string theories, we discuss avoidance of the Hagedorn temperature possible relaxation of string swampland constraints in dynamical tension string theories, and that the dynamical string theories can bridge between the low and high energy quantum gravity effects, The dynamical modified string theory has target space scale invariance and this target space scale invariance can be restored at the points where the string tension approaches infinity. These models suggest the swampland constraints could be avoided.</description>

      <title>PyMerger: Detecting Binary Black Hole merger from Einstein Telescope Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10409v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PyMerger, a Python tool for detecting binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the Einstein Telescope (ET), based on a Deep Residual Neural Network model (ResNet). ResNet was trained on data combined from all three proposed sub-detectors of ET (TSDCD) to detect BBH mergers. Five different lower frequency cutoffs ($F_{\text{low}}$): 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 15 Hz, 20 Hz, and 30 Hz, with match-filter Signal-to-Noise Ratio ($MSNR$) ranges: 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, and &gt;8, were employed in the data simulation. Compared to previous work that utilized data from single sub-detector data (SSDD), the detection accuracy from TSDCD has shown substantial improvements, increasing from $60\%$, $60.5\%$, $84.5\%$, $94.5\%$ to $78.5\%$, $84\%$, $99.5\%$, $100\%$, and $100\%$ for sources with $MSNR$ of 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, and &gt;8, respectively. The ResNet model was evaluated on the first Einstein Telescope mock Data Challenge (ET-MDC1) dataset, where the model demonstrated strong performance in detecting BBH mergers, identifying 5,566 out of 6,578 BBH events, with optimal SNR starting from 1.2, and a minimum and maximum $D_{L}$ of 0.5 Gpc and 148.95 Gpc, respectively. Despite being trained only on BBH mergers without overlapping sources, the model achieved high BBH detection rates. Notably, even though the model was not trained on BNS and BHNS mergers, it successfully detected 11,477 BNS and 323 BHNS mergers in ET-MDC1, with optimal SNR starting from 0.2 and 1, respectively, indicating its potential for broader applicability.</description>

      <title>Integral identities and universal relations for solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05789v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any nonlinear field theory giving rise to static solutions with finite energy like, e.g., topological solitons, allows us to derive an infinite number of integral identities which any such solution has to obey. These integral identities can always be understood as being generated by field transformations and their related Noether currents. We also explain why all integral identities generated by coordinate transformations become trivial for Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) solitons, i.e., topological solitons which saturate a topological energy bound. Finally, we consider applications of these identities to a broad class of nonlinear scalar theories, including the Skyrme model. More concretely, we find nontrivial integral identities that can be seen as model-independent relations between certain physical properties of the solitons in such theories, and we comment on the possible connection between these new relations and those already found in the context of astrophysical compact objects. We also demonstrate the usefulness of said identities to estimate the precision of the numerical calculation of soliton observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical framework for symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy with a non-abelian symmetry group. To obtain a reduced density matrix that is block-diagonal in the non-abelian charges, we define subsystems operationally in terms of subalgebras of invariant observables. We derive exact formulas for the average and the variance of the typical entanglement entropy for the ensemble of random pure states with fixed non-abelian charges. We focus on compact, semisimple Lie groups. We show that, compared to the abelian case, new phenomena arise from the interplay of locality and non-abelian symmetry, such as the asymmetry of the entanglement entropy under subsystem exchange, which we show in detail by computing the Page curve of a many-body system with SU(2) symmetry.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-induced force noise in LISA Pathfinder free-falling test masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LISA Pathfinder was a mission designed to test key technologies required for gravitational wave detection in space. Magnetically driven forces play a key role in the instrument sensitivity in the low-frequency regime, which corresponds to the measurement band of interest for future space-borne gravitational wave observatories. Magnetic-induced forces couple to the test mass motion, introducing a contribution to the relative acceleration noise between the free falling test masses. In this Letter we present the first complete estimate of this term of the instrument performance model. Our results set the magnetic-induced acceleration noise during the February 2017 noise run of $\rm 0.25_{-0.08}^{+0.15}\,fm\,s^{-2}/\sqrt{Hz}$ at 1 mHz and $\rm 1.01_{-0.24}^{+0.73}\, fm\,s^{-2}/\sqrt{Hz}$ at 0.1 mHz. We also discuss how the non-stationarities of the interplanetary magnetic field can affect these values during extreme space weather conditions.</description>

Abstract: A precise characterization of the magnetic properties of LISA Pathfinder free falling test-masses is of special interest for future gravitational wave observatory in space. Magnetic forces have an important impact on the instrument sensitivity in the low frequency regime below the millihertz. In this paper we report on the magnetic injection experiments performed throughout LISA Pathfinder operations. We show how these experiments allowed a high precision estimate of the instrument magnetic parameters. The remanent magnetic moment was found to have a modulus of $(0.245\pm0.081)\,\rm{nAm}^2$, the x-component of the background magnetic field within the test masses position was measured to be $(414 \pm 74)$ nT and its gradient had a value of $(-7.4\pm 2.1)\,\mu$T/m. Finally, we also measured the test mass magnetic susceptibility to be $(-3.35\pm0.15)\times$10$^{-5}$ in the low frequency regime. All results are in agreement with on-ground estimates.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic behavior of Lorentz-violating photon fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss the Lorentz-violating modifications of the propagation properties of the massless photon in the null formalism. Starting with the Maxwell Lagrangian in the minimal standard model extension, we derive the Maxwell equations in the null formalism based on the fact that at leading order of optical approximation, the light cone structure for the CPT-violating (CPTV) $(k_{AF})^\mu$ term is unaltered. Assuming the order expansion as $\phi_0=\sum_{n=1}\phi^{n-1}_0/r^{n+2}$ and reserving only linear order corrections of the $(k_{AF})^\mu$ term, we find that the asymptotic behaviors of the three complex scalars deviate from $\phi_a^0\sim\mathcal{O}(r^{a-3})$, the behaviors of the LI counterparts, provided one of the spherically symmetric $k^2\neq0$. Our results also gives unnatural constraints: $k^2+4k^1=0$ and $\mathrm{Re}[\phi_1^0]=0$. We attribute this unnaturalness to the flaw of our perturbative treatment, in comparison with the formal dipole radiation solutions in Ref. [13]. In other words, it is highly plausible that the non-perturbative nature of the CPTV modified polarization structure may forbid a consistent perturbative treatment of Maxwell equations in the Newman-Penrose form. By the way, the exact formal results reveal that CPTV not only modifies the phase factor (dispersion relations) as a kinematic effect, it also modifies the amplitude and asymptotic behaviors of the radiation and Coulomb modes as dynamical effects. This dramatic changes of the peeling theorem may provide novel signals of the deviation from exact Lorentz symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate how field redefinition influences the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic fluid dynamics. We show that the hydrodynamic modes do not get affected under local field redefinition, whereas the non-hydrodynamic modes do. These non-hydrodynamic modes can be removed through a suitable all-order field redefinition. This process leads to a new frame containing only hydrodynamic modes, which we refer to as the hydro frame. Additionally, we demonstrate that the resulting stress-energy tensor may constitute an infinite series in momentum space, with the radius of convergence associated with the removed non-hydrodynamic mode, highlighting its role in the hydrodynamic expansion's validity.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description.</description>
