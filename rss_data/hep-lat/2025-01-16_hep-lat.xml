      <title>A lattice QCD calculation of the Compton amplitude subtraction function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Compton amplitude subtraction function is an essential component in work concerning both the proton radius puzzle and the proton-neutron mass difference. However, owing to the difficulty in determining the subtraction function, it remains a key source of uncertainty in these two contexts. Here, we use the Feynman-Hellmann method to determine this subtraction function directly from lattice QCD. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to control dominant discretisation artefacts for this calculation, eliminating a major source of systematic error. This calculation is performed for a range of hard momentum scales, and three different sets of gauge configurations for pion masses about 400 MeV. Our results show good agreement with continuum OPE expectations. As such, this work paves the way for model-independent and precise determinations of the subtraction function over a wide range of kinematics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid spin-dependent and hybrid-quarkonium mixing potentials at order $(1 /m_Q)^1$ from SU(3) lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first lattice gauge theory results for hybrid spin-dependent and hybrid-quarkonium mixing potentials appearing at order $(1 /m_Q)^1$ in the Born-Oppenheimer Effective Field theory for hybrid mesons with gluon spin $\kappa^{PC} = 1^{+-}$. Specifically, we compute the four unknown potentials $V^{sa}_{11}(r)$, $V^{sb}_{10}(r)$, which are relevant for the hyperfine splitting in heavy hybrid meson spectra, as well as $V^\text{mix}_{\Sigma_u^-}(r)$ and $V^\text{mix}_{\Pi_u}(r)$, which describe the mixing of heavy hybrid mesons with ordinary quarkonium. We relate these potentials to matrix elements, which we extract from generalized Wilson loops with a chromomagnetic field insertion along one of the temporal lines and suitable hybrid creation operators replacing the spatial lines. We use gradient flow, which facilitates the renormalization of the matrix elements and has the additional benefit of significantly reducing statistical noise. We present results for gauge group SU(3) and lattice spacing $a=0.060$ fm. Our results demonstrate that a future combined continuum and zero-flow time extrapolation is possible within our setup, which will be necessary to reliably predict the hyperfine splitting of heavy hybrid mesons as well as their mixing with ordinary quarkonium through coupled channel Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

      <title>QCD condensates and $\alpha_s$ from $\tau$-decay: Summary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this talk, I summarize the recent determinations in Ref.[1] of the QCD condensates and $\alpha_s$ within the SVZ expansion using the ratio of Laplace sum rule (LSR) ${\cal R}_{10}^A(\tau)$ and $\tau$-like moments ${\cal R}_{n,A},\, {\cal R}_{n,V-A}$within stability criteria in the axial-vector (A) and V-A channels of the $\tau$- semi-hadronic decays. The factorization of the four-quark condensate is violated by a factor 6 like in the case of the $e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons data. There is no exponential growth of the size of higher dimension condensates which does not favour (by duality) a significant effect of the so-called Duality Violation (DV). The extracted value of $\alpha_s$ is in good agreement with the one from $e^+e^-$ and indicates that the determination at the observed $\tau$-mass is not the optimal one and leads to an overestimate of its actual value.</description>

      <title>Fermions and Zeta Function on the Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel fermionic model on the graphs. The Dirac operator of the model consists of deformed incidence matrices on the graph and the partition function is given by the inverse of the graph zeta function. We find that the coefficients of the inverse of the graph zeta function, which is a polynomial of finite degree in the coupling constant, count the number of fermionic cycles on the graph. We also construct the model on grid graphs by using the concept of the covering graph and the Artin-Ihara $L$-function. In connection with this, we show that the fermion doubling is absent, and the overlap fermions can be constructed on a general graph.Furthermore, we relate our model to statistical models by introducing the winding number around cycles, where the distribution of the poles of the graph zeta function (the zeros of the partition function) plays a crucial role.Finally, we formulate gauge theory including fermions on the graph from the viewpoint of the covering graph derived from the gauge group in a unified way.</description>

      <title>Studies of nucleon isovector structure with the PACS10 superfine lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results for the nucleon axial-vector, induced pseudoscalar and pion-nucleon couplings obtained from 2+1 flavor lattice QCD at the physical point with a large spatial extent of about 10 fm. Our calculations are performed with the PACS10 gauge configurations generated by the PACS Collaboration with the six stout-smeared $O(a)$ improved Wilson-clover quark action and Iwasaki gauge action at $\beta$ = 1.82, 2.00 and 2.20 corresponding to lattice spacings of 0.09 fm (coarse), 0.06 fm (fine) and 0.04 fm (superfine), respectively. We first evaluate the value of the nucleon axial-vector coupling. In addition, the induced pseudoscalar and pion-nucleon couplings from the induced pseudoscalar form factor are also investigated. Combining the results obtained from the all of our coarse, fine and superfine lattices, we finally discuss the systematic uncertainties in our calculation based on the comparison with both of the experimental values and lattice QCD results provided by the other collaborations.</description>

      <title>Landscape of QCD Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00318v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We found new solutions of the sourceless Yang-Mills equation describing the superposition of chromomagnetic vortices of oppositely oriented magnetic fluxes. These gauge field configurations have constant energy densities and are separated by potential barriers forming a complicated landscape. It is suggested that the solutions describe the condensate of chromomagnetic vortices and represent a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor. In the presence of an Abelian field and in a particular limit the solutions reduce to the flat connections of zero energy density and are forming a complicated potential landscape of the QCD vacuum. A possible tunnelling transition between these superfluxon flat configurations and the flat configurations with non-vanishing Chern-Pontryagin index will wash out the CP violating $\theta$ angle to zero, dynamically restoring CP symmetry.</description>

      <title>Properties of the wormhole-dominant phase in two-dimensional quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $N \times N$ Hermitian one-matrix model modified by the double-trace interaction. It is known that the coupling for the double-trace interaction can control the weight for the microscopic wormholes if interpreting the matrix model as the lattice model of random surface; tuning the coupling to its critical value, the effect of wormholes become substantial to change the critical behavior of the pure $2$D quantum gravity, which is characterized by a certain positive value of the string susceptibility. In the large-$N$ limit, we calculate the continuum limit of the disk amplitude in which the wormhole effects are important. The resulting continuum disk amplitude is the same as that of the pure $2$D quantum gravity. We also introduce the renormalized coupling for the double-trace interaction, and show that the newly introduced renormalized coupling can alter the renormalized bulk cosmological constant effectively.</description>
