      <title>Adapted almost invariant sets and splittings of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove relative versions of many earlier results about almost invariant sets and splittings of groups. In particular, we prove a relative version of the algebraic torus theorem, and we prove the existence and uniqueness of relative versions of algebraic regular neighbourhoods and of JSJ decompositions.</description>

      <title>On unique decomposition of knotted handlebodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers the uniqueness question of factorization of a knotted handlebody in the $3$-sphere along decomposing $2$-spheres. We obtain a uniqueness result for factorization along decomposing $2$-spheres meeting the handlebody at three parallel disks. The result is used to examine handlebody-knot symmetry; particularly, the chirality of $6_{10}$ in the handlebody-knot table, previously unknown, is determined. In addition, an infinite family of hyperbolic handlebody-knots with homeomorphic exteriors is constructed.</description>

      <title>Basis for KBSM of fibered torus with multiplicity two exceptional fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of bases for the Kauffman bracket skein module (KBSM) of the product of an annulus and a circle. Using these bases, we find a new basis for the KBSM of $(\beta,2)$-fibered torus as a first step toward developing techniques for computing KBSM of a family of small Seifert fibered $3$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Nearly geodesic surfaces are filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A surface $S$ in a manifold $M$ is filling if $M-S$ consists of contractible components. We prove for any closed hyperbolic $3$-manifold $M$, there exists an $\epsilon_0&gt;0$ such that every homotopy class of $(1+\epsilon)$-quasi-Fuchsian surfaces with $0&lt;\epsilon \leq \epsilon_0$ is filling. As a corollary, the set of embedded surfaces in $M$ satisfies a dichotomy: it consists of at most finitely many totally geodesic surfaces and surfaces with a quasi-Fuchsian constant lower bound $1+\epsilon_0$. Each of these nearly geodesic surfaces separates any pair of distinct points at the boundary of infinity of the universal cover. Crucial tools include the rigidity results of Mozes-Shah, Ratner, and Shah. This work is inspired by a question of Wu and Xue whether random geodesics on random hyperbolic surfaces are filling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct algorithms and topological invariants that allow us to distinguish the topological type of a surface, as well as functions and vector fields for their topological equivalence. In the first part (arXiv:2501.15657), we discused basic concepts of diferential topology. In the second part we discus the main discrete topological structures used in the topological theory of dynamic systems: simplicial complexes, regular SW-complexes, Euler characteristic and homology groops, Morse-Smale complexes and handle decomposition of manifolds, Poincare rotation index of vector field, discrete Morse function and vector fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum duality maps, skein algebras and their ensemble compatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19074v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the quantum duality map $\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{A}}$ of Allegretti--Kim [AK17] for punctured closed surfaces to general marked surfaces. When the marked surface has no interior marked points, we investigate its compatibility with the quantum duality map $\mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{X}}$ on the dual side based on the quantum bracelets basis [Thu14, MQ23]. Our construction factors through reduced stated skein algebras, based on the quantum trace maps [L\^e18] together with an appropriate way of \emph{skein lifting} of integral $\mathcal{A}$-laminations. We also give skein theoretic proofs for some expected properties of Laurent expressions, and positivity of structure constants for marked disks and a marked annulus.</description>

      <title>Morse homology and equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop methods for calculating equivariant homology from equivariant Morse functions on a closed manifold with the action of a finite group. We show how to alter $G$-equivariant Morse functions to a stable one, where the descending manifold from a critical point $p$ has the same stabilizer group as $p$, giving a better-behaved cell structure on $M$. For an equivariant, stable Morse function, we show that a generic equivariant metric satisfies the Morse--Smale condition.
  In the process, we give a proof that a generic equivariant function is Morse, and that equivariant, stable Morse functions form a dense subset in the $C^0$-topology within the space of all equivariant functions.
  Finally, we give an expository account of equivariant homology and cohomology theories, as well as their interaction with Morse theory. We show that any equivariant Morse function gives a filtration of $M$ that induces a Morse spectral sequence, computing the equivariant homology of $M$ from information about how the stabilizer group of a critical point acts on its tangent space. In the case of a stable Morse function, we show that this can be further reduced to a Thom-Smale-Witten complex.</description>

      <title>Detecting Free Group Automorphisms via Virtual Homology Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F_n= F\langle x_1,...,x_n\rangle$ denote the free group of rank $n\ge 2$ and let $\mathrm{End}(F_n)$ be the endomorphism monoid of $F_n$. We show that automorphisms of $F_n$ are detected via the $\mathrm{End}(F_n)$-action on the first integral homology of finite characteristic covers of the wedge of $n\ge 2$ circles $R_n$. This gives a homological characterization of homotopy equivalences of $R_n$ that we utilize to show that $\mathrm{End}(F_n)$ is asymptotically linear. We extend these results by showing that the $\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$-action on the homology of iterated covers of a punctured surface $\Sigma_g^b$ of the same homotopy type as $R_n$ detects homeomorphisms of $\Sigma_g^b$ in homotopy classes of homotopy equivalences of $R_n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an end-periodic homeomorphism $f: S \to S$ we give a lower bound on the Handel--Miller stretch factor of $f$ in terms of the capacity of $f$, which is a measure of topological complexity for an end-periodic homeomorphism. We also show that this bound is asymptotically sharp.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral surfaces in flat (2+1)-spacetimes and balanced cellulations on hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first prove that given a hyperbolic metric $h$ on a closed surface $S$, any flat metric on $S$ with negative singular curvatures isometrically embeds as a convex polyhedral Cauchy surface in a unique future-complete flat globally hyperbolic maximal (2+1)-spacetime whose linear part of the holonomy is given by $h$. The Gauss map allows to translate this statement to a purely 2-dimensional problem of finding a balanced geodesic cellulation on the hyperbolic surface, from which the flat metric can be easily recovered.
  We show next that given two such flat metrics on the surface, there exists a unique pair of future- and past-complete flat globally hyperbolic maximal (2+1)-spacetimes with the same holonomy, in which the flat metrics embed respectively as convex polyhedral Cauchy surfaces. The proof follows from convexity properties of the total length of the associated balanced geodesic cellulations over Teichm\"uller space.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</description>
