      <title>Observability of dynamical tides in merging eccentric neutron star binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While dynamical tides only become relevant during the last couple of orbits for circular inspirals, orbital eccentricity can increase their impact during earlier phases of the inspiral by exciting tidal oscillations at each close encounter. We investigate the effect of dynamical tides on the orbital evolution of eccentric neutron star binaries using post-Newtonian numerical simulations and constructing an analytic stochastic model. Our study reveals a strong dependence of dynamical tides on the pericenter distance, with the energy transferred to dynamical tides over that dissipated in gravitational waves (GWs) exceeding $\sim1\%$ at separations $r_\mathrm{p}\lesssim50$ km for large eccentricities. We demonstrate that the effect of dynamical tides on orbital evolution can manifest as a phase shift in the GW signal. We show that the signal-to-noise ratio of the GW phase shift can reach the detectability threshold of 8 with a single aLIGO detector at design densitivity for eccentric neutron star binaries at a distance of $40$ Mpc. This requires a pericenter distance of $r_\mathrm{p0}\lesssim68$ km ($r_\mathrm{p0}\lesssim76$ km) at binary formation with eccentricity close to 1 for a reasonable tidal deformability and f-mode frequency of 500 and $1.73$ kHz (700 and $1.61$ kHz), respectively. The observation of the phase shift will enable measuring the f-mode frequency of neutron stars independently from their tidal deformability, providing significant insights into neutron star seismology and the properties of the equation of state. We also explore the potential of distinguishing between equal-radius and twin-star binaries, which could provide an opportunity to reveal strong first-order phase transitions in the nuclear equation of state.</description>

      <title>Compactness peaks: An astrophysical interpretation of the mass distribution of merging binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing number of detections of binary black hole mergers, we are beginning to probe structure in the distribution of masses. A recent study by Schneider et al. proposes that isolated binary evolution of stripped stars naturally gives rise to the peaks at chirp masses $\sim 8 M_\odot$, $14 M_\odot$ in the chirp mass distribution and explains the dearth of black holes between $\approx 10-12 M_\odot$ in chirp mass. The gap in chirp mass results from an apparent gap in the component mass distribution between $m_1, m_2 \approx 10-15 M_\odot$ and the specific pairing of these black holes. This component mass gap results from the variation in core compactness of the progenitor, where a drop in compactness of Carbon-Oxygen core mass will no longer form black holes from core collapse. We develop a population model motivated by this scenario to probe the structure of the component mass distribution of binary black holes consisting of two populations: 1) two peak components to represent black holes formed in the compactness peaks, and 2) a powerlaw component to account for any polluting events, these are binaries that may have formed from different channels (e.g. dynamical). We perform hierarchical Bayesian inference to analyse the events from the third gravitational-wave transient catalogue (GWTC-3) with this model. We find that there is a preference for the lower mass peak to drop off sharply at $\sim 11 M_\odot$ and the upper mass peak to turn on at $\sim 13 M_\odot$, in line with predictions from Schneider et al. However, there is no clear evidence for a gap. We also find mild support for the two populations to have different spin distributions. In addition to these population results, we highlight observed events of interest that differ from the expected population distribution of compact objects formed from stripped stars.</description>

      <title>Observational Evidence for Magnetic Field Amplification in SN 1006</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first observational evidence for magnetic field amplification in the north-east/south-west (NE/SW) shells of supernova remnant SN 1006, one of the most promising sites of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration. In previous studies, the strength of magnetic fields in these shells was estimated to be $B_{\rm SED}$ $\simeq$ 25$\mu$G from the spectral energy distribution, where the synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accounted for radio to X-rays, along with the inverse Compton emission extending from the GeV to TeV energy bands. However, the analysis of broadband radio data, ranging from 1.37~GHz to 100~GHz, indicated that the radio spectrum steepened from $\alpha_1 = 0.52 \pm 0.02$ to $\alpha_2 = 1.34 \pm 0.21$ by $\Delta \alpha$ = 0.85 $\pm$ 0.21. This is naturally interpreted as a cooling break under strong magnetic field of $B_{\rm brk}$ $\ge$ 2~mG. Moreover, the high-resolution MeerKAT image indicated that the width of the radio NE/SW shells was broader than that of the X-ray shell by a factor of only 3$-$20, as measured by Chandra. Such narrow radio shells can be naturally explained if the magnetic field responsible for the radio emissions is $B_{\rm R}$ $\ge$ 2 mG. Assuming that the magnetic field is locally enhanced by a factor of approximately $a$ = 100 along the NE/SW shells, we argue that the filling factor, which is the volume ratio of such a magnetically enhanced region to that of the entire shell, must be as low as approximately $k$ = 2.5$\times$10$^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Identifying pulsar candidates in interferometric radio images using scintillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsars have been primarily detected by their narrow pulses or periodicity in time domain data. Interferometric surveys for pulsars are challenging due to the trade-off between beam sensitivity and beam size and the corresponding tradeoff between survey sensitivity (depth), sky coverage, and computational efforts. The detection sensitivity of time-domain searches for pulsars is affected by dispersion smearing, scattering, and rapid orbital motion of pulsars in binaries. We have developed a new technique to select pulsar candidates in interferometric radio images by identifying scintillating sources and measuring their scintillation bandwidth and timescale. Identifying likely candidates allows sensitive, focused time-domain searches, saving computational effort. Pulsar scintillation is independent of its timing properties and hence offers a different selection of pulsars compared to time-domain searches. Candidates identified from this method could allow us to find hard-to-detect pulsars, such as sub-millisecond pulsars and pulsars in very compact, highly-accelerated binary orbits. We use uGMRT observations in the fields of PSR\,B1508+55, PSR\,J0437$-$4715, and PSR\,B0031$-$07 as test cases for our technique. We demonstrate that the technique correctly differentiates between the pulsar and other non-scintillating point sources and show that the extracted dynamic spectrum of the pulsar is equivalent to that extracted from the uGMRT phased array beam. We show the results from our analysis of known pulsar fields and discuss challenges in dealing with interference and instrumental effects.</description>

      <title>High resolution X-ray spectra of the compact binary supersoft X-ray source CAL 87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present an analysis of the archival X-ray data of the eclipsing supersoft X-ray binary CAL 87 observed with the {\it Chandra} Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) camera and Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG) in 2001 August and with {\it XMM-Newton} in 2003 April. The high resolution X-ray spectra are almost unchanged in the two different dates. The average unabsorbed X-ray luminosity during the exposure was 4.64$-$5.46$\times10^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ in 2001 and 4.54$-$4.82 $\times10^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ in 2003, with prominent and red-shifted emission lines, mostly of nitrogen, oxygen, iron and argon, contributing to at least 30\% of the X-ray flux. The continuum X-ray flux is at least an order of magnitude too small for a hot, hydrogen burning WD. However, the continuum flux is consistent with Thomson-scattering reflecting about 5\% of the light of a hydrogen burning WD with effective temperature of 800,000 K, and a mass of $\sim$ 1.2 M$_\odot$. It has been noted before that a large Thomson-scattering corona explains the X-ray eclipse of CAL 87, in which the eclipsed region is found to be of size the order of a solar radius. The emission lines originate in an even more extended region, beyond the eclipsed central X-ray source; the emission spectrum is very complex, with unusual line ratios.</description>

      <title>Puzzle of [Ar II] 7 mcm line broad component of SN 1987A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the origin of the broad component of the [Ar II] 7 mcm line emission related to the ejecta excitation by the neutron star of SN 1987A. We argue that the line broad wings are emitted at the tmperature of $\sim300$ K. The flux excess in the red wing of [Ar II] line is reproduced by the line photons scattering off the optically thin uniform dust component with the grain size of 1 - 2 mcm and the total mass of $\mbox{(several)}\times10^{-3}\,M{\odot}$. The dusty opaque clumps containing almost all the dust of SN~1987A have a low occultation optical depth and line photon scattering on dusty clumps do not contribute noticeably in the red wing. The additional heating might be related to ionization losses of relativistic protons.</description>

      <title>A higher-level large-eddy filtering strategy for general relativistic fluid simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear simulations of neutron star mergers are complicated by the need to represent turbulent dynamics. As we cannot (yet) perform simulations that resolve accurately both the gravitational-wave scale and the smallest scales at which magneto/hydrodynamic turbulence plays a role, we need to rely on approximations. Addressing this problem in the context of large-eddy models, we outline a coherent Lagrangian filtering framework that allows us to explore the many issues that arise, linking conceptual problems to practical implementations and the interpretation of the results. We develop understanding crucial for quantifying unavoidable uncertainties in current and future numerical relativity simulations and consider the implications for neutron-star parameter estimation and constraints on the equation of state of matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>On the ultra-long spin period of 4U 1954+31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4U 1954+31 is a high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) that contains a neutron star and an M supergiant companion. The neutron star has a spin period of ~5.4 hr. The traditional wind-accreting model requires an ultra-strong magnetic field for the neutron star to explain its extremely long spin period, which seems problematic for the neutron star with an age of a few tens of million years. In this work, we take into account the unsteady feature of wind accretion, which results in alternation of the direction of the wind matter's angular momentum. Accordingly, the torque exerted by the accreted wind matter varies between positive and negative from time to time, and largely cancels out over long time. In such a scenario, neutron stars can naturally attain long spin periods without the requirement of a very strong magnetic field. This may also provide a reasonable explanation for the spin period distribution of long-period neutron stars in HMXBs.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Low Mass Black Hole-Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of the GW230529 event indicates that black hole-neutron star binaries can contain low-mass black holes. Since lower mass systems are more favourable for tidal disruption, such events are promising candidates for multi-messenger observations. In this study, we employ five finite-temperature, composition-dependent matter equations of state and present results from ten 3D general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations for the mass ratios $q = 2.6$ and $5$. Two of these simulations target the chirp mass and effective spin parameter of the GW230529 event, while the remaining eight contain slightly higher-mass black holes, including both spinning ($a_{BH} = 0.7$) and non-spinning ($a_{BH} = 0$) models. We discuss the impact of the equation of state, spin, and mass ratio on black hole-neutron star mergers by examining both gravitational-wave and ejected matter properties. For the low-mass ratio model we do not see fast-moving ejecta for the softest equation of state model, but the stiffer model produces on the order of $10^{-6}M_\odot$ of fast-moving ejecta, expected to contribute to an electromagnetic counterpart. Notably, the high-mass ratio model produces nearly the same amount of total dynamical ejecta, but yields $52$ times more fast-moving ejecta than the low-mass ratio system. In addition, we observe that the black-hole spin tends to decrease the amount of fast-moving ejecta while increasing significantly the total ejected mass. Finally, we note that the disc mass tends to increase as the neutron star compactness decreases.</description>

      <title>Phase-resolved Spectroscopy of Low-frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillations from the Newly Discovered Black Hole X-ray Binary Swift J1727.8-1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) are commonly observed in X-ray light curves of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs); however, their origin remains a topic of debate. In order to thoroughly investigate variations in spectral properties on the QPO timescale, we utilized the Hilbert-Huang transform technique to conduct phase-resolved spectroscopy across a broad energy band for LFQPOs in the newly discovered BHXRB Swift J1727.8-1613. This is achieved through quasi-simultaneous observations from Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER), Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR), and Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT). Our analysis reveals that both the non-thermal and disk-blackbody components exhibit variations on the QPO timescale, with the former dominating the QPO variability. For the spectral parameters, we observe modulation of the disk temperature, spectral indices, and reflection fraction with the QPO phase with high statistical significance (&gt;5\sigma). Notably, the variation in the disk temperature is found to precede the variations in the non-thermal and disk fluxes by ~0.4-0.5 QPO cycles. We suggest that these findings offer further evidence that the type-C QPO variability is a result of geometric effects of the accretion flow.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Discovery Potential for Decaying Dark Matter and Faint X-ray Sources with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical emission lines arising from particle decays can offer unique insights into the nature of dark matter (DM). Using dedicated simulations with background and foreground modeling, we comprehensively demonstrate that the recently launched XRISM space telescope with powerful X-ray spectroscopy capabilities is particularly well-suited to probe decaying DM, such as sterile neutrinos and axion-like particles, in the mass range of few to tens of keV. We analyze and map XRISM's DM discovery potential parameter space by considering Milky Way Galactic DM halo, including establishing an optimal line-of-sight search, as well as dwarf galaxies where we identify Segue 1 as a remarkably promising target. We demonstrate that with only 100 ks exposure XRISM/Resolve instrument is capable of probing the underexplored DM parameter window around few keV and testing DM couplings with sensitivity that exceeds by two orders existing Segue 1 limits. Further, we demonstrate that XRISM/Xtend instrument sensitivity enables discovery of the nature of faint astrophysical X-ray sources, especially in Segue 1, which could shed light on star-formation history. We discuss implications for decaying DM searches with improved detector energy resolution in future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has now been just over four decades since the first discovery of a millisecond spin period pulsar (MSP), B1937+21, by Don Backer and collaborators in late 1982. This finding of an entirely new class of astronomical object revolutionized pulsar astronomy and provided inspiration for novel scientific investigation for decades to come, continuing to the current day and beyond. Here we review the events leading to the discovery, based on archival material, personal correspondence, and first-hand accounts of several of the participants. We also briefly review the enormous impact that MSPs have had on physics and astronomy by highlighting major MSP-related science of the past 40 years.</description>

      <title>Big Galaxies and Big Black Holes: The Massive Ends of the Local Stellar and Black Hole Mass Functions and the Implications for Nanohertz Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14595v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the $z=0$ galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) by combining the GSMF at stellar masses $M_* \lesssim 10^{11.3} M_\odot$ from the census study of Leja et al. (2020) and the GSMF of massive galaxies at $M_* \gtrsim 10^{11.5} M_\odot$ from the volume-limited MASSIVE galaxy survey. To obtain a robust estimate of $M_*$ for local massive galaxies, we use MASSIVE galaxies with $M_*$ measured from detailed dynamical modeling or stellar population synthesis modeling (incorporating a bottom-heavy initial mass function) with high-quality spatially-resolved spectroscopy. These two independent sets of $M_*$ agree to within ${\sim}7$%. Our new $z=0$ GSMF has a higher amplitude at $M_* \gtrsim 10^{11.5} M_\odot$ than previous studies, alleviating prior concerns of a lack of mass growth in massive galaxies between $z\sim 1$ and 0. We derive a local black hole mass function (BHMF) from this GSMF and the scaling relation of SMBH and galaxy masses. The inferred abundance of local SMBHs above $\sim 10^{10}M_\odot$ is consistent with the number of currently known systems. The predicted amplitude of the nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background is also consistent with the levels reported by Pulsar Timing Array teams. Our $z = 0$ GSMF therefore leads to concordant results in the high-mass regime of the local galaxy and SMBH populations and the gravitational wave amplitude from merging SMBHs. An exception is our BHMF yields a $z=0$ SMBH mass density that is notably higher than the value estimated from quasars at higher redshifts.</description>

      <title>The mass of the white dwarf in YY Dra (=DO Dra): Dynamical measurement and comparative study with X-ray estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dynamical study of the intermediate polar cataclysmic variable YY Dra based on time-series observations in the $K$ band, where the donor star is known to be the major flux contributor. We covered the $3.97$-h orbital cycle with 44 spectra taken between $2020$ and $2022$ and two epochs of photometry observed in 2021 March and May. One of the light curves was simultaneously obtained with spectroscopy to better account for the effects of irradiation of the donor star and the presence of accretion light. From the spectroscopy, we derived the radial velocity curve of the donor star metallic absorption lines, constrained its spectral type to M0.5$-$M3.5 with no measurable changes in the effective temperature between the irradiated and non-irradiated hemispheres of the star, and measured its projected rotational velocity $v_\mathrm{rot} \sin i = 103 \pm 2 \, \mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Through simultaneous modelling of the radial velocity and light curves, we derived values for the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the donor star, $K_2 = 188^{+1}_{-2} \, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, the donor to white dwarf mass ratio, $q=M_2/M_1 = 0.62 \pm 0.02$, and the orbital inclination, $i={42^{\circ}}^{+2^{\circ}}_{-1^{\circ}}$. These binary parameters yield dynamical masses of $M_{1} = 0.99^{+0.10}_{-0.09} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and $M_2 = 0.62^{+0.07}_{-0.06} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ ($68$ per cent confidence level). As found for the intermediate polars GK Per and XY Ari, the white dwarf dynamical mass in YY Dra significantly differs from several estimates obtained by modelling the X-ray spectral continuum.</description>

      <title>Periodicity significance testing with null-signal templates: reassessment of PTF's SMBH binary candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodograms are widely employed for identifying periodicity in time series data, yet they often struggle to accurately quantify the statistical significance of detected periodic signals when the data complexity precludes reliable simulations. We develop a data-driven approach to address this challenge by introducing a null-signal template (NST). The NST is created by carefully randomizing the period of each cycle in the periodogram template, rendering it non-periodic. It has the same frequentist properties as a periodic signal template regardless of the noise probability distribution, and we show with simulations that the distribution of false positives is the same as with the original periodic template, regardless of the underlying data. Thus, performing a periodicity search with the NST acts as an effective simulation of the null (no-signal) hypothesis, without having to simulate the noise properties of the data. We apply the NST method to the supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) search in the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), where Charisi et al. had previously proposed 33 high signal to (white) noise candidates utilizing simulations to quantify their significance. Our approach reveals that these simulations do not capture the complexity of the real data. There are no statistically significant periodic signal detections above the non-periodic background. To improve the search sensitivity we introduce a Gaussian quadrature based algorithm for the Bayes Factor with correlated noise as a test statistic, in contrast to the standard signal to white noise. We show with simulations that this improves sensitivity to true signals by more than an order of magnitude. However, using the Bayes Factor approach also results in no statistically significant detections in the PTF data.</description>

      <title>Suppressed Cosmic Ray Energy Densities in Molecular Clouds From Streaming Instability-Regulated Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) are the primary driver of ionization in star forming molecular clouds (MCs). Despite their potential impacts on gas dynamics and chemistry, no simulations of star cluster formation following the creation of individual stars have included explicit cosmic ray transport (CRT) to date. We conduct the first numerical simulations following the collapse of a $2000 M_{\odot}$ MC and the subsequent star formation including CRT using the STARFORGE framework implemented in the GIZMO code. We show that when CR-transport is streaming-dominated, the CR energy in the cloud is strongly attenuated due to energy losses from the streaming instability. Consequently, in a Milky Way like environment the median CR ionization rate (CRIR) in the cloud is low ($ \zeta \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-19} \rm s^{-1}$) during the main star forming epoch of the calculation and the impact of CRs on the star formation in the cloud is limited. However, in high-CR environments, the CR distribution in the cloud is elevated ($\zeta \lesssim 6 \times 10^{-18}$), and the relatively higher CR pressure outside the cloud causes slightly earlier cloud collapse and increases the star formation efficiency (SFE) by $50 \%$ to $\sim 13 \%$. The initial mass function (IMF) is similar in all cases except with possible variations in a high-CR environment. Further studies are needed to explain the range of ionization rates observed in MCs and explore star formation in extreme CR environments.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Rotating Anisotropic Dark Energy Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By employing modified Chaplygin fluid prescription for the dark energy, we construct slowly rotating isotropic and anisotropic dark energy stars. The slow rotation is incorporated via general relativistic Hartle-Thorne formalism; whereas the anisotropy is introduced through Bowers-Liang prescription. We consider both the monopole and quadrupole deformations and present a complete analysis of rotating dark energy stars. By numerically solving the rotating stellar structure equations in presence of anisotropy, we analyse and quantify various properties of dark energy stars such as mass ($M$), radius, mass deformation, angular momentum ($J$), moment of inertia, and quadrupole moment ($Q$), for three different equation of state parameters. We find that anisotropic slow rotation results in significant deformation of stellar mass and thereby affects other global properties studied. For the values of angular frequencies considered, the effect of anisotropy on the stellar structure is found to be more prominent than that due to rotation. The dimensionless quadrupole moment $QM/J^2$ measuring deviation from a Kerr metric black hole was obtained for anisotropic dark energy stars. We observe that dark energy stars with higher anisotropic strength tend to approach the Kerr solution more closely. We report that our results have considerable agreement with various astrophysical observational measurements.</description>

      <title>Toward a test of Gaussianity of a gravitational wave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degree of Gaussianity of a field offers insights into its cosmological nature, and its statistical properties serve as indicators of its Gaussianity. In this work, we examine the signatures of Gaussianity in a gravitational wave background (GWB) by analyzing the cumulants of the one- and two-point functions of the relevant observable, using pulsar timing array (PTA) simulations as a proof-of-principle. This appeals to the ongoing debate about the source of the spatially-correlated common-spectrum process observed in PTAs, which is likely associated with a nanohertz stochastic GWB. We investigate the distribution of the sample statistics of the one-point function in the presence of a Gaussian GWB. Our results indicate that, within PTAs, one-point statistics are impractical for constraining the Gaussianity of the nanohertz GWB due to dominant pulsar noises. However, our analysis of two-point statistics shows promise, suggesting that it may be possible to constrain the Gaussianity of the nanohertz GWB using PTA data. We also emphasize that the Gaussian signatures identified in the one- and two-point functions in this work are expected to be applicable to any gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>Cross-Observatory Coordination with tilepy: A Novel Tool for Observations of Multi-Messenger Transient Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-domain astrophysics has leaped forward with the direct discovery of gravitational waves and the emergence of new generation instruments for multi-messenger studies. The capacity of the multi-messenger multi-wavelength community to effectively pursue follow-up observations is hindered by the suboptimal localization of numerous transient events and the escalating volume of alerts. Thus, we have developed an effective tool to overcome the observational and technical hurdles inherent in the emerging field of multi-messenger astrophysics. We present tilepy, a Python package for the automatic scheduling of follow-up observations of poorly localized transient events. It is ideally suited to tackle the challenge of complex follow-up in mid and small-FoV telescope campaigns, with or without human intervention. We demonstrate the capabilities of tilepy in the realm of multi-observatory, multi-wavelength campaigns, to cover the localization uncertainty region of various events ultimately aiming at pinpointing the source of the multi-messenger emission. The tilepy code is publicly available on GitHub and is sufficiently flexible to be employed either automatically or in a customized manner, tailored to collaboration and individual requirements. tilepy is also accessible via a public API and through the Astro-COLIBRI platform.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection and Approximate Similarity Searches of Transients in Real-time Data Streams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present LAISS (Lightcurve Anomaly Identification and Similarity Search), an automated pipeline to detect anomalous astrophysical transients in real-time data streams. We deploy our anomaly detection model on the nightly ZTF Alert Stream via the ANTARES broker, identifying a manageable $\sim$1-5 candidates per night for expert vetting and coordinating follow-up observations. Our method leverages statistical light-curve and contextual host-galaxy features within a random forest classifier, tagging transients of rare classes (spectroscopic anomalies), of uncommon host-galaxy environments (contextual anomalies), and of peculiar or interaction-powered phenomena (behavioral anomalies). Moreover, we demonstrate the power of a low-latency ($\sim$ms) approximate similarity search method to find transient analogs with similar light-curve evolution and host-galaxy environments. We use analogs for data-driven discovery, characterization, (re-)classification, and imputation in retrospective and real-time searches. To date we have identified $\sim$50 previously known and previously missed rare transients from real-time and retrospective searches, including but not limited to: SLSNe, TDEs, SNe IIn, SNe IIb, SNe Ia-CSM, SNe Ia-91bg-like, SNe Ib, SNe Ic, SNe Ic-BL, and M31 novae. Lastly, we report the discovery of 325 total transients, all observed between 2018-2021 and absent from public catalogs ($\sim$1% of all ZTF Astronomical Transient reports to the Transient Name Server through 2021). These methods enable a systematic approach to finding the "needle in the haystack" in large-volume data streams. Because of its integration with the ANTARES broker, LAISS is built to detect exciting transients in Rubin data.</description>

      <title>Swift J1727.8-1613 has the Largest Resolved Continuous Jet Ever Seen in an X-ray Binary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-wavelength polarimetry and radio observations of Swift J1727.8-1613 at the beginning of its recent 2023 outburst suggested the presence of a bright compact jet aligned in the north-south direction, which could not be confirmed without high angular resolution images. Using the Very Long Baseline Array and the Long Baseline Array, we imaged Swift J1727.8-1613, during the hard/hard-intermediate state, revealing a bright core and a large, two-sided, asymmetrical, resolved jet. The jet extends in the north-south direction, at a position angle of $-0.60\pm0.07\deg$ East of North. At 8.4 GHz, the entire resolved jet structure is $\sim110 (d/2.7\,\text{kpc})/\sin i$ AU long, with the southern approaching jet extending $\sim80 (d/2.7\,\text{kpc})/\sin i$ AU from the core, where $d$ is the distance to the source and $i$ is the inclination of the jet axis to the line of sight. These images reveal the most resolved continuous X-ray binary jet, and possibly the most physically extended continuous X-ray binary jet ever observed. Based on the brightness ratio of the approaching and receding jets, we put a lower limit on the intrinsic jet speed of $\beta\geq0.27$ and an upper limit on the jet inclination of $i\leq74\deg$. In our first observation we also detected a rapidly fading discrete jet knot $66.89\pm0.04$ mas south of the core, with a proper motion of $0.66\pm0.05$ mas hour$^{-1}$, which we interpret as the result of a downstream internal shock or a jet-ISM interaction, as opposed to a transient relativistic jet launched at the beginning of the outburst.</description>

      <title>First detection of X-ray pulsations and spectrum of the high Galactic latitude pulsar PSR J0837-2454 and direct Urca cooling implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PSR J0837-2454 is a young 629 ms radio pulsar whose uncertain distance has important implications. A large distance would place the pulsar far out of the Galactic plane and suggest it is the result of a runaway star, while a short distance would mean the pulsar is extraordinarily cold. Here we present further radio observations and the first deep X-ray observation of PSR J0837-2454. Data from the Parkes Murriyang telescope show flux variations over short and long timescales and also yield an updated timing model, while the position and proper motion (and, less strongly, parallax) of the pulsar are constrained by a number of low-significance detections with the Very Long Baseline Array. XMM-Newton data enable detection of X-ray pulsations for the first time from this pulsar and yield a spectrum that is thermal and blackbody-like, with a cool blackbody temperature ~70 eV or atmosphere temperature ~50 eV, as well as a small hotspot. The spectrum also indicates the pulsar is at a small distance of &lt;~1 kpc, which is compatible with the marginal VLBA parallax constraint that favours a distance of &gt;~330 pc. The low implied luminosity (~7.6x10^31 erg s^-1 at 0.9 kpc) suggests PSR J0837-2454 has a mass high enough that fast neutrino emission from direct Urca reactions operates in this young star and points to a nuclear equation of state that allows for direct Urca reactions at the highest densities present in neutron star cores.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for gamma-ray emission from OJ287 in the energy range from 0.1-300 GeV during 2015-2023, in coincidence with an extensive observing campaign to monitor the optical flux variability and polarization, as discussed in arXiv:2311.02372. We present results for eight segments in the aforementioned period, with each segment corresponding to an observing season. We report non-zero gamma-ray flux (with $&gt;10\sigma$ significance) for all the eight segments. The photon and energy flux observed during this period is $\sim 5.2 \times 10^{-8} \rm{ph~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ and $2.75 \times 10^{-5} \rm{MeV~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$, respectively, while the SED can be fitted with a power law with a slope of $2.12 \pm 0.02$. The observed luminosity is between $10^{45}-10^{46}$ ergs/sec. Similar to previous works we find a hard cutoff in the gamma-ray spectrum at around 20 GeV. We do not observe any correlations between the peaks in the gamma ray light curves and corresponding optical light cuves in $I$ and $R$ bands, as well as the X-ray light curves from SWIFT between 0.3-10 keV.</description>

      <title>Estimate for the neutrino magnetic moment from pulsar kick velocities induced at the birth of strange quark matter neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We estimate the magnetic moment of electron neutrinos by computing the neutrino chirality flip rate that can occur in the core of a strange quark matter neutron star at birth. We show that this process allows neutrinos to anisotropically escape, thus inducing the star kick velocity. Although the flip from left- to right-handed neutrinos is assumed to happen in equilibrium, the no-go theorem does not apply because right-handed neutrinos do not interact with matter and the reverse process does not happen, producing the loss of detailed balance. For simplicity, we model the star core as consisting of strange quark matter. We find that even when the energy released in right-handed neutrinos is a small fraction of the total energy released in left-handed neutrinos, the process describes kick velocities for natal conditions, which are consistent with the observed ones and span the correct range of radii, temperatures and chemical potentials for typical magnetic field intensities. The neutrino magnetic moment is estimated to be $\mu_\nu \sim 3.6 \times 10^{-18}\mu_B$, where $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton. This value is more stringent than the bound found for massive neutrinos in a minimal extension of the \mbox{standard model.}</description>
