      <title>SFQA: A Comprehensive Perceptual Quality Assessment Dataset for Singing Face Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Talking Face Generation task has enormous potential for various applications in digital humans and agents, etc. Singing, as a common facial movement second only to talking, can be regarded as a universal language across ethnicities and cultures. However, it is often underestimated in the field due to lack of singing face datasets and the domain gap between singing and talking in rhythm and amplitude. More significantly, the quality of Singing Face Generation (SFG) often falls short and is uneven or limited by different applicable scenarios, which prompts us to propose timely and effective quality assessment methods to ensure user experience. To address existing gaps in this domain, this paper introduces a new SFG content quality assessment dataset SFQA, built using 12 representative generation methods. During the construction of the dataset, 100 photographs or portraits, as well as 36 music clips from 7 different styles, are utilized to generate 5,184 singing face videos that constitute the SFQA dataset. To further explore the quality of SFG methods, subjective quality assessment is conducted by evaluators, whose ratings reveal a significant variation in quality among different generation methods. Based on our proposed SFQA dataset, we comprehensively benchmark the current objective quality assessment algorithms.</description>

      <title>Block Erasure-Aware Semantic Multimedia Compression via JSCC Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an AI-based framework for semantic transmission of multimedia data over band-limited, time-varying channels. The method targets scenarios where large content is split into multiple packets, with an unknown number potentially dropped due to channel impairments. Using joint source-channel coding (JSCC), our approach achieves reliable semantic reconstruction with graceful quality degradation as channel conditions worsen, eliminating the need for retransmissions that cause unacceptable delays in latency-sensitive applications such as video conferencing and robotic control. The framework is compatible with existing network protocols and further enables intelligent congestion control and unequal error protection. A tunable design parameter allows balancing robustness at low channel quality against fidelity at high channel quality. Experiments demonstrate significant robustness improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in both image and video domains.</description>

      <title>Size Matters: Reconstructing Real-Scale 3D Models from Monocular Images for Food Portion Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of chronic diseases related to diet, such as obesity and diabetes, emphasizes the need for accurate monitoring of food intake. While AI-driven dietary assessment has made strides in recent years, the ill-posed nature of recovering size (portion) information from monocular images for accurate estimation of ``how much did you eat?'' is a pressing challenge. Some 3D reconstruction methods have achieved impressive geometric reconstruction but fail to recover the crucial real-world scale of the reconstructed object, limiting its usage in precision nutrition. In this paper, we bridge the gap between 3D computer vision and digital health by proposing a method that recovers a true-to-scale 3D reconstructed object from a monocular image. Our approach leverages rich visual features extracted from models trained on large-scale datasets to estimate the scale of the reconstructed object. This learned scale enables us to convert single-view 3D reconstructions into true-to-life, physically meaningful models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on two publicly available datasets show that our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, achieving nearly a 30% reduction in mean absolute volume-estimation error, showcasing its potential to enhance the domain of precision nutrition.

      <title>Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Missing Modality Completion in Product Catalogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Missing-modality information on e-commerce platforms, such as absent product images or textual descriptions, often arises from annotation errors or incomplete metadata, impairing both product presentation and downstream applications such as recommendation systems. Motivated by the multimodal generative capabilities of recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this work investigates a fundamental yet underexplored question: can MLLMs generate missing modalities for products in e-commerce scenarios? We propose the Missing Modality Product Completion Benchmark (MMPCBench), which consists of two sub-benchmarks: a Content Quality Completion Benchmark and a Recommendation Benchmark.
  We further evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs from the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3 model families across nine real-world e-commerce categories, focusing on image-to-text and text-to-image completion tasks. Experimental results show that while MLLMs can capture high-level semantics, they struggle with fine-grained word-level and pixel- or patch-level alignment. In addition, performance varies substantially across product categories and model scales, and we observe no trivial correlation between model size and performance, in contrast to trends commonly reported in mainstream benchmarks. We also explore Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to better align MLLMs with this task. GRPO improves image-to-text completion but does not yield gains for text-to-image completion. Overall, these findings expose the limitations of current MLLMs in real-world cross-modal generation and represent an early step toward more effective missing-modality product completion.</description>

      <title>XY-Cut++: Advanced Layout Ordering via Hierarchical Mask Mechanism on a Novel Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Document Reading Order Recovery is a fundamental task in document image understanding, playing a pivotal role in enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and serving as a critical preprocessing step for large language models (LLMs). Existing methods often struggle with complex layouts(e.g., multi-column newspapers), high-overhead interactions between cross-modal elements (visual regions and textual semantics), and a lack of robust evaluation benchmarks. We introduce XY-Cut++, an advanced layout ordering method that integrates pre-mask processing, multi-granularity segmentation, and cross-modal matching to address these challenges. Our method significantly enhances layout ordering accuracy compared to traditional XY-Cut techniques. Specifically, XY-Cut++ achieves state-of-the-art performance (98.8 BLEU overall) while maintaining simplicity and efficiency. It outperforms existing baselines by up to 24\% and demonstrates consistent accuracy across simple and complex layouts on the newly introduced DocBench-100 dataset. This advancement establishes a reliable foundation for document structure recovery, setting a new standard for layout ordering tasks and facilitating more effective RAG and LLM preprocessing.</description>

      <title>Multi-hop Parallel Image Semantic Communication for Distortion Accumulation Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing semantic communication schemes primarily focus on single-hop scenarios, overlooking the challenges of multi-hop wireless image transmission. As semantic communication is inherently lossy, distortion accumulates over multiple hops, leading to significant performance degradation. To address this, we propose the multi-hop parallel image semantic communication (MHPSC) framework, which introduces a parallel residual compensation link at each hop against distortion accumulation. To minimize the associated transmission bandwidth overhead, a coarse-to-fine residual compression scheme is designed. A deep learning-based residual compressor first condenses the residuals, followed by the adaptive arithmetic coding (AAC) for further compression. A residual distribution estimation module predicts the prior distribution for the AAC to achieve fine compression performances. This approach ensures robust multi-hop image transmission with only a minor increase in transmission bandwidth. Experimental results confirm that MHPSC outperforms both existing semantic communication and traditional separated coding schemes.</description>

      <title>RacketVision: A Multiple Racket Sports Benchmark for Unified Ball and Racket Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce RacketVision, a novel dataset and benchmark for advancing computer vision in sports analytics, covering table tennis, tennis, and badminton. The dataset is the first to provide large-scale, fine-grained annotations for racket pose alongside traditional ball positions, enabling research into complex human-object interactions. It is designed to tackle three interconnected tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Our evaluation of established baselines reveals a critical insight for multi-modal fusion: while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines. RacketVision provides a versatile resource and a strong starting point for future research in dynamic object tracking, conditional motion forecasting, and multimodal analysis in sports.

      <title>Listen, Look, Drive: Coupling Audio Instructions for User-aware VLA-based Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models promise an open-vocabulary interface that can translate perceptual ambiguity into semantically grounded driving decisions, yet they still treat language as a static prior fixed at inference time. As a result, the model must infer continuously shifting objectives from pixels alone, yielding delayed or overly conservative maneuvers. We argue that effective VLAs for autonomous driving need an online channel in which users can influence driving with specific intentions. To this end, we present EchoVLA, a user-aware VLA that couples camera streams with in situ audio instructions. We augment the nuScenes dataset with temporally aligned, intent-specific speech commands generated by converting ego-motion descriptions into synthetic audios. Further, we compose emotional speech-trajectory pairs into a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for fine-tuning a Multimodal Large Model (MLM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni. Specifically, we synthesize the audio-augmented dataset with different emotion types paired with corresponding driving behaviors, leveraging the emotional cues embedded in tone, pitch, and speech tempo to reflect varying user states, such as urgent or hesitant intentions, thus enabling our EchoVLA to interpret not only the semantic content but also the emotional context of audio commands for more nuanced and emotionally adaptive driving behavior. In open-loop benchmarks, our approach reduces the average L2 error by $59.4\%$ and the collision rate by $74.4\%$ compared to the baseline of vision-only perception. More experiments on nuScenes dataset validate that EchoVLA not only steers the trajectory through audio instructions, but also modulates driving behavior in response to the emotions detected in the user's speech.</description>
