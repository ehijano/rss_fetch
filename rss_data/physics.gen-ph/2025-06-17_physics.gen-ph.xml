      <title>Zero mass as the Borel structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lorentz group Lor$_{1,3}=$SO$_0(1,3)$ has two point fixgroups, namely SO$(3)$ for time-like translations and SO$_0(1,1)\times R^2$ for light-like translations. However, for light-like translations it is reasonable to consider a line fixgroup that leads to the Borel structure of the Lorentz group and gives appropriate helicities for massless particles. Therefore, whether a particle is massless or massive is not so much a physical question but rather a question of the underlying Lie group symmetry.</description>

      <title>Lower bound of computational complexity of knapsack problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum statistics mechanism is very powerful for investigating the equilibrium states and the phase transitions in complex spin disorder systems. The spin disorder systems act as an interdisciplinary platform for solving the optimum processes in computer science. In this work, I determined the lower bound of the computational complexity of knapsack problems. I investigated the origin of nontrivial topological structures in these hard problems. It was uncovered that the nontrivial topological structures arise from the contradictory between the three-dimensional character of the lattice and the two-dimensional character of the transfer matrices used in the quantum statistics mechanism. I illustrated a phase diagram for the non-deterministic polynomial (NP) vs polynomial (P) problems, in which a NP-intermediate (NPI) area exists between the NP-complete problems and the P-problems, while the absolute minimum core model is at the border between the NPI and the NP-complete problems. The absolute minimum core model of the knapsack problem cannot collapse directly into the P-problem. Under the guide of the results, one may develop the best algorithms for solving various optimum problems in the shortest time, being in subexponential and superpolynomial. This work illuminates the road on various fields of science ranging from physics to biology to finances, and to information technologies.</description>

      <title>A theory of vectorial probability for quantum correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomness is a ubiquitous phenomenon that is practically accompanied by physical events described by probability theory. However, probability by definition in the theory is a nonnegative scalar quantity. Here, we propose the concept of vectorial probability, quantified as a vector with interesting but hidden geometry, and develop a theory to describe random events with correlations dictated by this geometry. Based on this theory, we construct a local model that is able to reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics about Bell's theorem. We discover that the particle detection events in Bell experiments exhibit the stochastic nature of four-dimensional probability and that it is the unexplored geometry of the vectorial probability that is responsible for the violation of Bell's theorem. This work paves the way for generalizing probability theory from the one-dimensional probability space to higher-dimensional ones and reveals that quantum systems with correlations violating Bell's theorem are physical platforms for producing real stochastic events of high-dimensional probability.</description>

      <title>Use of Redshifts as Evidence of Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale dynamics of the universe is generally described in terms of the time-dependent scale factor $a(t)$. To make contact with observational data, the $a(t)$ function needs to be related to the observable $z(r)$ function, redshift versus distance. Model fitting of data has shown that the equation that governs $z(r)$ needs to contain a constant term, which has been identified as Einstein's cosmological constant. Here, it is shown that the required constant term is not a cosmological constant but is due to an overlooked geometric difference between proper time $t$ and look-back time $t_{\rm lb}$ along lines of sight, which fan out isotropically in all directions of the 3D (3-dimensional) space that constitutes the observable universe. The constant term is needed to satisfy the requirement of spatial isotropy in the local limit. Its magnitude is independent of the epoch in which the observer lives and agrees with the value found by model fitting of observational data. Two of the observational consequences of this explanation are examined: an increase in the age of the universe from 13.8 Gyr to 15.4 Gyr, and a resolution of the $H_0$ tension, which restores consistency to cosmological theory.</description>

      <title>Hamilton-Jacobi Treatment of The Scalar Field Coupled to Two Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The constrained filed system, the scalar field coupled to two flavours of fermions through Yukawa couplings, is treated by using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. The equations of motion are obtained as total differential equations in many variables. The equations of motion are in exact agreement with those equations obtained using Dirac's method. Due to the Hamilton-Jacobi quantization, the path integral of the scalar field coupled to two fermions is obtained directly as an integration over the canonical phase space without using any gauge fixing condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18495v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the separability properties of quantum states described by an extended Werner density matrix, where the classical component exhibits statistical dependence. By generalizing the classical part to allow correlations, we demonstrate that within a specific parameter range the separable region expands compared to the standard Werner state with an independent classical component. This result suggests that increasing classical correlation can enhance the separability of the overall quantum state, providing new insights into the interplay between classical and quantum correlations.</description>
