      <title>Convergence domains of sedenionic star-power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of slice regular (also called hyperholomorphic) functions is a generalization of complex analysis originally given in the quaternionic framework, and then further extended to Clifford algebras, octonions, and to real alternative algebras. Recently, we have extended this theory to the case of (real) even-dimensional Euclidean space. We provided several tools for studying slice regular functions in this context, such as a path-representation formula, slice-solutions, hyper-solutions and hyper-sigma balls. When adding an algebra structure to Euclidean space we have more properties related to the possibility of multiplying elements in the algebra. In this paper, we focus on exploring the properties specific to the context of the algebra of sedenions which is rather peculiar, being the algebra non associative and non alternative. The consideration of a non alternative algebra is a novelty in the context of slice regularity which opens the way to a number of further progresses. We offer an explicit characterization for slice-solutions and hyper-solutions, and we determine the convergence domain of the power series in the form $q\mapsto\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}}(q-p)^{*n}a_n$ with sedenionic coefficients. Unlike the case of complex numbers and quaternions, the convergence domain in this context is determined by two convergence radii instead of one. These results are closely tied to the presence of zero divisors in the algebra of sedenions.</description>

      <title>A logarithmic characterization of Arakelian sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arakelian's classical approximation theorem \cite{Ar} gives necessary and sufficient conditions such that functions can be uniformly approximated in (unbounded) closed sets $F\subset \mathbb{C}$ by entire functions. The conditions are purely topological and concern the connectedness of the complement of $F$. We give a new characterization of Arakelian sets in terms of logarithmic branches of functions $f\in A(F)$, which are continuous in $F$ and holomorphic in its interior $F^\circ$. Our proof is based on a contradiction argument and the counterexample function that we use is furnished by the Weierstrass factorization theorem.</description>

      <title>On Lemniscate starlikeness of analytic functions and its application to special functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the lemniscate starlikeness of analytic functions by deriving specific conditions on their power series coefficients. The study utilizes the Cauchy product of power series along with key inequalities involving the Pochhammer symbol and the Gamma function. The derived results are further applied to a number of special functions, providing parameter restrictions under which these functions become lemniscate starlike. The findings extend and refine several earlier results in this domain.</description>

      <title>Parametric Factorization of Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey paper we study parametric versions of writing a matrix in $SL_n (\mathbb{C})$ as a product of lower and upper unitriangular matrices in interchanging order as well as generalizations to other classical groups. We give an account of algebraic, continuous and holomorphic factorization results, from the standpoint of Several Complex Variables. Out of the wealth of algebraic results, we only concentrate on those which are related to holomorphic factorization and often formulate them in a specific form, e.g. for the field of complex numbers in place of more general fields or principal ideal domains. The number of unitriangular matrices needed is a difficult problem and is solved in very specific cases only. We give a new lower bound for factorizing matrices in $SL_2 (\mathbb{C})$ continuously parametrized by two dimensional normal topological spaces.</description>

      <title>A Pair of Multiplication-Type Operators in Quaternionic Analysis and the 2-Cauchy-Fueter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a pair of multiplication-like operations, $L_0$ and $L_1$, which derive $k$-regular functions from $(k+1)$-regular functions. The investigation of the inverse problem naturally leads to a deeper study of the 2-Cauchy-Fueter equation. In doing so, we provide a new acyclic resolution for the sheaf of $2$-regular functions $\mathcal{R}^{(2)}$. Furthermore, a complete topological characterization for the solvability of the $2$-Cauchy-Fueter equation is established. Specifically, we prove that the $2$-Cauchy-Fueter equation $$\mathscr{D}^{(2)}f=g$$ is solvable for any $g$ satisfying $\mathscr{D}_1^{(2)}g=0$ on a domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^4$ if and only if $H^3(\Omega, \mathbb{R}) = 0$, or equivalently, if and only if every real-valued harmonic function on $\Omega$ can be represented as the real part of a quaternionic regular function.</description>

Abstract: We show that a class of quasiregular Latt\`es maps, called orthotopic Latt\`es maps, are cellular Markov maps. This provides examples of expanding Thurston-type maps that are also uniformly quasiregular, and whose visual metrics are quasisymmetrically equivalent to the Riemannian distance.</description>

      <title>Minimal surfaces over the Pitot quadrilaterals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a fully explicit framework for constructing Scherk-type minimal graphs over the Pitot quadrilaterals (i.e. such that the two pairs of opposite sides have the same total length). For any Pitot quadrilateral \(Q\), we first produce a harmonic diffeomorphism of the unit disk onto \(Q\), whose dilatation is the square of a M\"obius automorphism determined directly by the vertices of \(Q\). Using this map as the Weierstrass data, we obtain a minimal graph \(\Sigma\) whose Gauss map is a univalent M\"obius transformation and whose height function exhibits alternating blow-up behavior along opposite sides of \(Q\), mirroring the classical Scherk surfaces. We further construct an associated canonical surface \(\Sigma^\diamond\), with the same boundary asymptotics, and prove a sharp curvature comparison theorem: at the harmonic center of \(Q\), among all bounded minimal graphs with matching normal direction and mixed derivative, \(\Sigma^\diamond\) uniquely maximizes the absolute Gaussian curvature. This provides a complete and constructive description of Scherk-type minimal graphs over all, both convex or concave, Pitot quadrilaterals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the theory of thermodynamic formalism from the perspective of computable analysis, with a special focus on the computability of equilibrium states. Specifically, we develop two complementary general approaches to verify the computability of equilibrium states for non-uniformly expanding computable dynamical systems. The first approach applies to dynamical systems whose topological pressure functions admit effective approximations and whose measure-theoretic entropy functions are upper semi-continuous. As a concrete application, we establish the computability of the equilibrium states for Misiurewicz-Thurston rational maps with \holder continuous potentials. The second approach exploits prescribed Jacobians of equilibrium states through a local analysis and applies to settings where the measure-theoretic entropy functions may lack upper semi-continuity.</description>

      <title>Around the semi-classical limit of boundary Liouville conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liouville conformal field theory describes a random geometry that fluctuates around a deterministic one: the unique solution of the problem of finding, within a given conformal class, a Riemannian metric with prescribed scalar and geodesic curvatures as well as conical singularities and corners. The level of randomness in Liouville theory is measured by the coupling constant $\gamma\in(0,2)$, the semi-classical limit corresponding to taking $\gamma\to0$.
  Based on the probabilistic definition of Liouville theory, we prove that this semi-classical limit exists and does give rise to this deterministic geometry. At second order this limit is described in terms of a massive Gaussian free field with Robin boundary conditions.
  This in turn allows to implement CFT-inspired techniques in a deterministic setting: in particular we define the classical stress-energy tensor, show that it can be expressed in terms of accessory parameters (written as regularized derivatives of the Liouville action), and that it gives rise to classical higher equations of motion.</description>

Abstract: A classical result of Fekete gives necessary conditions on a compact set in the complex plane so that it contains infinitely many sets of conjugate algebraic integers. For such sets, we demonstrate the existence of a sequence of algebraic integers such that most of their conjugates eventually lie near the set, while maintaining a bound on heights. Finally, we examine properties satisfied by the limiting distribution of a sequence of algebraic numbers.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of a nontrivial uniform algebra that is logmodular and regular on the Cantor set. As a consequence, we obtain that for every compact metrizable space X without isolated points there exists a nontrivial essential uniform algebra that is logmodular and regular on X. In particular, there exists a nontrivial essential uniform algebra that is logmodular and regular on the closed unit interval. Our algebras seem to be the first known uniform algebras that are regular on a metrizable space but are not normal.</description>

      <title>Shafarevich-Tate groups of holomorphic Lagrangian fibrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.10921v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a Lagrangian fibration $\pi\colon X\to \mathbb P^n$ on a hyperk\"ahler manifold $X$. There are two ways to construct a holomorphic family of deformations of $\pi$ over $\mathbb C$. The first one is known under the name Shafarevich-Tate family while the second one is the degenerate twistor family constructed by Verbitsky. We show that both families coincide. We prove that for a very general $X$ all members of the Shafarevich-Tate family are K\"ahler. There is a related notion of the Shafarevich-Tate group associated to a Lagrangian fibration. Its connected component of unity can be shown to be isomorphic to $\mathbb C/\Lambda$ where $\Lambda$ is a finitely generated subgroup of $\mathbb C$ and $\mathbb C$ is thought of as the base of the Shafarevich-Tate family. We show that for a very general $X$, projective deformations in the Shafarevich-Tate family correspond to the torsion points in the connected component of unity of the Shafarevich-Tate group. A sufficient condition for a Lagrangian fibration $X$ to be projective is existence of a holomorphic section. We find sufficient cohomological conditions for existence of a deformation in the Shafarevich-Tate family that admits a section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09178v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact hyperk\"ahler manifold with a Lagrangian fibration $\pi\colon X\to B$. A Shafarevich-Tate twist of $X$ is a holomorphic symplectic manifold with a Lagrangian fibration $\pi^\varphi\colon X^\varphi\to B$ which is isomorphic to $\pi$ locally over the base. In particular, $\pi^\varphi$ has the same fibers as $\pi$. A twist $X^\varphi$ corresponds to an element $\varphi$ in the Shafarevich-Tate group of $X$. We show that $X^\varphi$ is K\"ahler when a multiple of $\varphi$ lies in the connected component of unity of the Shafarevich-Tate group and give a necessary condition for $X^\varphi$ to be bimeromorphic to a K\"ahler manifold.</description>

      <title>Geometric Solution of the Loop Equation and Quark Confinement in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic confining area law for pure $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ Yang--Mills theory, satisfying the hierarchy of multiloop equations for arbitrary regular loops and any number of colors $N_c$. The solution is constructed using a quaternionic Hodge-dual minimal surface in a 16-dimensional auxiliary space. Unlike random surfaces, this construction defines an effectively topological string theory where the bulk dynamics reduces to the area of a conformal map of the 2D disk, with all nontrivial dynamics encoded in the boundary loop.
  The Wilson loop factorizes into a confining dressing factor and a perturbative term: $W[C] = W_{\text{pert}}[C]\, e^{-\kappa S[C]}$. We show that the geometric factor $e^{-\kappa S[C]}$ is an exact multiplicative zero mode of the loop-space diffusion operator and of the full MM multiloop hierarchy for any finite $N_c$, extending the planar area law to the physical case $N_c=3$. The functional $S[C]$ obeys the inequality $S[C] \ge \sqrt{2}\,A[C]$ (where $A[C]$ is the Euclidean minimal area), providing a sufficient condition for confinement.
  The area law is given explicitly by the spectral formula $S[C] = 2\sqrt{2}\,(\lambda_3 + \lambda_4)$, using the two largest eigenvalues of the Douglas--Gram matrix. We demonstrate that this functional is an exact additive zero mode of the loop diffusion operator, protected algebraically by the Bianchi identity, and globally defined for regular loops $C \in H^{1/2}(\mathbb{S}^1,\mathbb{R}^4)$. Matching this factor with the gluon condensate via the OPE determines the physical string tension $\kappa \sim \Lambda_{\text{QCD}}^2$. This framework yields a first-principles derivation of confinement in QCD and new tools for the high-lying meson spectrum.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new formulation of a vanishing theorem for surfaces. Although this vanishing theorem follows easily from the well-known Kawamata--Viehweg vanishing theorem, it turns out to be remarkably useful. In particular, it is sufficient for the minimal model theory of log surfaces, and it allows one to carry out both the minimal model program and the abundance theorem for log surfaces without invoking any of the deeper vanishing theorems.</description>
