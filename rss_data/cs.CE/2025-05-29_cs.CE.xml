      <title>Modeling extreme events and intermittency in turbulent diffusion with a mean gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of passive tracer transport in turbulent flows with a mean gradient, emphasizing tracer intermittency and extreme events. An analytically tractable model is developed, coupling zonal and shear velocity components with both linear and nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Formulating the model in Fourier space, a simple explicit solution for the tracer invariant statistics is derived. Through this model we identify the resonance condition responsible for non-Gaussian behavior and bursts in the tracer. Resonant conditions, that lead to a peak in the tracer variance, occur when the zonal flow and the shear flow phase speeds are equivalent. Numerical experiments across a range of regimes, including different energy spectra and zonal flow models, are performed to validate these findings and demonstrate how the velocity field and stochasticity determines tracer extremes. These results provide additional insight into the mechanisms underlying turbulent tracer transport, with implications for uncertainty quantification and data assimilation in geophysical and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>CiRL: Open-Source Environments for Reinforcement Learning in Circular Economy and Net Zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand of finite raw materials will keep increasing as they fuel modern society. Simultaneously, solutions for stopping carbon emissions in the short term are not available, thus making the net zero target extremely challenging to achieve at scale. The circular economy (CE) paradigm is gaining attention as a solution to address climate change and the uncertainties of supplies of critical materials. Hence, in this paper, we introduce CiRL, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) library of environments focused on the circularity of both solid and fluid materials. The integration of DRL into the design of material circularity is possible thanks to the formalism of thermodynamical material networks, which is underpinned by compartmental dynamical thermodynamics. Along with the focus on circularity, this library has three more features: the new CE-oriented environments are in the state-space form, which is typically used in dynamical systems analysis and control designs; it is based on a state-of-the-art Python library of DRL algorithms, namely, Stable-Baselines3; and it is developed in Google Colaboratory to be accessible to researchers from different disciplines and backgrounds as is often the case for circular economy researchers and engineers. CiRL is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Power-Capping Metric Evaluation for Improving Energy Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With high-performance computing systems now running at exascale, optimizing power-scaling management and resource utilization has become more critical than ever. This paper explores runtime power-capping optimizations that leverage integrated CPU-GPU power management on architectures like the NVIDIA GH200 superchip. We evaluate energy-performance metrics that account for simultaneous CPU and GPU power-capping effects by using two complementary approaches: speedup-energy-delay and a Euclidean distance-based multi-objective optimization method. By targeting a mostly compute-bound exascale science application, the Locally Self-Consistent Multiple Scattering (LSMS), we explore challenging scenarios to identify potential opportunities for energy savings in exascale applications, and we recognize that even modest reductions in energy consumption can have significant overall impacts. Our results highlight how GPU task-specific dynamic power-cap adjustments combined with integrated CPU-GPU power steering can improve the energy utilization of certain GPU tasks, thereby laying the groundwork for future adaptive optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>SVRPBench: A Realistic Benchmark for Stochastic Vehicle Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21887v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust routing under uncertainty is central to real-world logistics, yet most benchmarks assume static, idealized settings. We present SVRPBench, the first open benchmark to capture high-fidelity stochastic dynamics in vehicle routing at urban scale. Spanning more than 500 instances with up to 1000 customers, it simulates realistic delivery conditions: time-dependent congestion, log-normal delays, probabilistic accidents, and empirically grounded time windows for residential and commercial clients. Our pipeline generates diverse, constraint-rich scenarios, including multi-depot and multi-vehicle setups. Benchmarking reveals that state-of-the-art RL solvers like POMO and AM degrade by over 20% under distributional shift, while classical and metaheuristic methods remain robust. To enable reproducible research, we release the dataset and evaluation suite. SVRPBench challenges the community to design solvers that generalize beyond synthetic assumptions and adapt to real-world uncertainty.</description>

      <title>FALCON: An ML Framework for Fully Automated Layout-Constrained Analog Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing analog circuits from performance specifications is a complex, multi-stage process encompassing topology selection, parameter inference, and layout feasibility. We introduce FALCON, a unified machine learning framework that enables fully automated, specification-driven analog circuit synthesis through topology selection and layout-constrained optimization. Given a target performance, FALCON first selects an appropriate circuit topology using a performance-driven classifier guided by human design heuristics. Next, it employs a custom, edge-centric graph neural network trained to map circuit topology and parameters to performance, enabling gradient-based parameter inference through the learned forward model. This inference is guided by a differentiable layout cost, derived from analytical equations capturing parasitic and frequency-dependent effects, and constrained by design rules. We train and evaluate FALCON on a large-scale custom dataset of 1M analog mm-wave circuits, generated and simulated using Cadence Spectre across 20 expert-designed topologies. Through this evaluation, FALCON demonstrates &gt;99\% accuracy in topology inference, &lt;10\% relative error in performance prediction, and efficient layout-aware design that completes in under 1 second per instance. Together, these results position FALCON as a practical and extensible foundation model for end-to-end analog circuit design automation.</description>

      <title>B-XAIC Dataset: Benchmarking Explainable AI for Graph Neural Networks Using Chemical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the reasoning behind deep learning model predictions is crucial in cheminformatics and drug discovery, where molecular design determines their properties. However, current evaluation frameworks for Explainable AI (XAI) in this domain often rely on artificial datasets or simplified tasks, employing data-derived metrics that fail to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios and lack a direct link to explanation faithfulness. To address this, we introduce B-XAIC, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world molecular data and diverse tasks with known ground-truth rationales for assigned labels. Through a comprehensive evaluation using B-XAIC, we reveal limitations of existing XAI methods for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the molecular domain. This benchmark provides a valuable resource for gaining deeper insights into the faithfulness of XAI, facilitating the development of more reliable and interpretable models.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Distillation of Diffusion Models for PDE-Constrained Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling physical systems in a generative manner offers several advantages, including the ability to handle partial observations, generate diverse solutions, and address both forward and inverse problems. Recently, diffusion models have gained increasing attention in the modeling of physical systems, particularly those governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, diffusion models only access noisy data $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ at intermediate steps, making it infeasible to directly enforce constraints on the clean sample $\boldsymbol{x}_0$ at each noisy level. As a workaround, constraints are typically applied to the expectation of clean samples $\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{x}_0|\boldsymbol{x}_t]$, which is estimated using the learned score network. However, imposing PDE constraints on the expectation does not strictly represent the one on the true clean data, known as Jensen's Gap. This gap creates a trade-off: enforcing PDE constraints may come at the cost of reduced accuracy in generative modeling. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc distillation approach, where PDE constraints are not injected directly into the diffusion process, but instead enforced during a post-hoc distillation stage. We term our method as Physics-Informed Distillation of Diffusion Models (PIDDM). This distillation not only facilitates single-step generation with improved PDE satisfaction, but also support both forward and inverse problem solving and reconstruction from randomly partial observation. Extensive experiments across various PDE benchmarks demonstrate that PIDDM significantly improves PDE satisfaction over several recent and competitive baselines, such as PIDM, DiffusionPDE, and ECI-sampling, with less computation overhead. Our approach can shed light on more efficient and effective strategies for incorporating physical constraints into diffusion models.</description>

      <title>M2L Translation Operators for Kernel Independent Fast Multipole Methods on Modern Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07436v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hardware trends favor algorithm designs that maximize data reuse per FLOP. We develop and benchmark high-performance Multipole-to-Local (M2L) translation operators for the kernel-independent Fast Multipole Method (kiFMM), a widely adopted FMM variant that supports a broad class of kernels and has been favored by recent implementations for its simple specification. Naively implemented, M2L is bandwidth-limited and therefore a key bottleneck in the FMM. State-of-the-art FFT-based M2L implementations, though elegant and with a fast setup time, suffer from low operational intensity and require architecture-specific optimizations. We demonstrate that a BLAS-based M2L, combined with randomized low-rank compression, achieves competitive performance with greater portability and a simpler implementation leveraging existing BLAS infrastructure, at the cost of higher setup times-especially for high-accuracy settings in double precision. Our Rust-based implementation enables seamless switching between strategies for fair benchmarking. Results on CPUs show that FFT-based M2L is favorable in low-accuracy settings or dynamic particle simulations, while BLAS-based M2L is favored for high-accuracy settings for static particle distributions, where its higher setup costs are amortized in many practical applications of the FMM.</description>

      <title>Improving precision of A/B experiments using trigger intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In industry, online randomized controlled experiment (a.k.a. A/B experiment) is a standard approach to measure the impact of a causal change. These experiments have small treatment effect to reduce the potential blast radius. As a result, these experiments often lack statistical significance due to low signal-to-noise ratio. A standard approach for improving the precision (or reducing the standard error) focuses only on the trigger observations, where the output of the treatment and the control model are different. Although evaluation with full information about trigger observations (full knowledge) improves the precision, detecting all such trigger observations is a costly affair. In this paper, we propose a sampling based evaluation method (partial knowledge) to reduce this cost. The randomness of sampling introduces bias in the estimated outcome. We theoretically analyze this bias and show that the bias is inversely proportional to the number of observations used for sampling. We also compare the proposed evaluation methods using simulation and empirical data. In simulation, bias in evaluation with partial knowledge effectively reduces to zero when a limited number of observations (&lt;= 0.1%) are sampled for trigger estimation. In empirical setup, evaluation with partial knowledge reduces the standard error by 36.48%.</description>
