      <title>Aerobars Position Effect: What is the Interaction Between Aerodynamic Drag and Power Production?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive research has been dedicated to optimizing the cyclist's position on the bike to enhance aerodynamic performance. This study aims to further investigate the aerobars position effect on cycling speed. Drawing from previous work (Fintelman et al., 2015), a relationship is established between position variations and hip angle, a critical determinant of power output. Based on a 3D scan of an elite athlete on his Time Trial (TT) bike, a digital twin with upper body mobility is created, utilizing inverse kinematics with aerobars as a root. Adjustments to the aerobars position translate into alterations in the cyclist's upper body posture. These changes influence both aerodynamic drag -quantified by Computational Fluid Dynamics method (CFD)- and hip angle -computed by 3D software, directly affecting the athlete's capacity for power generation. The interplay between aerodynamic efficiency and power output is analyzed, with varying parameters such as speed and slope angle considered to ascertain the optimal aerobar position for individual athletes in a specific cycling context. Results show impactful variations in cycling speed as a function of the aerobars position, the latter having a strong influence on aerodynamic drag and theoretical power production.</description>

      <title>Effect of Parametric Variation of Chordae Tendineae Structure on Simulated Atrioventricular Valve Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many approaches have been used to model chordae tendineae geometries in finite element simulations of atrioventricular heart valves. Unfortunately, current "functional" chordae tendineae geometries lack fidelity that would be helpful when informing clinical decisions. The objectives of this work are (i) to improve synthetic chordae tendineae geometry fidelity to consider branching and (ii) to define how the chordae tendineae geometry affects finite element simulations of valve closure. In this work, we develop an open-source method to construct synthetic chordae tendineae geometries in the SlicerHeart Extension of 3D Slicer. The generated geometries are then used in FEBio finite element simulations of atrioventricular valve function to evaluate how variations in chordae tendineae geometry influence valve behavior. Effects are evaluated using functional and mechanical metrics. Our findings demonstrated that altering the chordae tendineae geometry of a stereotypical mitral valve led to changes in clinically relevant valve metrics and valve mechanics. Specifically, cross sectional area had the most influence over valve closure metrics, followed by chordae tendineae density, length, radius and branches. We then used this information to showcase the flexibility of our new workflow by altering the chordae tendineae geometry of two additional geometries (mitral valve with annular dilation and tricuspid valve) to improve finite element predictions. This study presents a flexible, open-source method for generating synthetic chordae tendineae with realistic branching structures. Further, we establish relationships between the chordae tendineae geometry and valve functional/mechanical metrics. This research contribution helps enrich our open-source workflow and brings the finite element simulations closer to use in a patient-specific clinical setting.</description>

      <title>MICCAI-CDMRI 2023 QuantConn Challenge Findings on Achieving Robust Quantitative Connectivity through Harmonized Preprocessing of Diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White matter alterations are increasingly implicated in neurological diseases and their progression. International-scale studies use diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) to qualitatively identify changes in white matter microstructure and connectivity. Yet, quantitative analysis of DW-MRI data is hindered by inconsistencies stemming from varying acquisition protocols. There is a pressing need to harmonize the preprocessing of DW-MRI datasets to ensure the derivation of robust quantitative diffusion metrics across acquisitions. In the MICCAI-CDMRI 2023 QuantConn challenge, participants were provided raw data from the same individuals collected on the same scanner but with two different acquisitions and tasked with preprocessing the DW-MRI to minimize acquisition differences while retaining biological variation. Submissions are evaluated on the reproducibility and comparability of cross-acquisition bundle-wise microstructure measures, bundle shape features, and connectomics. The key innovations of the QuantConn challenge are that (1) we assess bundles and tractography in the context of harmonization for the first time, (2) we assess connectomics in the context of harmonization for the first time, and (3) we have 10x additional subjects over prior harmonization challenge, MUSHAC and 100x over SuperMUDI. We find that bundle surface area, fractional anisotropy, connectome assortativity, betweenness centrality, edge count, modularity, nodal strength, and participation coefficient measures are most biased by acquisition and that machine learning voxel-wise correction, RISH mapping, and NeSH methods effectively reduce these biases. In addition, microstructure measures AD, MD, RD, bundle length, connectome density, efficiency, and path length are least biased by these acquisition differences.</description>

      <title>Exploring the capabilities of CNNs for 3D angiographic reconstructions from limited projection data using rotational angiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study leverages convolutional neural networks to enhance the temporal resolution of 3D angiography in intracranial aneurysms focusing on the reconstruction of volumetric contrast data from sparse and limited projections. Three patient-specific IA geometries were segmented and converted into stereolithography files to facilitate computational fluid dynamics simulations. These simulations first modeled blood flow under steady conditions with varying inlet velocities: 0.25 m/s, 0.35 m/s, and 0.45 m/s. Subsequently, 3D angiograms were simulated by labeling inlet particles to represent contrast bolus injections over durations of 0.5s, 1.0s, 1.5s, and 2.0s. The angiographic simulations were then used within a simulated cone beam C arm CT system to generate in-silico rotational DSAs, capturing projections every 10 ms over a 220-degree arc at 27 frames per second. From these simulations, both fully sampled (108 projections) and truncated projection datasets were generated the latter using a maximum of 49 projections. High fidelity volumetric images were reconstructed using a Parker weighted Feldkamp Davis Kress algorithm. A modified U Net CNN was subsequently trained on these datasets to reconstruct 3D angiographic volumes from the truncated projections. The network incorporated multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activations and Max pooling, complemented by upsampling and concatenation to preserve spatial detail. Model performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE). Evaluating our U net model across the test set yielded a MSE of 0.0001, indicating good agreement with ground truth reconstructions and demonstrating acceptable capabilities in capturing relevant transient angiographic features. This study confirms the feasibility of using CNNs for reconstructing 3D angiographic images from truncated projections.</description>

      <title>RibCageImp: A Deep Learning Framework for 3D Ribcage Implant Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recovery of damaged or resected ribcage structures requires precise, custom-designed implants to restore the integrity and functionality of the thoracic cavity. Traditional implant design methods rely mainly on manual processes, making them time-consuming and susceptible to variability. In this work, we explore the feasibility of automated ribcage implant generation using deep learning. We present a framework based on 3D U-Net architecture that processes CT scans to generate patient-specific implant designs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation into automated thoracic implant generation using deep learning approaches. Our preliminary results, while moderate, highlight both the potential and the significant challenges in this complex domain. These findings establish a foundation for future research in automated ribcage reconstruction and identify key technical challenges that need to be addressed for practical implementation.</description>
