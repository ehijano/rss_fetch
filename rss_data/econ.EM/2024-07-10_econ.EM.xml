      <title>Conditional Rank-Rank Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rank-rank regressions are widely used in economic research to evaluate phenomena such as intergenerational income persistence or mobility. However, when covariates are incorporated to capture between-group persistence, the resulting coefficients can be difficult to interpret as such. We propose the conditional rank-rank regression, which uses conditional ranks instead of unconditional ranks, to measure average within-group income persistence. This property is analogous to that of the unconditional rank-rank regression that measures the overall income persistence. The difference between conditional and unconditional rank-rank regression coefficients therefore can measure between-group persistence. We develop a flexible estimation approach using distribution regression and establish a theoretical framework for large sample inference. An empirical study on intergenerational income mobility in Switzerland demonstrates the advantages of this approach. The study reveals stronger intergenerational persistence between fathers and sons compared to fathers and daughters, with the within-group persistence explaining 62% of the overall income persistence for sons and 52% for daughters. Families of small size or with highly educated fathers exhibit greater persistence in passing on their economic status.</description>

      <title>Femicide Laws, Unilateral Divorce, and Abortion Decriminalization Fail to Stop Women's Killings in Mexico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of femicide laws in combating gender-based killings of women, a major cause of premature female mortality globally. Focusing on Mexico, a pioneer in adopting such legislation, the paper leverages variations in the enactment of femicide laws and associated prison sentences across states. Using the difference-in-difference estimator, the analysis reveals that these laws have not significantly affected the incidence of femicides, homicides of women, or reports of women who have disappeared. These findings remain robust even when accounting for differences in prison sentencing, whether states also implemented unilateral divorce laws, or decriminalized abortion alongside femicide legislation. The results suggest that legislative measures are insufficient to address violence against women in settings where impunity prevails.</description>

      <title>Causes and Electoral Consequences of Political Assassinations: The Role of Organized Crime in Mexico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mexico has experienced a notable surge in assassinations of political candidates and mayors. This article argues that these killings are largely driven by organized crime, aiming to influence candidate selection, control local governments for rent-seeking, and retaliate against government crackdowns. Using a new dataset of political assassinations in Mexico from 2000 to 2021 and instrumental variables, we address endogeneity concerns in the location and timing of government crackdowns. Our instruments include historical Chinese immigration patterns linked to opium cultivation in Mexico, local corn prices, and U.S. illicit drug prices. The findings reveal that candidates in municipalities near oil pipelines face an increased risk of assassination due to drug trafficking organizations expanding into oil theft, particularly during elections and fuel price hikes. Government arrests or killings of organized crime members trigger retaliatory violence, further endangering incumbent mayors. This political violence has a negligible impact on voter turnout, as it targets politicians rather than voters. However, voter turnout increases in areas where authorities disrupt drug smuggling, raising the chances of the local party being re-elected. These results offer new insights into how criminal groups attempt to capture local governments and the implications for democracy under criminal governance.</description>

      <title>Dealing with idiosyncratic cross-correlation when constructing confidence regions for PC factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a computationally simple estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the Principal Components (PC) factors valid in the presence of cross-correlated idiosyncratic components. The proposed estimator of the asymptotic Mean Square Error (MSE) of PC factors is based on adaptive thresholding the sample covariances of the id iosyncratic residuals with the threshold based on their individual variances. We compare the nite sample performance of condence regions for the PC factors obtained using the proposed asymptotic MSE with those of available extant asymptotic and bootstrap regions and show that the former beats all alternative procedures for a wide variety of idiosyncratic cross-correlation structures.</description>

      <title>Flexible Covariate Adjustments in Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.07942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical regression discontinuity (RD) studies often use covariates to increase the precision of their estimates. In this paper, we propose a novel class of estimators that use such covariate information more efficiently than existing methods and can accommodate many covariates. It involves running a standard RD analysis in which a function of the covariates has been subtracted from the original outcome variable. We characterize the function that leads to the estimator with the smallest asymptotic variance, and consider feasible versions of such estimators in which this function is estimated, for example, through modern machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Using Forests in Multivariate Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss estimation and inference of conditional treatment effects in regression discontinuity designs with multiple scores. Aside from the commonly used local linear regression approach and a minimax-optimal estimator recently proposed by Imbens and Wager (2019), we consider two estimators based on random forests -- honest regression forests and local linear forests -- whose construction resembles that of standard local regressions, with theoretical validity following from results in Wager and Athey (2018) and Friedberg et al. (2020). We design a systematic Monte Carlo study with data generating processes built both from functional forms that we specify and from Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks that can closely mimic the observed data. We find that no single estimator dominates across all simulations: (i) local linear regressions perform well in univariate settings, but can undercover when multivariate scores are transformed into a univariate score -- which is commonly done in practice -- possibly due to the "zero-density" issue of the collapsed univariate score at the transformed cutoff; (ii) good performance of the minimax-optimal estimator depends on accurate estimation of a nuisance parameter and its current implementation only accepts up to two scores; (iii) forest-based estimators are not designed for estimation at boundary points and can suffer from bias in finite sample, but their flexibility in modeling multivariate scores opens the door to a wide range of empirical applications in multivariate regression discontinuity designs.</description>

      <title>What Does it Take to Control Global Temperatures? A toolbox for testing and estimating the impact of economic policies on climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper tests the feasibility and estimates the cost of climate control through economic policies. It provides a toolbox for a statistical historical assessment of a Stochastic Integrated Model of Climate and the Economy, and its use in (possibly counterfactual) policy analysis. Recognizing that stabilization requires supressing a trend, we use an integrated-cointegrated Vector Autoregressive Model estimated using a newly compiled dataset ranging between years A.D. 1000-2008, extending previous results on Control Theory in nonstationary systems. We test statistically whether, and quantify to what extent, carbon abatement policies can effectively stabilize or reduce global temperatures. Our formal test of policy feasibility shows that carbon abatement can have a significant long run impact and policies can render temperatures stationary around a chosen long run mean. In a counterfactual empirical illustration of the possibilities of our modeling strategy, we study a retrospective policy aiming to keep global temperatures close to their 1900 historical level. Achieving this via carbon abatement may cost about 75% of the observed 2008 level of world GDP, a cost equivalent to reverting to levels of output historically observed in the mid 1960s. By contrast, investment in carbon neutral technology could achieve the policy objective and be self-sustainable as long as it costs less than 50% of 2008 global GDP and 75% of consumption.</description>
