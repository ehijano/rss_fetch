      <title>Feedforward equilibrium trajectory optimization with GSPulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the common tasks required for designing new plasma scenarios or evaluating capabilities of a tokamak is to design the desired equilibria using a Grad-Shafranov (GS) equilibrium solver. However, most standard equilibrium solvers are time-independent and do not include dynamic effects such as plasma current flux consumption, induced vessel currents, or voltage constraints. Another class of tools, plasma equilibrium evolution simulators, do include time-dependent effects. These are generally structured to solve the forward problem of evolving the plasma equilibrium given feedback-controlled voltages. In this work, we introduce GSPulse, a novel algorithm for equilibrium trajectory optimization, that is more akin to a pulse planner than a pulse simulator. GSPulse includes time-dependent effects and solves the inverse problem: given a user-specified set of target equilibrium shapes, as well as limits on the coil currents and voltages, the optimizer returns trajectories of the voltages, currents, and achievable equilibria. This task is useful for scoping performance of a tokamak and exploring the space of achievable pulses. The computed equilibria satisfy both Grad-Shafranov force balance and axisymmetric circuit dynamics. The optimization is performed by restructuring the free-boundary equilibrium evolution (FBEE) equations into a form where it is computationally efficient to optimize the entire dynamic sequence. GSPulse can solve for hundreds of equilibria simultaneously within a few minutes. GSPulse has been validated against NSTX-U and MAST-U experiments and against SPARC feedback control simulations, and is being used to perform scenario design for SPARC. The computed trajectories can be used as feedforward inputs to inform and improve feedback performance. The code for GSPulse is available open-source at https://github.com/jwai-cfs/GSPulse_public.</description>

      <title>In-liquid Plasma Catalysis for Nitrogen Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ammonia, a crucial component in fertilizers and fuels, is currently produced by the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process. However, due to the high upfront investments required for large-scale centralized production, alternative routes for small-scale applications are being sought. We integrate in-liquid plasma with electrocatalysis for ammonia generation via the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Among materials tested, platinum emerged as the most stable and active catalyst - it evolves hydrogen without plasma but produces significant ammonia under cold or hot in-liquid plasma. Our system employs a dual mechanism: plasma activates N2, while the elevated Pt electrode temperature drives water decomposition (thermally and via plasma pathways), releasing reactive hydrogen. This synergy stabilizes key NH intermediates, enabling ammonia production beyond conventional electrocatalysis and eliminating the need for added hydrogen. Under optimized plasma conditions, partial current densities up to 3 mmol h-1 cm-2 at 250 mA cm-2 are achieved. Control measurements across various metals confirm a synergistic plasma-catalysis effect.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of J x B electron acceleration with the micro-structured target and picosecond high-contrast relativistic-intensity laser pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient generation of multi-hundred-keV electrons is essential for isochoric heating and can influence ion acceleration. We investigated electron acceleration from copper-oleate foil targets, either planar or coated with a gold mesh structure (bar width $5,\mu\mathrm{m}$, spacing $7.5,\mu\mathrm{m}$, thickness $\sim6,\mu\mathrm{m}$), irradiated by $1.5$-ps, $350$-J LFEX laser pulses. Two laser-contrast conditions were examined: high ($\sim10^{10}$, with a plasma mirror) and low ($\sim10^{8}$, without a plasma mirror). Using Cu-K$_\alpha$ emission mapping, we found that under high-contrast irradiation the micro-structured target enhanced the laser-to-electron conversion efficiency from $4.9\%$ to $14\%$, attributed to multiple internal reflections that strengthen $J\times B$ acceleration. In contrast, under low-contrast conditions the structures were filled with pre-plasma before the main pulse, and no enhancement was observed. These results demonstrate that both fine-scale structuring and high contrast are crucial for maximizing $J\times B$-driven electron generation in laser-plasma interactions. Our findings suggest a practical approach to improving laser-plasma coupling efficiency by exploiting micro-structured surfaces and contrast-controlled irradiation.</description>

      <title>Generation of high power spatially-structured laser pulses via forward Raman amplification in plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially-structured light with tunable intensity, wavelength, and spatiotemporal profiles has demonstrated significant potentials for fundamental and applied science, including the ultrafast and high-field physics. Nevertheless, the generation or amplification of such light towards extremely high power remains challenging due to the limitations of conventional gain media. Building upon our recently proposed forward Raman amplification (FRA) mechanism [Lei et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 255001 (2025)], here we develop a universal plasma-based amplification scheme that is capable of generating high-power structured laser beams, including vortex, Bessel, and Airy beams. Through theoretical modeling and multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that a near-infrared structured seed laser with an initial intensity of 1e12 W/cm2 can achieve 1e4~1e5-fold intensity amplification via FRA, and subsequently be self-compressed to sub-cycle duration with petawatt-level peak power. Benefiting from its exceptionally high amplification growth rate, the FRA process requires only femtosecond-scale interaction time and submillimeter propagation distance in plasma, effectively suppressing concomitant plasma instabilities. The high output intensity 1e17 W/cm2, compactness (&lt;500 um), high temporal contrast, universal applicability to diverse structured beams, and relatively easy implementation with the co-propagating configuration combine to make the FRA a disruptive approach to the generation of petawatt-class spatially-structured light, enabling unprecedented applications in high-field physics and ultrafast science.</description>

      <title>Decoupling acceleration and wiggling in a laser-produced Betatron source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Betatron radiation is produced in Laser Plasma Accelerators when the electrons are accelerated and simultaneously wiggle across the propagation axis. The mechanisms of electron acceleration and X-ray radiation production follow different scaling laws, and the brightest X-ray radiation is often produced for an electron beam with a lower quality in terms of energy and divergence. Here, we report a laser-driven Betatron X-ray source where the plasma density profile is tailored in order to separate the acceleration and wiggler stages, which allows for the independent optimizations of acceleration and X-ray production. We demonstrate this concept experimentally, and show that the Betatron photon energy can be controlled by adjusting the length of the plasma wiggler. This scheme offers a path to overcome the limitations of conventional Betatron sources, enabling the production of bright, stable, energetic, and collimated X-ray beams.</description>

      <title>Critical gradient optimization for quasi-isodynamic stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new and updated methods for reducing transport caused by electrostatic ion temperature gradient (ITG) driven turbulence in quasi-isodynamic (QI) configurations. We first show an updated model for the threshold (critical) gradient of localized toroidal ITG modes. It is then argued that it is desirable for ITG modes to "split" and localize in separate curvature drift wells, which is leveraged to produce a six-field-period QI configuration with a high critical gradient. We show that the destabilizing effect of kinetic electrons (Costello &amp; Plunk 2025a) on localized ITG modes can be minimized in a magnetic field structure, which we dub "inverse mirror". Applying a general optimization target that improves ITG stability above the critical gradient yields an inverse mirror configuration, which produces heat fluxes below or equal to the W7-X high mirror configuration for a range of applied density gradients.</description>

      <title>Metriplectic bracket for guiding-center Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metriplectic formulation of collisional guiding-center Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau theory is presented. The guiding-center Landau collision operator, which describes collisions involving test-particle and field-particle guiding-center orbits, is represented in terms of a symmetric dissipative bracket involving functional derivatives of the guiding-center Vlasov phase-space density $F_{\rm gc}$ and the electromagnetic fields $({\bf D}_{\rm gc},{\bf B})$, where the guiding-center displacement vector ${\bf D}_{\rm gc} \equiv {\bf E} + 4\pi\,{\sf P}_{\rm gc}$ is expressed in terms of the electric field ${\bf E}$ and the guiding-center polarization ${\sf P}_{\rm gc}$. This dissipative Landau bracket conserves guiding-center energy-momentum and angular momentum, as well as satisfying a guiding-center H-theorem.</description>
