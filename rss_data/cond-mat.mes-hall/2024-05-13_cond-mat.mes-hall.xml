      <title>Gate Tunable Asymmetric Ozone Adsorption on Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular adsorption is pivotal in device fabrication and material synthesis for quantum technology. However, elucidating the behavior of physisorption poses technical challenges. Here graphene with ultrahigh sensitivity was utilized to detect ozone adsorption at cryogenic temperatures. Significant hole doping observed in graphene indicates a strong interaction between ozone and graphene. Interestingly, the adsorption exhibits asymmetry with positive and negative gate voltages. The strong affinity of ozone provides a tool to modulate materials and devices, while the gate tunability of adsorption offers new insights into construction and manipulation of oxide quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Exploring Entanglement Spectrum and Phase Diagram in multi-electron Quantum Dot Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties in semiconductor quantum dot systems modeled by extended Hubbard model, focusing on the impact of potential energy variations and electron interactions within a four-site quantum dot spin chain. Our study explores local and pairwise entanglement across configurations with electron counts N=4 and N=6, under different potential energy settings. By adjusting the potential energy in specific dots and examining the entanglement across various interaction regimes, we identify significant variations in the ground states of quantum dots. Our results reveal that local potential modifications lead to notable redistributions of electron configurations, significantly affecting the entanglement properties. These changes are depicted in phase diagrams that show entanglement dependencies on interaction strengths and potential energy adjustments, highlighting complex entanglement dynamics and phase transitions triggered by inter-dot interactions.</description>

      <title>Fluorescent Graphene Quantum Dots-Enhanced Machine Learning for Accurate Detection and Quantification of Hg2+ and Fe3+ in Real Water Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective, accurate, fast, and with minimal usage of instrumentation has become paramount nowadays in areas of environmental monitoring. Here, we chemically modified fluorescent graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and trained a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for the selective quantification of Hg2+ and Fe3+ ions present within real water samples. The probe is obtained by an electrosynthesis of CVD graphene in the presence of urea, followed by the functionalization with 1-nitroso-2-naphthol (NN). The functionalization with NN moieties dramatically improve selectivity and sensitivity toward Hg2+ and Fe3+, as demonstrated by LODs as low as 0.001 mg L-1 and 0.003 mg L-1; respectively. Time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) reveals that the NN molecules within the GQDs are responsible of the florescence emission of the probe. The emission spectra profiles exhibited distinct characteristics between Hg2+ and Fe3+ enabling the ML model to precisely quantify and differentiate between both analytes present in natural and drinking waters. The ML results were further validated by measurements via cold vapor-atomic fluorescence spectroscopy and UV-vis spectroscopy. The efficiency of the ML model eliminates the necessity of extensive training values and validations, making it a reliable tool for precisely quantifying the presence of Fe and Hg ions in real water samples.</description>

      <title>Observation of a $p$-orbital higher-order topological insulator phase in puckered lattice acoustic metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The puckered lattice geometry, along with $p$-orbitals is often overlooked in the study of topological physics. Here, we investigate the higher-order topology of the $p_{x,y}$-orbital bands in acoustic metamaterials using a simplified two-dimensional phosphorene lattice which possesses a puckered structure. Notably, unlike the $s$-orbital bands in planar lattices, the unique higher-order topology observed here is specific to $p$-orbitals and the puckered geometry due to the unusual hopping patterns induced by them. {Using acoustic pump-probe measurements in metamaterials}, we confirm the emergence of the edge and corner states arising due to the unconventional higher-order topology. We reveal the uniqueness of the higher-order topological physics here via complimentary tight-binding calculations, finite-element simulations, and acoustic experiments. We analyze the underlying physics of the special properties of the edge and corner states in the puckered lattice acoustic metamaterials from the picture of Wannier orbitals. Our work sheds light on the intriguing physics of $p$-orbital topological physics in puckered lattices and acoustic metamaterials which lead to unconventional topological boundary states. \end{abstract}</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch band theory of sub-symmetry-protected topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases relates the non-trivial topological invariant of the bulk to the number of topologically protected boundary states. Recently, a finer classification of SPT phases has been discovered, known as sub-symmetry- protected topological (sub-SPT) phases. In sub- SPT phases, a fraction of the boundary states is protected by the sub-symmetry of the system, even when the full symmetry is broken. While the conventional topological invariant derived from the Bloch band is not applicable to describe the BBC in these systems, we propose to use the non-Bloch topological band theory to describe the BBC of sub-SPT phases. Using the concept of the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ), where Bloch momenta are generalized to take complex values, we show that the non-Bloch band theory naturally gives rise to a non-Bloch topological invariant, establishing the BBC in both SPT and sub-SPT phases. In a one-dimensional system, we define the winding number, whose physical meaning corresponds to the reflection amplitude in the scattering matrix. Furthermore, the non-Bloch topological invariant characterizes the hidden intrinsic topology of the GBZ under translation symmetry-breaking boundary conditions. The topological phase transitions are characterized by the generalized momenta touching the GBZ, which accompanies the emergence of diabolic or band-touching points. Additionally, we discuss the BBCs in the presence of local or global full-symmetry or sub-symmetry-breaking deformations.</description>

      <title>Robust field-free switching using large unconventional spin-orbit torque in an all-van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging all-van der Waals (vdW) magnetic heterostructure provides a new platform to control the magnetization by the electric field beyond the traditional spintronics devices. One promising strategy is using unconventional spin-orbit torque (SOT) exerted by the out-of-plane polarized spin current to enable deterministic magnetization switching and enhance the switching efficiency. However, in all-vdW heterostructures, large unconventional SOT remains elusive and the robustness of the field-free switching against external magnetic field hasn't been examined, which hinder further applications. Here we demonstrate the field-free switching in an all-vdW heterostructure combining a type-II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 and above-room-temperature ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. The fully field-free switching can be achieved at 2.56 x 10^10 A per m2 at 300K and a large SOT efficiency of the out-of-plane polarized spin current generated by TaIrTe4 is determined to be 0.37. Moreover, we find that the switching polarity cannot be changed until the external in-plane magnetic field reaches 252mT, indicating a robust switching against the magnetic field. The numerical simulation suggests the large unconventional SOT reduces the switching current density and enhances the robustness of the switching. Our work shows that all-vdW heterostructures are promising candidates for future highly efficient and stable SOT-based devices.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a graphene-hBN superlattice field effect transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene is a unique platform to naturally host a high quality 2D electron system. With hBN encapsulation to protect the graphene from the noisy environment, it has a potential to realize ultrahigh performance nanodevices, such as photodiodes and transistors. However, absence of a band gap at Dirac point poses challenges in using the system as a useful transistor. In this study, we investigate the functionality of a hBN-aligned monolayer graphene as a field effect transistor (FET). By precisely aligning the hBN and graphene, the band gaps open at the first Dirac point and at the hole-doped induced Dirac point via an interfacial moire potential. To characterize as a submicron scale FET, we fabricated a global bottom gate to tune the density of a conducting channel and a local top gate to switch-off the channel, demonstrating that this system can be tuned at an optimal on/off ratio regime by controlling the gates separately. These findings will present a useful reference point for further development of the FETs based on graphene heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Topological phase diagram of the Haldane model on a Bishamon-kikko--honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological flat bands have gained extensive interest as a platform for exploring the interplay between nontrivial band topology and correlation effects. In recent studies, strongly correlated phenomena originating from a topological flat band were discussed on a periodically 1/6-depleted honeycomb lattice, but the fundamental topological nature associated with this lattice structure remains unexplored. Here we study the band structure and topological phase diagram for the Haldane model on this lattice, which we call the Bishamon-kikko lattice. We also extend our study to the model connecting the Bishamon-kikko and honeycomb lattices. We show that these models exhibit richer topological characteristics compared to the original Haldane model on the honeycomb lattice, such as topological insulating states with higher Chern numbers, metallic states with nontrivial band topology even at commensurate electron fillings, and metal-insulator transitions between them.7 Our findings offer a playground of correlated topological phenomena and stimulate their realization in a variety of two-dimensional systems, such as van der Waals materials, graphene nanostructures, and photonic crystals.</description>

      <title>Levitons in correlated nano-scale systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: in nanoscale systems in the presence of single-electron excitations generated by Lorentzian voltage drives, termed \textit{Levitons}. These excitations allow to realize the analog of quantum optics experiments using electrons instead of photons. Importantly, electrons in condensed matter systems are strongly affected by the presence of different types of non-trivial correlations, with no counterpart in the domain of photonic quantum optics. After providing a short introduction about Levitons in non-interacting systems, we focus on how they operate in the presence of two types of strong electronic correlations in nanoscale systems, such as those arising in the fractional quantum Hall effect or in superconducting systems. Specifically, we consider Levitons in a quantum Hall bar of the fractional quantum Hall effect, pinched by a quantum point contact, where anyons with fractional charge and statistics tunnel between opposite edges. In this case, a Leviton-Leviton interaction can be induced by the strongly correlated background. Concerning the effect of superconducting correlations on Levitons, we show that, in a normal metal system coupled to BCS superconductors, half integer Levitons minimize the excess noise in the Andreev regime. Interestingly, energy-entangled electron states can be realized on-demand in this type of hybrid setups by exploiting crossed Andreev reflection. The results exposed in this review have potential applications in the context of quantum information and computation with single-electron flying qubits.</description>

      <title>Lateral plasmonic superlattice in strongly dissipative regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate transmission coefficient, $\mathcal T,$ of terahertz radiation through lateral plasmonic superlattice with a unit cell consisting of two regions with different plasma wave velocities, $s_1$ and $s_2$ ($s_1 &gt; s_2$). We generalize theory developed earlier for resonant case to the non-resonant regime, when the scattering rate, $\gamma,$ is large compared to fundamental gate-tunable frequencies $\omega_{1,2}$ of plasma oscillations in both regions. We find that absorption, and consequently $\mathcal T$, strongly depends on density modulation amplitude and on the frequency of the incoming radiation. We describe evolution of the absorption with increasing of radiation frequency from the quasi-static regime of very low frequency to the high-frequency regime, identify several dissipation regimes and find analytical expression for absorption, and, accordingly, for $\mathcal T,$ in these regimes. A general phase diagram of non-resonant regime in the plane $(\omega,\omega_2)$ for fixed $\omega_1$ is constructed. Most importantly, $\mathcal T$ sharply depends on the gate voltages and frequency. In particular, for $\omega_2 \ll \omega_1,$ $\mathcal T$ strongly varies on the very small frequency scale, $\delta \omega \ll \gamma,$ determined by the Maxwell relaxation, $\delta \omega \sim \omega_1^2/\gamma,$ so that the superlattice shows high responsivity within the frequency band $\delta \omega.$</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quasiparticle states and nonlocal correlations of a hybrid structure, comprising two quantum dots interconnected through a short-length topological superconducting nanowire hosting overlaping Majorana modes. We show that the hybridization between different components of this setup gives rise to the emergence of molecular states, which are responsible for nonlocal correlations. We inspect the resulting energy structure, focusing on the inter-dependence between the quasiparticles of individual quantum dots. We predict the existence of nonlocal effects, which could be accessed and probed by crossed Andreev reflection spectroscopy. Our study would be relevant to a recent experimental realization of the minimal Kitaev model [T. Dvir et al., Nature 614, 445 (2023)], by considering its hybrid structure with side-attached quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Biaxial strain effects in 2D diamond formation from graphene stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering innovative methods to understand phase transitions, modify phase diagrams, and uncover novel synthesis routes poses significant and far-reaching challenges. In this study, we demonstrate the formation of nanodiamond-like sp3 carbon from few-layer graphene (FLG) stacks at room temperature and relatively low transition pressure (~7.0 GPa) due to chemical interaction with water and physical biaxial strain induced by substrate compression. By employing resonance Raman and optical absorption spectroscopies at high-pressure on FLG systems, utilizing van der Waals heterostructures (hBN/FLG) on different substrates (SiO2/Si and diamond), we originally unveiled the key role of biaxial strain. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations corroborates the pivotal role of both water and biaxial strain in locally stabilizing sp3 carbon structures at the graphene-ice interface. This breakthrough directly enhances nanodiamond technology but also establishes biaxial strain engineering as a promising tool to explore novel phases of 2D nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Interlayer couplings in homobilayer structures of MSi2X4 (M = Mo/W, X = N/P/As)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the interlayer coupling effect in homobilayer structures of MSi2X4 with M = Mo/W and X = N/P/As. Through the combination of first-principles calculations and analytical formulations, the equilibrium interlayer distance, layer energy difference and interlayer hopping strength are obtained for all six MSi2X4 materials, which are found to be insensitive to the type of M atom but differ significantly between X = N and X = P/As. In homobilayers with close to 0{\deg} twist angles, the interlayer charge redistribution introduces a stacking-dependent interlayer electrostatic potential with a magnitude reaching 0.1 eV in MSi2N4, suggesting that it can be an excellent candidate for studying the sliding ferroelectricity. The interlayer hopping strengths are found to be as large as several tens meV at valence band maxima positions K and {\Gamma}, and ~ 1 meV at the conduction band edge K. The resultant layer-hybridizations vary in a large range under different stacking registries, which can be used to simulate honeycomb lattice models with both trivial and non-trivial band topologies.</description>

      <title>Parsing skin effect in a non-Hermitian spinless BHZ-like model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work comprehensively investigates the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a spinless Bernevig- Hughes-Zhang (BHZ)-like model in one dimension. It is generally believed that a system with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes demonstrates NHSE. However, we show that there are exceptions, and more in-depth analyses are required to decode the presence of NHSE or its variants in a system. The fascinating aspects of our findings, depending on the inclusion of non-reciprocity in the inter-orbital hopping terms, concede the existence of conventional NHSE or NHSE at both edges and even a surprising absence of NHSE. The topological properties and the (bi-orthogonal) bulk-boundary correspondence, enumerated via computation of the (complex) Berry phase and spatial localization of the edge modes, highlight the topological phase transitions occurring therein. Further, to facilitate a structured discussion of the non-Hermitian model, we split the results into PT symmetric and non-PT symmetric cases with a view to comparing the two.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Chiral Symmetry and Symmetry-Class Conversion in Floquet Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss properties with no static counterpart arising in Floquet topological insulators with a dynamical chiral symmetry (DCS), i.e., a chiral symmetry which is present while driving. We explore the topological properties of Floquet insulators possessing a DCS which either does or does not survive upon taking the static limit. We consider the case of harmonic drives and employ a general framework using the quasi-energy operator in frequency space. We find that for a DCS with no static analog, the presence of driving has a negligible impact on the topological phases associated with zero quasi-energy. In stark contrast, topological gaps can open at $\pi$ quasi-energy and mainly occur at momenta where the driving perturbation vanishes. We confirm the above general predictions for an extended Kitaev chain model in the BDI symmetry class. Another possibility that opens up when adding the drive, while preserving chiral symmetry, is symmetry-class conversion. We demonstrate such an effect for a static CI class Hamiltonian which is topologically trivial in 1D. By considering a suitable driving, we obtain a CI$\rightarrow$AIII transition, which now enables the system to harbor topological $\pi$-modes. Notably, the arising topological phases strongly depend on whether the DCS has a static analog or not. Our results bring Floquet insulators with nonstandard DCS forward as ideal candidate platforms for engineering and manipulating topological $\pi$-modes.</description>

      <title>Preservation of scalar spin chirality across a metallic spacer in synthetic antiferromagnets with chiral interlayer interactions</title>

Abstract: Chiral magnetic textures are key for the development of modern spintronic devices. In multilayered thin films, these are typically stabilized via the interfacial intralayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Additionally, it has been recently observed that DMI may also promote vector spin chirality along the third dimension, coupling spins in different magnetic layers via non-magnetic spacer layers, an effect referred to as interlayer DMI (IL-DMI). This interaction holds promise for 3D nanomagnetism, from the creation of 3D spin structures such as hopfions to new forms of magnetic functionality in the vertical direction via remote control of chiral spin states. Here, we investigate via magnetic X-ray scattering and imaging techniques the chiral nature of orthogonal magnetic states that form in a synthetic antiferromagnet with IL-DMI. We find that the vector spin chirality of the textures formed in an in-plane layer is determined by the net out-of-plane spin configuration of a neighboring layer, leading as a result to complex spin states across a metallic interface where the overall scalar spin chirality is preserved. This work thus uncovers a new flavor of chiral interlayer interactions, demonstrating new ways to control magnetic chirality in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Creation and Manipulation of Higher-Order Topological States by Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to implement tunable higher-order topological states in a heterojunction consisting of a two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator and the recently discovered altermagnets, whose unique spin-polarization in both real and reciprocal space and null magnetization are in contrast to conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Based on symmetry analysis and effective edge theory, we show that the special spin splitting in altermagnets with different symmetries, such as $d$-wave, can introduce Dirac mass terms with opposite signs on the adjacent boundaries of the topological insulator, resulting in the higher-order topological state with mass-domain bound corner states. Moreover, by adjusting the direction of the N\'{e}el vector, we can manipulate such topological corner states by moving their positions. By first-principles calculations, taking a 2D topological insulator bismuthene with a square lattice on an altermagnet MnF$_2$ as an example, we demonstrate the feasibility of creating and manipulating the higher-order topological states through altermagnets. Finally, we discuss the experimental implementation and detection of the tunable topological corner states, as well as the potential non-Abelian braiding of the Dirac corner fermions.</description>

      <title>Variational manifolds for ground states and scarred dynamics of blockade-constrained spin models on two and three dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variational manifold of simple tensor network states for the study of a family of constrained models that describe spin-1/2 systems as realized by Rydberg atom arrays. Our manifold permits analytical calculation via perturbative expansion of one- and two-point functions in arbitrary spatial dimensions and allows for efficient computation of the matrix elements required for variational energy minimization and variational time evolution in up to three dimensions. We apply this framework to the PXP model on the hypercubic lattice in 1D, 2D, and 3D, and show that, in each case, it exhibits quantum phase transitions breaking the sub-lattice symmetry in equilibrium, and hosts quantum many body scars out of equilibrium. We demonstrate that our variational ansatz qualitatively captures all these phenomena and predicts key quantities with an accuracy that increases with the dimensionality of the lattice, and conclude that our method can be interpreted as a generalization of mean-field theory to constrained spin models.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect in junctions of superconductors with band asymmetric metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14084v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At interfaces connecting two superconductors (SCs) separated by a metallic layer, an electric current is induced when there is a disparity in the phases of the two superconductors. We elucidate this phenomenon based on the weights of the Andreev bound states associated with the states carrying current in forward and reverse directions. Typically, current phase relation (CPR) in Josephson junctions is an odd function. When time reversal and inversion symmetries are broken at the junction, CPR ceases to be an odd function and the system may exhibit Josephson diode effect. This phenomenon has been studied in spin orbit coupled systems under an external Zeeman field wherein the magnetochiral anisotropy is responsible for the Josephson diode effect. Recently introduced the band asymmetric metal (BAM) model presents a novel avenue, featuring an asymmetric band structure. We investigate DC Josephson effect in SC-BAM-SC junctions and find that band asymmetry can lead to Josephson diode effect and anomalous Josephson effect. We explain the mechanism behind these effects based on interference of plane wave modes within the Bogoliubov de-Genne formalism. We calculate diode effect coefficient for different values of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport of confined water molecules in quasi-one-dimensional nanotubes</title>

Abstract: Dimensions and molecular structure play pivotal roles in the principle of heat conduction. The dimensional characteristics of solution within nanoscale systems depend on the degrees of confinement. However, the influence of such variations on heat transfer remains inadequately understood. Here, we perform quasi-one-dimensional non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the thermal conductivity of water molecules confined in carbon nanotubes. The structure of water molecules is determined depending on the nanotube radius, forming a single-file, a single-layer, and a double-layer structure, corresponding to an increasing radius order. We reveal that the thermal conductivity of liquid water has a sublinear dependency on nanotube length exclusively when water molecules form a single file. Stronger confinement leads to behavioral and structural characteristics closely resembling a one-dimensional nature. Moreover, single-layer-structured water molecules exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity. We elucidate that this is due to the increase in the local water density and the absence of transitions to another layer, which typically occurs in systems with double-layer water structures within relatively large radius nanotubes.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale CMOS-compatible graphene Josephson field-effect transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrostatically tunable Josephson field-effect transistors (JoFETs) are one of the most desired building blocks of quantum electronics. JoFET applications range from parametric amplifiers and superconducting qubits to a variety of integrated superconducting circuits. Here, we report on graphene JoFET devices fabricated with wafer-scale complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible processing based on wet transfer of chemical vapour deposited graphene, atomic-layer-deposited Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ gate oxide, and evaporated superconducting Ti/Al source, drain, and gate contacts. By optimizing the contact resistance down to $\sim$ 170 $\Omega \mu m$, we observe proximity-induced superconductivity in the JoFET channels with different gate lengths of 150 - 350 nm. The Josephson junction devices show reproducible critical current $I_{\text{C}}$ tunablity with the local top gate. Our JoFETs are in short diffusive limit with the $I_{\text{C}}$ reaching up to $\sim\,$3 $\mu A$ for a 50 $\mu m$ channel width. Overall, our demonstration of CMOS-compatible 2D-material-based JoFET fabrication process is an important step toward graphene-based integrated quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Generation of multiple bound states in the continuum through doubly degenerate quasi-guided modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed theoretical analysis of a peculiar generation of multiple bound states in the continuum (BICs) in two-dimensional periodic arrays of dielectric spheres. They emerge in high-symmetry lattices with the $C_{6v}$ and $C_{4v}$ point groups and involve doubly degenerate quasi-guided modes at the $\Gamma$ point that can couple to external radiation. By tuning a system parameter, the doubly degenerate modes can exhibit accidental BICs at a critical parameter. In the vicinity of the critical parameter, the two bands originating from the degenerate mode exhibit multiple off-$\Gamma$ BICs. They move and annihilate across the two bands by changing the parameter around the critical one. A ring-like high $Q$ channel pinned with multiple BICs emerges particularly for the $C_{6v}$ case. Across the critical coupling, the total vorticity of the multiple BICs is conserved. The $\vb*{k}\cdot\vb*{p}$ perturbation theory explains some features of the phenomena reasonably well.</description>
