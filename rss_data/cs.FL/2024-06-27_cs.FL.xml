      <title>Regular Expressions with Backreferences on Multiple Context-Free Languages, and the Closed-Star Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backreference is a well-known practical extension of regular expressions and most modern programming languages, such as Java, Python, JavaScript and more, support regular expressions with backreferences (rewb) in their standard libraries for string processing. A difficulty of backreference is non-regularity: unlike some other extensions, backreference strictly enhances the expressive power of regular expressions and thus rewbs can describe non-regular (in fact, even non-context-free) languages. In this paper, we investigate the expressive power of rewbs by comparing rewbs to multiple context-free languages (MCFL) and parallel multiple context-free languages (PMCFL). First, we prove that the language class of rewbs is a proper subclass of unary-PMCFLs. The class of unary-PMCFLs coincides with that of EDT0L languages, and our result strictly improves the known upper bound of rewbs. Additionally, we show that, however, the language class of rewbs is not contained in that of MCFLs even when restricted to rewbs with only one capturing group and no captured references. Therefore, in general, the parallelism seems essential for rewbs. Backed by these results, we define a novel syntactic condition on rewbs that we call closed-star and observe that it provides an upper bound on the number of times a rewb references the same captured string. The closed-star condition allows dispensing with the parallelism: that is, we prove that the language class of closed-star rewbs falls inside the class of unary-MCFLs, which is equivalent to that of EDT0L systems of finite index. Furthermore, as additional evidence for the robustness of the condition, we show that the language class of closed-star rewbs also falls inside the class of nonerasing stack languages (NESL).</description>

      <title>The single-use restriction for register automata and transducers over infinite alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis studies the single-use restriction for register automata and transducers over infinite alphabets. The restriction requires that a read-access to a register should have the side effect of destroying its contents. This constraint results in robust classes of languages and transductions. For automata models, we show that one-way register automata, two-way register automata, and orbit-finite monoids have the same expressive power. For transducer models, we show that single-use Mealy machines and single-use two-way transducers admit versions of the Krohn-Rhodes decomposition theorem. Moreover, single-use Mealy machines are equivalent to an algebraic model called local algebraic semigroup transductions. Additionally, we show that single-use two-way transducers are equivalent to single-use streaming string transducers (SSTs) over infinite alphabets and to regular list functions with atoms.
  Compared with the previous work arXiv:1907.10504, this thesis offers a coherent narrative on the single-use restriction. We introduce an abstract notion of single-use functions and use them to define all the discussed single-use models. We also introduce and study the algebraic models of local semigroup transduction and local rational semigroup transduction.</description>

      <title>On Transition Constructions for Automata -- A Categorical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transition monoid construction for deterministic automata in a categorical setting and establish it as an adjunction. We pair this adjunction with two other adjunctions to obtain two endofunctors on deterministic automata, a comonad and a monad, which are closely related, respectively, to the largest set of equations and the smallest set of coequations satisfied by an automaton. Furthermore, we give similar transition algebra constructions for lasso and {\Omega}-automata, and show that they form adjunctions. We present some initial results on sets of equations and coequations for lasso automata.</description>

      <title>The Repetition Threshold for Rote Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Rote words, which are infinite binary words with factor complexity $2n$. We prove that the repetition threshold for this class is $5/2$. Our technique is purely computational, using the Walnut theorem prover and a new technique for generating automata from morphisms due to the first author and his co-authors.</description>
