      <title>A survey on combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey revisits classical combinatorial optimization algorithms and extends them to two-stage stochastic models, particularly focusing on client-element problems. We reformulate these problems to optimize element selection under uncertainty and present two key sampling algorithms: SSA and Boost-and-Sample, highlighting their performance guarantees. Additionally, we explore correlation-robust optimization, introducing the concept of the correlation gap, which enables approximations using independent distributions with minimal accuracy loss. This survey analyzes and presents foundational combinatorial optimization methods for researchers at the intersection of this field and reinforcement learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimal filtering problem for a interacting particle system generated by stochastic differential equations with interaction. By using Malliavin calculus, we construct the differential equation of the covariance process and transform the filter problem to an optimal control problem. Finally we give the necessary condition that the coefficient of the optimal filter should satisfy</description>

      <title>Modelling and analysis of multi-timescale uncertainty in energy system planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in decomposition methods for multi-stage stochastic programming with block separable recourse enable the solution to large-scale stochastic programs with multi-timescale uncertainty. Multi-timescale uncertainty is important in energy system planning problems. Therefore, the proposed algorithms were applied to energy system planning problems to demonstrate their performance. However, the impact of multi-timescale uncertainty on energy system planning is not sufficiently analysed. In this paper, we address this research gap by comprehensively modelling and analysing short-term and long-term uncertainty in energy system planning. We use the REORIENT model to conduct the analysis. We also propose a parallel stabilised Benders decomposition as an alternative solution method to existing methods. We analyse the multi-timescale uncertainty regarding stability, the value of the stochastic solution, the rolling horizon value of the stochastic solutions and the planning decisions. The results show that (1) including multi-timescale uncertainty yields an increase in the value of the stochastic solutions, (2) long-term uncertainty in the right-hand side parameters affects the solution structure more than cost coefficient uncertainty, (3) parallel stabilised Benders decomposition is up to 7.5 times faster than the serial version.</description>

      <title>Exact Recovery Guarantees for Parameterized Non-linear System Identification Problem under Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the system identification problem for parameterized non-linear systems using basis functions under adversarial attacks. Motivated by the LASSO-type estimators, we analyze the exact recovery property of a non-smooth estimator, which is generated by solving an embedded $\ell_1$-loss minimization problem. First, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the well-specifiedness of the estimator and the uniqueness of global solutions to the underlying optimization problem. Next, we provide exact recovery guarantees for the estimator under two different scenarios of boundedness and Lipschitz continuity of the basis functions. The non-asymptotic exact recovery is guaranteed with high probability, even when there are more severely corrupted data than clean data. Finally, we numerically illustrate the validity of our theory. This is the first study on the sample complexity analysis of a non-smooth estimator for the non-linear system identification problem.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Joint Chance-Constrained Optimization for Electricity Imbalance in Iran: Integrating Renewables and Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iran's power grid faces mounting challenges due to the widening gap between rapidly increasing peak demand and lagging sustainable capacity expansion or load management. Prosumers have become key players in reducing grid load and offering valuable flexible services, but their effectiveness is hampered by a lack of knowledge about uncertain parameters and their probability distributions. This study introduces a novel two-stage multi-time scale distributionally robust optimization framework integrated with joint chance constraints to effectively manage the operation of prosumers and their energy sharing to mitigate overall peak load imbalances under uncertainties. In a data-driven setting and by leveraging historical data, the proposed model is reformulated as a tractable second-order conic constrained quadratic programing (SOCP). By considering real-world complexities based on realistic-data such as diverse load profiles and intermittent renewable generation, our approach demonstrates enhanced energy management system performance, even in out-of-sample scenarios. The synergy of distributed energy resources and coordinated flexibility within the network is instrumental in achieving substantial reductions in peak load and improving grid resilience.</description>

      <title>Optimal control problem of evolution equation governed by hypergraph Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an optimal control problem of an ordinary differential inclusion governed by the hypergraph Laplacian, which is defined as a subdifferential of a convex function and then is a set-valued operator. We can assure the existence of optimal control for a suitable cost function by using methods of a priori estimates established in the previous studies. However, due to the multivaluedness of the hypergraph Laplacian, it seems to be difficult to derive the necessary optimality condition for this problem. To cope with this difficulty, we introduce an approximation operator based on the approximation method of the hypergraph, so-called ``clique expansion.'' We first consider the optimality condition of the approximation problem with the clique expansion of the hypergraph Laplacian and next discuss the convergence to the original problem. In appendix, we state some basic properties of the clique expansion of the hypergraph Laplacian for future works.</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Interaction Dynamics with Dual Model Predictive Control for Multi-Agent Systems Using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized control in complex and uncertain multi-agent scenarios requires careful consideration of the interactions between the agents. In this context, this paper proposes a dual model predictive control (MPC) method using Gaussian process (GP) models for multi-agent systems. While Gaussian process MPC (GP-MPC) has been shown to be effective in predicting the dynamics of other agents, current methods do not consider the influence of the control input on the covariance of the predictions, and, hence, lack the dual control effect. Therefore, we propose a dual MPC that directly optimizes the actions of the ego agent, and the belief of the other agents by jointly optimizing their state trajectories as well as the associated covariance while considering their interactions through a GP. We demonstrate our GP-MPC method in a simulation study on autonomous driving, showing improved prediction quality compared to a baseline stochastic MPC. Simulation results show that our GP-MPC can learn the interactions between agents online, demonstrating the potential of GPs for dual MPC in uncertain and unseen scenarios.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Free Method for Heavily Constrained Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) method has been shown to be a powerful method for solving the optimization problem where explicit expression of the gradients is difficult or infeasible to obtain. Recently, due to the practical value of the constrained problems, a lot of ZO Frank-Wolfe or projected ZO methods have been proposed. However, in many applications, we may have a very large number of nonconvex white/black-box constraints, which makes the existing zeroth-order methods extremely inefficient (or even not working) since they need to inquire function value of all the constraints and project the solution to the complicated feasible set. In this paper, to solve the nonconvex problem with a large number of white/black-box constraints, we proposed a doubly stochastic zeroth-order gradient method (DSZOG) with momentum method and adaptive step size. Theoretically, we prove DSZOG can converge to the $\epsilon$-stationary point of the constrained problem. Experimental results in two applications demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of training time and accuracy compared with other ZO methods for the constrained problem.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Prosumer Networks for Peak Load Management in Iran: A Distributed Contextual Stochastic Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renewable prosumers face the complex challenge of balancing self-sufficiency with seamless grid and market integration. This paper introduces a novel prosumers network framework aimed at mitigating peak loads in Iran, particularly under the uncertainties inherent in renewable energy generation and demand. A cost-oriented integrated prediction and optimization approach is proposed, empowering prosumers to make informed decisions within a distributed contextual stochastic optimization (DCSO) framework. The problem is formulated as a bi-level two-stage multi-time scale optimization to determine optimal operation and interaction strategies under various scenarios, considering flexible resources. To facilitate grid integration, a novel consensus-based contextual information sharing mechanism is proposed. This approach enables coordinated collective behaviors and leverages contextual data more effectively. The overall problem is recast as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) by incorporating optimality conditions and linearizing complementarity constraints. Additionally, a distributed algorithm using the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is presented for computational tractability and privacy preservation. Numerical results highlights that integrating prediction with optimization and implementing a contextual information-sharing network among prosumers significantly reduces peak loads as well as total costs.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Control Approach for Inverse Problems with Deep Learnable Regularizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an optimal control framework to address the inverse problem using a learned regularizer, with applications in image reconstruction. We build upon the concept of Learnable Optimization Algorithms (LOA), which combine deep learning with traditional optimization schemes to improve convergence and stability in image reconstruction tasks such as CT and MRI. Our approach reformulates the inverse problem as a variational model where the regularization term is parameterized by a deep neural network (DNN). By viewing the parameter learning process as an optimal control problem, we leverage Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) to derive necessary conditions for optimality. We propose the Method of Successive Approximations (MSA) to iteratively solve the control problem, optimizing both the DNN parameters and the reconstructed image. Additionally, we introduce an augmented reverse-state method to enhance memory efficiency without compromising the convergence guarantees of the LOA framework.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Optimization-Based Period Estimation with Outliers and Missing Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the frequency estimation of periodic signals using noisy time-of-arrival (TOA) information with missing (sparse) data contaminated with outliers. We tackle the problem from a mathematical optimization standpoint, formulating it as a linear regression with an unknown increasing integer independent variable and outliers. Assuming an upper bound on the variance of the noise, we derive an online, parallelizable, near-CRLB optimization-based algorithm amortized to a linear complexity. We demonstrate the outstanding robustness of our algorithm to noise and outliers by testing it against diverse randomly generated signals. Our algorithm handles outliers by design and yields precise estimations even with up to 20% of contaminated data.</description>

      <title>Optimality conditions and subdifferential calculus for infinite sums of functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we extend the widely used in optimization theory decoupling techniques to infinite collections of functions. Extended concepts of uniform lower semicontinuity and firm uniform lower semicontinuity as well as the new concepts of weak uniform lower semicontinuity and robust infimum are discussed. We study the uniform and robust minimum, and provide conditions under which these minimality concepts reduce to the conventional one. The main theorem gives fuzzy subdifferential necessary conditions (multiplier rules) for a quasiuniform local minimum of the sum of an infinite collection of functions without the traditional Lipschitz continuity assumptions. We consider a general infinite convex optimization problem, and develop a methodology for closing the duality gap and guaranteeing strong duality. In this setting, application of the fuzzy multiplier and sum rules for infinite sums produces general optimality conditions/multiplier rules.</description>

      <title>Average-case optimization analysis for distributed consensus algorithms on regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The consensus problem in distributed computing involves a network of agents aiming to compute the average of their initial vectors through local communication, represented by an undirected graph. This paper focuses on the studying of this problem using an average-case analysis approach, particularly over regular graphs. Traditional algorithms for solving the consensus problem often rely on worst-case performance evaluation scenarios, which may not reflect typical performance in real-world applications. Instead, we apply average-case analysis, focusing on the expected spectral distribution of eigenvalues to obtain a more realistic view of performance. Key contributions include deriving the optimal method for consensus on regular graphs, showing its relation to the Heavy Ball method, analyzing its asymptotic convergence rate, and comparing it to various first-order methods through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>The landscape of deterministic and stochastic optimal control problems: One-shot Optimization versus Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal control problems can be solved via a one-shot (single) optimization or a sequence of optimization using dynamic programming (DP). However, the computation of their global optima often faces NP-hardness, and thus only locally optimal solutions may be obtained at best. In this work, we consider the discrete-time finite-horizon optimal control problem in both deterministic and stochastic cases and study the optimization landscapes associated with two different approaches: one-shot and DP. In the deterministic case, we prove that each local minimizer of the one-shot optimization corresponds to some control input induced by a locally minimum control policy of DP, and vice versa. However, with a parameterized policy approach, we prove that deterministic and stochastic cases both exhibit the desirable property that each local minimizer of DP corresponds to some local minimizer of the one-shot optimization, but the converse does not necessarily hold. Nonetheless, under different technical assumptions for deterministic and stochastic cases, if there exists only a single locally minimum control policy, one-shot and DP turn out to capture the same local solution. These results pave the way to understand the performance and stability of local search methods in optimal control.</description>

      <title>A general framework of Riemannian adaptive optimization methods with a convergence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a general framework of Riemannian adaptive optimization methods. The framework encapsulates several stochastic optimization algorithms on Riemannian manifolds and incorporates the mini-batch strategy that is often used in deep learning. Within this framework, we also propose AMSGrad on embedded submanifolds of Euclidean space. Moreover, we give convergence analyses valid for both a constant and a diminishing step size. Our analyses also reveal the relationship between the convergence rate and mini-batch size. In numerical experiments, we applied the proposed algorithm to principal component analysis and the low-rank matrix completion problem, which can be considered to be Riemannian optimization problems. Python implementations of the methods used in the numerical experiments are available at https://github.com/iiduka-researches/202408-adaptive.</description>

      <title>Multistage Robust Average Randomized Spectral Risk Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the multistage spectral risk minimization models proposed by Philpott et al.~\cite{PdF13} and Guigues and R\"omisch \cite{GuR12} but with some new focuses. We consider a situation where the decision maker's (DM's) risk preferences may be state-dependent or even inconsistent at some states, and consequently there is not a single deterministic spectral risk measure (SRM) which can be used to represent the DM's preferences at each stage. We adopt the recently introduced average randomized SRM (ARSRM) (in \cite{li2022randomization}) to describe the DM's overall risk preference at each stage. To solve the resulting multistage ARSRM (MARSRM) problem, we apply the well-known stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) method which generates a sequence of lower and upper bounds in an iterative manner. Under some moderate conditions, we prove that the optimal solution can be found in a finite number of iterations. The MARSRM model generalizes the one-stage ARSRM and simplifies the existing multistage state-dependent preference robust model \cite{liu2021multistage}, while also encompassing the mainstream multistage risk-neutral and risk-averse optimization models \cite{GuR12,PdF13}. In the absence of complete information on the probability distribution of the DM's random preferences, we propose to use distributionally robust ARSRM (DR-ARSRM) to describe the DM's preferences at each stage. We detail computational schemes for solving both MARSRM and DR-MARSRM. Finally, we examine the performance of MARSRM and DR-MARSRM by applying them to an asset allocation problem with transaction costs and compare them with standard risk neutral and risk averse multistage linear stochastic programming (MLSP) models.</description>

      <title>Generalized Continuous-Time Models for Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has indicated a substantial rise in interest in understanding Nesterov's accelerated gradient methods via their continuous-time models. However, most existing studies focus on specific classes of Nesterov's methods, which hinders the attainment of an in-depth understanding and a unified perspective. To address this deficit, we present generalized continuous-time models that cover a broad range of Nesterov's methods, including those previously studied under existing continuous-time frameworks. Our key contributions are as follows. First, we identify the convergence rates of the generalized models, eliminating the need to determine the convergence rate for any specific continuous-time model derived from them. Second, we show that six existing continuous-time models are special cases of our generalized models, thereby positioning our framework as a unifying tool for analyzing and understanding these models. Third, we design a restart scheme for Nesterov's methods based on our generalized models and show that it ensures a monotonic decrease in objective function values. Owing to the broad applicability of our models, this scheme can be used to a broader class of Nesterov's methods compared to the original restart scheme. Fourth, we uncover a connection between our generalized models and gradient flow in continuous time, showing that the accelerated convergence rates of our generalized models can be attributed to a time reparametrization in gradient flow. Numerical experiment results are provided to support our theoretical analyses and results.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization under Edge Agreement with Application in Battery Network Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a distributed optimization problem under edge agreements, where each agent in the network is also subject to local convex constraints. Generalized from the concept of consensus, a group of edge agreements represents the constraints defined for neighboring agents, with each pair of neighboring agents required to satisfy one edge agreement constraint. Edge agreements are defined locally to allow more flexibility than a global consensus, enabling heterogeneous coordination within the network. This paper proposes a discrete-time algorithm to solve such problems, providing a theoretical analysis to prove its convergence. Additionally, this paper illustrates the connection between the theory of distributed optimization under edge agreements and distributed model predictive control through a distributed battery network energy management problem. This approach enables a new perspective to formulate and solve network control and optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Solving Integrated Process Planning and Scheduling Problem via Graph Neural Network Based Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Integrated Process Planning and Scheduling (IPPS) problem combines process route planning and shop scheduling to achieve high efficiency in manufacturing and maximize resource utilization, which is crucial for modern manufacturing systems. Traditional methods using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and heuristic algorithms can not well balance solution quality and speed when solving IPPS. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method. We model the IPPS problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture the complex relationships among operations, machines, and jobs. To optimize the scheduling strategy, we use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Experimental results show that, compared to traditional methods, our approach significantly improves solution efficiency and quality in large-scale IPPS instances, providing superior scheduling strategies for modern intelligent manufacturing systems.</description>

      <title>On the risk levels of distributionally robust chance constrained problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chance constraints ensure the satisfaction of constraints under uncertainty with a desired probability. This scheme is unfortunately sensitive to assumptions of the probability distribution of the uncertainty, which are difficult to verify. The uncertainty in the probability distribution can be considered via ambiguity sets that include all distributions close to a nominal distribution with respect to different ambiguity metrics. One simple methodology to deal with distributional ambiguity is to solve the original chance constrained problem with a specifically lowered risk level, called perturbed risk level
  In this paper, we compare different ambiguity metrics for which a perturbed risk level exists. The comparison highlights that one particular ambiguity metric is especially well suited to handle low risk levels, which are typically needed in control applications. To approximate the solution of the ambiguous chance constrained problem, we present a general method to achieve distributionally robust bounds with methods like the scenario approach and derive closed-form expressions for the confidence level and one-level probability bounds.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing for Discrete Optimization: A Highlight of Three Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimization has emerged as a promising frontier of quantum computing, providing novel numerical approaches to mathematical optimization problems. The main goal of this paper is to facilitate interdisciplinary research between the Operations Research (OR) and Quantum Computing communities by providing an OR scientist's perspective on selected quantum-powered methods for discrete optimization. To this end, we consider three quantum-powered optimization approaches that make use of different types of quantum hardware available on the market. To illustrate these approaches, we solve three classical optimization problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem, Weighted Maximum Cut, and Maximum Independent Set. With a general OR audience in mind, we attempt to provide an intuition behind each approach along with key references, describe the corresponding high-level workflow, and highlight crucial practical considerations. In particular, we emphasize the importance of problem formulations and device-specific configurations, and their impact on the amount of resources required for computation (where we focus on the number of qubits). These points are illustrated with a series of experiments on three types of quantum computers: a neutral atom machine from QuEra, a quantum annealer from D-Wave, and a gate-based device from IBM.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Iterative Hard Thresholding for Sparse Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For statistical modeling wherein the data regime is unfavorable in terms of dimensionality relative to the sample size, finding hidden sparsity in the ground truth can be critical in formulating an accurate statistical model. The so-called "l0 norm" which counts the number of non-zero components in a vector, is a strong reliable mechanism of enforcing sparsity when incorporated into an optimization problem. However, in big data settings wherein noisy estimates of the gradient must be evaluated out of computational necessity, the literature is scant on methods that reliably converge. In this paper we present an approach towards solving expectation objective optimization problems with cardinality constraints. We prove convergence of the underlying stochastic process, and demonstrate the performance on two Machine Learning problems.</description>

      <title>Comparison of control regularization techniques for minimum-fuel low-thrust trajectory design using indirect methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimum-fuel low-thrust trajectories typically consist of a finite, yet unknown number of switches in the thrust magnitude profile. This optimality-driven characteristic of minimum-fuel trajectories poses a challenge to the numerical methods that are typically used for solving the resulting Hamiltonian boundary-value problems (BVPs). In this paper, we compare the impact of the popular hyperbolic-tangent-based smoothing with a novel L2-norm-based smoothing on the convergence performance of quasi-Newton gradient-based methods. Both smoothing methods are applied directly at the level of control, which offer a significant implementation simplicity. We also investigate the application of each method in scenarios where the State Transition Matrix (STM) is used for accurate calculation of the sensitivities of the residual vector of the resulting BVPs with respect to the unknown initial costate values. The effectiveness of each control smoothing method is assessed across several benchmark minimum-fuel low-thrust trajectory optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Modular Vehicle Routing Problem: Applications in Logistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies and industry advancements indicate that modular vehicles (MVs) have the potential to enhance transportation systems through their ability to dock and split en route. Although various applications of MVs have been explored across different domains, their use in logistics remains relatively underexplored. This study examines the application of MVs in cargo delivery to reduce costs. We model the delivery problem for MVs as a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem, referred to as the Modular Vehicle Routing Problem (MVRP). In the MVRP, MVs can either serve customers independently or dock with other MVs to form a platoon, thereby reducing the average cost per unit. To tackle this problem, we first developed a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model, solvable by commercial optimization solvers. Given the problem's computational complexity, we also designed a Tabu Search (TS) algorithm with specialized neighborhood operators tailored for the MVRP. To escape local optima, multi-start and shaking strategies were incorporated into the TS algorithm. Additionally, we explored potential applications in logistics through various MVRP variants. The results of the numerical experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm successfully identifies all optimal solutions found by the MILP model in small-size benchmark instances, while also demonstrating good convergence speed in large-size benchmark instances. Comparative experiments show that the MVRP approach can reduce costs by approximately 5\% compared to traditional delivery methods. The code and data used in this study will be made available upon the acceptance of this paper.</description>

      <title>A proximal splitting algorithm for generalized DC programming with applications in signal recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difference-of-convex (DC) program is a crucial approach to nonconvex optimization problems due to its structure, which encompasses a wide ranges of practical applications. In this paper, we aim to tackle a generalized class of DC programs, where the objective function is formed by summing a possibly nonsmooth nonconvex function and a differentiable nonconvex function with Lipschitz continuous gradient, and then subtracting a nonsmooth continuous convex function. We develop a proximal splitting algorithm that utilizes proximal evaluation for the concave part and Douglas--Rachford splitting for the remaining components. The algorithm guarantees subsequential convergence to a stationary point of the problem model. Under the widely used Kurdyka--Lojasiewicz property, we establish global convergence of the full sequence of iterates and derive convergence rates for both the iterates and the objective function values, without assuming the concave part is differentiable. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on signal recovery problems with a nonconvex regularization term and exhibits competitive results compared to notable algorithms in the literature on both synthetic data and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Heterogeneous Deffuant-Weisbuch Model: A Complete Proof and Some Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Deffuant-Weisbuch (DW) model is a well-known bounded-confidence opinion dynamics that has attracted wide interest. Although the heterogeneous DW model has been studied by simulations over $20$ years, its convergence proof is open. Our previous paper \cite{GC-WS-WM-FB:20} solves the problem for the case of uniform weighting factors greater than or equal to $1/2$, but the general case remains unresolved.
  This paper considers the DW model with heterogeneous confidence bounds and heterogeneous (unconstrained) weighting factors and shows that, with probability one, the opinion of each agent converges to a fixed vector. In other words, this paper resolves the convergence conjecture for the heterogeneous DW model. Our analysis also clarifies how the convergence speed may be arbitrarily slow under certain parameter conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents bilateral control laws for one-dimensional(1-D) linear 2x2 hyperbolic first-order systems (with spatially varying coefficients). Bilateral control means there are two actuators at each end of the domain. This situation becomes more complex as the transport velocities are no longer constant, and this extension is nontrivial. By selecting the appropriate backstepping transformation and target system, the infinite-dimensional backstepping method is extended and a full-state feedback control law is given that ensures the closed-loop system converges to its zero equilibrium in finite time. The design of bilateral controllers enables a potential for fault-tolerant designs.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, by using the relaxed transposition method[29], we solve the second-order adjoint equations, corresponding to the optimal control of quantum stochastic systems in fermion fields, which plays the fundamental roles in the study of the Pointryagin-type maximum principle in quantum stochastic optimal control. The second-order adjoint equation is a backard operator valued quantum stochastic differential equation, which has no definition in the algebra of bounded operators, and the solution derived from the relaxed transposition method makes sense in W*-topology.</description>

      <title>New results on the local-nonglobal minimizers of the generalized trust-region subproblem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the local-nonglobal minimizers of the Generalized Trust-Region subproblem $(GTR)$ and its Equality-constrained version $(GTRE)$. Firstly, the equivalence is established between the local-nonglobal minimizers of both $(GTR)$ and $(GTRE)$ under assumption of the joint definiteness. By the way, a counterexample is presented to disprove a conjecture of Song-Wang-Liu-Xia [SIAM J. Optim., 33(2023), pp.267-293]. Secondly, if the Hessian matrix pair is jointly positive definite, it is proved that each of $(GTR)$ and $(GTRE)$ has at most two local-nonglobal minimizers. This result first confirms the correctness of another conjecture of Song-Wang-Liu-Xia [SIAM J. Optim., 33(2023), pp.267-293]. Thirdly, if the Hessian matrix pair is jointly negative definite, it is verified that each of $(GTR)$ and $(GTRE)$ has at most one local-nonglobal minimizer. In special, if the constraint is reduced to be a ball or a sphere, the above result is just the classical Mart\'{i}nez's. Finally, an algorithm is proposed to find all the local-nonglobal minimizers of $(GTR)$ and $(GTRE)$ or confirm their nonexistence in a tolerance. Preliminary numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a 4th order 3-dimensional cyclic symmetric tensor, a sufficient and necessary condition is bulit for its positive semi-definiteness. A sufficient and necessary condition of positive definiteness is showed for a 4th order $n$-dimensional symmetric tensor. With the help of such a condition, the positive definiteness of a class of 4th order 3-dimensional cyclic symmetric tensors is given. Moreover, the positive definiteness of a class of non-cyclic symmetric tensors is showed also. By applying these conclusions, several (strict) inequalities are erected for ternary quartic homogeneous polynomials.</description>

      <title>Randomized Submanifold Subgradient Method for Optimization over Stiefel Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization over Stiefel manifolds has found wide applications in many scientific and engineering domains. Despite considerable research effort, high-dimensional optimization problems over Stiefel manifolds remain challenging, and the situation is exacerbated by nonsmooth objective functions. The purpose of this paper is to propose and study a novel coordinate-type algorithm for weakly convex (possibly nonsmooth) optimization problems over high-dimensional Stiefel manifolds, named randomized submanifold subgradient method (RSSM). Similar to coordinate-type algorithms in the Euclidean setting, RSSM exhibits low per-iteration cost and is suitable for high-dimensional problems. We prove that RSSM converges to the set of stationary points and attains $\varepsilon$-stationary points with respect to a natural stationarity measure in $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ iterations in both expectation and the almost-sure senses. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first convergence guarantees for coordinate-type algorithms to optimize nonconvex nonsmooth functions over Stiefel manifolds. An important technical tool in our convergence analysis is a new Riemannian subgradient inequality for weakly convex functions on proximally smooth matrix manifolds, which could be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring the well-posedness of the stochastic singular systems. Moreover, we investigate the stochastic singular linear-quadratic control problems, considering both finite and infinite horizons, and transform each of these problems into their corresponding normal linear-quadratic control problem. To guarantee the finiteness of the infinite-horizon linear-quadratic control problem, we establish the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus rank criterion for accessing the controllability of the stochastic system. Furthermore, we derive the feedback form of the optimal control. Finally, we provide solutions for illustrated examples of the stochastic singular linear-quadratic control problem in both finite and infinite horizons.</description>

      <title>Large Growth of nonconvex functionals at strict local minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present new equivalent conditions for the growth of proper lower semicontinuous functionals at strict local minimizers. The main conditions are a variant of the so-called tilt stability property of local minimizers and an analog of the classic Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition, where the gradient is replaced by linear perturbations. We derive the following tilting principle: stability of minimizers under linear perturbations can infer their stability under nonlinear ones. We show how growth conditions can be used to give convergence rates for the proximal point algorithm. Finally, we give an application to elliptic tracking problems, establishing a novel equivalence between second-order conditions and the sensitivity of solutions with respect to uncertainty in data.</description>

      <title>Feature-Based Interpretable Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For optimization models to be used in practice, it is crucial that users trust the results. A key factor in this aspect is the interpretability of the solution process. A previous framework for inherently interpretable optimization models used decision trees to map instances to solutions of the underlying optimization model. Based on this work, we investigate how we can use more general optimization rules to further increase interpretability and at the same time give more freedom to the decision maker. The proposed rules do not map to a concrete solution but to a set of solutions characterized by common features. To find such optimization rules, we present an exact methodology using mixed-integer programming formulations as well as heuristics. We also outline the challenges and opportunities that these methods present. In particular, we demonstrate the improvement in solution quality that our approach offers compared to existing frameworks for interpretable optimization and we discuss the relationship between interpretability and performance. These findings are supported by experiments using both synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>$\ell_0$ Factor Analysis: A P-Stationary Point Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Factor Analysis is a widely used modeling technique for stationary time series which achieves dimensionality reduction by revealing a hidden low-rank plus sparse structure of the covariance matrix. Such an idea of parsimonious modeling has also been important in the field of systems and control. In this article, a nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem involving the $\ell_0$ norm is constructed in order to achieve the low-rank and sparse additive decomposition of the sample covariance matrix. We establish the existence of an optimal solution and characterize these solutions via the concept of proximal stationary points. Furthermore, an ADMM algorithm is designed to solve the $\ell_0$ optimization problem, and a subsequence convergence result is proved under reasonable assumptions. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison with some alternatives in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a zero-sum stochastic linear quadratic (SLQ, for short) differential games with Markovian jumps. Both open-loop and closed-loop solvabilities are studied by employing a new "decomposition method", which can decompose the open-loop and closed-loop solvability problems of zero-sum SLQ differential game into two coupled SLQ control problems for solving. Moreover, we construct the open-loop saddle point and its closed-loop representation under the uniform convexity-concavity condition based on the solution of a system of constrained coupled differential Riccati equations (CDREs, for short), whose solvability is also provided by adopting the dimension extension technique and the continuation method. At the end of this paper, we provide a concrete example and give its open-loop saddle based on the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic regret in the ergodic Avellaneda-Stoikov market making model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the regret arising from learning the price sensitivity parameter $\kappa$ of liquidity takers in the ergodic version of the Avellaneda-Stoikov market making model. We show that a learning algorithm based on a regularised maximum-likelihood estimator for the parameter achieves the regret upper bound of order $\ln^2 T$ in expectation. To obtain the result we need two key ingredients. The first are tight upper bounds on the derivative of the ergodic constant in the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with respect to $\kappa$. The second is the learning rate of the maximum-likelihood estimator which is obtained from concentration inequalities for Bernoulli signals. Numerical experiment confirms the convergence and the robustness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust model predictive control algorithms are essential for addressing unavoidable errors due to the uncertainty in predicting real-world systems. However, the formulation of such algorithms typically results in a trade-off between conservatism and computational complexity. Monotone systems facilitate the efficient computation of reachable sets and thus the straightforward formulation of a robust model predictive control approach optimizing over open-loop predictions. We present an approach based on the division of reachable sets to incorporate feedback in the predictions, resulting in less conservative strategies. The concept of mixed-monotonicity enables an extension of our methodology to non-monotone systems. The potential of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through a nonlinear high-dimensional chemical tank reactor cascade case study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces CEopt (https://ceopt.org), a MATLAB tool leveraging the Cross-Entropy method for non-convex optimization. Due to the relative simplicity of the algorithm, it provides a kind of transparent ``gray-box'' optimization solver, with intuitive control parameters. Unique in its approach, CEopt effectively handles both equality and inequality constraints using an augmented Lagrangian method, offering robustness and scalability for moderately sized complex problems. Through select case studies, the package's applicability and effectiveness in various optimization scenarios are showcased, marking CEopt as a practical addition to optimization research and application toolsets.</description>

      <title>Methods based on Radon transform for non-affine deformable image registration of noisy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformable image registration is a standard engineering problem used to determine the distortion experienced by a body by comparing two images of it in different states. This study introduces two new DIR methods designed to capture non-affine deformations using Radon transform-based similarity measures and a classical regularizer based on linear elastic deformation energy. It establishes conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solutions for both methods and presents synthetic experimental results comparing them with a standard method based on the sum of squared differences similarity measure. These methods have been tested to capture various non-affine deformations in images, both with and without noise, and their convergence rates have been analyzed. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these methods was also evaluated in a lung image registration scenario.</description>

      <title>An alternative formulation of attention pooling function in translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present an alternative formulation of the attention scoring function in translation tasks. Generally speaking, language is deeply structured, and this is reflected in the attention scoring matrix. We exploit this property to define the attention pooling function, taking this aspect into account. In the first chapters, we introduce the attention mechanism in mathematical terms and explain its limitations and alternative formulations. Next, we focus on the experimental session that led to the alternative formulation. Essentially, we guide queries and keys to interact in a specific manner, encoding the distinct roles of attention heads and directing values on where to seek context. In mathematical terms, we can think of this formula as projecting the attention scores matrix, say $H$, onto the space of band matrices with fixed bandwidth. This convex subspace is clearly finite-dimensional and therefore closed. As a consequence, the projection on this space is well-posed and unique. However, at the price of losing the uniqueness of the projection (i.e., the best approximation for $H$), we defined a new space consisting of band matrices plus error sparse matrices. We prove that this is a compact subspace which guarantees the existence of a matrix that best approximates $H$. We conclude the thesis by validating the new formula, namely calculating how well the new formula for attention scores approximates the original one. Additionally, we explore the impact of different parameters such as w (context windows) and num-pos (number of relevant words in a sentence). These analyses provide deeper insights into how languages are processed and translated, revealing nuances in the roles of context and word relevance.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Multiple DER Aggregators on Wholesale Energy Markets: A Hybrid Mean Field Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into wholesale energy markets can greatly enhance grid flexibility, improve market efficiency, and contribute to a more sustainable energy future. As DERs -- such as solar PV panels and energy storage -- proliferate, effective mechanisms are needed to ensure that small prosumers can participate meaningfully in these markets. We study a wholesale market model featuring multiple DER aggregators, each controlling a portfolio of DER resources and bidding into the market on behalf of the DER asset owners. The key of our approach lies in recognizing the repeated nature of market interactions the ability of participants to learn and adapt over time. Specifically, Aggregators repeatedly interact with each other and with other suppliers in the wholesale market, collectively shaping wholesale electricity prices (aka the locational marginal prices (LMPs)). We model this multi-agent interaction using a mean-field game (MFG), which uses market information -- reflecting the average behavior of market participants -- to enable each aggregator to predict long-term LMP trends and make informed decisions. For each aggregator, because they control the DERs within their portfolio under certain contract structures, we employ a mean-field control (MFC) approach (as opposed to a MFG) to learn an optimal policy that maximizes the total rewards of the DERs under their management. We also propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to help each agent learn optimal strategies within the MFG framework, enhancing their ability to adapt to market conditions and uncertainties. Numerical simulations show that LMPs quickly reach a steady state in the hybrid mean-field approach. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the combination of energy storage and mean-field learning significantly reduces price volatility compared to scenarios without storage.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Steady-State Approach for Efficient Multiscale Simulation and Optimization of mAb Glycosylation in CHO Culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glycosylation is a critical quality attribute for monoclonal antibody, and multiscale mechanistic models, spanning from the bioreactor to the Golgi apparatus, have been proposed for analyzing the glycosylation process. However, these models are computationally intensive to solve, making optimization and control challenging. In this work, we propose a quasi-steady-state (QSS) approach for efficiently solving the multiscale glycosylation model. By introducing the QSS assumption and assuming negligible nucleotide sugar donor flux for glycosylation in the Golgi, the large-scale partial differential algebraic equation system is converted into a series of independent differential algebraic equation systems. Based on that representation, we develop a three-step QSS simulation method and further reduce computational time through parallel computing and nonuniform time grid strategies. Case studies in simulation, parameter estimation, and dynamic optimization demonstrate that the QSS approach can be more than 300-fold faster than the method of lines, with less than 1.6% relative errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a combined global-local control approach to regulate voltage and minimize power losses in distribution networks with high integration of distributed energy resources (DERs). Local controllers embed the fast acting proportional volt-var-watt control law and have their gain (slope) coefficients updated regularly by a global optimization problem at a slower time-scale. Design of optimal coefficients preserve overall system stability and encapsulate inverter and energy limits of controllable DERs. The proposed approach is formulated based on a linear network model (LinDistFlow) and suitable approximations to produce a convex multi-period optimization formulation. Numerical simulations with real-world customer data and two different distribution feeders revealed that our approach provides substantial voltage regulation, while reducing losses by 11 per cent and peak substation power by 26 per cent compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Flexible Ramping Product Procurement in Day-Ahead Markets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible ramping products (FRPs) emerge as a promising instrument for addressing steep and uncertain ramping needs through market mechanisms. Initial implementations of FRPs in North American electricity markets, however, revealed several shortcomings in existing FRP designs. In many instances, FRP prices failed to signal the true value of ramping capacity, most notably evident in zero FRP prices observed in a myriad of periods during which the system was in acute need for rampable capacity. These periods were marked by scheduled but undeliverable FRPs, often calling for operator out-of-market actions. On top of that, the methods used for procuring FRPs have been primarily rule-based, lacking explicit economic underpinnings. In this paper, we put forth an alternative framework for FRP procurement, which seeks to set FRP requirements and schedule FRP awards such that the expected system operation cost is minimized. Using real world data from U.S. ISOs, we showcase the relative merits of the framework in (i) reducing the total system operation cost, (ii) improving price formation, (iii) enhancing the the deliverability of FRP awards, and (iv) reducing the need for out-of-market actions.</description>

Abstract: We consider a velocity tracking problem for stochastic Navier-Stokes equations in a 2D-bounded domain. The control acts on the boundary through an injection-suction device with uncertainty, which acts in accordance with the non-homogeneous Navier-slip boundary conditions. After establishing a suitable stability result for the solution of the stochastic state equation, we prove the well-posedness of the stochastic linearized state equation and show that the G\^ateaux derivative of the control-to-state mapping corresponds to the unique solution of the linearized equation. Next, we study the stochastic backward adjoint equation and establish a duality relation between the solutions of the forward linearized equation and the backward adjoint equation. Finally, we derive the first-order optimality conditions.</description>

  More precisely, we consider the system governing the evolution of a second grade fluid filling a two-dimensional bounded domain, supplemented with a Navier slip boundary condition, and under certain assumptions on the size of the initial data and parameters of the model, we prove the second-order sufficient optimality conditions.
  Furthermore, we establish a global uniqueness result for the solutions of the first-order optimality system.</description>

      <title>Localizing Single and Multiple Oscillatory Sources: A Frequency Divider Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localizing sources of troublesome oscillations, particularly forced oscillations (FOs), in power systems has received considerable attention over the last few years. This is driven in part by the massive deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) that capture these oscillations when they occur; and in part by the increasing incidents of FOs due to malfunctioning components, wind power fluctuations, and/or cyclic loads. Capitalizing on the frequency divider formula of [1], we develop methods to localize single and multiple oscillatory sources using bus frequency measurements. The method to localize a single oscillation source does not require knowledge of network parameters. However, the method for localizing FOs caused by multiple sources requires this knowledge. We explain the reasoning behind this knowledge difference as well as demonstrate the success of our methods for source localization in multiple test systems.</description>

      <title>Variable reduction as a nonlinear preconditioning approach for optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When considering an unconstrained minimization problem, a standard approach is to solve the optimality system with a Newton method possibly preconditioned by, e.g., nonlinear elimination. In this contribution, we argue that nonlinear elimination could be used to reduce the number of optimization variables by artificially constraining them to satisfy a subset of the optimality conditions. Consequently, a reduced objective function is derived which can now be minimized with any optimization algorithm. By choosing suitable variables to eliminate, the conditioning of the reduced optimization problem is largely improved. We here focus in particular on a right preconditioned gradient descent and show theoretical and numerical results supporting the validity of the presented approach.</description>

      <title>On encoded quantum gate generation by iterative Lyapunov-based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of encoded quantum gate generation is studied in this paper. The idea is to consider a quantum system of higher dimension $n$ than the dimension $\bar n$ of the quantum gate to be synthesized. Given two orthonormal subsets $\mathbb{E} = \{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_{\bar n}\}$ and $\mathbb F = \{f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_{\bar n}\}$ of $\mathbb{C}^n$, the problem of encoded quantum gate generation consists in obtaining an open loop control law defined in an interval $[0, T_f]$ in a way that all initial states $e_i$ are steered to $\exp(\jmath \phi) f_i, i=1,2, \ldots ,\bar n$ up to some desired precision and to some global phase $\phi \in \mathbb{R}$. This problem includes the classical (full) quantum gate generation problem, when $\bar n = n$, the state preparation problem, when $\bar n = 1$, and finally the encoded gate generation when $ 1 &lt; \bar n &lt; n$. Hence, three problems are unified here within a unique common approach. The \emph{Reference Input Generation Algorithm (RIGA)} is generalized in this work for considering the encoded gate generation problem for closed quantum systems. A suitable Lyapunov function is derived from the orthogonal projector on the support of the encoded gate. Three case-studies of physical interest indicate the potential interest of such numerical algorithm: two coupled transmon-qubits, a cavity mode coupled to a transmon-qubit, and a chain of $N$ qubits, including a large dimensional case for which $N=10$.</description>

      <title>PACSBO: Probably approximately correct safe Bayesian optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms promise to find optimal control policies without knowing the system dynamics while at the same time guaranteeing safety with high probability. In exchange for those guarantees, popular algorithms require a smoothness assumption: a known upper bound on a norm in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The RKHS is a potentially infinite-dimensional space, and it is unclear how to, in practice, obtain an upper bound of an unknown function in its corresponding RKHS. In response, we propose an algorithm that estimates an upper bound on the RKHS norm of an unknown function from data and investigate its theoretical properties. Moreover, akin to Lipschitz-based methods, we treat the RKHS norm as a local rather than a global object, and thus reduce conservatism. Integrating the RKHS norm estimation and the local interpretation of the RKHS norm into a safe BO algorithm yields PACSBO, an algorithm for probably approximately correct safe Bayesian optimization, for which we provide numerical and hardware experiments that demonstrate its applicability and benefits over popular safe BO algorithms.</description>

      <title>Performance-Aware Self-Configurable Multi-Agent Networks: A Distributed Submodular Approach for Simultaneous Coordination and Network Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first, to our knowledge, rigorous approach that enables multi-agent networks to self-configure their communication topology to balance the trade-off between scalability and optimality during multi-agent planning. We are motivated by the future of ubiquitous collaborative autonomy where numerous distributed agents will be coordinating via agent-to-agent communication to execute complex tasks such as traffic monitoring, event detection, and environmental exploration. But the explosion of information in such large-scale networks currently curtails their deployment due to impractical decision times induced by the computational and communication requirements of the existing near-optimal coordination algorithms. To overcome this challenge, we present the AlterNAting COordination and Network-Design Algorithm (Anaconda), a scalable algorithm that also enjoys near-optimality guarantees. Subject to the agents' bandwidth constraints, Anaconda enables the agents to optimize their local communication neighborhoods such that the action-coordination approximation performance of the network is maximized. Compared to the state of the art, Anaconda is an anytime self-configurable algorithm that quantifies its suboptimality guarantee for any type of network, from fully disconnected to fully centralized, and that, for sparse networks, is one order faster in terms of decision speed. To develop the algorithm, we quantify the suboptimality cost due to decentralization, i.e., due to communication-minimal distributed coordination. We also employ tools inspired by the literature on multi-armed bandits and submodular maximization subject to cardinality constraints. We demonstrate Anaconda in simulated scenarios of area monitoring and compare it with a state-of-the-art algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative terminal landing guidance law that utilizes an analytic solution derived from the gravity turn trajectory. The characteristics of the derived solution are thoroughly investigated, and the solution is employed to generate a reference velocity vector that satisfies terminal landing conditions. A nonlinear control law is applied to effectively track the reference velocity vector within a finite time, and its robustness against disturbances is studied. Furthermore, the guidance law is expanded to incorporate ground collision avoidance by considering the shape of the gravity turn trajectory. The proposed method's fuel efficiency, robustness, and practicality are demonstrated through comprehensive numerical simulations, and its performance is compared with existing methods.</description>

      <title>Data-driven topology design based on principal component analysis for 3D structural design problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology optimization is a structural design methodology widely utilized to address engineering challenges. However, sensitivity-based topology optimization methods struggle to solve optimization problems characterized by strong non-linearity. Leveraging the sensitivity-free nature and high capacity of deep generative models, data-driven topology design (DDTD) methodology is considered an effective solution to this problem. Despite this, the training effectiveness of deep generative models diminishes when input size exceeds a threshold while maintaining high degrees of freedom is crucial for accurately characterizing complex structures. To resolve the conflict between the both, we propose DDTD based on principal component analysis (PCA). Its core idea is to replace the direct training of deep generative models with material distributions by using a principal component score matrix obtained from PCA computation and to obtain the generated material distributions with new features through the restoration process. We apply the proposed PCA-based DDTD to the problem of minimizing the maximum stress in 3D structural mechanics and demonstrate it can effectively address the current challenges faced by DDTD that fail to handle 3D structural design problems. Various experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed PCA-based DDTD.</description>

      <title>Two-layers neural networks for Schr{\"o}dinger eigenvalue problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to analyze numerical schemes using two-layer neural networks withinfinite width for the resolution of high-dimensional Schr{\"o}dinger eigenvalue problems with smoothinteraction potentials and Neumann boundary condition on the unit cube in any dimension. Moreprecisely, any eigenfunction associated to the lowest eigenvalue of the Schr{\"o}dinger operator is a unitL 2 norm minimizer of the associated energy. Using Barron's representation of the solution witha probability measure defined on the set of parameter values and following the approach initiallysuggested by Bach and Chizat [1], the energy is minimized thanks to a constrained gradient curvedynamic on the 2-Wasserstein space of the set of parameter values defining the neural network. Weprove the existence of solutions to this constrained gradient curve. Furthermore, we prove that,if it converges, the represented function is then an eigenfunction of the considered Schr{\"o}dingeroperator. At least up to our knowledge, this is the first work where this type of analysis is carriedout to deal with the minimization of non-convex functionals.</description>

      <title>Mixed Regular and Impulsive Sampled-data LQR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the benefits of combining regular and impulsive inputs for the control of sampled-data linear time-invariant systems. We first observe that adding an impulsive term to a regular, zero-order-hold controller may help enlarging the set of sampling periods under which controllability is preserved by sampling. In this context, we provide a tailored Hautus-like necessary and sufficient condition under which controllability of the mixed regular, impulsive (MRI) sampled-data model is preserved. We then focus on LQR optimal control. After having presented the optimal controllers for the sampled-data LQR control in the MRI setting, we consider the scenario where an impulsive disturbance affects the dynamics and is known ahead of time. The solution to the so-called preview LQR is presented exploiting both regular and impulsive input components. Numerical examples, that include an insulin infusion benchmark, illustrate that leveraging both future disturbance information and MRI controls may lead to significant performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Robust Clustering on High-Dimensional Data with Stochastic Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of traditional vector quantization (clustering) algorithms, particularly K-Means and its variant K-Means++, and explores the Stochastic Quantization (SQ) algorithm as a scalable alternative for high-dimensional unsupervised and semi-supervised learning problems. Some traditional clustering algorithms suffer from inefficient memory utilization during computation, necessitating the loading of all data samples into memory, which becomes impractical for large-scale datasets. While variants such as Mini-Batch K-Means partially mitigate this issue by reducing memory usage, they lack robust theoretical convergence guarantees due to the non-convex nature of clustering problems. In contrast, the Stochastic Quantization algorithm provides strong theoretical convergence guarantees, making it a robust alternative for clustering tasks. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and rapid convergence of the algorithm on an image classification problem with partially labeled data, comparing model accuracy across various ratios of labeled to unlabeled data. To address the challenge of high dimensionality, we trained Triplet Network to encode images into low-dimensional representations in a latent space, which serve as a basis for comparing the efficiency of both the Stochastic Quantization algorithm and traditional quantization algorithms. Furthermore, we enhance the algorithm's convergence speed by introducing modifications with an adaptive learning rate.</description>

      <title>Robust Accelerated Primal-Dual Methods for Computing Saddle Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.12743v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider strongly-convex-strongly-concave saddle point problems assuming we have access to unbiased stochastic estimates of the gradients. We propose a stochastic accelerated primal-dual (SAPD) algorithm and show that SAPD sequence, generated using constant primal-dual step sizes, linearly converges to a neighborhood of the unique saddle point. Interpreting the size of the neighborhood as a measure of robustness to gradient noise, we obtain explicit characterizations of robustness in terms of SAPD parameters and problem constants. Based on these characterizations, we develop computationally tractable techniques for optimizing the SAPD parameters, i.e., the primal and dual step sizes, and the momentum parameter, to achieve a desired trade-off between the convergence rate and robustness on the Pareto curve. This allows SAPD to enjoy fast convergence properties while being robust to noise as an accelerated method. SAPD admits convergence guarantees for the distance metric with a variance term optimal up to a logarithmic factor -which can be removed by employing a restarting strategy. We also discuss how convergence and robustness results extend to the convex-concave setting. Finally, we illustrate our framework on distributionally robust logistic regression problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.15084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new stochastic method SAPD+ for solving nonconvex-concave minimax problems of the form $\min\max \mathcal{L}(x,y) = f(x)+\Phi(x,y)-g(y)$, where $f,g$ are proper closed convex and $\Phi(x,y)$ is a smooth function that is weakly convex in $x$, (strongly) concave in $y$. For both strongly concave and merely concave settings, SAPD+ achieves the best known sample complexities of $\mathcal{O}(L\kappa_y\epsilon^{-4})$ and $\mathcal{O}(L^3\epsilon^{-6})$, respectively, without assuming compactness of the problem domain, where $\kappa_y$ is the condition number and $L$ is the Lipschitz constant. We also propose SAPD+ with variance reduction, which enjoys the best known sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(L\kappa_y^2\epsilon^{-3})$ for weakly convex-strongly concave setting. We demonstrate the efficiency of SAPD+ on a distributionally robust learning problem with a weakly convex cost and also on a multi-class classification problem in deep learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.00973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a class of monotone inclusion (MI) problems of finding a zero of the sum of two monotone operators, in which one operator is maximal monotone while the other is {\it locally Lipschitz} continuous. We propose primal-dual extrapolation methods to solve them using a point and operator extrapolation technique, whose parameters are chosen by a backtracking line search scheme. The proposed methods enjoy an operation complexity of ${\cal O}(\log \epsilon^{-1})$ and ${\cal O}(\epsilon^{-1}\log \epsilon^{-1})$, measured by the number of fundamental operations consisting only of evaluations of one operator and resolvent of the other operator, for finding an $\varepsilon$-residual solution of strongly and non-strongly MI problems, respectively. The latter complexity significantly improves the previously best operation complexity ${\cal O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$. As a byproduct, complexity results of the primal-dual extrapolation methods are also obtained for finding an $\varepsilon$-KKT or $\varepsilon$-residual solution of convex conic optimization, conic constrained saddle point, and variational inequality problems under {\it local Lipschitz} continuity. We provide preliminary numerical results to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we study monotone dynamical systems with respect to polyhedral cones. Using the half-space representation and the vertex representation, we propose three equivalent conditions to certify monotonicity of a dynamical system with respect to a polyhedral cone. We then introduce the notion of gauge norm associated with a cone and provide closed-from formulas for computing gauge norms associated with polyhedral cones. A key feature of gauge norms is that contractivity of monotone systems with respect to them can be efficiently characterized using simple inequalities. This result generalizes the well-known criteria for Hurwitzness of Metzler matrices and provides a scalable approach to search for Lyapunov functions of monotone systems with respect to polyhedral cones. Finally, we study the applications of our results in transient stability of dynamic flow networks and in scalable control design with safety guarantees.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Quasi-Newton Method in the Absence of Common Random Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quasi-Newton method for unconstrained stochastic optimization. Most existing literature on this topic assumes a setting of stochastic optimization in which a finite sum of component functions is a reasonable approximation of an expectation, and hence one can design a quasi-Newton method to exploit common random numbers. In contrast, and motivated by problems in variational quantum algorithms, we assume that function values and gradients are available only through inexact probabilistic zeroth- and first-order oracles and no common random numbers can be exploited. Our algorithmic framework -- based on prior work on the SASS algorithm -- is general and does not assume common random numbers. We derive a high-probability tail bound on the iteration complexity of the algorithm for nonconvex and strongly convex functions. We present numerical results demonstrating the empirical benefits of augmenting SASS with our quasi-Newton updating scheme, both on synthetic problems and on real problems in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Optimization on product manifolds under a preconditioned metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since optimization on Riemannian manifolds relies on the chosen metric, it is appealing to know that how the performance of a Riemannian optimization method varies with different metrics and how to exquisitely construct a metric such that a method can be accelerated. To this end, we propose a general framework for optimization problems on product manifolds where the search space is endowed with a preconditioned metric, and we develop the Riemannian gradient descent and Riemannian conjugate gradient methods under this metric. Specifically, the metric is constructed by an operator that aims to approximate the diagonal blocks of the Riemannian Hessian of the cost function, which has a preconditioning effect. We explain the relationship between the proposed methods and the variable metric methods, and show that various existing methods, e.g., the Riemannian Gauss--Newton method, can be interpreted by the proposed framework with specific metrics. In addition, we tailor new preconditioned metrics and adapt the proposed Riemannian methods to the canonical correlation analysis and the truncated singular value decomposition problems, and we propose the Gauss--Newton method to solve the tensor ring completion problem. Numerical results among these applications verify that a delicate metric does accelerate the Riemannian optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Generalized open-loop Nash equilibria in linear-quadratic difference games with coupled-affine inequality constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we study a class of deterministic finite-horizon linear-quadratic difference games with coupled affine inequality constraints involving both state and control variables. We show that the necessary conditions for the existence of generalized open-loop Nash equilibria in this game class lead to two strongly coupled discrete-time linear complementarity systems. Subsequently, we derive sufficient conditions by establishing an equivalence between the solutions of these systems and convexity of the players' objective functions. These conditions are then reformulated as a solution to a linear complementarity problem, providing a numerical method to compute these equilibria. We illustrate our results using a network flow game with constraints.</description>

      <title>Explainable Data-driven Share-of-choice Product Line Design Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The share-of-choice (SOC) problem is a widely studied problem for product line design (PLD) where representative customers are sampled from a target population and the percentage of the ones who choose the offered products over outside options over the sample is maximized. The utility maximization framework captures individual choices. A significant challenge is that these utilities are not directly observable and must be estimated from other primitive data. Conjoint analysis is a commonly applied technique for generating such data, where sampled customers rate, rank, or choose between different product alternatives. With the responses, various methods, such as the hierarchical Bayesian method and polyhedral estimation, are employed to estimate the utilities. However, this " estimate-then-optimize" procedure disconnects the decision-making process from the primitive data and thus cannot attribute the PLD decision to the unresolved survey data. To fill the gap, we integrate the polyhedral estimation method into the PLD optimization, which constructs a polyhedron set containing all utilities consistent with the responses. Specifically, we proposed a robust model that maximizes the share-of-choice calculated by the worst-case utility over the polyhedron. The model brings threefold explainability to the PLD problem. First, it enables us to explore the influence of both estimation error and the number of sampled customers through an out-of-sample performance guarantee of the proposed model. Secondly, the linearly tractable equivalent reformulation constructed by the duality allows us to attribute the optimal product line to the survey data through the dual variables. Third, inspired by the fact that the survey questions are associated with columns in the dual reformulation, we propose a column generation approach to identify new questions that most effectively improve the model's objective.</description>

      <title>The Anytime Convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum: From a Continuous-Time Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19598v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stochastic optimization problem from a continuous-time perspective, with a focus on the Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) method. We show that the trajectory of SGDM, despite its \emph{stochastic} nature, converges in $L_2$-norm to a \emph{deterministic} second-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) as the stepsize goes to zero. The connection between the ODE and the algorithm results in a useful development for the discrete-time convergence analysis. More specifically, we develop, through the construction of a suitable Lyapunov function, convergence results for the ODE, which are then translated to the corresponding convergence results for the discrete-time case. This approach yields a novel \emph{anytime} convergence guarantee for stochastic gradient methods. In particular, we prove that the sequence $\{ x_k \}$, governed by running SGDM on a smooth convex function $f$, satisfies \begin{align*}
  \mathbb{P}\left(f (x_k) - f^* \le C\left(1+\log\frac{1}{\beta}\right)\frac{\log k}{\sqrt{k}},\;\text{for all $k$}\right)\ge 1-\beta\quad\text{ for any $\beta&gt;0$,} \end{align*} where $f^*=\min_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n} f(x)$, and $C$ is a constant. Rather than at a single step, this result captures the convergence behavior across the entire trajectory of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Nonsmooth Projection-Free Optimization with Functional Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a subgradient-based algorithm for constrained nonsmooth convex optimization that does not require projections onto the feasible set. While the well-established Frank-Wolfe algorithm and its variants already avoid projections, they are primarily designed for smooth objective functions. In contrast, our proposed algorithm can handle nonsmooth problems with general convex functional inequality constraints. It achieves an $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations, with each iteration requiring only a single (potentially inexact) Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) call and a (possibly inexact) subgradient computation. This performance is consistent with existing lower bounds. Similar performance is observed when deterministic subgradients are replaced with stochastic subgradients. In the special case where there are no functional inequality constraints, our algorithm competes favorably with a recent nonsmooth projection-free method designed for constraint-free problems. Our approach utilizes a simple separation scheme in conjunction with a new Lagrange multiplier update rule.</description>

      <title>Representation results and error estimates for differential games with applications using neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study deterministic optimal control problems for differential games with finite horizon. We propose new approximations of the strategies in feedback form, and show error estimates and a convergence result of the value in some weak sense for one of the formulations. This result applies in particular to neural networks approximations. This work follows some ideas introduced in Bokanowski, Prost and Warin (PDEA, 2023) for deterministic optimal control problems, yet with a simplified approach for the error estimates, which allows to consider a global optimization scheme instead of a time-marching scheme. We also give a new approximation result between the continuous and the semi-discrete optimal control value in the game setting, improving the classical convergence order under some assumptions on the dynamical system. Numerical examples are performed on elementary academic problems related to backward reachability, with exact analytic solutions given, as well as a two-player game in presence of state constraints. We use stochastic gradient type algorithms in order to deal with the min-max problem.</description>

      <title>Strategic Negotiations in Endogenous Network Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In network formation games, agents form edges with each other to maximize their utility. Each agent's utility depends on its private beliefs and its edges in the network. Strategic agents can misrepresent their beliefs to get a better resulting network. Most prior works in this area consider honest agents or a single strategic agent. Instead, we propose a model where any subset of agents can be strategic. We provide an efficient algorithm for finding the set of Nash equilibria, if any exist, and certify their nonexistence otherwise. We also show that when several strategic agents are present, their utilities can increase or decrease compared to when they are all honest. Small changes in the inter-agent correlations can cause such shifts. In contrast, the simpler one-strategic-agent setting explored in the literature lacks such complex patterns. Finally, we develop an algorithm by which new agents can learn the information needed for strategic behavior. Our algorithm works even when the (unknown) strategic agents deviate from the Nash-optimal strategies. We verify these results on both simulated networks and a real-world dataset on international trade.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to establish the Ahlfors regularity of minimizers of set functions that satisfy a suitable maxitive condition on disjoint unions of sets. Our analysis focuses on minimizers within continua of the plane with finite one-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Through quantitative estimates, we prove that the length of a minimizer inside the ball centered at one of its points is comparable to the radius of the ball. By operating within an abstract framework, we are able to encompass a diverse range of entities, including spectral functionals defined in terms of the eigenvalues of elliptic operators, the inradius, and the maximum of the torsion function. These entities are of interest for several applications, such as structural engineering, urban planning, and quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Mine Planning with Large Neighbourhood Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Large Neighbourhood Search (LNS) based approach for solving complex long-term open-pit mine planning problems. An initial feasible solution, generated by a sliding windows heuristic, is improved through repeated solves of a restricted mixed integer program. Each iteration leaves only a subset of the variables in the planning model free to take on new values. We form these subsets through the use of a path-based neighbourhood structure, and neighbourhood formation strategies that exploit the structure of the planning model. We show that our method is able to find near-optimal solutions to problems that cannot be solved, or improved upon, by an off-the-shelf solver in a reasonable time, or with reasonable computational resources. Our method substantially reduces the solve times required for large models, allowing mine planners to explore multiple scenarios in a timely fashion. Our approach is being used by Rio Tinto for solving large life-of-mine planning problems, and has been responsible for generating millions of dollars in value insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for non-convex optimization, called Swarm-based Simulated Annealing (SSA), which is at the interface between the swarm-based gradient-descent (SBGD) [J. Lu et. al., ArXiv:2211.17157; E.Tadmor and A. Zenginoglu, Acta Applicandae Math., 190, 2024] and Simulated Annealing (SA) [V. Cerny, J. optimization theory and appl., 45:41-51, 1985; S.Kirkpatrick et. al., Science, 220(4598):671-680, 1983; S. Geman and C.-R. Hwang, SIAM J. Control and Optimization, 24(5):1031-1043, 1986]. Similar to SBGD, we introduce a swarm of agents, each identified with a position, ${\mathbf x}$ and mass $m$, to explore the ambient space. Similar to SA, the agents proceed in the gradient descent direction, and are subject to Brownian motion. The annealing rate, however, is dictated by a decreasing function of their mass. As a consequence, instead of the SA protocol for time-decreasing temperature, we let the swarm decide how to `cool down' agents, depending on their accumulated mass over time. The dynamics of masses is coupled with the dynamics of positions: agents at higher ground transfer (part of) their mass to those at lower ground. Consequently, resulting SSA optimizer is dynamically divided between heavier, cooler agents viewed as `leaders' and lighter, warmer agents viewed as `explorers'. Mean-field convergence analysis and benchmark optimizations demonstrate the effectiveness of the swarm-based method as a multi-dimensional global optimizer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose semidefinite trajectory optimization (STROM), a framework that computes fast and certifiably optimal solutions for nonconvex trajectory optimization problems defined by polynomial objectives and constraints. STROM employs sparse second-order Lasserre's hierarchy to generate semidefinite program (SDP) relaxations of trajectory optimization. Different from existing tools (e.g., YALMIP and SOSTOOLS in Matlab), STROM generates chain-like multiple-block SDPs with only positive semidefinite (PSD) variables. Moreover, STROM does so two orders of magnitude faster. Underpinning STROM is cuADMM, the first ADMM-based SDP solver implemented in CUDA and runs in GPUs (with C/C++ extension). cuADMM builds upon the symmetric Gauss-Seidel ADMM algorithm and leverages GPU parallelization to speedup solving sparse linear systems and projecting onto PSD cones. In five trajectory optimization problems (inverted pendulum, cart-pole, vehicle landing, flying robot, and car back-in), cuADMM computes optimal trajectories (with certified suboptimality below 1%) in minutes (when other solvers take hours or run out of memory) and seconds (when others take minutes). Further, when warmstarted by data-driven initialization in the inverted pendulum problem, cuADMM delivers real-time performance: providing certifiably optimal trajectories in 0.66 seconds despite the SDP has 49,500 variables and 47,351 constraints.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel semidefinite programming framework for designing custom frugal resolvent splitting algorithms which find a zero in the sum of n monotone operators. This framework features a number of design choices which facilitate creating resolvent splitting algorithms with specific communication structure. We illustrate these design choices using a variety of constraint sets and objective functions, as well as the use of a mixed-integer SDP to minimize time per iteration or required number of communications between the resolvents which define the splitting. Using the Performance Estimation Problem (PEP) framework, we provide parameter selections, such as step size, which for high dimensional problems provide optimal contraction factors in the algorithms. Among the algorithm design choices we introduce, we provide a characterization of algorithm designs which provide minimal convergence time given structural properties of the monotone operators, resolvent computation times, and communication latencies.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Primal-Dual Proximal Gradient Splitting Methods for Convex-Concave Saddle-Point Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, based a novel primal-dual dynamical model with adaptive scaling parameters and Bregman divergences, we propose new accelerated primal-dual proximal gradient splitting methods for solving bilinear saddle-point problems with provable optimal nonergodic convergence rates. For the first, using the spectral analysis, we show that a naive extension of acceleration model for unconstrained optimization problems to a quadratic game is unstable. Motivated by this, we present an accelerated primal-dual hybrid gradient (APDHG) flow which combines acceleration with careful velocity correction. To work with non-Euclidean distances, we also equip our APDHG model with general Bregman divergences and prove the exponential decay of a Lyapunov function. Then, new primal-dual splitting methods are developed based on proper semi-implicit Euler schemes of the continuous model, and the theoretical convergence rates are nonergodic and optimal with respect to the matrix norms,\, Lipschitz constants and convexity parameters. Thanks to the primal and dual scaling parameters, both the algorithm designing and convergence analysis cover automatically the convex and (partially) strongly convex objectives. Moreover, the use of Bregman divergences not only unifies the standard Euclidean distances and general cases in an elegant way, but also makes our methods more flexible and adaptive to problem-dependent metrics.</description>

Abstract: This study develops an algorithm for distributed computing of linear programming problems of huge-scales. Global consensus with single common variable, multiblocks, and augmented Lagrangian are adopted. The consensus is used to partition the constraints of equality and inequality into multi consensus blocks, and the subblocks of each consensus block are employed to partition the primal variables into $M$ sets of disjoint subvectors. The block-coordinate Gauss-Seidel method, the proximal point method, and ADMM are used to update the primal variables, and descent models used to update the dual. Convergence of the algorithm is analyzed and the rate of convergence of the augmented Lagrangian without penalty to the original constraints, of $O(1/k)$ is obtained.</description>

      <title>Optimization model for electric aircraft tow tractors considering operator coalition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Horizontal collaboration between operators can save traffic operation costs, a concept that has been particularly validated in the logistics field. Due to the increasing transportation demand and the introduction of charging times for electric vehicles, there is growing pressure on airport ground support services. This study introduces the concept of coalition to airport ground support services. Unlike most studies on horizontal collaboration, the scheduling for airport ground support services needs to particularly consider punctuality issues. In this study, we separately establish electric vehicle scheduling models for operator-separate and operator-cooperated modes and design an algorithm based on the concept of the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm, aiming to obtain the electric vehicle scheduling plan with minimum cost and delay time. Furthermore, the study proposes a cost allocation method that considers the degree of sharing among operators to ensure the feasibility of coalition. Finally, we conducted numerical experiments based on actual airport operation data. The experiments verified the effectiveness of the algorithm and the cost allocation method. Compared to solvers, our algorithm can obtain feasible solutions in a shorter time while ensuring that the objective function gap is within 2%. Additionally, the improved cost allocation method is fairer compared to the traditional Shapley method. Numerical experiments also show that coalition can save 15-25% of airport operating costs and 26-39% of delay time, with savings varying based on the sharing parameters. Through quantitative analysis such as sensitivity analysis, the study provides insights into the variation patterns of overall and individual shared utilities and offers suggestions and decision-making mechanisms for the configuration and operation of airport ground operators.</description>

      <title>Scheduling Servers with Stochastic Bilinear Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.06362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address a control system optimization problem that arises in multi-class, multi-server queueing system scheduling with uncertainty. In this scenario, jobs incur holding costs while awaiting completion, and job-server assignments yield observable stochastic rewards with unknown mean values. The rewards for job-server assignments are assumed to follow a bilinear model with respect to features characterizing jobs and servers. Our objective is regret minimization, aiming to maximize the cumulative reward of job-server assignments over a time horizon while maintaining a bounded total job holding cost, thus ensuring queueing system stability. This problem is motivated by applications in computing services and online platforms. To address this problem, we propose a scheduling algorithm based on weighted proportional fair allocation criteria augmented with marginal costs for reward maximization, incorporating a bandit strategy. Our algorithm achieves sub-linear regret and sub-linear mean holding cost (and queue length bound) with respect to the time horizon, thus guaranteeing queueing system stability. Additionally, we establish stability conditions for distributed iterative algorithms for computing allocations, which are relevant to large-scale system applications. Finally, we validate the efficiency of our algorithm through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Iteration Complexity of Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been much recent interest in near-term applications of quantum computers, i.e., using quantum circuits that have short decoherence times due to hardware limitations. Variational quantum algorithms (VQA), wherein an optimization algorithm implemented on a classical computer evaluates a parametrized quantum circuit as an objective function, are a leading framework in this space. An enormous breadth of algorithms in this framework have been proposed for solving a range of problems in machine learning, forecasting, applied physics, and combinatorial optimization, among others.
  In this paper, we analyze the iteration complexity of VQA, that is, the number of steps that VQA requires until its iterates satisfy a surrogate measure of optimality. We argue that although VQA procedures incorporate algorithms that can, in the idealized case, be modeled as classic procedures in the optimization literature, the particular nature of noise in near-term devices invalidates the claim of applicability of off-the-shelf analyses of these algorithms. Specifically, noise makes the evaluations of the objective function via quantum circuits biased. Commonly used optimization procedures, such as SPSA and the parameter shift rule, can thus be seen as derivative-free optimization algorithms with biased function evaluations, for which there are currently no iteration complexity guarantees in the literature. We derive the missing guarantees and find that the rate of convergence is unaffected. However, the level of bias contributes unfavorably to both the constant therein, and the asymptotic distance to stationarity, i.e., the more bias, the farther one is guaranteed, at best, to reach a stationary point of the VQA objective.</description>

      <title>A Formal Perspective on Byte-Pair Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) is a popular algorithm used for tokenizing data in NLP, despite being devised initially as a compression method. BPE appears to be a greedy algorithm at face value, but the underlying optimization problem that BPE seeks to solve has not yet been laid down. We formalize BPE as a combinatorial optimization problem. Via submodular functions, we prove that the iterative greedy version is a $\frac{1}{{\sigma(\boldsymbol{\mu}^\star)}}(1-e^{-{\sigma(\boldsymbol{\mu}^\star)}})$-approximation of an optimal merge sequence, where ${\sigma(\boldsymbol{\mu}^\star)}$ is the total backward curvature with respect to the optimal merge sequence $\boldsymbol{\mu}^\star$. Empirically the lower bound of the approximation is $\approx 0.37$.
  We provide a faster implementation of BPE which improves the runtime complexity from $\mathcal{O}\left(N M\right)$ to $\mathcal{O}\left(N \log M\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length and $M$ is the merge count. Finally, we optimize the brute-force algorithm for optimal BPE using memoization.</description>

      <title>Is the Faber-Krahn inequality true for the Stokes operator?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to investigate the minimisation of the first eigenvalue of the (vectorial) incompressible Dirichlet-Stokes operator. After providing an existence result, we investigate optimality conditions and we prove the following surprising result: while the ball satisfies first and second-order optimality conditions in dimension 2, it does not in dimension 3, so that the Faber-Krahn inequality for the Stokes operator is probably true in $\mathbb{R}^2$, but does not hold in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The multiplicity of the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet-Stokes operator in the ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$ plays a crucial role in the proof of that claim.</description>

      <title>Using $LDL^{T}$ factorizations in Newton's method for solving general large-scale algebraic Riccati equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations can be found in many disciplines in different forms. In the case of small-scale dense coefficient matrices, stabilizing solutions can be computed to all possible formulations of the Riccati equation. This is not the case when it comes to large-scale sparse coefficient matrices. In this paper, we provide a reformulation of the Newton-Kleinman iteration scheme for continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations using indefinite symmetric low-rank factorizations. This allows the application of the method to the case of general large-scale sparse coefficient matrices. We provide convergence results for several prominent realizations of the equation and show in numerical examples the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Optimal Stopping of BSDEs with Constrained Jumps and Related Double Obstacle PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider partial differential equations (PDEs) characterized by an upper barrier that depends on the solution itself and a fixed lower barrier, while accommodating a non-local driver. First, we show a Feynman-Kac representation for the PDE when the driver is local. Specifically, we relate the non-linear Snell envelope for an optimal stopping problem, where the underlying process is the first component in the solution to a stopped backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) with jumps and a constraint on the jumps process, to a viscosity solution for the PDE. Leveraging this Feynman-Kac representation, we subsequently prove existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions in the non-local setting by employing a contraction argument. In addition, the contraction argument yields existence of a new type of non-linear Snell envelope and extends the theory of probabilistic representation for PDEs.</description>

      <title>Fully discretized Sobolev gradient flow for the Gross-Pitaevskii eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the numerical approximation of the ground state of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) eigenvalue problem with a fully discretized Sobolev gradient flow induced by the $H^1$ norm. For the spatial discretization, we consider the finite element method with quadrature using $P^k$ basis on a simplicial mesh and $Q^k$ basis on a rectangular mesh. We prove the global convergence to a critical point of the discrete GP energy, and establish a local exponential convergence to the ground state under the assumption that the linearized discrete Schr\"odinger operator has a positive spectral gap. We also show that for the $P^1$ finite element discretization with quadrature on an unstructured shape regular simplicial mesh, the eigengap satisfies a mesh-independent lower bound, which implies a mesh-independent local convergence rate for the proposed discrete gradient flow. Numerical experiments with discretization by high order $Q^k$ spectral element methods in two and three dimensions are provided to validate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Perfecting Periodic Trajectory Tracking: Model Predictive Control with a Periodic Observer ($\Pi$-MPC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Model Predictive Control (MPC), discrepancies between the actual system and the predictive model can lead to substantial tracking errors and significantly degrade performance and reliability. While such discrepancies can be alleviated with more complex models, this often complicates controller design and implementation. By leveraging the fact that many trajectories of interest are periodic, we show that perfect tracking is possible when incorporating a simple observer that estimates and compensates for periodic disturbances. We present the design of the observer and the accompanying tracking MPC scheme, proving that their combination achieves zero tracking error asymptotically, regardless of the complexity of the unmodelled dynamics. We validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating asymptotically perfect tracking on a high-dimensional soft robot with nearly 10,000 states and a fivefold reduction in tracking errors compared to a baseline MPC on small-scale autonomous race car experiments.</description>

      <title>Fair Mixed Effects Support Vector Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To ensure unbiased and ethical automated predictions, fairness must be a core principle in machine learning applications. Fairness in machine learning aims to mitigate biases present in the training data and model imperfections that could lead to discriminatory outcomes. This is achieved by preventing the model from making decisions based on sensitive characteristics like ethnicity or sexual orientation. A fundamental assumption in machine learning is the independence of observations. However, this assumption often does not hold true for data describing social phenomena, where data points are often clustered based. Hence, if the machine learning models do not account for the cluster correlations, the results may be biased. Especially high is the bias in cases where the cluster assignment is correlated to the variable of interest. We present a fair mixed effects support vector machine algorithm that can handle both problems simultaneously. With a reproducible simulation study we demonstrate the impact of clustered data on the quality of fair machine learning predictions.</description>

      <title>Cross-Dimensional Mathematics: A Foundation For STP/STA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new mathematical structure, called the cross-dimensional mathematics (CDM), is proposed. The CDM considered in this paper consists of three parts: hyper algebra, hyper geometry, and hyper Lie group/Lie algebra. Hyper algebra proposes some new algebraic structures such as hyper group, hyper ring, and hyper module over matrices and vectors with mixed dimensions (MVMDs). They have sets of classical groups, rings, and modules as their components and cross-dimensional connections among their components. Their basic properties are investigated. Hyper geometry starts from mixed dimensional Euclidian space, and hyper vector space. Then the hyper topological vector space, hyper inner product space, and hyper manifold are constructed. They have a joined cross-dimensional geometric structure. Finally, hyper metric space, topological hyper group and hyper Lie algebra are built gradually, and finally, the corresponding hyper Lie group is introduced. All these concepts are built over MVMDs, and to reach our purpose in addition to existing semi-tensor products (STPs) and semi-tensor additions (STAs), a couple of most general STP and STA are introduced. Some existing structures/results about STPs/STAs have also been resumed and integrated into this CDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-horizon tasks, which have a large discount factor, pose a challenge for most conventional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Algorithms such as Value Iteration and Temporal Difference (TD) learning have a slow convergence rate and become inefficient in these tasks. When the transition distributions are given, PID VI was recently introduced to accelerate the convergence of Value Iteration using ideas from control theory. Inspired by this, we introduce PID TD Learning and PID Q-Learning algorithms for the RL setting, in which only samples from the environment are available. We give a theoretical analysis of the convergence of PID TD Learning and its acceleration compared to the conventional TD Learning. We also introduce a method for adapting PID gains in the presence of noise and empirically verify its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Reachability Analysis of Stochastic Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the reachability problem for continuous-time stochastic dynamic systems. Our objective is to present a unified framework that characterizes the reachable set of a dynamic system in the presence of both stochastic disturbances and deterministic inputs. To achieve this, we devise a strategy that effectively decouples the effects of deterministic inputs and stochastic disturbances on the reachable sets of the system. For the deterministic part, many existing methods can capture the deterministic reachability. As for the stochastic disturbances, we introduce a novel technique that probabilistically bounds the difference between a stochastic trajectory and its deterministic counterpart. The key to our approach is introducing a novel energy function termed the Averaged Moment Generating Function that yields a high probability bound for this difference. This bound is tight and exact for linear stochastic dynamics and applicable to a large class of nonlinear stochastic dynamics. By combining our innovative technique with existing methods for deterministic reachability analysis, we can compute estimations of reachable sets that surpass those obtained with current approaches for stochastic reachability analysis. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through various numerical experiments. Beyond its immediate applications in reachability analysis, our methodology is poised to have profound implications in the broader analysis and control of stochastic systems. It opens avenues for enhanced understanding and manipulation of complex stochastic dynamics, presenting opportunities for advancements in related fields.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Policy Identification in Robust Constrained Markov Decision Processes via Epigraph Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing a safe policy for uncertain environments is crucial in real-world control applications. However, this challenge remains inadequately addressed within the Markov decision process (MDP) framework. This paper presents the first algorithm capable of identifying a near-optimal policy in a robust constrained MDP (RCMDP), where an optimal policy minimizes cumulative cost while satisfying constraints in the worst-case scenario across a set of environments. We first prove that the conventional Lagrangian max-min formulation with policy gradient methods can become trapped in suboptimal solutions by encountering a sum of conflicting gradients from the objective and constraint functions during its inner minimization problem. To address this, we leverage the epigraph form of the RCMDP problem, which resolves the conflict by selecting a single gradient from either the objective or the constraints. Building on the epigraph form, we propose a binary search algorithm with a policy gradient subroutine and prove that it identifies an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in an RCMDP with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ policy evaluations.</description>
