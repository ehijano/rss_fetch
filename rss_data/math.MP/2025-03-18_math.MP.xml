      <title>Electric potentials and field lines for uniformly-charged tube and cylinder expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function and integration of $Z(u|m) \mathrm{sc}(u|m)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The closed-form expressions of electric potentials and field lines for a uniformly-charged tube and cylinder are presented using elliptic integrals and Appell's hypergeometric functions, where field lines are depicted by introducing the concept of the field line potential in axisymmetric systems, whose contour lines represent electric field lines outside the charged region, thought of as an analog of the conjugate harmonic function in the presence of non-uniform metric. The field line potential for the tube shows a multi-valued behavior and enables us to define a topological charge. The integral of $Z(u|m)\operatorname{sc}(u|m)$, where $ Z $ and $ \operatorname{sc} $ are the Jacobi zeta and elliptic functions, is also expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function as a by-product, which was missing in classical tables of formulas.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to extend the Kitaev model to a general dimensional diamond crystal.

      <title>Topological edge states of continuous Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the topological classification of continuous Hamiltonians that find applications in biased cold plasmas and photonics. Besides a magnetic bias, the Hamiltonians are parametrized by a plasma frequency and a fixed vertical wavenumber. Eight distinct phases of matter are identified as these parameters vary. When insulating gaps are shared by two such phases, asymmetric edge modes propagate along interfaces separating the two phases. Here we apply the notion of a bulk difference invariant (BDI) to this Hamiltonian, and show by numerical diagonalizations of interface Hamiltonians that after an appropriate regularization our BDI correctly predicts edge transport as described by a bulk edge correspondence. We also derive theoretical tools to compute the BDI and show the limitations of the bulk edge correspondence (BEC) when the phase transition is too singular.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov exponent for quantum graphs that are elements of a subshift of finite type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Schr\"odinger operator on the quantum graph whose edges connect the points of ${\Bbb Z}$. The numbers of the edges connecting two consecutive points $n$ and $n+1$ are read along the orbits of a shift of finite type. We prove that the Lyapunov exponent is potitive for energies $E$ that do not belong to a discrete subset of $[0,\infty)$. The number of points $E$ of this subset in $[(\pi (j-1))^2, (\pi j)^2]$ is the same for all $j\in {\Bbb N}$.</description>

      <title>Hadamard states for decomposable Green-hyperbolic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadamard states were originally introduced for quantised Klein-Gordon fields and occupy a central position in the theory of quantum fields on curved spacetimes. Subsequently they have been developed for other linear theories, such as the Dirac, Proca and Maxwell fields, but the particular features of each require slightly different treatments.
  The first aim of this paper is to give a generalised definition of Hadamard states for linear bosonic and fermionic theories encompassing a range of theories that are described by Green-hyperbolic operators with 'decomposable' Pauli-Jordan propagators, including theories whose bicharacteristic curves are not necessarily determined by the spacetime metric. The new definition reduces to previous definitions for normally hyperbolic and Dirac-type operators. We develop the theory of Hadamard states in detail, showing that our definition propagates under the equation of motion, and is also stable under pullbacks and suitable pushforwards. There is an equivalent formulation in terms of Hilbert space valued distributions, and the generalised Hadamard condition on 2-point functions constrains the singular behaviour of all $n$-point functions. For locally covariant theories, the Hadamard states form a covariant state space. It is also shown how Hadamard states may be combined through tensor products or reduced by partial tracing while preserving the Hadamard property. As a particular application it is shown that state updates resulting from nonselective measurements preserve the Hadamard condition.
  The treatment we give was partly inspired by a recent work of Moretti, Murro and Volpe (MMV) on the neutral Proca field. Among our other applications, we revisit the neutral Proca field and prove a complete equivalence between the MMV definition of Hadamard states and an older work of Fewster and Pfenning.</description>

      <title>Polarisation sets of Green operators for normally hyperbolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarisation set of a vector-valued distribution generalises the wavefront set and captures fibre-directional information about its singularities in addition to their phase space description. Motivated by problems in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes, we consider normally hyperbolic operators on vector bundles over globally hyperbolic spacetimes, and compute the polarisation sets of the kernel distributions for their advanced and retarded Green operators and the difference thereof. This permits the computation of related polarisation and wavefront sets for operators whose solution theory is related to the normally hyperbolic case. As a particular example, we consider the Proca equation that describes massive relativistic spin-1 particles, identifying and closing a gap in a recent paper on that subject.</description>

      <title>Stable homotopy theory of invertible gapped quantum spin systems I: Kitaev's $\Omega$-spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical realization of a proposal by Kitaev, on the basis of the operator-algebraic formulation of infinite quantum spin systems. Our main results are threefold. First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--L\"{u}ck assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study coupled complex modified Korteweg-de Vries (ccmKdV) equation by combining the Hirota's method and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) reduction method. First, we show that the bilinear form of the ccmKdV equation under nonzero boundary condition is linked to the discrete BKP hierarchy through Miwa transformation. Based on this finding, we construct the dark-dark soliton solution in the pfaffian form. The dynamical behaviors for one- and two-soliton are analyzed and illustrated.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in the Universal Structures in B-model Topological String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a systematic analysis of Alim-Yau-Zhou's double scaling limit and Couso-Santamar\'{i}a's large radius limit for the perturbative free energies in B-model topological string theory based on \'Ecalle's Resurgence Theory. Taking advantage of the known resurgent properties of the formal solutions to the Airy equation and of the stability of resurgent series under exponential/logarithm and nonlinear changes of variable, we show how to rigorously derive the non-perturbative information from the perturbative one by means of alien calculus in this context, spelling out the notions of formal integral and Bridge Equation, typical of the resurgent approach to ordinary differential equations. We also discuss the Borel-Laplace summation of the obtained resurgent transseries, including a study of real analyticity based on the connection formulas stemming from the resummation of the Bridge Equation.</description>

      <title>Scale-Dependent Suppression Functions and Functional Space Geometry in Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13196v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the effects of a scale-dependent suppression function $\Omega(k, \Lambda)$ on the functional space geometry in renormalization theory. By introducing a dynamical cutoff scale $\Lambda$, the suppression function smoothly regulates high-momentum contributions without requiring a hard cutoff. We show that $\Omega(k, \Lambda)$ induces a modified metric on functional space, leading to a non-trivial Ricci curvature that becomes increasingly negative in the ultraviolet (UV) limit. This effect dynamically suppresses high-energy states, yielding a controlled deformation of the functional domain. Furthermore, we derive the renormalization group (RG) flow of $\Omega(k, \Lambda)$ and demonstrate its role in controlling the curvature flow of the functional space. The suppression function leads to spectral modifications that suggest an effective dimensional reduction at high energies, a feature relevant to functional space deformations and integral convergence in renormalization theory. Our findings provide a mathematical framework for studying regularization techniques and their role in the UV behavior of function spaces.</description>

      <title>Spherical accretion of a collisionless kinetic gas into a generic static black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a nontrivial extension of the problem of spherical accretion of a collisionless kinetic gas into the standard Schwarzschild black hole. This extension consists of replacing the Schwarzschild black hole by generic static and spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes with the aim of studying the effects of either modified gravitational theories beyond Einstein gravity or matter sources coupled to general relativity on the accretion process. This generalization also allows us to investigate the accretion into other types of black hole spacetimes, such as ones inspired by loop quantum gravity and string theory. To do so, we take into account a large class of static and spherically symmetric black holes whose spacetime is asymptotically flat with a positive total mass, has a regular Killing horizon, and satisfies appropriate monotonicity conditions of the metric functions. We provide the most general solution of the collisionless Boltzmann equation on such spacetimes by expressing the one-particle distribution function in terms of suitable symplectic coordinates on the cotangent bundle, and we calculate the relevant observables, such as particle current density and energy-momentum-stress tensor. Specializing to the case where the gas is described by an isotropic ideal fluid at rest at infinity, we compute the mass accretion rate and compression ratio, and we show that the tangential pressure is larger than the radial one at the horizon, indicating that the behavior of a collisionless gas is different from the one of an isotropic perfect fluid. As an example, we apply our generic formulae to two special black hole spacetimes, namely the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and a loop quantum corrected black hole. We explore the effects of the free parameters on the observables and accretion rate, and we compare the results with those corresponding to the Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion via iterative quantitative homogenization: an overview of the main ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous diffusion is the fundamental ansatz of phenomenological theories of passive scalar turbulence, and has been confirmed numerically and experimentally to an extraordinary extent. The purpose of this survey is to discuss our recent result, in which we construct a class of incompressible vector fields that have many of the properties observed in a fully turbulent velocity field, and for which the associated scalar advection-diffusion equation generically displays anomalous diffusion. Our main contribution is to propose an analytical framework in which to study anomalous diffusion via a backward cascade of renormalized eddy viscosities.</description>

      <title>Rigorous analysis of shape transitions in frustrated elastic ribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ribbons are elastic bodies of thickness $t$ and width $w$, where $t\ll w\ll 1$. Many ribbons in nature have a non-trivial internal geometry, making them incompatible with the Euclidean space; this incompatibility, which can be represented as a failure of the Gauss-Codazzi equations for surfaces, often results in shape transitions between narrow and wide ribbons. These transitions depend on the internal geometry: ribbons whose incompatibility arises from failure of the Gauss equation always exhibit a transition, whereas some, but not all, of those whose incompatibility arises from failure of the Codazzi equations do. We give the first rigorous analysis of this behavior, mainly for ribbons whose first fundamental form is flat: for Gauss-incompatible ribbons we identify the natural energy scaling of the problem and prove the existence of a shape transition, and for Codazzi-incompatible ribbons we give a necessary condition for a transition to occur. The results are obtained by calculating the $\Gamma$-limits, as $t,w\to 0$, for narrow ribbons ($w^2 \ll t$), and wide ribbons (taking $t$ to zero and then $w$), in the natural energy scalings dictated by the internal geometry.</description>

      <title>Dynamical field theories for biaxial liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase field crystal (PFC) models constitute central tools for a microscopic understanding of the dynamics of complex systems in soft matter physics. They have found widespread application in the modeling of the uniaxial orientational ordering of liquid crystals. However, only very limited progress has been made in applying them to the more complex cases of biaxial phases and biaxial particles. Here, we discuss the microscopic derivation of PFC models for biaxial liquid crystals. We illustrate it by presenting two models, one involving four scalar orientational order parameters relevant for the dynamics of biaxial particles, and one involving two scalar order parameters and a director field to describe biaxial phases in a three-dimensional uniaxial nematic liquid crystal. These models allow for an efficient simulation of spatially inhomogeneous biaxial orientational ordering dynamics. We also combine a microscopic and macroscopic approach to extract model coefficients for a full biaxial model from the microscopic derivation for a simple special case. This universal method also enables to perform derivations for other low-symmetry particles where, due to the complexity of the general case, this has not been previously attempted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geometries associated with 3-forms of various orbital types on a symplectic 6-manifold. We demonstrate that certain unstable 3-forms, which naturally emerge from specific degenerations of Calabi-Yau structures, exhibit remarkably rich geometric properties. This, in turn, offers a novel perspective on the SYZ conjecture.</description>

      <title>On Product Lie Algebroids, and Collective Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the geometrical/algebraic framework of Lie algebroids, with a specific focus on the decoupling and coupling phenomena within the bicocycle double cross product realization. The bicocycle double cross product theory serves as the most general method for (de)coupling an algebroid into the direct sum of two vector bundles in the presence of mutual \textit{representations}, along with two twisted cocycle terms. Consequently, it encompasses unified product, double cross product (matched pairs), semi-direct product, and cocycle extension frameworks as particular instances. In addition to algebraic constructions, the research extends to both reversible and irreversible Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics on (de)coupled Lie algebroids, as well as Euler-Poincar\'{e}-(Herglotz) and Lie-Poisson-(Herglotz) dynamics on (de)coupled Lie algebras, providing insights into potential physical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze asymptotic height function fluctuations in uniformly random domino tiling models on multiply connected Temperleyan domains. Starting from asymptotic formulas derived by Kenyon [arXiv:math-ph/9910002v1], we show that (1) the difference of the centered height function and a harmonic function with boundary values given by the (random) centered hole heights converges in the sense of moments to a Gaussian free field, which is independent of the hole heights, and (2) the hole heights themselves converge in distribution to a discrete Gaussian random vector. These results confirm general predictions about height fluctuations for tilings on multiply connected domains.</description>

      <title>Photon spheres, gravitational lensing/mirroring, and greybody radiation in deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black holes with phantom global monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the geodesic structure, gravitational lensing/mirroring phenomena, and scalar perturbations of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black holes with global monopoles, incorporating both ordinary and phantom configurations. We introduce a modified black hole metric characterized by a deformation parameter $\alpha$, a control parameter $\beta$, and a symmetry-breaking scale parameter $\eta$, which collectively influence the spacetime geometry. Through comprehensive geodesic analysis, we determine the photon sphere radius numerically for various parameter configurations, revealing significant differences between ordinary and phantom global monopoles. The stability of timelike circular orbits is assessed via the Lyapunov exponent, demonstrating how these parameters affect orbital dynamics. Our gravitational lensing analysis, employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, reveals a remarkable gravitational mirroring effect in phantom monopole spacetimes at high AdS curvature radii, where light rays experience negative deflection angles-being repelled rather than attracted by the gravitational field. Furthermore, we analyze massless scalar perturbations and derive the corresponding greybody factors, which characterize the transmission of Hawking radiation through the effective potential barrier surrounding the black hole. Our numerical results indicate that phantom global monopoles substantially modify both gravitational lensing/mirroring properties and the radiation spectrum compared to ordinary monopoles. The presence of the deformation parameter $\alpha$ introduces additional complexity to the system, leading to distinct thermodynamic behavior that deviates significantly from the standard AdS-Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of the largest eigenvalue for deformed GOE/GUE random matrices via replica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the probability distribution function $P(\lambda)$ of the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\rm max}$ of $N \times N$ random matrices of the form $H + V$, where $H$ belongs to the GOE/GUE ensemble and $V$ is a full rank deterministic diagonal perturbation. This model is related to spherical spin glasses and semi-discrete directed polymers. In the large $N$ limit, using the replica method introduced in Ref. \cite{TrivializationUs2014}, we obtain the rate function ${\cal L}(\lambda)$ which describes the upper large deviation tail $P(\lambda) \sim e^{- \beta N {\cal L}(\lambda) }$. We also obtain the moment generating function $\langle e^{N s {\lambda}_{\max} } \rangle \sim e^{N \phi(s)}$ and the overlap of the optimal eigenvector with the perturbation $V$. For suitable $V$, a transition generically occurs in the rate functions. For the GUE it has a direct interpretation as a localisation transition for tilted directed polymers with competing columnar and point disorder. Although in a different form, our results are consistent with those obtained recently by Mc Kenna in \cite{McKenna2021}. Finally, we consider briefly the quadratic optimisation problem in presence of an additional random field and obtain its large deviation rate function, although only within the replica symmetric phase.</description>

      <title>Quantum physics informed neural networks for multi-variable partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks (QPINNs) integrate quantum computing and machine learning to impose physical biases on the output of a quantum neural network, aiming to either solve or discover differential equations. The approach has recently been implemented on both the gate model and continuous variable quantum computing architecture, where it has been demonstrated capable of solving ordinary differential equations. Here, we aim to extend the method to effectively address a wider range of equations, such as the Poisson equation and the heat equation. To achieve this goal, we introduce an architecture specifically designed to compute second-order (and higher-order) derivatives without relying on nested automatic differentiation methods. This approach mitigates the unwanted side effects associated with nested gradients in simulations, paving the way for more efficient and accurate implementations. By leveraging such an approach, the quantum circuit addresses partial differential equations -- a challenge not yet tackled using this approach on continuous-variable quantum computers. As a proof-of-concept, we solve a one-dimensional instance of the heat equation, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling PDEs. Such a framework paves the way for further developments in continuous-variable quantum computing and underscores its potential contributions to advancing quantum machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct the Born and inverse Born approximation and series to recover two function-valued coefficients in the Helmholtz equation for inverse scattering problems from the scattering data at two different frequencies. An analysis of the convergence and approximation error of the proposed regularized inverse Born series is provided. The results show that the proposed series converges when the inverse Born approximations of the perturbations are sufficiently small. The preliminary numerical results show the capability of the proposed regularized inverse Born approximation and series for recovering the isotropic inhomogeneous media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the formal $\hbar$-power series solution of the deformed Painlev\'{e} I equation is resurgent, which means it is generically Borel summable and its Borel transform admits endless analytic continuation. In particular, we find that the Borel transform defines a global multivalued holomorphic function on a singular algebraic surface isomorphic to the Fermat quintic surface $x^5 + y^5 + z^5 = 0$ modulo an involution. This surface is an algebraic fibration over the complex plane of the differential equation with generic fibre a smooth quintic curve. Each fibre is equipped with a fivefold covering map over another complex plane (the Borel plane) with ten ramification points (the Borel singularities) spread equally over two branch points giving two opposite Stokes rays.</description>

      <title>Optimization-based method for conjugate heat transfer problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical approach for solving conjugate heat transfer problems using the finite volume method. This approach combines a semi-implicit scheme for fluid flow, governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with an optimization-based approach for heat transfer across the fluid-solid interface. In the semi-implicit method, the convective term in the momentum equation is treated explicitly, ensuring computational efficiency, while maintaining stability when a CFL condition involving fluid velocity is satisfied. Heat exchange between the fluid and solid domains is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, which is efficiently solved using a sequential quadratic programming method. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Topological Engineering of High-Order Exceptional Points through Transformation Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian photonic systems have attracted considerable research interest due to their singular eigenvalue topology and associated anomalous physical phenomena. These properties enable diverse applications ranging from enhanced quantum metrology to chiral light-matter interactions. Practical implementation of high order EPs in optical platforms however remains fundamentally challenging, requiring precise multi-parameter control that often exceeds conventional design capabilities. This work presents a novel framework for engineering high order EPs through transformation optics (TO) principles, establishing a direct correspondence between mathematical singularities and physically controllable parameters. Our TO-based paradigm addresses critical limitations in conventional Hamiltonian approaches, where abstract parameter spaces lack explicit connections to experimentally accessible degrees of freedom, while simultaneously providing full-field mode solutions. In contrast to prevailing parity-time-symmetric architectures, our methodology eliminates symmetry constraints in EP design, significantly expanding the possibilities in non-Hermitian photonic engineering. The proposed technique enables unprecedented control over EP formation and evolution in nanophotonic systems, offering new pathways for developing topological optical devices with enhanced functionality and robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an antiferromagnet in one space dimension with easy-axis anisotropy in a perpendicular magnetic field. We study propagating domain wall solutions that can have a velocity up to a maximum $v_c$. The width of the domain wall is a non-monotonic function of the velocity and it diverges to infinity at $v_c$. Both features are in contrast to the case of the Lorentz invariant model in the absence of the field. We further study the modification of the wall profile when a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is added. Finally, we present a propagating spiral expected to form when the system is forced at a velocity higher than the maximum velocity for domain walls and we give numerical results for the effect of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.</description>

      <title>On minimizing curves in a Brownian potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a $(1+1)$-dimensional semi-discrete random variational problem that can be interpreted as the geometrically linearized version of the critical $2$-dimensional random field Ising model. The scaling of the correlation length of the latter was recently characterized in [11] and [12, Section 5]; our analysis is reminiscent of the multi-scale approach of that work. We show that at every dyadic scale from the system size down to the lattice spacing the minimizer contains at most order-one Dirichlet energy per unit length. To this purpose we adapt arguments from [9] on the $(d+1)$-dimensional version our the model, with a Brownian replacing the white noise potential, to obtain the initial large-scale bounds. Based on our bounds on the $(p=3)$-Dirichlet energy, we give an informal justification of the geometric linearization. Our bounds, which are oblivious to the microscopic cut-off scale provided by the lattice spacing, yield tightness of the law of minimizers in the space of continuous functions as the lattice spacing is sent to zero.</description>

Abstract: We continue our work [arXiv:2403.07628] on asymptotic expansions at the soft edge for the classical $n$-dimensional Gaussian and Laguerre random matrix ensembles. By revisiting the construction of the associated skew-orthogonal polynomials in terms of wave functions, we obtain concise expressions for the level densities that are well suited for proving asymptotic expansions in powers of a certain parameter $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$. In the unitary case, the expansion for the level density can be used to reconstruct the first correction term in an established asymptotic expansion of the associated generating function. In the orthogonal and symplectic cases, we can even reconstruct the conjectured first and second correction terms.</description>

      <title>Boundary Conditions for the Entanglement Cut in 2D Conformal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement spectra for a subsystem in a spin chain fine-tuned to a quantum-critical point contains signatures of the underlying quantum field theory that governs its low-energy properties. For an open chain with given boundary conditions described by a 2D conformal field theory~(CFT), the entanglement spectrum of the left/right half of the system coincides with a boundary CFT spectrum, where one of the boundary conditions arise due to the `entanglement cut'. The latter has been argued to be conformal and has been numerically found to be the `free' boundary condition for Ising, Potts and free boson theories. For these models, the `free' boundary condition for the lattice degree of freedom has a counterpart in the continuum theory. However, this is not true in general. Here, this question is analyzed for the unitary minimal models of 2D CFTs using the density matrix renormalization group technique. The entanglement spectra are computed for blocks of spins in open chains of A-type restricted solid-on-solid models with identical boundary conditions at the ends. The imposed boundary conditions are realized exactly for these lattice models due to their integrable nature. The obtained entanglement spectra are in good agreement with certain boundary CFT spectra. The boundary condition for the entanglement cut is found to be conformal and to coincide with the one with the highest boundary entropy. This identification enables determination of the exponents governing the unusual corrections to the entanglement entropy from the CFT partition functions. These are compared with numerical results.</description>

Abstract: We describe the use of confluent Darboux transformations for Schr\"odinger operators, and how they give rise to explicit Wronskian formulae for certain algebraic solutions of Painlev\'e equations. As a preliminary illustration, we briefly describe how the Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials arise in this way, thus providing well-known expressions for the tau functions of the rational solutions of the Painlev\'e II equation. We then proceed to apply the method to obtain the main result, namely a new Wronskian representation for the Ohyama polynomials, which correspond to the algebraic solutions of the Painlev\'e III equation of type $D_7$.</description>

      <title>Gapless Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of gapless phases with categorical (or so-called non-invertible) symmetries is a formidable task, in particular in higher than two space-time dimensions. In this paper we build on previous works arXiv:2408.05266 and arXiv:2502.20440 on gapped phases in (2+1)d and provide a systematic framework to study phase transitions with categorical symmetries. The Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) is, as often in these matters, the central tool. Applied to gapless theories, we need to consider the extension of the SymTFT to interfaces between topological orders, so-called ``club sandwiches", which realize generalizations of so-called Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations. This requires an input phase transition for a smaller symmetry, such as the Ising transition for $\mathbb{Z}_2$, and the SymTFT constructs a transformation to a gapless phase with a larger categorical symmetry. We carry this out for categorical symmetries whose SymTFT is a (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theory for a finite group $G$ with twist -- so-called all bosonic fusion 2-categories. We classify such interfaces using a physically motivated picture of generalized gauging, as well as with a complementary analysis using (bi-)module 2-categories.This is exemplified in numerous abelian and non-abelian DW theories, giving rise to interesting gapless phases such as intrinsically gapless symmetry protected phases (igSPTs) and spontaneous symmetry breaking phases (igSSBs) from abelian, $S_3$, and $D_8$ DW theories.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Schr\"odinger equation for potentials with inverse-square singularities: Generalized Trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a renormalization procedure necessary for the complete description of the energy spectra of a one-dimensional stationary Schr\"odinger equation with a potential that exhibits inverse-square singularities. We apply and extend the methods introduced in our recent paper on the hyperbolic P\"oschl-Teller potential (with a single singularity) to its trigonometric version. This potential, defined between two singularities, is analyzed across the entire bidimensional coupling space. The fact that the trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller potential is supersymmetric and shape-invariant simplifies the analysis and eliminates the need for self-adjoint extensions in certain coupling regions. However, if at least one coupling is strongly attractive, the renormalization is essential to construct a discrete energy spectrum family of one or two parameters. We also investigate the features of a singular symmetric double well obtained by extending the range of the trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller potential. It has a non-degenerate energy spectrum and eigenstates with well-defined parity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce matrix quantum phase-space distributions. These extend the idea of a quantum phase-space representation via projections onto a density matrix of global symmetry variables. The method is applied to verification of low-loss Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) quantum computational advantage experiments with up to 10,000 modes, where classically generating photon-number counts is exponentially hard. We demonstrate improvements in sampling error by a factor of 1000 or more compared to unprojected methods, which are infeasible for such cases.</description>

      <title>Gravito-turbulent bi-fluid protoplanetary discs: 1. An analytical perspective to stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. In Class 0/I and the outskirts of Class II circumstellar discs, the self-gravity of gas significantly affects the disc's vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. The contribution of dust, whose measured mass is still uncertain, could influence this equilibrium. Aims. We aim to formulate and solve approximately the equations governing the hydrostatic equilibrium of a self-gravitating disc composed of gas and dust. Particularly, we aim to provide a fully consistent treatment of turbulence and gravity, affecting almost symmetrically gas and dust. Observationally, we study the possibility of indirectly measuring disc masses through gas layering and dust settling measurements. Methods. We used analytical methods to approximate the solution of the 1D Liouville equation with additional non-linearities governing the stratification of a self-gravitating protoplanetary disc. The findings were verified numerically and validated through physical interpretation. Results. For a constant vertical stopping time profile, we discovered a nearly exact layering solution valid across all self-gravity regimes for gas and dust. From first principles, we defined the Toomre parameter of a bi-fluid system as the harmonic average of its constituents' Toomre parameters. Based on these findings, we propose a method to estimate disc mass through gas or dust settling observations. We introduce a generic definition of the dust-to-gas scale height, applicable to complex profiles. We also identified new exact solutions for benchmarking self-gravity solvers in numerical codes. Conclusions. The hydrostatic equilibrium of a gas/dust mixture is governed by their Toomre parameters and effective relative temperature. This equilibrium could be used for measuring disc masses, improving our understanding of disc settling and gravitational collapse, and enhancing the computation of self-gravity in thin disc simulations.</description>

      <title>Breather interactions in the integrable discrete Manakov system and trigonometric Yang-Baxter maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to obtain a complete characterization of soliton and breather interactions in the integrable discrete Manakov (IDM) system, a vector generalization of the Ablowitz-Ladik model. The IDM system, which in the continuous limit reduces to the Manakov system (i.e., a 2-component vector nonlinear Schrodinger equation), was shown to admit a variety of discrete vector soliton solutions: fundamental solitons, fundamental breathers, and composite breathers. While the interaction of fundamental solitons was studied early on, no results are presently available for other types of soliton-breather and breather-breather interactions. Our study reveals that upon interacting with a fundamental breather, a fundamental soliton becomes a fundamental breather. Conversely, the interaction of two fundamental breathers generically yields two fundamental breathers with polarization shifts, but may also result in a fundamental soliton and a fundamental breather. Composite breathers interact trivially both with each other and with a fundamental soliton or breather. Explicit formulas for the scattering coefficients that characterize fundamental and composite breathers are given. This allows us to interpret the interactions in terms of a refactorization problem and derive the associated Yang-Baxter maps describing the effect of interactions on the polarizations. These give the first examples of parametric Yang-Baxter maps of trigonometric type.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov functions for Morse-Smale synchronisation diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical system governing the phase differences between three identical oscillators arranged symmetrically and coupled by burst interactions. By constructing a discrete Lyapunov function, we prove the existence of two asymptotically stable fixed points on the 2-torus T^2, which correspond to Huygens synchronisation of three clocks. The locked states have phase differences of (2 pi/3,4 pi/3) and (4 pi/3,2 pi/3). Each fixed point possesses an open basin of attraction. The closure of the union of the basins of attraction of the two asymptotically stable attractors is the torus T^2, implying that Huygens synchronisation occurs generically and with full Lebesgue measure with respect to initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Complex abstract Wiener spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real abstract Wiener spaces (AWS) were originally defined by Gross using measurable norms, as a generalisation of the theory of advanced integral calculus in infinite dimensions as introduced by Cameron and Martin. In this paper we present a rigorous, complete and self-contained general framework for $\mathbb{K}$-AWS, where $\mathbb{K} \in \{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\}$ using the language of characteristic functions instead of measurable norms. In particular, we will prove that $X$ is a centred resp. proper $H$-valued Gaussian field over $\mathbb{K}$ iff the covariance function can be written in terms of some non-negative, self-adjoint trace class operator, and that the existence and uniqueness of $X$ is equivalent to the $\mathbb{K}$-AWS. Finally we will relate the $\mathbb{C}$-AWS to the $\mathbb{R}$-AWS by way of a real structure, which is a real linear, complex anti-linear involution on a complex vector space. This allows for a commutative relation between the real and complex Gaussian fields and the real and complex abstract Wiener spaces. We will construct specific examples which fall under this framework like the complex Brownian motion, complex Feynman-Kac formula and complex fractional Gaussian fields.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for composite quantum hypothesis testing and a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal error exponents of binary composite i.i.d. state discrimination are trivially bounded by the worst-case pairwise exponents of discriminating individual elements of the sets representing the two hypotheses, and in the finite-dimensional classical case, these bounds in fact give exact single-copy expressions for the error exponents. In contrast, in the non-commutative case, the optimal exponents are only known to be expressible in terms of regularized divergences, resulting in formulas that, while conceptually relevant, practically not very useful. In this paper, we develop further an approach initiated in [Mosonyi, Szil\'agyi, Weiner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 68(2):1032--1067, 2022] to give improved single-copy bounds on the error exponents by comparing not only individual states from the two hypotheses, but also various unnormalized positive semi-definite operators associated to them. Here, we show a number of equivalent characterizations of such operators giving valid bounds, and show that in the commutative case, considering weighted geometric means of the states, and in the case of two states per hypothesis, considering weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means, are optimal for this approach. As a result, we give a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means as the only $2$-variable operator geometric means that are block additive, tensor multiplicative, and satisfy the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also extend our results to composite quantum channel discrimination, and show an analogous optimality property of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means of two quantum channels, a notion that seems to be new. We extend this concept to defining the notion of superoperator perspective function and establish some of its basic properties, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Can Yang-Baxter imply Lie algebra?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum knot invariants (like colored HOMFLY-PT or Kauffman polynomials) are a distinguished class of non-perturbative topological invariants. Any known way to construct them (via Chern-Simons theory or quantum R-matrix) starts with a finite simple Lie algebra. Another set of knot invariants - of finite type - is related to quantum invariants via a perturbative expansion. However can all finite type invariants be obtained in this way? Investigating this problem, P. Vogel discovered a way to polynomially parameterize the expansion coefficients with three parameters so that, at different specific values, this reproduces the answers for all simple Lie (super)algebras. Then it is easy to construct a polynomial $P_{alg}$ that vanishes for all simple Lie algebras, and the corresponding Vassiliev invariant would thus be absent from the perturbative expansion.
  We review these Vogel claims pointing out at least two interesting implications of his construction. First, we discuss whether infinite-dimensional Lie algebras might enlarge Chern-Simons theory. Second, Vogel's construction implies an alternative axiomatization of simple Lie algebras - when we start from knot invariants and arrive at Lie algebras and their classification, which is opposite to conventional logic that we mentioned at the beginning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the defocusing
  complex mKdV equation with finite density initial data
  \begin{align*} &amp;q_t+\frac{1}{2}q_{xxx}-3|q|^2q_{x}=0,\\ &amp;q(x,0)=q_{0}(x) \sim \pm 1, \ x\to \pm\infty, \end{align*}
  which can be formulated into a Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem. With
  $\bar\partial$-generation of the nonlinear steepest descent approach and a double scaling limit technique,
  in the transition region $$\mathcal{D}:=\left\{(x,t)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^+\big|-C&lt; \left(x/(2t)+3/2\right) t^{2/3}&lt;0, C\in\mathbb{R}^+\right\},$$
  we find that the long-time asymptotics of the solution $q(x,t)$ to the Cauchy problem
  is associated with the Painlev\'{e}-II transcendents.</description>

Abstract: We provide an explicit expression for the modular hamiltonian of the von Neumann algebras associated to the unit double cone for the (fermionic) quantum field theories of the 2-component Weyl (helicity 1/2) field, and of the 4-component massless Dirac and Majorana fields. To this end, we represent the one particle spaces of these theories in terms of solutions of the corresponding wave equations, and obtain the action of the modular group on them. As an application, we compute the relative entropy between the vacuum of the massless Majorana field and one particle states associated to waves with Cauchy data localized in the spatial unit ball.</description>

Abstract: We consider weakly interacting diffusions on the torus, for multichromatic interaction potentials. We consider interaction potentials that are not H-stable, leading to phase transitions in the mean field limit. We show that the mean field dynamics can exhibit multipeak stationary states, where the number of peaks is related to the number of nonzero Fourier modes of the interaction. We also consider the effect of a confining potential on the structure of non-uniform steady states. We approach the problem by means of analysis, perturbation theory and numerical simulations for the interacting particle systems and the PDEs.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum KMS states on spin lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the classical and quantum KMS conditions within the context of spin lattice systems. Specifically, we define a strict deformation quantization (SDQ) for a $\mathbb{S}^2$-valued spin lattice system over $\mathbb{Z}^d$ generalizing the renown Berezin SDQ for a single sphere. This allows to promote a classical dynamics on the algebra of classical observables to a quantum dynamics on the algebra of quantum observables. We then compare the notion of classical and quantum thermal equilibrium by showing that any weak*-limit point of a sequence of quantum KMS states fulfils the classical KMS condition. In short, this proves that the semiclassical limit of quantum thermal states describes classical thermal equilibrium, strenghtening the physical interpretation of the classical KMS condition. Finally we provide two sufficient conditions ensuring uniqueness of classical and quantum KMS states: The latter are based on an version of the Kirkwood-Salzburg equations adapted to the system of interest. As a consequence we identify a mild condition which ensures uniqueness of classical KMS states and of quantum KMS states for the quantized dynamics for a common sufficiently high temperature.</description>

      <title>Petz-R\'enyi relative entropy in QFT from modular theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the generalization of the Araki-Uhlmann formula for relative entropy to Petz-R\'enyi relative entropy. We compute this entropy for a free scalar field in the Minkowski wedge between the vacuum and a coherent state, as well as for the free chiral current in a thermal state. In contrast to the relative entropy which in these cases only depends on the sympletic form and thus reduces to the classical entropy of a wave packet, the Petz-R\'enyi relative entropy also depends on the symmetric part of the two-point function and is thus genuinely quantum. We also consider the relation with standard subspaces, where we define the R\'enyi entropy of a vector and show that it admits an upper bound given by the entropy of the vector.</description>

The particles under considerations, obeying a parastatistics, are mutually exchanged via the permutation group and can exist in any space dimension (the anyons, which transform under the more general braid group, cannot exist in more than two space dimensions).</description>

      <title>Generalized Buchdahl equations as Lie-Hamilton systems from the 'book' and oscillator algebras: Quantum deformations and their general solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the nonlinear second-order differential equations $$
  \ddot{x}(t)=a (x )\dot{x}(t)^2+b(t)\dot{x}(t)
  $$ where $a(x)$ and $b(t)$ are arbitrary functions on their argument from the perspective of Lie-Hamilton systems. For the particular choice $a(x)=3/x$ and $b(t)=1/t$, these equations reduce to the Buchdahl equation considered in the context of General Relativity. It is shown that these equations are associated to the 'book' Lie algebra $\mathfrak{b}_2$, determining a Lie-Hamilton system for which the corresponding $t$-dependent Hamiltonian and the general solution of the equations are given. The procedure is illustrated considering several particular cases. We also make use of the quantum deformation of $\mathfrak{b}_2$ with quantum deformation parameter $z$ (where $q={\rm e}^z$), leading to a deformed generalized Buchdahl equation. Applying the formalism of Poisson-Hopf deformations of Lie-Hamilton systems, we derive the corresponding deformed $t$-dependent Hamiltonian, as well as its general solution. The generalized Buchdahl equation is further extended to the oscillator Lie-Hamilton algebra $\mathfrak{h}_4\supset \mathfrak{b}_2$, together with its quantum deformation, and the corresponding (deformed) equations are also analyzed for their exact solutions. The presence of the quantum deformation parameter $z$ is interpreted as the introduction of an integrable perturbation of the (initial) generalized Buchdahl equation, which is described in detail in its linear approximation. Finally, it is also shown that, under quantum deformations, the higher-dimensional deformed generalized Buchdahl equations from either the book or the oscillator algebras do not reduce to a sum of copies of the initial system but to intrinsic coupled systems governed by $z$.</description>

      <title>Stable soap bubble clusters with multiple torus bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02736v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last two centuries and more particularly in the last decades, the geometry of foams has become an important research domain, in mathematics, physics, material sciences and biology. Most of the simplest geometrical observations of bubble clusters have long resisted rigorous mathematical proofs. Geometries can even get more complicated if immiscible fluids are considered. Although they have to fulfill Plateau's laws like soap bubble clusters if the surface tensions are close to unity, this is not the case in general. In 1996, Frederick J. Almgren asked whether there is "any stable cluster of bubbles in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with some bubble being topologically a torus". We propose to answer the latter numerically with simple numerical examples. We build stable soap bubble clusters with a triple torus bubble, a fivefold torus bubble or an elevenfold torus bubble. The construction uses the geometry of a simple immiscible fluids cluster with a torus bubble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.04662v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a vertex operator algebra $V$, we construct an explicit isomorphism between the space of genus-0 conformal blocks associated to permutation-twisted $V^{\otimes n}$-modules and the space of conformal blocks associated to untwisted $V$-modules and a branched covering C of the Riemann sphere. As a consequence, when V is CFT-type, rational, and C2 cofinite, the fusion rules for permutation-twisted modules are determined. We also relate the sewing and factorization of permutation-twisted $V^{\otimes n}$-conformal blocks and untwisted $V$-conformal blocks. Various applications are discussed.
  Note the differences in theorem and equation numbering between the arXiv version and the published version. Some terminology also varies: See Def. 2.2.1 (Def. 2.20 of the published version) for a slight difference in the meanings of $\mathbb U$. The term "Analytic Jacobi identity" in the arXiv version is called the "duality property" in the published version.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supermaps are Characterized by Locality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09844v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new characterisation of quantum supermaps in terms of an axiom that refers only to sequential and parallel composition. Consequently, we generalize quantum supermaps to arbitrary monoidal categories and operational probabilistic theories. We do so by providing a simple definition of locally-applicable transformation on a monoidal category. The definition can be rephrased in the language of category theory using the principle of naturality, and can be given an intuitive diagrammatic representation in terms of which all proofs are presented. In our main technical contribution, we use this diagrammatic representation to show that locally-applicable transformations on quantum channels are in one-to-one correspondence with deterministic quantum supermaps. This alternative characterization of quantum supermaps is proven to work for more general multiple-input supermaps such as the quantum switch and on arbitrary normal convex spaces of quantum channels such as those defined by satisfaction of signaling constraints.</description>

Abstract: The Lie-Trotter formula has been a fundamental tool in quantum mechanics, quantum computing, and quantum simulations. The error estimations for the Lie-Trotter product formula play a crucial role in achieving scalability and computational efficiency. In this note, we present two error estimates of Lie-Trotter product formulas, utilizing Jordan product within Banach algebras. Additionally, we introduce two generalized Lie-Trotter formula and provide two explicit estimation formulas. Consequently, the renowned Suzuki symmetrized approximation for the exponentiated sums follows directly from our main Theorem.</description>

      <title>Supersonic Gravitational Collapse for Non-Isentropic Gaseous Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of a new class of initially smooth spherically symmetric self-similar solutions to the non-isentropic Euler-Poisson system. These solutions exhibit supersonic gravitational implosion in the sense that the density blows-up in finite time while the fluid velocity remains supersonic. In particular, they occupy a portion of the phase space that is far from the recently constructed isentropic self-similar implosion. At the heart of our proof is the presence of a two-parameter scaling invariance and the reduction of the problem to a non-autonomous system of ordinary differential equations. We use the requirement of smoothness of the flow as a selection principle that constrains the choice of scaling indices. An important consequence of our analysis is that for all the solutions we construct, the polytropic index $\gamma$ is strictly bigger than $\frac{4}{3}$, which is in sharp contrast to the known results in the isentropic case.</description>

We use this result to prove a shape theorem for super-critical long-range percolation in the strong decay regime and to show transience of the infinite supercritical long-range percolation cluster in dimensions $d\geq 3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the mean-field spin models where the Gibbs measure of each configuration depends only on its magnetization. Based on the Stein and Laplace methods, we give a new and short proof for the scaling limit theorems with convergence rate for the magnetization in a perturbed model. As an application, we derive the scaling limit theorems for the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) in linear models. Remarkably, we characterize the full diagram of fluctuations for the magnetization and MLEs by analyzing the structure of the maximizers of a function associated with the Hamiltonian. For illustration, we apply our results to several well-known mixed spin models, as well as to the annealed Ising model on random regular graphs</description>

      <title>Decomposition of a system in pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work outlines a consistent method of identifying subsystems in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, independent of the underlying inner-product structure. Such Hilbert spaces arise in $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric quantum mechanics, where a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is made self-adjoint by changing the inner product using the so-called ``metric operator". This is the framework of pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. For composite quantum systems in this framework, defining subsystems is generally considered feasible only when the metric operator is chosen to have a tensor product form so that a partial trace operation can be well defined. In this work, we use arguments from algebraic quantum mechanics to show that the subsystems can be well-defined in every metric space - irrespective of whether or not the metric is of tensor product form. This is done by identifying subsystems with a decomposition of the underlying C*-algebra into commuting subalgebras. Although the choice of the metric is known to have no effect on the system's statistics, we show that different choices of the metric can lead to inequivalent subsystem decompositions. Each of the subsystems can be tomographically constructed and these subsystems satisfy the no-signalling principle. With these results, we put all the choices of the metric operator on an equal footing for composite systems.</description>

      <title>Trace Moments for Schr\"odinger Operators with Matrix White Noise and the Rigidity of the Multivariate Stochastic Airy Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the semigroups of random Schr\"odinger operators of the form $\widehat{H}f=-\frac12f''+(V+\xi)f$, where $f:I\to\mathbb F^r$ ($\mathbb F=\mathbb R,\mathbb C,\mathbb H$) are vector-valued functions on a possibly infinite interval $I\subset\mathbb R$ that satisfy a mix of Robin and Dirichlet boundary conditions, $V$ is a deterministic diagonal potential with power-law growth at infinity, and $\xi$ is a matrix white noise. Our main result consists of Feynman-Kac formulas for trace moments of the form $\mathbf E[\prod_{k=1}^n\mathrm{Tr}[\mathrm e^{-t_k\widehat{H}}]]$ ($n\in\mathbb N$, $t_k&gt;0$).
  One notable example covered by our main result consists of the multivariate stochastic Airy operator (SAO) of Bloemendal and Vir\'ag (Ann. Probab., 44(4):2726-2769, 2016), which characterizes the soft-edge eigenvalue fluctuations of critical rank-$r$ spiked Wishart and GO/U/SE random matrices. As a corollary of our main result, we prove that if $V$'s growth is at least linear (this includes the multivariate SAO), then $\widehat{H}$'s spectrum is number rigid in the sense of Ghosh and Peres (Duke Math. J., 166(10):1789-1858, 2017). Together with the rigidity of the scalar SAO, this completes the characterization of number rigidity in the soft-edge limits of Gaussian $\beta$-ensembles and their finite-rank spiked versions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy bounds for pure states of rapid decorrelation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For pure states of multi-dimensional quantum lattice systems, which in a convenient computational basis have amplitude and phase structure of sufficiently rapid decorrelation, we construct high fidelity approximations of relatively low complexity. These are used for a conditional proof of area-law bounds for the states' entanglement entropy. The condition is also shown to imply exponential decay of the state's mutual information between disjoint regions, and hence exponential clustering of local observables. The applicability of the general results is demonstrated on the quantum Ising model in transverse field. Combined with available model-specific information on spin-spin correlations, we establish an area-law type bound on the entanglement in the model's subcritical ground states, valid in all dimensions and up to the model's quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Weak gauge PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge PDEs generalise the AKSZ construction when dealing with generic local gauge theories. Despite being very flexible and invariant, these geometrical objects are usually infinite-dimensional and are difficult to define explicitly, just like standard infinitely-prolonged PDEs. We propose a notion of a weak gauge PDE in which the nilpotency of the BRST differential is relaxed in a controllable way. In this approach a nontopological local gauge theory can be described in terms of a finite-dimensional geometrical object. Moreover, among the equivalent weak gauge PDEs describing a given system, a minimal one can usually be found and is unique in a certain sense. In the case of a Lagrangian system, the respective weak gauge PDE naturally arises from its weak presymplectic formulation. We prove that any weak gauge PDE determines the standard jet-bundle Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of the underlying gauge theory, giving an unambiguous physical interpretation of these objects. The formalism is illustrated by a few examples, including the non-Lagrangian self-dual Yang-Mills theory and a finite jet-bundle. We also discuss possible applications of the approach to the characterisation of those infinite-dimensional gauge PDEs that correspond to local theories.</description>

Abstract: In (J. Stat. Phys. 132, 275-290, 2008) Borodin and P\'ech\'e introduced a generalization of the extended Airy kernel based on two infinite sets of parameters. For an arbitrary choice of parameters we construct determinantal point processes on $\mathbb{R}^2$ for these generalized kernels. In addition, for a subset of the parameter space we show that the point processes can be lifted to line ensembles on $\mathbb{R}$, which satisfy the Brownian Gibbs property. Our ensembles generalize the wanderer line ensembles introduced by Corwin and Hammond in (Invent. Math. 195, 441-508, 2014).</description>

      <title>Nappi-Witten vertex operator algebra via inverse Quantum Hamiltonian Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The representation theory of the Nappi-Witten VOA was initiated in arXiv:1104.3921 and arXiv:2011.14453. In this paper we use the technique of inverse quantum hamiltonian reduction to investigate the representation theory of the Nappi-Witten VOA $ V^1(\mathfrak h_4)$. We first prove that the quantum hamiltonian reduction of $ V^1(\mathfrak h_4)$ is the Heisenberg-Virasoro VOA $L^{HVir}$ of level zero investigated in arXiv:math/0201314 and arXiv:1405.1707. We invert the quantum hamiltonian reduction in this case and prove that $V^1(\mathfrak h_4)$ is realized as a vertex subalgebra of $L^{HVir} \otimes \Pi$, where $\Pi$ is a certain lattice-like vertex algebra. Using such an approach we shall realize all relaxed highest weight modules which were classified in arXiv:2011.14453. We show that every relaxed highest weight module, whose top components is neither highest nor lowest weight $\mathfrak h_4$-module, has the form $M_1 \otimes \Pi_{1} (\lambda)$ where $M_1$ is an irreducible, highest weight $L^{HVir}$-module and $\Pi_{1} (\lambda)$ is an irreducible weight $\Pi$-module.
  Using the fusion rules for $L^{HVir}$-modules and the previously developed methods of constructing logarithmic modules we are able to construct a family of logarithmic $V^1(\mathfrak h_4)$-modules. The Loewy diagrams of these logarithmic modules are completely analogous to the Loewy diagrams of projective modules of weight $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}(2))$-modules, so we expect that our logarithmic modules are also projective in a certain category of weight $ V^1(\mathfrak h_4)$-modules.</description>

      <title>Coupling constant metamorphosis, Fermat principle and light propagation in Kerr metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geodesics of Kerr's metric are described by the four-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics integrable in the Arnold-Liouville sense. It can be reduced to two-dimensional one by the use of Fermat's principle. The resulting Hamiltonian is, however, rather complicated. We show how one can apply the coupling constant metamorphosis to simplify the Hamiltonian to the one quadratic in momenta and depending on the initial "energy" as parameter. It describes a simple dynamics of two non-linear oscillators and can be integrated directly or evaluated in the framework of perturbation theory by adopting the elegant Lindstedt--Poincar\'e algorithm.</description>

      <title>Dynamical formulation of low-frequency scattering in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transfer matrix of scattering theory in one dimension can be expressed in terms of the time-evolution operator for an effective non-unitary quantum system. In particular, it admits a Dyson series expansion which turns out to facilitate the construction of the low-frequency series expansion of the scattering data. In two and three dimensions, there is a similar formulation of stationary scattering where the scattering properties of the scatterer are extracted from the evolution operator for a corresponding effective quantum system. We explore the utility of this approach to scattering theory in the study of the scattering of low-frequency time-harmonic scalar waves, $e^{-i\omega t}\psi(\mathbf{r})$, with $\psi(\mathbf{r})$ satisfying the Helmholtz equation, $[\nabla^2+k^2\hat\varepsilon(\mathbf{r};k)]\psi(\mathbf{r})=0$, $\omega$ and $k$ being respectively the angular frequency and wavenumber of the incident wave, and $\hat\varepsilon(\mathbf{r};k)$ denoting the relative permittivity of the carrier medium which in general takes complex values. We obtain explicit formulas for low-frequency scattering amplitude, examine their effectiveness in the study of a class of exactly solvable scattering problems, and outline their application in devising a low-frequency cloaking scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the system of first order PDEs for the pseudo-Riemannian metrics governing the Hamiltonian formalism for systems of hydrodynamic type. In the diagonal setting the Tsarev's integrability conditions ensure the compatibility of this system and, thanks to a classical theorem of Darboux, the existence of a family of solutions depending on functional parameters. In this paper we study the generalization of this result for the class of non-diagonalizable systems of hydrodymic type that naturally generalises Tsarev's integrable diagonal systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Groups as Global Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24142v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum field theories which have quantum groups as global internal symmetries. We show that in such theories operators are generically non-local, and should be thought as living at the ends of topological lines. We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.</description>

      <title>Energy and entropy conserving compatible finite elements with upwinding for the thermal shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a new compatible finite element formulation of the thermal shallow water equations that conserves energy and mathematical entropies given by buoyancy-related quadratic tracer variances. Our approach relies on restating the governing equations to enable discontinuous approximations of thermodynamic variables and a variational continuous time integration. A key novelty is the inclusion of centred and upwinded fluxes. The proposed semi-discrete system conserves discrete entropy for centred fluxes, monotonically damps entropy for upwinded fluxes, and conserves energy. The fully discrete scheme reflects entropy conservation at the continuous level. The ability of a new linearised Jacobian, which accounts for both centred and upwinded fluxes, to capture large variations in buoyancy and simulate thermally unstable flows for long periods of time is demonstrated for two different transient case studies. The first involves a thermogeostrophic instability where including upwinded fluxes is shown to suppress spurious oscillations while successfully conserving energy and monotonically damping entropy. The second is a double vortex where a constrained fully discrete formulation is shown to achieve exact entropy conservation in time.</description>

      <title>On some states minimizing uncertainty relations: A new look at these relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08131v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing Heisenberg--Robertson (HR) and Schr\"{o}dinger uncertainty relations we found, that there can exist a large set of states of the quantum system under considerations, for which the lower bound of the product of the standard deviations of a pair of non--commuting observables, $A$ and $B$, is zero. These states are not eigenstates of either the observable $A$ or $B$. The correlation function for these observables in such states is equal to zero. We have also shown that the so--called "sum uncertainty relations" also do not provide any information about lower bounds on the standard deviations calculated for these states. We additionally show that the uncertainty principle in its most general form has two faces: one is that it is a lower bound on the product of standard deviations, and the other is that the product of standard deviations is an upper bound on the modulus of the correlation function of a pair of the non--commuting observables in the state under consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a renormalization group flow preserving a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_1$. If it flows to a rational conformal field theory, the surviving symmetry $\mathcal S_1$ flows to a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_2$ with monoidal functor $F:\mathcal S_1\to\mathcal S_2$. By clarifying mathematical (especially category theoretical) meaning of renormalization group domain wall/interface or boundary condition, we find the hidden extended vertex operator (super)algebra gives a unique (up to braided equivalence) completely $(\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2)'$-anisotropic representative of the Witt equivalence class $[\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2]$. The mathematical conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets.
  The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $(A_{10},E_6)\to M(4,3)$.</description>

      <title>QG from SymQRG: AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ Correspondence as Topological Symmetry-Preserving Quantum RG Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By analyzing the non-perturbative RG flows that explicitly preserve given symmetries, we demonstrate that they can be expressed as quantum path integrals of the $\textit{SymTFT}$ in one higher dimension. When the symmetries involved include Virasoro defect lines, such as in the case of $T\bar{T}$ deformations, the RG flow corresponds to the 3D quantum gravitational path integral. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges as a non-perturbative constraint. These observations are summarized in the slogan: $\textbf{SymQRG = QG}$. The recently proposed exact discrete formulation of Liouville theory in [1] allows us to identify a universal SymQRG kernel, constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols associated with $U_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$. This kernel is directly related to the quantum path integral of the Virasoro TQFT, and manifests itself as an exact and analytical 3D background-independent MERA-type holographic tensor network. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS/CFT and topological holography. We propose that the non-perturbative AdS/CFT correspondence is a $\textit{maximal}$ form of topological holography.</description>

Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with certain continuous chiral and two-flavor symmetries. For the Hamiltonian of the model, we construct a ground state which breaks the parity and flavor symmetries. In our argument, the chiral symmetry plays a crucial role for proving the violation of the parity and flavor symmetries, although the model does not contain the so-called Wilson term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considered in this work is the Yang-Mills field in an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, a physically motivated mathematical model introduced by Bizo\'n and Kahl. The kink is a fundamental, strongly unstable stationary solution in this non-perturbative, variable coefficients model, with a polynomial tail and no explicit form. In this paper, we introduce and extend several virial techniques, adapt them to the inhomogeneous medium setting, and construct a finite codimensional manifold of the energy space where the kink is asymptotically stable. In particular, we handle, using virial techniques, the emergence of a weak threshold resonance in the description of the stable manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning based framework for discovering integrable models. Our approach first employs a synchronized ensemble of neural networks to find high-precision numerical solution to the Yang-Baxter equation within a specified class. Then, using an auxiliary system of algebraic equations, [Q_2, Q_3] = 0, and the numerical value of the Hamiltonian obtained via deep learning as a seed, we reconstruct the entire Hamiltonian family, forming an algebraic variety. We illustrate our presentation with three- and four-dimensional spin chains of difference form with local interactions. Remarkably, all discovered Hamiltonian families form rational varieties.</description>
