      <title>Realisation of de Gennes$'$ Absolute Superconducting Switch with a Heavy Metal Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1966, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes proposed a non-volatile mechanism for switching superconductivity on and off in a magnetic device. This involved a superconductor (S) sandwiched between ferromagnetic (F) insulators in which the net magnetic exchange field could be controlled through the magnetisation-orientation of the F layers. Because superconducting switches are attractive for a range of applications, extensive studies have been carried out on $F/S/F$ structures. Although these have demonstrated a sensitivity of the superconducting critical temperature ($T_{c}$) to parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) magnetisation-orientations of the F layers, corresponding shifts in $T_c$ (i.e., ${\Delta}T_c = T_{c,AP} - T_{c,P}$) are lower than predicted with ${\Delta}T_c$ only a small fraction of $T_{c,AP}$, precluding the development of applications. Here, we report $EuS/Au/Nb/EuS$ structures where EuS is an insulating ferromagnet, Nb is a superconductor and Au is a heavy metal. For P magnetisations, the superconducting state in this structure is quenched down to the lowest measured temperature of 20 mK meaning that ${\Delta}T_c/T_{c,AP}$ is practically 1. The key to this so-called absolute switching effect is a sizable spin-mixing conductance at the $EuS/Au$ interface which ensures a robust magnetic proximity effect, unlocking the potential of $F/S/F$ switches for low power electronics.</description>

      <title>Laguerre-Gaussian light induction of orbital currents and Kapitza stabilization in superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam on the superconducting state. We show that the vortex angular momentum of a LG beam affects the superconducting state and induces currents. The induction of the current by light is illustrated on a Josephson loop and SQUID devices. In particular, we establish that coupling a dc SQUID to the AC magnetic flux of a LG beam can stabilize pi phase in the SQUID. This can happen via developing a global or local minimum in the effective potential at pi. In the latter case, this happens via the Kapitza mechanism.</description>

      <title>From weak to strong-coupling superconductivity tuned by substrate in TiN films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between substrates and superconducting thin films has attracted increasing attention. Here, we report an in-depth investigation on superconducting properties of the epitaxial TiN thin films grown on two different substrates by dc reactive magnetron sputtering. The TiN films grown on (0001) sapphire exhibit (111) crystal orientation, while that grown on (100) Si substrates exhibit (100) orientation. Moreover, the samples grown on Si reveal a relatively lower level of disorder, accompanied by the higher critical transition temperature $T_c$ and smaller magnitude of upper critical field slope near $T_c$. Remarkably, we uncovered a rather high value of superconducting gap (with $\Delta_0/k_BT_c$ = 3.05) in TiN film on Si indicating a very strong coupling superconductivity, in sharp contrast to the case using sapphires as the substrate which reveals a weak-coupling feature. Further analysis shows that the weakened electronic screening effect due to the high level of disorder and the suppressed electronic density of states may be the underlying reasons for the occurrence of weak coupling superconductivity in the TiN films based on sapphire substrate.</description>

      <title>Andreev reflection, Andreev states, and long ballistic SNS junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis in the present paper is based on the most known concept introduced by the brilliant physicist Alexander Andreev: Andreev bound states in a normal metal sandwiched between two superconductors. The paper presents results of direct calculations of {\em ab initio} expressions for the currents in a long ballistic SNS junction. The expressions are expanded in $1/L$ ($L$ is the thickness of the normal layer). The main contribution $\propto 1/L$ to the current agrees with the results obtained in the past, but the analysis suggests a new physical picture of the charge transport through the junction free from the problem with the charge conservation law. The saw-tooth current-phase relation at $T=0$ directly follows from the Galilean invariance of the Bogolyubov-de Gennes equations proved in the paper. The proof is valid for any variation of the energy gap in space if the Andreev reflection is the only scattering process. The respective roles of the contributions of bound and continuum states to the current are clarified. They depend on the junction dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure, self-doping, and superconducting instability in the alternating single-layer trilayer stacking nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently proposed alternating single-layer trilayer stacking structure for the nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we comprehensively study this system using {\it ab initio} and random-phase approximation techniques. Our analysis unveils similarities between this novel La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ structure and other Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate superconductors, such as a similar charge-transfer gap value and orbital-selective behavior of the $e_g$ orbitals. However, different from other Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate superconductors, we do not observe any obvious reconstruction of the Fermi surface from ambient conditions (Cmmm phase) to high pressures (P4/mmm phase). Pressure primarily increases the bandwidths of the Ni $e_g$ bands, suggesting an enhancement of the itinerant properties of those $e_g$ states. Furthermore, the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital also has a layer-selective behavior because the antibonding-bonding-nonbonding splitting can only be obtained in the trilayer. In addition, we observe a "self-doping" effect from the trilayer to the single-layer sublattices and this effect will be enhanced by overall electron doping. Moreover, we find a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state that is restricted to the single-layer. Because the effective coupling between the single layers is very weak -- due to the non-superconducting trilayer in between -- this suggests that the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in this structure should be much lower than in the bilayer structure.</description>

      <title>Observation of intra-unit-cell superconductivity modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In unconventional high-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors, the symmetry-breaking electronic orders intertwined with the superconductivity provide important clues for understanding the nature of the unconventional pairing mechanism. Recently, an exotic superconducting order showing spatially periodic order parameter modulations and translational symmetry breaking, namely the pair density wave (PDW) state, has attracted broad attention. Without breaking translational symmetry, point group symmetry breaking may also induce superconductivity modulations on different atom sites within a single unit cell. However, the intra-unit-cell superconductivity modulation has never been carefully investigated before. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we report the observation of intra-unit-cell superconductivity modulations in the superconducting gap size and the coherence peak sharpness in monolayer high-Tc Fe(Te,Se) films epitaxially grown on SrTiO3(001) substrates. Further analysis shows that the maxima and minima in the superconductivity modulation are centered at the crystallographic locations of the Te/Se atoms, revealing the breaking of the glide-mirror symmetry of the Te/Se atoms in monolayer high-Tc Fe(Te,Se) films grown on SrTiO3(001). Our findings provide precise microscopic information of superconductivity within the lattice unit cell and indicate that the p-orbital electrons of the Te/Se atoms also play an important role in Cooper pairing in unconventional high-Tc iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Identifying the ground state phases by spin-patterns in the Shastry-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the influence of frustration on the phases and related phase transitions in condensed matter physics is of fundamental importance in uncovering the role played by frustration. In the two-dimensional square lattice, a minimal frustration has been formulated in 1981 as the Shastry-Sutherland (SS) model described by competitions between the nearest-neighbor bond ($J_1$) and the next-nearest-neighbor one ($J_2$). In the two limits of $\alpha=J_2/J_1$, i.e. $\alpha \ll 1$ and $\alpha \gg 1$, the corresponding phases are the N{\'e}el antiferromagnet (AFM) and the dimer-singlet(DS). Unfortunately, the intermediate regime remains controversial, and the nature of transition from the N{\'e}el AFM to the intermediate state is also unclear. Here we provide a pattern language to explore the SS model and take the lattice size $L=4 \times4$ with periodic boundary condition. We firstly diagonalize the Hamiltonian in an operator space to obtain all fundamental spin-patterns and then analyze their energy and occupancy evolutions with the frustration parameter $\kappa=\alpha / (1+\alpha)$. Our results indicate that the intermediate regime is characterized by diagonal two-domain spin-pattern while the N{\'e}el AFM state has a diagonal single-domain and the DS has mixings of diagonal single- and four-domain. While the transition from the DS to the intermediate phase occurred around $\alpha_c = 1.5$ is the first-order in nature, consistent with that in literature, the one from the intermediate phase to the AFM is clearly seen around $\alpha_c = 1.277$, where it has a reversal of the contributions from the single- and two-domain patterns to the ground state. The result indicates that the pattern language is powerful in identifying the possible phases in frustrated models.</description>

      <title>Wave-function engineering on superconducting substrates: Chiral Yu-Shiba-Rusinov molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic adatoms on superconductors give rise to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states that hold considerable interest for the design of topological superconductivity. Here, we show that YSR states are also an ideal platform to engineer structures with intricate wave-function symmetries. We assemble structures of iron atoms on the quasi-two-dimensional superconductor $2H$-NbSe$_2$. The Yu-Shiba-Rusinov wave functions of individual atoms extend over several nanometers enabling hybridization even at large adatom spacing. We show that the substrate can be exploited to deliberately break symmetries of the adatom structure in ways unachievable in the gas phase. We highlight this potential by designing chiral wave functions of triangular adatom structures confined within a plane. Our results significantly expand the range of interesting quantum states that can be engineered using arrays of magnetic adatoms on superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Klein and anti-Klein tunneling in Weyl junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Klein tunneling is an old topic in relativistic quantum physics, and has been observed recently in graphene where massless particles reside. Here, we propose a new heterostructure platform for Klein tunneling to occur, which consists of a Weyl-semimetal-based normal state/superconductor (NS) junction. By developing a Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk-like theory, we find that Klein tunneling occurs at normal incidence, which can lead to differential conductance doubling. If the (single) Weyl semimeltals are replaced by double Weyl semimetals, anti-Klein tunneling will take place of Klein tunneling. Our work provides a theoretical guide for the detection of (anti-)Klein tunneling in three-dimensional chiral NS junctions.</description>

      <title>Field-induced electronic phase separation in the high-temperature superconductor La$_{1.94}$Sr$_{0.06}$CuO$_{4+y}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.10672v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a combined neutron diffraction and high field muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) study of the magnetically ordered and superconducting phases of the high-temperature superconductor La$_{1.94}$Sr$_{0.06}$CuO$_{4+y}$ ($T_{\rm c} = 37.5(2)$~K) in a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the CuO$_2$ planes. We observe a linear field-dependence of the intensity of the neutron diffraction peak that reflects the modulated antiferromagnetic stripe order. The magnetic volume fraction extracted from $\mu$SR data likewise increases linearly with applied magnetic field. The combination of these two observations allows us to unambiguously conclude that stripe-ordered regions grow in an applied field, whereas the stripe-ordered magnetic moment itself is field-independent. This contrasts with earlier suggestions that the field-induced neutron diffraction intensity in La-based cuprates is due to an increase in the ordered moment. We discuss a microscopic picture that is capable of reconciling these conflicting viewpoints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) $\mathrm{La_4Ni_3O_{10}}$ under pressure has further expanded the realm of nickelate-based superconductor family. In this paper, we performed a first-principle study of $\mathrm{La_4Ni_3O_{10}}$ for both $P2_1/a$ phase at ambient pressure and $I4/mmm$ phase at high pressure, with $U$=0, 3.5\ eV. Our results confirmed the characteristic upward shift of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ bonding band under pressure. Moreover, our analysis of electronic spectrum and orbital occupancy unveil the dynamic mechanism of electronic reconstructions under pressure, embedded in a critical dual effect. Based on our results, we further proposed a trilayer two-orbital model by performing Wannier downfolding on Ni-$e_g$ orbitals. Our model reveals four Fermi surface sheets with $\alpha,\beta,\beta^\prime,\gamma$ pockets, bearing resemblance to that of bilayer $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$. According to the model, our calculated spin susceptibility under random phase approximation shows that $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is also important for the magnetic fluctuation in RP series. Finally, a high energy sixteen-orbital model with direct $dp,pp$ hoppings is proposed, which implies that $\mathrm{La_4Ni_3O_{10}}$ also lies in charge-transfer picture within Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen scheme. Our exposition of electronic reconstructions and multi-orbital models shed light on theoretical electronic correlation study and experimental exploration of lower pressure superconductor in RP series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extensive efforts have been undertaken to combine superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect so that Cooper-pair transport between superconducting electrodes in Josephson junctions is mediated by one-dimensional edge states. This interest has been motivated by prospects of finding new physics, including topologically-protected quasiparticles, but also extends into metrology and device applications. So far it has proven challenging to achieve detectable supercurrents through quantum Hall conductors. Here we show that domain walls in minimally twisted bilayer graphene support exceptionally robust proximity superconductivity in the quantum Hall regime, allowing Josephson junctions to operate in fields close to the upper critical field of superconducting electrodes. The critical current is found to be non-oscillatory and practically unchanging over the entire range of quantizing fields, with its value being limited by the quantum conductance of ballistic, strictly one-dimensional electronic channels residing within the domain walls. The system described is unique in its ability to support Andreev bound states at quantizing fields and offers many interesting directions for further exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In superconductors that lack inversion symmetry, a supercurrent flow can lead to nondissipative magnetoelectric effects. We offer a straightforward formalism to obtain a supercurrent-induced magnetization in superconductors with broken inversion symmetry, which may have orbital, layer, sublattice, or valley degrees of freedom, multiband noncentrosymmetric superconductors. The nondissipative magnetoelectric effect may find applications in fabricating quantum computation platforms or efficient superconducting spintronic devices. We explore how the current-induced magnetization can be employed to create and manipulate Majorana zero modes in a simple hybrid structure.</description>
