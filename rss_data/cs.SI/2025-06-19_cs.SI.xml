      <title>Collaborative Interest-aware Graph Learning for Group Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the popularity of social media, an increasing number of users are joining group activities on online social platforms. This elicits the requirement of group identification (GI), which is to recommend groups to users. We reveal that users are influenced by both group-level and item-level interests, and these dual-level interests have a collaborative evolution relationship: joining a group expands the user's item interests, further prompting the user to join new groups. Ultimately, the two interests tend to align dynamically. However, existing GI methods fail to fully model this collaborative evolution relationship, ignoring the enhancement of group-level interests on item-level interests, and suffering from false-negative samples when aligning cross-level interests. In order to fully model the collaborative evolution relationship between dual-level user interests, we propose CI4GI, a Collaborative Interest-aware model for Group Identification. Specifically, we design an interest enhancement strategy that identifies additional interests of users from the items interacted with by the groups they have joined as a supplement to item-level interests. In addition, we adopt the distance between interest distributions of two users to optimize the identification of negative samples for a user, mitigating the interference of false-negative samples during cross-level interests alignment. The results of experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CI4GI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Detecting Narrative Shifts through Persistent Structures: A Topological Analysis of Media Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse? This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during crises, protests, and information shocks.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic resolution of crowd-sourced moderation on X in polarized settings across countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social platforms increasingly transition from expert fact-checking to crowd-sourced moderation, with X pioneering this shift through its Community Notes system, enabling users to collaboratively moderate misleading content. To resolve conflicting moderation, Community Notes learns a latent ideological dimension and selects notes garnering cross-partisan support. As this system, designed for and evaluated in the United States, is now deployed worldwide, we evaluate its operation across diverse polarization contexts. We analyze 1.9 million moderation notes with 135 million ratings from 1.2 million users, cross-referencing ideological scaling data across 13 countries. Our results show X's Community Notes effectively captures each country's main polarizing dimension but fails by design to moderate the most polarizing content, posing potential risks to civic discourse and electoral processes.</description>

      <title>Learn to Vaccinate: Combining Structure Learning and Effective Vaccination for Epidemic and Outbreak Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and vaccination algorithms.</description>

      <title>Spectral Contraction of Boundary-Weighted Filters on delta-Hyperbolic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical graphs often exhibit tree-like branching patterns, a structural property that challenges the design of traditional graph filters. We introduce a boundary-weighted operator that rescales each edge according to how far its endpoints drift toward the graph's Gromov boundary. Using Busemann functions on delta-hyperbolic networks, we prove a closed-form upper bound on the operator's spectral norm: every signal loses a curvature-controlled fraction of its energy at each pass. The result delivers a parameter-free, lightweight filter whose stability follows directly from geometric first principles, offering a new analytic tool for graph signal processing on data with dense or hidden hierarchical structure.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Misinformation Detection Data and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05060v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misinformation is a complex societal issue, and mitigating solutions are difficult to create due to data deficiencies. To address this, we have curated the largest collection of (mis)information datasets in the literature, totaling 75. From these, we evaluated the quality of 36 datasets that consist of statements or claims, as well as the 9 datasets that consist of data in purely paragraph form. We assess these datasets to identify those with solid foundations for empirical work and those with flaws that could result in misleading and non-generalizable results, such as spurious correlations, or examples that are ambiguous or otherwise impossible to assess for veracity. We find the latter issue is particularly severe and affects most datasets in the literature. We further provide state-of-the-art baselines on all these datasets, but show that regardless of label quality, categorical labels may no longer give an accurate evaluation of detection model performance. Finally, we propose and highlight Evaluation Quality Assurance (EQA) as a tool to guide the field toward systemic solutions rather than inadvertently propagating issues in evaluation. Overall, this guide aims to provide a roadmap for higher quality data and better grounded evaluations, ultimately improving research in misinformation detection. All datasets and other artifacts are available at misinfo-datasets.complexdatalab.com.</description>

      <title>HetGCoT: Heterogeneous Graph-Enhanced Chain-of-Thought LLM Reasoning for Academic Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Academic question answering (QA) in heterogeneous scholarly networks presents unique challenges requiring both structural understanding and interpretable reasoning. While graph neural networks (GNNs) capture structured graph information and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in semantic comprehension, current approaches lack integration at the reasoning level. We propose HetGCoT, a framework enabling LLMs to effectively leverage and learn information from graphs to reason interpretable academic QA results. Our framework introduces three technical contributions: (1) a framework that transforms heterogeneous graph structural information into LLM-processable reasoning chains, (2) an adaptive metapath selection mechanism identifying relevant subgraphs for specific queries, and (3) a multi-step reasoning strategy systematically incorporating graph contexts into the reasoning process. Experiments on OpenAlex and DBLP datasets show our approach outperforms all sota baselines. The framework demonstrates adaptability across different LLM architectures and applicability to various scholarly question answering tasks.</description>

      <title>Voter model can accurately predict individual opinions in online populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of opinion dynamics describe how opinions are shaped in various environments. While these models are able to replicate general opinion distributions observed in real-world scenarios, their capacity to align with data at the user level remains mostly untested. We evaluate the capacity of the multi-state voter model with zealots to capture individual opinions in a fine-grained Twitter dataset collected during the 2017 French Presidential elections. Our findings reveal a strong correspondence between individual opinion distributions in the equilibrium state of the model and ground-truth political leanings of the users. Additionally, we demonstrate that discord probabilities accurately identify pairs of like-minded users. These results emphasize the validity of the voter model in complex settings, and advocate for further empirical evaluations of opinion dynamics models at the user level.</description>

      <title>GNN-based Anchor Embedding for Efficient Exact Subgraph Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00031v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subgraph matching query is a fundamental problem in graph data management and has a variety of real-world applications. Several recent works utilize deep learning (DL) techniques to process subgraph matching queries. Most of them find approximate subgraph matching results without accuracy guarantees. Unlike these DL-based inexact subgraph matching methods, we propose a learning-based exact subgraph matching framework, called \textit{graph neural network (GNN)-based anchor embedding framework} (GNN-AE). In contrast to traditional exact subgraph matching methods that rely on creating auxiliary summary structures online for each specific query, our method indexes small feature subgraphs in the data graph offline and uses GNNs to perform graph isomorphism tests for these indexed feature subgraphs to efficiently obtain high-quality candidates. To make a tradeoff between query efficiency and index storage cost, we use two types of feature subgraphs, namely anchored subgraphs and anchored paths. Based on the proposed techniques, we transform the exact subgraph matching problem into a search problem in the embedding space. Furthermore, to efficiently retrieve all matches, we develop a parallel matching growth algorithm and design a cost-based DFS query planning method to further improve the matching growth algorithm. Extensive experiments on 6 real-world and 3 synthetic datasets indicate that GNN-AE is more efficient than the baselines, especially outperforming the exploration-based baseline methods by up to 1--2 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Joint UAV Trajectory Planning and LEO Satellite Selection for Data Offloading in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) becomes a major trend in the next-generation networks. However, due to the instability of heterogeneous communication and time-varying characteristics of SAGIN, it is challenging to meet the remote Internet of Things (IoT) demands for data collection and offloading. In this paper, we investigate a two-phase hierarchical data uplink model in SAGIN. Specifically, UAVs optimize trajectories to enable efficient data collection from IoT devices, and then they transmit the data to LEO satellites with computing capabilities for further processing. The problem is formulated to minimize the total energy consumption for IoT devices, UAVs, and LEO satellites. Since the problem is in the form of mixed-integer nonlinear programming and intractable to solve directly, we decompose it into two phases. In the IoT-UAV phase, we design the algorithm to jointly optimize the IoT pairing, power allocation, and UAVs trajectories. Considering the high dynamic characteristics of LEO satellites, a real-time LEO satellite selection mechanism joint with the Satellite Tool Kit is proposed in the UAV-LEO phase. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, with about 10% less energy consumption compared with the benchmark algorithm.</description>

      <title>Contributions to Representation Learning with Graph Autoencoders and Applications to Music Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.14651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph autoencoders (GAE) and variational graph autoencoders (VGAE) emerged as two powerful groups of unsupervised node embedding methods, with various applications to graph-based machine learning problems such as link prediction and community detection. Nonetheless, at the beginning of this Ph.D. project, GAE and VGAE models were also suffering from key limitations, preventing them from being adopted in the industry. In this thesis, we present several contributions to improve these models, with the general aim of facilitating their use to address industrial-level problems involving graph representations. Firstly, we propose two strategies to overcome the scalability issues of previous GAE and VGAE models, permitting to effectively train these models on large graphs with millions of nodes and edges. These strategies leverage graph degeneracy and stochastic subgraph decoding techniques, respectively. Besides, we introduce Gravity-Inspired GAE and VGAE, providing the first extensions of these models for directed graphs, that are ubiquitous in industrial applications. We also consider extensions of GAE and VGAE models for dynamic graphs. Furthermore, we argue that GAE and VGAE models are often unnecessarily complex, and we propose to simplify them by leveraging linear encoders. Lastly, we introduce Modularity-Aware GAE and VGAE to improve community detection on graphs, while jointly preserving good performances on link prediction. In the last part of this thesis, we evaluate our methods on several graphs extracted from the music streaming service Deezer. We put the emphasis on graph-based music recommendation problems. In particular, we show that our methods can improve the detection of communities of similar musical items to recommend to users, that they can effectively rank similar artists in a cold start setting, and that they permit modeling the music genre perception across cultures.</description>
