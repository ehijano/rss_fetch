      <title>A Chinese Heart Failure Status Speech Database with Universal and Personalised Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, there is a lack of research on whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise' classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for frequency importance analysis. The data and demonstrations are published at https://github.com/panyue1998/Voice_HF.</description>

      <title>Transsion Multilingual Speech Recognition System for MLC-SLM 2025 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the architecture and performance of a novel Multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system developed by the Transsion Speech Team for Track 1 of the MLC-SLM 2025 Challenge. The proposed system comprises three key components: 1) a frozen Whisper-large-v3 based speech encoder, leveraging large-scale pretraining to ensure robust acoustic feature extraction; 2) a trainable adaptor module using Linear-ReLU-Linear transformation mechanisms to effectively align speech and text representations; and 3) a frozen Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct large language model (LLM) integrated with trainable LoRA for optimized contextual linguistic decoding. By systematically combining pretrained models with task specific fine-tuning, the system achieved a word/character error rate (WER/CER) of 9.83% across 11 languages in the evaluation set and ranked third place among global participants.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucinations in LM-Based TTS Models via Distribution Alignment Using GFlowNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems often generate hallucinated speech that deviates from input text. Existing mitigation strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost. Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%, demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>EffortNet: A Deep Learning Framework for Objective Assessment of Speech Enhancement Technologies Using EEG-Based Alpha Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents EffortNet, a novel deep learning framework for decoding individual listening effort from electroencephalography (EEG) during speech comprehension. Listening effort represents a significant challenge in speech-hearing research, particularly for aging populations and those with hearing impairment. We collected 64-channel EEG data from 122 participants during speech comprehension under four conditions: clean, noisy, MMSE-enhanced, and Transformer-enhanced speech. Statistical analyses confirmed that alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) exhibited significantly higher power during noisy speech processing compared to clean or enhanced conditions, confirming their validity as objective biomarkers of listening effort. To address the substantial inter-individual variability in EEG signals, EffortNet integrates three complementary learning paradigms: self-supervised learning to leverage unlabeled data, incremental learning for progressive adaptation to individual characteristics, and transfer learning for efficient knowledge transfer to new subjects. Our experimental results demonstrate that Effort- Net achieves 80.9% classification accuracy with only 40% training data from new subjects, significantly outperforming conventional CNN (62.3%) and STAnet (61.1%) models. The probability-based metric derived from our model revealed that Transformer-enhanced speech elicited neural responses more similar to clean speech than MMSEenhanced speech. This finding contrasted with subjective intelligibility ratings but aligned with objective metrics. The proposed framework provides a practical solution for personalized assessment of hearing technologies, with implications for designing cognitive-aware speech enhancement systems.</description>

      <title>Denoising by neural network for muzzle blast detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoem develops gunshot detection systems, consisting of a microphone array and software that detects and locates shooters on the battlefield.  The performance of such systems is obviously affected by the acoustic environment in which they are operating: in particular, when mounted on a moving military vehicle, the presence of noise reduces the detection performance of the software. To limit the influence of the acoustic environment, a neural network has been developed. Instead of using a heavy convolutional neural network, a lightweight neural network architecture was chosen to limit the computational resources required to embed the algorithm on as many hardware platforms as possible.  Thanks to the combination of a two hidden layer perceptron and appropriate signal processing techniques, the detection rate of impulsive muzzle blast waveforms (the wave coming from the detonation and indicating the position of the shooter) is significantly increased. With a rms value of noise of the same order as the muzzle blast peak amplitude, the detect rate is more than doubled with this denoising processing.</description>

      <title>Human Feedback Driven Dynamic Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes to explore a new area of dynamic speech emotion recognition. Unlike traditional methods, we assume that each audio track is associated with a sequence of emotions active at different moments in time. The study particularly focuses on the animation of emotional 3D avatars. We propose a multi-stage method that includes the training of a classical speech emotion recognition model, synthetic generation of emotional sequences, and further model improvement based on human feedback. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach to modeling emotional mixtures based on the Dirichlet distribution. The models are evaluated based on ground-truth emotions extracted from a dataset of 3D facial animations. We compare our models against the sliding window approach. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of Dirichlet-based approach in modeling emotional mixtures. Incorporating human feedback further improves the model quality while providing a simplified annotation procedure.</description>

      <title>XAI-Driven Spectral Analysis of Cough Sounds for Respiratory Disease Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-driven methodology to enhance the understanding of cough sound analysis for respiratory disease management. We employ occlusion maps to highlight relevant spectral regions in cough spectrograms processed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Subsequently, spectral analysis of spectrograms weighted by these occlusion maps reveals significant differences between disease groups, particularly in patients with COPD, where cough patterns appear more variable in the identified spectral regions of interest. This contrasts with the lack of significant differences observed when analyzing raw spectrograms. The proposed approach extracts and analyzes several spectral features, demonstrating the potential of XAI techniques to uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and improve the diagnostic capabilities of cough sound analysis by providing more interpretable results.</description>

      <title>Optimal Interference Signal for Masking an Acoustic Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an environment where acoustic privacy or deliberate signal obfuscation is desired, it is necessary to mask the acoustic signature generated in essential operations. We consider the problem of masking the effect of an acoustic source in a target region where possible detection sensors are located. Masking is achieved by placing interference signals near the acoustic source. We introduce a theoretical and computational framework for designing such interference signals with the goal of minimizing the residual amplitude in the target region. For the three-dimensional (3D) forced wave equation with spherical symmetry, we derive analytical quasi-steady periodic solutions for several canonical cases. We examine the phenomenon of self-masking where an acoustic source with certain spatial forcing profile masks itself from detection outside its forcing footprint. We then use superposition of spherically symmetric solutions to investigate masking in a given target region. We analyze and optimize the performance of using one or two point-forces deployed near the acoustic source for masking in the target region. For the general case where the spatial forcing profile of the acoustic source lacks spherical symmetry, we develop an efficient numerical method for solving the 3D wave equation. Potential applications of this work include undersea acoustic communication security, undersea vehicles stealth, and protection against acoustic surveillance.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of Text and Audio Simplification: A Methodological Replication Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study serves as a methodological replication of Leroy et al. (2022) research, which investigated the impact of text simplification on healthcare information comprehension in the evolving multimedia landscape. Building upon the original studys insights, our replication study evaluates audio content, recognizing its increasing importance in disseminating healthcare information in the digital age. Specifically, we explored the influence of text simplification on perceived and actual difficulty when users engage with audio content automatically generated from that text. Our replication involved 44 participants for whom we assessed their comprehension of healthcare information presented as audio created using Leroy et al. (2022) original and simplified texts. The findings from our study highlight the effectiveness of text simplification in enhancing perceived understandability and actual comprehension, aligning with the original studys results. Additionally, we examined the role of education level and language proficiency, shedding light on their potential impact on healthcare information access and understanding. This research underscores the practical value of text simplification tools in promoting health literacy. It suggests the need for tailored communication strategies to reach diverse audiences effectively in the healthcare domain.</description>

      <title>UniCoM: A Universal Code-Switching Speech Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual systems.</description>

      <title>CUPE: Contextless Universal Phoneme Encoder for Language-Agnostic Speech Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length windows.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Audio Feature Tailored for Anomalous Sound Detection Based on Pre-trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) aims at identifying anomalous sounds from machines and has gained extensive research interests from both academia and industry. However, the uncertainty of anomaly location and much redundant information such as noise in machine sounds hinder the improvement of ASD system performance. This paper proposes a novel audio feature of filter banks with evenly distributed intervals, ensuring equal attention to all frequency ranges in the audio, which enhances the detection of anomalies in machine sounds. Moreover, based on pre-trained models, this paper presents a parameter-free feature enhancement approach to remove redundant information in machine audio. It is believed that this parameter-free strategy facilitates the effective transfer of universal knowledge from pre-trained tasks to the ASD task during model fine-tuning. Evaluation results on the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2024 Challenge dataset demonstrate significant improvements in ASD performance with our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Versatile Framework for Song Generation with Prompt-based Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19062v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Song generation focuses on producing controllable high-quality songs based on various prompts. However, existing methods struggle to generate vocals and accompaniments with prompt-based control and proper alignment. Additionally, they fall short in supporting various tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce VersBand, a multi-task song generation framework for synthesizing high-quality, aligned songs with prompt-based control. VersBand comprises these primary models: 1) VocalBand, a decoupled model, leverages the flow-matching method for generating singing styles, pitches, and mel-spectrograms, allowing fast, high-quality vocal generation with style control. 2) AccompBand, a flow-based transformer model, incorporates the Band-MOE, selecting suitable experts for enhanced quality, alignment, and control. This model allows for generating controllable, high-quality accompaniments aligned with vocals. 3) Two generation models, LyricBand for lyrics and MelodyBand for melodies, contribute to the comprehensive multi-task song generation system, allowing for extensive control based on multiple prompts. Experimental results show that VersBand outperforms baseline models across multiple song generation tasks using objective and subjective metrics. Demos and codes are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/VersBandDemo and https://github.com/AaronZ345/VersBand.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Approaches to Vocal Register Classification in Contemporary Male Pop Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For singers of all experience levels, one of the most daunting challenges in learning technical repertoire is navigating placement and vocal register in and around the passagio (passage between chest voice and head voice registers). Particularly in pop music, where a single artist may use a variety of timbre's and textures to achieve a desired quality, it can be difficult to identify what vocal register within the vocal range a singer is using. This paper presents two methods for classifying vocal registers in an audio signal of male pop music through the analysis of textural features of mel-spectrogram images. Additionally, we will discuss the practical integration of these models for vocal analysis tools, and introduce a concurrently developed software called AVRA which stands for Automatic Vocal Register Analysis. Our proposed methods achieved consistent classification of vocal register through both Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, which supports the promise of more robust classification possibilities across more voice types and genres of singing.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning ASR for Stuttered Speech: Personalized vs. Generalized Approaches</title>

Abstract: Stuttering -- characterized by involuntary disfluencies such as blocks, prolongations, and repetitions -- is often misinterpreted by automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, resulting in elevated word error rates and making voice-driven technologies inaccessible to people who stutter. The variability of disfluencies across speakers and contexts further complicates ASR training, compounded by limited annotated stuttered speech data. In this paper, we investigate fine-tuning ASRs for stuttered speech, comparing generalized models (trained across multiple speakers) to personalized models tailored to individual speech characteristics. Using a diverse range of voice-AI scenarios, including virtual assistants and video interviews, we evaluate how personalization affects transcription accuracy. Our findings show that personalized ASRs significantly reduce word error rates, especially in spontaneous speech, highlighting the potential of tailored models for more inclusive voice technologies.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across textual and multimodal domains. In parallel, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm, offering improved controllability, bidirectional context modeling, and robust generation. However, their application to the audio modality remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{DIFFA}, the first diffusion-based large audio-language model designed to perform spoken language understanding. DIFFA integrates a frozen diffusion language model with a lightweight dual-adapter architecture that bridges speech understanding and natural language reasoning. We employ a two-stage training pipeline: first, aligning semantic representations via an ASR objective; then, learning instruction-following abilities through synthetic audio-caption pairs automatically generated by prompting LLMs. Despite being trained on only 960 hours of ASR and 127 hours of synthetic instruction data, DIFFA demonstrates competitive performance on major benchmarks, including MMSU, MMAU, and VoiceBench, outperforming several autoregressive open-source baselines. Our results reveal the potential of diffusion-based language models for efficient and scalable audio understanding, opening a new direction for speech-driven AI. Our code will be available at https://github.com/NKU-HLT/DIFFA.git.</description>
