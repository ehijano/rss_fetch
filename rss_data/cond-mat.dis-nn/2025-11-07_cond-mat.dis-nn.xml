      <title>Enhanced stochasticity in irradiated vanadium oxide oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insulator-to-metal transition materials are highly sensitive to even minute deviations of stoichiometry, lattice defects, and disorder, which provides opportunities to engineer their electrical switching characteristics. Using V2O3 as a prototypical metal-insulator transition resistive switching material, we demonstrate that localized focused ion beam irradiation can induce stochastic oscillatory dynamics in simple two-terminal switching devices. After irradiating the material, we observed an unusual dynamic regime where the voltage induced metallic state momentarily collapses into an insulating state, which results in a rapid current flickering that is qualitatively different from the conventional current spiking in a Pearson-Anson type oscillatory circuit implemented using the pristine material. Furthermore, the current flickering timing in the irradiated devices becomes progressively more random and more sparse with increasing input voltage, resulting in nonlinear and nondeterministic oscillatory behavior. The irradiation also leads to a dramatic reduction in switching power required to induce the current oscillations. These results are elucidated through random resistor network simulations which indicate that a small number of local sites can control the electrical metal-insulator transition switching properties in large devices with high defect concentration. Our results show that selective focused ion beam irradiation provides exciting prospects for engineering and tuning novel stochastic behaviors in emergent technologies that rely on the intrinsic randomness of physical processes.</description>

      <title>Emergent Dynamical Translational Symmetry Breaking as a Dynamical Order Principle for Localization and Topological Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</description>

      <title>KAN-Enhanced Contrastive Learning Accelerating Crystal Structure Identification from XRD Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of crystal structures is central to materials science, underpinning the understanding of composition-structure-property relationships and the discovery of new materials. Powder X-ray diffraction is a key technique in this pursuit due to its versatility and reliability. However, current analysis pipelines still rely heavily on expert knowledge and slow iterative fitting, limiting their scalability in high-throughput and autonomous settings. Here, we introduce a physics-guided contrastive learning framework termed as XCCP. It aligns powder diffraction patterns with candidate crystal structures in a shared embedding space to enable efficient structure retrieval and symmetry recognition. The XRD encoder employs a dual-expert design with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network projection head, one branch emphasizes low angle reflections reflecting long-range order, while the other captures dense high angle peaks shaped by symmetry. Coupled with a crystal graph encoder, contrastive pretraining yields physically grounded representations. XCCP demonstrates strong performance across tasks, with structure retrieval reaching 0.89 and space group identification attains 0.93 accuracy. The framework further generalizes to compositionally similar multi principal element alloys and demonstrates zero-shot transfer to experimental patterns. These results establish XCCP as a robust, interpretable, and scalable approach that offers a new paradigm for X-ray diffraction analysis. XCCP facilitates high-throughput screening, rapid structural validation and integration into autonomous laboratories.</description>

      <title>Energy transport and chaos in a one-dimensional disordered nonlinear stub lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate energy propagation in a one-dimensional stub lattice in the presence of both disorder and nonlinearity. In the periodic case, the stub lattice hosts two dispersive bands separated by a flat band; however, we show that sufficiently strong disorder fills all intermediate band gaps. By mapping the two-dimensional parameter space of disorder and nonlinearity, we identify three distinct dynamical regimes (weak chaos, strong chaos, and self-trapping) through numerical simulations of initially localized wave packets. When disorder is strong enough to close the frequency gaps, the results closely resemble those obtained in the one-dimensional disordered discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation and Klein-Gordon lattice model. In particular, subdiffusive spreading is observed in both the weak and strong chaos regimes, with the second moment $m_2$ of the norm distribution scaling as $m_2 \propto t^{0.33}$ and $m_2 \propto t^{0.5}$, respectively. The system's chaotic behavior follows a similar trend, with the finite-time maximum Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda$ decaying as $\Lambda \propto t^{-0.25}$ and $\Lambda \propto t^{-0.3}$. For moderate disorder strengths, i.e., near the point of gap closing, we find that the presence of small frequency gaps does not exert any noticeable influence on the spreading behavior. Our findings extend the characterization of nonlinear disordered lattices in both weak and strong chaos regimes to other network geometries, such as the stub lattice, which serves as a representative flat-band system.</description>

      <title>Geometry and universal scaling of Pareto-optimal signal compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I investigate the generic problem of lossy compression of a fluctuating stochastic signal $X$ into a discrete representation $Z$ through optimal thresholding. The signal modulates transition rates of a two-state system described by a binary variable $Y$. Optimising the retained mutual information between $Z$ and $Y$ under a constraint on fixed encoding cost of $Z$ reveals Pareto-optimal trade-offs, determined numerically using genetic algorithms. In the small-noise regime, these fronts are either concave or exhibit piecewise convex ``intrusions'' separated by first-order transitions in the optimal protocol. An analytical high-rate expansion shows that the optimal threshold density follows a universal cube-root scaling with the product of the prior distribution and the Fisher information associated with the response, which holds qualitatively even for few discrete states. Extending the analysis to non-Gaussian fluctuations reveals that for some parameters optimal encoders can yield strictly better information-cost trade-offs than Gaussian surrogates, meaning the same information content can often be achieved with fewer discrete readout states.</description>

      <title>Compensation between the parameters of the Jonschers's Universal Relaxation Law in disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18515v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental results for a huge number of different materials published during the past fifty years confirm the validity of the Jonscher's Universal Dielectric Response Law. Accordingly,the ac conductivity is a fractional power of frequency. Otemperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, spectra recorded at different temperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, as well. The dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac conductivity are three state variables, which describe the electric and dielectric properties. These constitute a unique relation by merging the Dielectric Response Law and the Ghosh - Pan Scaling Rule, respectively. A partial differentiation chain theorem combined with the temperature dependencies of the dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac response, establishes a compensation rule between the parameters of the Universal Dielectric Response Law. The compatibility of the present theorynwth published experimental data is discussed.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Thermalization of a Localized Chain Interacting with an Ergodic Bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of many-body localized (MBL) phases intrinsically links spectral properties with eigenstate characteristics: localized systems exhibit Poisson level statistics and area-law entanglement entropy, while ergodic systems display volume-law entanglement and follow random matrix theory predictions, including level repulsion. Here, we introduce the interacting Anderson Quantum Sun model, which significantly deviates from these conventional expectations. In addition to standard localized and ergodic phases, we identify a regime that exhibits volume-law entanglement coexisting with intermediate spectral statistics. We also identify another nonstandard regime marked by Poisson level statistics, sub-volume entanglement growth, and rare-event-dominated correlations, indicative of emerging ergodic instabilities. These results highlight unconventional routes of ergodicity breaking and offer fresh perspectives on how Anderson localization may be destabilized.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue spectral tails and localization properties of asymmetric networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to the neatly bounded spectra of densely populated large random matrices, sparse random matrices often exhibit unbounded eigenvalue tails on the real and imaginary axis, called Lifshitz tails. In the case of asymmetric matrices, concise mathematical results have proved elusive. In this work, we present an analytical approach to characterising these tails. We exploit the fact that eigenvalues in the tail region have corresponding eigenvectors that are exponentially localised on highly-connected hubs of the network associated to the random matrix. We approximate these eigenvectors using a series expansion in the inverse connectivity of the hub, where successive terms in the series take into account further sets of next-nearest neighbours. By considering the ensemble of such hubs, we are able to characterise the eigenvalue density and the extent of localisation in the tails of the spectrum in a general fashion. As such, we classify a number of different asymptotic behaviours in the Lifshitz tails, as well as the leading eigenvalue and the inverse participation ratio. We demonstrate how an interplay between matrix asymmetry, network structure, and the edge-weight distribution leads to the variety of observed behaviours.</description>

      <title>Not-so-glass-like Caging and Fluctuations of an Active Matter Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simple active models of matter recapitulate complex biological phenomena. The out-of-equilibrium nature of these models, however, often makes them beyond the reach of first-principle descriptions. This limitation is particularly perplexing when attempting to distinguish between different glass-forming mechanisms. We here consider a minimal active system in various spatial dimensions to identify the processes underlying their sluggish dynamics. Activity is found to markedly impact cage escape processes and critical fluctuations associated with exploring lower-dimensional caging features.</description>

      <title>Small Singular Values Matter: A Random Matrix Analysis of Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work analyzes singular-value spectra of weight matrices in pretrained transformer models to understand how information is stored at both ends of the spectrum. Using Random Matrix Theory (RMT) as a zero information hypothesis, we associate agreement with RMT as evidence of randomness and deviations as evidence for learning. Surprisingly, we observe pronounced departures from RMT not only among the largest singular values -- the usual outliers -- but also among the smallest ones. A comparison of the associated singular vectors with the eigenvectors of the activation covariance matrices shows that there is considerable overlap wherever RMT is violated. Thus, significant directions in the data are captured by small singular values and their vectors as well as by the large ones. We confirm this empirically: zeroing out the singular values that deviate from RMT raises language-model perplexity far more than removing values from the bulk, and after fine-tuning the smallest decile can be the third most influential part of the spectrum. To explain how vectors linked to small singular values can carry more information than those linked to larger values, we propose a linear random-matrix model. Our findings highlight the overlooked importance of the low end of the spectrum and provide theoretical and practical guidance for SVD-based pruning and compression of large language models.</description>

      <title>Extended Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker Formula for Current through Open Quantum Systems with Gain or Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</description>

      <title>Learning-at-Criticality in Large Language Models for Quantum Field Theory and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fundamental physics often confronts complex symbolic problems with few guiding exemplars or established principles. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality (LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data, exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model (CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition. This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern" crucial for generalization, enabled by the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems, significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse challenges in fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>On zeros and algorithms for disordered systems: mean-field spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin glasses are fundamental probability distributions at the core of statistical physics, the theory of average-case computational complexity, and modern high-dimensional statistical inference. In the mean-field setting, we design deterministic quasipolynomial-time algorithms for estimating the partition function to arbitrarily high accuracy for all inverse temperatures in the second moment regime. In particular, for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model, our algorithms succeed for the entire replica-symmetric phase. To achieve this, we study the locations of the zeros of the partition function. Notably, our methods are conceptually simple, and apply equally well to the spherical case and the case of Ising spins.</description>
