      <title>Pricing and hedging of decentralised lending contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the loan contracts offered by decentralised loan protocols (DLPs) through the lens of financial derivatives. DLPs, which effectively are clearinghouses, facilitate transactions between option buyers (i.e. borrowers) and option sellers (i.e. lenders). The loan-to-value at which the contract is initiated determines the option premium borrowers pay for entering the contract, and this can be deduced from the non-arbitrage pricing theory. We show that when there are no market frictions, and there is no spread between lending and borrowing rates, it is optimal to never enter the lending contract.
  Next, by accounting for the spread between rates and transactional costs, we develop a deep neural network-based algorithm for learning trading strategies on the external markets that allow us to replicate the payoff of the lending contracts that are not necessarily optimally exercised. This allows hedge the risk lenders carry by issuing options sold to the borrowers, which can complement (or even replace) the liquidations mechanism used to protect lenders' capital. Our approach can also be used to exploit (statistical) arbitrage opportunities that may arise when DLP allow users to enter lending contracts with loan-to-value, which is not appropriately calibrated to market conditions or/and when different markets price risk differently. We present thorough simulation experiments using historical data and simulations to validate our approach.</description>

      <title>Robust Elicitable Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elicitable functionals and (strict) consistent scoring functions are of interest due to their utility of determining (uniquely) optimal forecasts, and thus the ability to effectively backtest predictions. However, in practice, assuming that a distribution is correctly specified is too strong a belief to reliably hold. To remediate this, we incorporate a notion of statistical robustness into the framework of elicitable functionals, meaning that our robust functional accounts for "small" misspecifications of a baseline distribution. Specifically, we propose a robustified version of elicitable functionals by using the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify potential misspecifications from a baseline distribution. We show that the robust elicitable functionals admit unique solutions lying at the boundary of the uncertainty region. Since every elicitable functional possesses infinitely many scoring functions, we propose the class of b-homogeneous strictly consistent scoring functions, for which the robust functionals maintain desirable statistical properties. We show the applicability of the REF in two examples: in the reinsurance setting and in robust regression problems.</description>

      <title>Convolution Bounds on Quantile Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.09320v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantile aggregation with dependence uncertainty has a long history in probability theory with wide applications in finance, risk management, statistics, and operations research. Using a recent result on inf-convolution of quantile-based risk measures, we establish new analytical bounds for quantile aggregation which we call convolution bounds. Convolution bounds both unify every analytical result available in quantile aggregation and enlighten our understanding of these methods. These bounds are the best available in general. Moreover, convolution bounds are easy to compute, and we show that they are sharp in many relevant cases. They also allow for interpretability on the extremal dependence structure. The results directly lead to bounds on the distribution of the sum of random variables with arbitrary dependence. We discuss relevant applications in risk management and economics.</description>
