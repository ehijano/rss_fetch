      <title>Nitrogen and hydrogen intercalation into crystalline fullerite C$_{60}$ and photoluminescent studies in a wide temperature range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical properties of fullerite C$_{60}$ single crystals saturated with hydrogen and nitrogen molecules were studied in the temperature range from 20 K to 230 K using the spectral-luminescent method. Saturation was carried out under a pressure of 30 atm at various temperatures from 470 K to 720 K. At saturation temperatures above 520 K for hydrogen and 690 K for nitrogen, chemical interaction of impurity molecules and the fullerene matrix occurs, forming new chemical compounds. The results of a study of the photoluminescent properties of a new substances are presented for the first time.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillation studies of the nodal line semimetal Ni3In2S2-xSex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ternary shandite compounds with the general formula T3M2X2 (T = Ni, Co, Rh or Pd; M = Sn, In or Pb and X = S or Se) have emerged as a large pool of topological semimetals. This family of compounds hosts different topological phases for various combinations of T, M and X. This paper reports the observation of quantum oscillations under the high magnetic fields in Ni3In2S2-xSex single crystals. Angular dependence of oscillation frequency suggests an evolution of the Fermi surface from three-dimensional to two-dimensional on Se substitution for S in Ni3In2S2. The effective mass obtained for each composition by fitting the oscillation amplitude with the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula, shows no significant change, suggesting that the topological phase might be relatively robust against enhanced SOC upon Se doping in Ni3In2S2.</description>

      <title>Twisting in h-BN bilayers and their angle-dependent properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the structural and electronic properties of twisted h-BN bilayers to understand the role of the twisting angle. Using first-principles methods with relaxation taken into account, we simulate h-BN bilayers with commensurate supercells with the smallest angle being $2.88^{\circ}$ until $60^{\circ}$. We find that the interlayer separation is not constant throughout each bilayer because of the various stacking patterns of AA, AA', AB, AB', and A'B throughout the layers, which also play a significant role in their unique charge redistribution. The calculations for the 110 generated structures show the existence of flat bands in several twisted h-BN bilayers, as well as the emergence of different trends in their properties as a function of the twist angle. These results are useful for establishing a systematic base line of registry-dependent relations for the development of more advanced computational methods to access incommensurate h-BN bilayers.</description>

      <title>Linking quantum mechanical features to structural phase-transformation in inorganic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new descriptor, i.e., local lattice distortion, to predict structural phase transformation in inorganic compounds containing lanthanides and transition metals. The descriptor utilizes local lattice and angular distortions obtained from structural optimization of experimentally known crystalline phases within state-of-the-art density-functional theory method. The predictive power of the descriptor was tested on lanthanide based RE2In (RE=rare-earth) compounds known for a variety of phase transformations. We show that the inclusion of quantum-mechanical effects through local-charge, bonding, symmetry, and electronic-structure enhances the robustness of the descriptor in predicting structural phase transformation. To gain further insights, we analyzed phononic and electronic behavior of Y2In, and show that experimentally observed phase transformation can only be predicted when atomic strains are included. The descriptor was used to predict structural phase change in couple of new compounds, i.e., (Yb1-xErx)2In and Gd2(In1-xAlx), which was validated by X-ray powder diffraction measurements. Finally, we demonstrated the generality of the proposed descriptor by predicting phase transformation behavior in different classes of compounds indicating the usefulness of our approach in mapping desired phase changes in novel functional materials.</description>

      <title>Glassy Behavior and Anomalous Transport in Chimney Ladder Crystals Induced by Soft Optical Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowotny chimney ladder (NCL) crystals present physical properties in between the contrasting paradigms of ideal crystal and amorphous solid, making them promising candidates for thermoelectric applications due to their inherently low thermal conductivity. Here, we report an extensive experimental characterization of the thermodynamic and thermoelectric transport properties of a large class of NCL materials, focusing on the intermetallic compound Ru$_2$Sn$_{3-\delta}$. We show that the heat capacity of these NCL compounds exhibits a boson-peak-like glassy anomaly between $8$ K and $14$ K. By combining experimental measurements with density functional theory (DFT), we attribute its microscopic origin to extremely soft optical phonons that universally appear as a consequence of the chimney ladder sublattice structure. Additionally, the measured thermal conductivity and the thermoelectric response present distinct anomalous glass-like features that strongly correlate with the dynamics of the abundant soft optical phonons revealed by DFT. Our work demonstrates that soft modes in ordered crystals can induce glassy behavior, outlining a pathway to design metallic materials with low thermal conductivity and unique thermoelectric properties without the need for disorder or strong electronic correlations.</description>

      <title>Structural, vibrational, and transport properties of compound forming liquid Li-Bi alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the compound forming tendency, some of the liquid metal alloys show anomalous behavior in their physical and chemical properties. Near the compound forming concentration, their electrical resistivity is beyond the metallic values and hence they may be labelled as liquid semiconductors. Lithium-Bismuth is one such system. It shows some interesting features in terms of physical and chemical properties such as departure from nearly free electron theory, very high value of electrical resistivity near the compound forming composition. While dealing with the electrical resistivity of liquid alloys with very high values of electrical resistivity, the famously used approaches such as Faber-Ziman theory and Morgan theory have some limitations. Hence, some modifications in these theoretical formalisms are required in order to reproduce the experimental values of the electrical transport properties. We, in the present work have modeled liquid Li-Bi system using model potential formalism in conjunction with the established theoretical models along with suitable modifications to study structural, elastic and transport properties. In particular, we have treated the effective valence of pure Li and Bi as parameters and we have calculated the phase shifts using model potentials rather than muffin-tin potential. The results are compared with the results of molecular dynamics simulation and other theoretical models. It is observed that the t-matrix formulation in conjunction with the model potential formalism is able to reproduce the correct trends in the electrical resistivity isotherm. Whereas the results of Faber-Ziman and Morgan theory are highly underestimated, the non-metallic behavior near the critical composition can be explained clearly from the present results of electrical resistivity. Further, phonon frequencies and sound velocities are also estimated.</description>

      <title>Large Spin Hall Effect in High-Entropy Alloy/CoFeB Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) exhibit various physical properties, such as high microhardness for structured materials and high efficiency for catalysis. These features are recognized as a cocktail effect of five or more elements that stabilize a single-phase solid solution due to a high configurational entropy. HEAs may also exhibit short-range orders and microdistorshons, which cause the local symmetry breaking of systems. Systems with local symmetry breaking are of interest for spin-dependent transport, such as for spin Hall effects. In this study, sputtered-film samples of an HEA, Mn--Nb--Mo--Ta--W, and related alloys, were fabricated; these films were layered with ferromagnetic CoFeB. All samples exhibited x-ray diffraction peaks originating only from a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase, and transmission electron microscopy images indicated the absence of secondary phases and uniform elemental distributions. The spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) was investigated, and clear resistance changes were observed in all the samples. Quantitative analysis of SMR revealed that the spin Hall angle ($\theta_\mathrm{SH}$) was 0.12 $\pm$ 0.002 and 0.14 $\pm$ 0.037 for the HEA and Nb--Mo--Ta--W alloy (medium-entropy alloy (MEA)), respectively. The $\theta_\mathrm{SH}$s of the HEA and MEA were comparable to that of Pt which is a typical heavy element with relatively large $\theta_\mathrm{SH}$. The newly developed HEA and MEA films are attractive spin Hall materials with the bcc phase and are suitable for spintronic applications using magnetic tunnel junctions with CoFeB and an MgO barrier.</description>

      <title>Molecular-dynamics study of diffusional creep in uranium mononitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranium mononitride (UN) is a promising advanced nuclear fuel due to its high thermal conductivity and high fissile density. Yet, many aspects of its mechanical behavior and microstructural features are currently unknown. In this paper, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study UN's diffusional creep. Nanometer-sized polycrystals are used to simulate diffusional creep and to calculate an effective GB width. It is found that Nabarro-Herring creep is not dominant in the temperature range of 1700$-$2000 K and that the dominant diffusional creep mechanism is Coble creep with an activation energy of 2.28 $\pm$ 0.09 eV. A method is proposed to calculate the diffusional GB width and its temperature dependence in polycrystals. The effective GB width of UN is calculated as 2.69 $\pm$ 0.08 nm. This value fits very well with the prefactor of the phenomenological Coble creep formula. It is demonstrated that the most comprehensive thermal creep model for UN can be represented as the combination of our Coble creep model and the dislocation creep model proposed by Hayes et al.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Resolved Signatures of Carrier Screening Effects on Electron-Phonon Coupling in MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling is central to many condensed matter phenomena. Harnessing these effects for novel material functionality in materials always involves non-equilibrium electronic states, which in turn alter quasi-free-carrier density and screening. Thus, gaining a fundamental understanding of the interplay of carrier screening and electron-phonon coupling is essential for advancing ultrafast science. Prior works have mainly focused on the impact of carrier screening on electronic structure properties. Here we investigate the non-equilibrium lattice dynamics of MoS2 after a photoinduced Mott transition. The experimental data are closely reproduced by ab-initio ultrafast dynamics simulations. We find that the non-thermal diffuse scattering signals in the vicinity of the Bragg peaks, originating from long-wavelength phonon emission, can only be reproduced upon explicitly accounting for the screening of electron-phonon interaction introduced by the Mott transition. These results indicate the screening influences electron-phonon coupling, leading to a suppression of intravalley phonon-assisted carrier relaxation. Overall, the combined experimental and computational approach introduced here offers new prospects for exploring the influence of screening of the electron-phonon interactions and relaxation pathways in driven solids.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering measurements on the hexagonal Zn67Mg33S semiconductor alloy reveal a bimodal pattern of the optical modes across the Brillouin zone, confirmed by first-principles simulations. Such modes are sensitive to the local fluctuations in the composition inherent to random Zn/Mg alloying, distinguishing homo from hetero environments of a given bond (1-bond/2-mode), as is formalized for cubic alloys by the percolation model. The latter model thus emerges as a generic framework for systematizing the optical modes of semiconductor alloys in various crystal structures.</description>

      <title>Exploring Dual-Iron Atomic Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Reduction: A Comprehensive Study on Structural and Electronic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), as an efficient and green pathway for ammonia synthesis, plays a crucial role in achieving on-demand ammonia production. This study proposes a novel design concept based on dual-iron atomic sites and nitrogen-boron co-doped graphene catalysts, exploring their high efficiency in NRR. By modulating the N and B co-doped ratios, we found that Fe2N3B@G catalyst exhibited significant activity in the adsorption and hydrogenation of N2 molecules, especially with the lowest free energy (0.32 eV) on NRR distal pathway, showing its excellent nitrogen activation capability and NRR performance. The computed electron localization function, crystal orbital Hamiltonian population, electrostatic potential map revealed that the improved NRR kinetics of Fe2N3B@G catalyst derived by N3B co-doping induced optimization of Fe-Fe electronic environment, regulation of Fe-N bond strength, and the continuous electronic support during the N2 breakage and hydrogenation. In particular, machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations were employed to verify the high activity of Fe2N3B@G catalyst in NRR, which reveal that Fe2N3B@G effectively regulates the electron density of Fe-N bond, ensuring the smooth generation and desorption of NH3 molecules and avoiding the competition with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, the determined higher HER overpotential of Fe2N3B@G catalyst can effectively inhibit the HER and enhance the selectivity toward NRR. In addition, Fe2N3B@G catalyst also showed good thermal stability by MD simulations up to 500 K, offering its feasibility in practical applications. This study demonstrates the superior performance of Fe2N3B@G in nitrogen reduction catalysis, and provides theoretical guidance for atomic catalyst design by the co-doping strategy and in-deep electronic environment modulation.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Density Functional Dependence of the Antipolar $Pbcn$ Phase in HfO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antipolar $Pbcn$ phase of HfO$_2$ has been suggested to play an important role in the phase transition and polarization switching mechanisms in ferroelectric hafnia. In this study, we perform a comprehensive benchmark of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations to investigate the thermodynamic stability and phase transition behavior of hafnia, with a particular focus on the relationship between the $Pbcn$ and ferroelectric $Pca2_1$ phases. Our results reveal significant discrepancies in the predicted stability of the $Pbcn$ phase relative to the $Pca2_1$ phase across different exchange-correlation functionals. Notably, the PBE and hybrid HSE06 functionals exhibit consistent trends, which diverge from the predictions of the PBEsol and SCAN functionals. For a given density functional, temperature-driven phase transitions predicted by DFT-based quasi-harmonic free energy calculations aligns with finite-temperature MD simulations using a deep potential trained on the same density functional. Specifically, the PBE functional predicts a transition from $Pca2_1$ to $Pbcn$ with increasing temperature, while PBEsol predicts a transition from $Pca2_1$ to $P4_2/nmc$. A particularly striking and reassuring finding is that under fixed mechanical boundary conditions defined by the ground-state structure of $Pca2_1$, all functionals predict consistent relative phase stabilities and comparable switching barriers as well as domain wall energies. These findings underscore the unique characteristics of the $Pbcn$ phase in influencing phase transitions and switching mechanisms in ferroelectric hafnia.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence Detection of Polytype Polarization in r-MoS2 Enabled by Asymmetric Dielectric Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rhombohedral (r) polytypes of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) constitute a novel class of two-dimensional ferroelectric materials, where lateral shifts between parallel layers induce reversible out-of-plane polarization. This emerging field, known as SlideTronics, holds significant potential for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic applications. While extensive studies have investigated the effects of electrical and chemical doping on excitonic signatures in 2H-TMDs, as well as the influence of dielectric environments on their optical properties, the impact of intrinsic polarization in asymmetric environments remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a striking polarization-dependent photoluminescence (PL) contrast of up to 400\% between ferroelectric domains in bilayer and trilayer rhombohedral molybdenum disulfide (r-MoS2). This pronounced contrast arises from an asymmetric dielectric environment, which induces polarization-dependent shifts in the Fermi energy, leading to a modulation of the exciton-trion population balance. A detailed temperature-dependent line shape analysis of the PL, conducted from 4K to room temperature, reveals domain-specific trends that further reinforce the connection between polarization states and excitonic properties. The persistence of these distinct optical signatures at room temperature establishes PL as a robust and non-invasive probe for ferroelectric domain characterization, particularly in fully encapsulated device architectures where conventional techniques, such as Kelvin probe force microscopy, become impractical.</description>

      <title>Atomistically informed phase field study of austenite grain growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistically-informed phase field simulations have been performed to investigate the effect of five common alloying elements (Nb, Ti, Mo, V, Mn) on austenite grain growth. The anisotropic simulations based on the segregation energy profiles of the solutes to four different grain boundary (GB) types from density functional theory calculations suggest a secondary role of solute drag anisotropy on grain growth. Hence, the solute trends are determined to be the same for all investigated GBs, and as a result, the $\Sigma 5(310)[001]$ GB can be considered as a representative GB for solute trend predictions. The decrease in grain growth rates due to solute additions is quantitatively described using a solute trend parameter. The following hierarchy of the solute's effectiveness to retard austenite grain growth has been determined based on the results of the presented model calculations in agreement with the experimental observations: Nb$&gt;$Ti$&gt;$Mo$&gt;$V$\approx$Mn. The limitations and the strengths of the proposed approach are discussed in detail, and a potential application of this approach to steel design is proposed.</description>

      <title>Modeling solute-grain boundary interactions in a bcc Ti-Mo alloy using density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solute segregation in alloys is a key phenomenon which affects various material characteristics such as embrittlement, grain growth and precipitation kinetics. In this work, the segregation energies of Y, Zr, and Nb to a \textgreek{S}5 grain boundary in a bcc Ti-25 at \% Mo alloy were determined using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A systematic approach was laid out by computing the solution energy distributions in the bulk alloy using Warren-Cowley short-range order parameters to find a representative bulk-solute reference energy. Additionally, different scenarios were considered when a solute atom replaces different sites in terms of their local Ti-Mo chemistry at the GB plane to calculate the distribution of segregation energies. The solute segregation to a Mo site at the GB plane is preferred rather than to a Ti site. Further analysis shows that these segregation energy trends can be rationalized based on a primarily elastic interaction. Thus the segregation energies scale with the solute size such that Y has the largest segregation energies followed by Zr and Nb.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of quantum thermodynamics, quantum batteries have emerged as promising devices for energy storage and manipulation. Over the past decade, substantial progress has been made in understanding the fundamental properties of quantum batteries, with several experimental implementations showing great promise. This Perspective provides an overview of the solid-state materials platforms that could lead to fully operational quantum batteries. After briefly introducing the basic features of quantum batteries, we discuss organic microcavities, where superextensive charging has already been demonstrated experimentally. We then explore other materials, including inorganic nanostructures (such as quantum wells and dots), perovskite systems, and (normal and high-temperature) superconductors. Key achievements in these areas, relevant to the experimental realization of quantum batteries, are highlighted. We also address challenges and future research directions. Despite their enormous potential for energy storage devices, research into advanced materials for quantum batteries is still in its infancy. This paper aims to stimulate interdisciplinarity and convergence among different materials science research communities to accelerate the development of new materials and device architectures for quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Stability, growth, and doping of In$_{2}$(Si, Ge)$_{2}$O$_{7}$ as promising n-type wide-gap semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate, computationally and experimentally, the phase stability, electronic structure properties, and the propensity for n-type doping of In$_{2}$X$_{2}$O$_{7}$ (X=Si, Ge) ternary oxides. This family of materials contains promising novel wide-gap semiconductors based on their estimated high $n$-type Baliga figures of merit and acceptable thermal conductivity for power electronics applications. Here, we find that both In$_{2}$Si$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and In$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$O$_{7}$ to be n-type dopable, with Zr providing between 10$^{16}$ and above 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$ net donor concentrations under O-poor conditions, depending on the chemistry, structure (ground-state thorvetite or high-pressure pyrochlore) and synthesis temperature. Initial thin-film growth and annealing leads to polycrystalline In$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$O$_{7}$ thin films in thorvetite structure with band gap over 4 eV, and confirms Zr doping predictions by achieving electron concentrations at 10$^{14}$-10$^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$ under O-rich condition. While future epitaxial growth development is still needed, this study establishes In$_{2}$X$_{2}$O$_{7}$ as promising n-type wide-gap semiconductors for power electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of Ag nano-additivation on microstructure formation in Nd-Fe-B magnets built by laser powder bed fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) enables the near-net shape production of permanent magnets with complex geometry while reducing material waste. However, controlling the microstructure and optimizing magnetic properties remain challenging due to rapid solidification and intrinsic heat treatment effects occurring during both inter-layer and intra-layer processing. Surface additivation of the feedstock powder with Ag nanoparticles (NPs) is a concept that has been shown to increase the coercivity of PBF-LB/M-produced Nd-Fe-B magnets. Using atom probe tomography (APT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we reveal that Ag nano-additivation promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the Nd2Fe14B phase, leading to refined, equiaxed grains and increased stability of the Ti-Zr-B-rich intergranular phase. The intrinsic heat treatment, influenced by layer-wise processing, further affects the distribution of Ag-rich regions, impacting grain growth and intergranular phase composition across different regions of the melt pool. Compared to the unadditivated sample, the Ag-additivated sample exhibits a significantly finer grain structure and a changed intergranular phase, which contribute to enhanced domain wall pinning and coercivity. These microstructural changes directly modify the magnetic domain structure, as evidenced by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Our results highlight that the interplay between nano-additivation and in-process heat treatment provides a novel pathway for tailoring the microstructure and enhancing the magnetic performance of permanent magnets.</description>

      <title>Spin Models and Cluster Multipole Method: Application to Kagome Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-scale computational approach that combines atomistic spin models with the cluster multipole (CMP) method. The CMP method enables a systematic and accurate generation of complex non-collinear magnetic structures using symmetry-adapted representations. The parameters of the spin model are derived from density functional theory using the magnetic force theorem, with the paramagnetic state as a reference. The energy landscape of CMP-generated structures is inspected at the model Hamiltonian level, and sets of low-energy magnetic structures are identified for each material candidate. The inclusion of relativistic antisymmetric and anisotropic pair interactions lifts partially the degeneracy among these most stable structures. To demonstrate the applicability and predictive capability of the method, we apply it to the non-collinear Mn3X and collinear Fe3X (X = Ga, Ge, and Sn) kagome compounds. The computational efficiency of the method in identifying low-energy structures among multiple CMP configurations highlights its potential for high-throughput screening of complex magnets with unknown magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Atomistic modeling of functionalized magnetite surfaces with oxidation states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the atomic structure of magnetite-carboxylic acid interfaces is crucial for tailoring nanocomposites involving this interface. We present a Monte Carlo (MC)-based method utilizing iron oxidation state exchange to model magnetite interfaces with tens of thousands of atoms - scales typically inaccessible by electronic structure calculations. By comparing the binding site preferences of carboxylic acids obtained from electronic structure calculations, we validated the accuracy of our method. We found that the oxidation state distribution, and thus the binding site preference depends on the surface thickness and coverage. We found that the oxidation state distribution, and consequently binding site preference, depend on coverage and surface thickness, with a critical thickness signaling the transition from layered to bulk-like oxidation states. The method presented here needs no interface specific parameterization, ensuring seamless compatibility with popular bimolecular force fields providing transferability, and simplifying the study of magnetite interfaces in general.</description>

      <title>Lithographically-controlled liquid metal diffusion in graphene: Fabrication and magneto-transport signatures of superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal intercalation in epitaxial graphene enables the emergence of proximity-induced superconductivity and modified quantum transport properties. However, systematic transport studies of intercalated graphene have been hindered by challenges in device fabrication, including processing-induced deintercalation and instability under standard lithographic techniques. Here, we introduce a lithographically controlled intercalation approach that enables the scalable fabrication of gallium-intercalated quasi-freestanding bilayer graphene (QFBLG) Hall bar devices. By integrating lithographic structuring with subsequent intercalation through dedicated intercalation channels, this method ensures precise control over metal incorporation while preserving device integrity. Magneto-transport measurements reveal superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc,onset ~ 3.5 K and the occurrence of a transverse resistance, including both symmetric and antisymmetric field components, which is attributed to the symmetric-in-field component to non-uniform currents. These results establish an advanced fabrication method for intercalated graphene devices, providing access to systematic investigations of confined 2D superconductivity and emergent electronic phases in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Compression and Nanoindentation in FCC Nickel: A Methodology for Interatomic Potential Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the mechanical response of face-centered cubic (FCC) nickel under uniaxial compression and nanoindentation using traditional interatomic potentials, including the Embedded Atom Method (EAM) and Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM). By calculating the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE), we analyzed the dissociated slip paths responsible for stacking fault formation and partial Shockley dislocations during mechanical loading. Our findings highlight the critical importance of selecting appropriate interatomic potentials to model compression and nanoindentation tests accurately, aligning simulations with experimental observations. We propose a practical methodology for identifying empirical interatomic potentials suitable for mechanical testing of single-element materials. This approach establishes a benchmark for FCC nickel simulations and provides a basis for extending these methods to more complex Ni-based alloys, facilitating comparisons with experimental results such as those from electron microscopy.</description>

      <title>Vestigial Order from an Excitonic Mother State in Kagome Superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alongside high-temperature charge order and superconductivity, kagome metals exhibit signatures of time-reversal symmetry breaking and nematicity which appear to depend strongly on external perturbations such as strain and magnetic fields, posing a fundamental challenge for conceptual reconciliation. We develop a theory of vestigial order descending from an excitonic mother state in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$=K,Rb,Cs), which develops around $T_* \approx 40$ K. The application of external fields stabilises a subset of the phase-melted order parameter manifold, referred to as a vestigial state, producing a symmetry-breaking response which depends on the applied probe. Our theory reproduces the observations of piezomagnetism, electric magnetic chiral anisotropy, absence of Kerr rotation, unusual elastoresistance response, and superconducting diode effect. Our proposed excitonic mother state accounts for probe-dependent symmetry breaking patterns without fine-tuning, and predicts additional signatures accessible through optical spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Integrating Predictive and Generative Capabilities by Latent Space Design via the DKL-VAE Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Deep Kernel Learning Variational Autoencoder (VAE-DKL) framework that integrates the generative power of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with the predictive nature of Deep Kernel Learning (DKL). The VAE learns a latent representation of high-dimensional data, enabling the generation of novel structures, while DKL refines this latent space by structuring it in alignment with target properties through Gaussian Process (GP) regression. This approach preserves the generative capabilities of the VAE while enhancing its latent space for GP-based property prediction. We evaluate the framework on two datasets: a structured card dataset with predefined variational factors and the QM9 molecular dataset, where enthalpy serves as the target function for optimization. The model demonstrates high-precision property prediction and enables the generation of novel out-of-training subset structures with desired characteristics. The VAE-DKL framework offers a promising approach for high-throughput material discovery and molecular design, balancing structured latent space organization with generative flexibility.</description>

      <title>Chiral Vibrational Modes in Small Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of quantitative methods for characterizing molecular chirality can provide an important tool for studying chirality induced phenomena in molecular systems. Significant progress has been made in recent years toward understanding the chirality of molecular normal vibrational modes, mostly focusing on vibrations of helical molecular structures. In the present study, we examine the applicability two methodologies previously used for helical structures for the quantification of the chirality of molecular normal modes across a range of small, not necessarily helical, molecules. The first approach involves the application of the Continuous Chirality Measure (CCM) to each normal mode by associating the mode with a structure formed by imposing the corresponding motion about a common origin. The second approach assigns to each normal mode a pseudoscalar defined as the product of atomic linear and angular momentum summed over all atoms. In particular, using the CCM also as a measure of the chirality of the underlying molecular structure, we establish the existence of correlation between the chirality of molecular normal modes and that of the underlying molecular structure. Furthermore, we find that normal modes associated with different frequency ranges of the molecular vibrational spectrum exhibit distinct handedness behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Engineering of Dual Hall Effects in 2D Antiferromagnetic Bilayers via Interlayer Magnetic Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum geometry and magnetic order offers a novel strategy for designing next-generation nanodevices. Here, we demonstrate that interlayer magnetic coupling in two-dimensional (2D) CoPSe3 bilayers enables precise control over quantum geometric mechanisms, unlocking dual intrinsic Hall effects. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the altermagnetic (AM) phase exhibits a giant anisotropic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) ($\sigma_{xy}$ is approximately 46 S/cm) driven by Berry curvature localized at generic k-points, while the PT-symmetric antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase hosts an intrinsic second-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect (NAHE) ($\chi_{xyy}$ is approximately 160 ${\mu}$S/V) originating from quantum metric accumulation at high-symmetry k-points. By tuning interlayer magnetic couplings, we achieve reversible switching between these phases, leveraging their distinct band structures and symmetry constraints. The Neel-vector-dependent AHE in the AM phase and the symmetry-protected NAHE in the AFM phase highlight quantum geometry as a versatile tool for manipulating transport properties. Our work establishes 2D antiferromagnets as a promising platform for multifunctional device architectures, bridging linear and nonlinear magnetoelectric responses through tailored quantum geometric engineering.</description>

      <title>Vortex Motion Induced Losses in Tantalum Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tantalum (Ta) based superconducting circuits have been demonstrated to enable record qubit coherence times and quality factors, motivating a careful study of the microscopic origin of the remaining losses that limit their performance. We have recently shown that the losses in Ta-based resonators are dominated by two-level systems (TLSs) at low microwave powers and millikelvin temperatures. We also observe that some devices exhibit loss that is exponentially activated at a lower temperature inconsistent with the superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of the constituent film. Specifically, dc resistivity measurements show a Tc of over 4 K, while microwave measurements of resonators fabricated from these films show losses that increase exponentially with temperature with an activation energy as low as 0.3 K. Here, we present a comparative study of the structural and thermodynamic properties of Ta-based resonators and identify vortex motion-induced loss as the source of thermally activated microwave loss. Through careful magnetoresistance and x-ray diffraction measurements, we observe that the increased loss occurs for films that are in the clean limit, where the superconducting coherence length is shorter than the mean free path. Vortex motion-induced losses are suppressed for films in the dirty limit, which show evidence of structural defects that can pin vortices. We verify this hypothesis by explicitly pinning vortices via patterning and find that we can suppress the loss by microfabrication.</description>

      <title>Interfacial spin-orbit-coupling-induced strong spin-to-charge conversion at an all-oxide ferromagnetic /quasi-two-dimensional electron gas interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional oxides and hybrid structures with interfacial spin orbit coupling and the Rashba-Edelsterin effect (REE) are promising materials systems for thermal tolerance spintronic device applications. Here, we demonstrate efficient spin-to-charge conversion through enhanced interfacial spin orbit coupling at the all-oxide interface of La1-xCaxMnO3 with quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) SrTiO3 (LCMO/STO). The quasi-2D interface is generated via oxygen vacancies at the STO surface. We obtain a spin-to-charge conversion efficiency of ~ 2.32 +- 1.3 nm, most likely originating from the inverse REE, which is relatively large versus all-metallic spin-to-charge conversion materials systems. The results highlight that the LCMO/STO 2D electron gas is a potential platform for spin-based memory and transistor applications.</description>

      <title>Polydispersity-driven dynamical differences between two- and three-dimensional supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have suggested a conundrum in the relaxation dynamics of polydisperse supercooled liquids. It has been shown that in two dimensions, the relative relaxation times of particles of different sizes become more similar as the material is cooled, whereas the opposite happens in three dimensions: they decouple. Here we resolve this conundrum. First, we show that the coupling observed in two dimensions is an artifact of cage correction introduced to account for Mermin-Wagner fluctuations. Instead, the relative relaxation time of small and large particles in two dimensions remains constant or slightly decouples with temperature, as opposed to the substantial decoupling observed in three dimensions. Investigating these dimensional differences further, we find through mobile cluster analysis that small particles initiate relaxation in both dimensions. As the clusters grow larger, they remain dominated by small particles in three dimensions whereas in two cluster growth becomes particle-size agnostic. We explain these findings with a minimal model by studying the distributions of single-particle barrier heights in the system, showing there is a clear difference in the environments of small and large particles, depending on the dimensionality. These findings highlight the critical role of dimensionality in glass formation, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying the glass transition in polydisperse supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>Bicircular Light Induced Multi-State Geometric Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the photocurrent induced by bicircular light (BCL) in materials, with a focus on its multi-state geometric nature. BCL, a combination of left- and right-circularly polarized light, can generate both injection and shift currents, originating from the geometric properties of gauge-invariant shift vectors, quantum geometric tensors, and triple-phase products. Crucially, the real parts of the quantum geometric tensors and triple-phase products remain nonzero in centrosymmetric systems, facilitating photocurrent generation in contrast to the traditional shift current bulk photovoltaic effect. Using a diagrammatic approach, we systematically analyze the BCL-induced photocurrents and demonstrate the multi-state geometric nature within a one-dimensional three-site Rice-Mele model. Our findings provide a quantum geometric understanding of BCL-induced photocurrents, underscoring the importance of considering multi-band contributions in real materials.</description>

      <title>Kondo-like behavior in a mixed valent oxypnictide $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have synthesized and characterized the physical properties of a layered, mixed valent oxypnictide $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ via magnetization, electrical resistivity, and specific heat measurements. Although $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ does not exhibit superconductivity down to T = 0.5 K, it demonstrates an intriguing resistivity minimum observed at $\mathrm{T_{min}}$ = 13.7 K. Disappearance of the resistivity minimum under an applied magnetic field of $\mathrm{\mu_{0}H}$ = 9 T together with the negative magnetoresistance at low and positive at high temperatures are observed, which are typical for both Kondo-like spin-dependent scattering and 3D weak localization. We argue that the Kondo scattering is a more plausible explanation due to the low-temperature deviation from a Curie-Weiss law observed in the magnetic susceptibility, consistent with the presence of magnetic interactions between paramagnetic $\mathrm{Cu^{2+}}$ ions and Kondo screening of these $\mathrm{Cu^{2+}}$ moments. We supplemented the experimental characterization with a detailed description of chemical bonding, employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations and crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis for $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ and isostructural $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$, which is a superconductor with $\mathrm{T_c = 2.2}$ K. Based on the calculations performed, we present the difference between $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ in the character of electronic states at the Fermi level. This discrepancy impacts structural stability and may cause a lack of superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ down to T = 0.5 K.</description>

      <title>IsoME: Streamlining High-Precision Eliashberg Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Julia package IsoME, an easy-to-use yet accurate and robust computational tool designed to calculate superconducting properties. Multiple levels of approximation are supported, ranging from the basic McMillan-Allen-Dynes formula and its machine learning-enhanced variant to Eliashberg theory including static Coulomb interactions derived from $GW$ calculations, offering a fully ab initio approach to determine superconducting properties, such as the critical superconducting temperature ($T_\text{c}$) and the superconducting gap function ($\Delta$). We validate IsoME by benchmarking it against various materials, demonstrating its versatility and performance across different theoretical levels. The findings indicate that the previously held assumption that Eliashberg theory overestimates $T_\text{c}$ is no longer valid when $\mu^*$ is appropriately adjusted to account for the finite Matsubara frequency cutoff. Furthermore, we conclude that the constant density of states (DOS) approximation remains accurate in most cases. By unifying multiple approximation schemes within a single framework, IsoME combines first-principles precision with computational efficiency, enabling seamless integration into high-throughput workflows through its $T_\text{c}$ search mode. This makes IsoME a powerful and reliable tool for advancing superconductivity research.</description>

      <title>Theory of Cation Solvation in the Helmholtz Layer of Li-ion Battery Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solvation environments of Li$^+$ in conventional non-aqueous battery electrolytes, such as LiPF$_6$ in mixtures of ethylene carbaronate (EC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), are often used to rationalize the transport properties of electrolytes and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. In the SEI, the solvation environments in the compact electrical double layer (EDL) next to the electrode, also known as the Helmholtz layer, determine (partially) what species can react to form the SEI, with bulk solvation environments often being used as a proxy. Here we develop and test a theory of cation solvation in the Helmholtz layer of non-aqueous Li-ion battery electrolytes. First, we validate the theory against bulk and diffuse EDL atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of LiPF$_6$ EC/EMC mixtures as a function of surface charge, where we find the theory can capture the solvation environments well. Next we turn to the Helmholtz layer, where we find that the main effect of the solvation structures next to the electrode is an apparent reduction in the number of binding sites between Li$^+$ and the solvents, again where we find good agreement with our developed theory. Finally, by solving a simplified version of the theory, we find that the probability of Li$^+$ binding to each solvent remains equal to the bulk probability, suggesting that the bulk solvation environments are a reasonable place to start when understanding new battery electrolytes. Our developed formalism can be parameterized from bulk MD simulations and used to predict the solvation environments in the Helmholtz layer, which can be used to determine what could react and form the SEI.</description>

      <title>The Roles of Size, Packing, and Cohesion in the Emergence of Force Chains in Granular Packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates computationally the impact of particle size disparity and cohesion on force chain formation in granular media. The granular media considered in this study are bi-disperse systems under uniaxial compression, consisting of spherical, frictionless particles that interact through a modified Hookean model. Force chains in granular media are characterized as networks of particles that meet specific criteria for particle stress and inter-particle forces. The computational setup decouples the effects of particle packing on force chain formations, ensuring an independent assessment of particle size distribution and cohesion on force chain formation. The decoupling is achieved by characterizing particle packing through the radial density function, which enables the identification of systems with both regular and irregular packing. The fraction of particles in the force chains network is used to quantify the presence of the force chains.
  The findings show that particle size disparity promotes force chain formation in granular media with nearly-regular packing (i.e., an almost-ordered system). However, as particle size disparities grow, it promotes irregular packing (i.e., a disordered systems), leading to fewer force chains carrying larger loads than in ordered systems. Further, it is observed that the increased cohesion in granular systems leads to fewer force chains irrespective of particle size or packing.</description>

      <title>Ultra-stretchable and Self-Healable Vitrimers with Tuneable Damping and Mechanical Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vitrimers are a relatively new class of polymer materials with unique properties offered by cross-links that can undergo associative exchange dynamics. We here present a new class of vitrimers based on poly(methyl acrylate) with cross-links utilising dioxaboralane metathesis. These vitrimers demonstrate a combination of ultra-stretchability (up to $\sim$ 80 times their own length), mechanical toughness ($\sim$ 40 MJ/m$^3$), and thermal stability up to $T\sim$ 250 {\deg}C; moreover, the vitrimers demonstrate excellent mechanical damping characterised by a loss factor ($\tan(\delta)$) with a maximum of $\sim$ 2-3 and an effective value $&gt;$0.3 across five decades in frequency (0.001-100 Hz), or correspondingly across a $T$-range of $\sim$ 35 {\deg}C near room temperature (for a probe frequency of 1 Hz). The vitrimers can be successfully re-processed using both a thermo-mechanical and a chemical processing route, and can self-heal at room temperature, making them suitable for sustainable applications. The material properties are directly tuneable by variation of both the amount of cross-linker and by the degree of curing. Thus, this class of vitrimers are promising for applications where stretchability combined with mechanical toughness and/or a high mechanical dissipation is required.</description>

      <title>Discovery of intertwined spin and charge density waves in a layered altermagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets recently came into the spotlight as a new class of magnetic materials, arising as a consequence of specific crystal symmetries. They are characterized by a spin-polarized electronic band structure similar to ferromagnets, but with net zero magnetization, and touted as a promising platform to host a slew of exotic properties, many of which are yet to be explored. Using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spin-polarized STM, we discover intertwined spin and charge density waves in a layered triangular lattice altermagnet, Co-intercalated NbSe$_2$. STM topographs and differential conductance maps in the altermagnetic state show tri-directional modulations with a 2$a_0$ wave length that are robustly present and non-dispersive in a wide range of imaging biases, suggesting a charge ordering origin of the modulations. Spin-polarized STM measurements further reveal that the amplitude of the charge modulations is sensitive to the spin polarization of the tip. This observation demonstrates an additional spin modulation associated with the density wave modulations. Our work uncovers the first density wave instability involving both charge and spin degrees of freedom in an altermagnetic system, accomplished by providing elusive atomic-scale insights. Our experiments thus set the foundation for the studies of correlated electronic states in altermagnets, and motivate comprehensive explorations of intercalated quasi-2D transition metal dichalcogenides in the search for novel phenomena in altermagnets.</description>

Abstract: Body-Centred Cubic (BCC) lattices with twinned meta-crystal architecture inspired by the strengthening of bulk metals have significantly improved mechanical performance; however, their deformation behaviour and underlying strengthening mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we reveal that twinning causes a transition from bending to stretch-dominated behaviour in BCC lattices, eliciting vast improvements in stiffness (+162%) and strength (+95%) without changing nodal connectivity. We designed meta-harmonic lattices by controlling a heterogenous distribution of twinned grain boundaries, inspired by bimodal harmonic microstructure, and we amplified the axial strain energy at location specific sites to further enhance the stiffness of BCC lattices by 206%. Our lattice design philosophy unleashes the potential of cellular materials for high-performance engineering applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the tremendous progress in spintronic studies of van der Waals (vdW) room-temperature ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2, much less effort has been spent on its lattice dynamics and possible interaction with spintronic degrees of freedom. In this work, by combining Raman spectroscopy in a wide range of pressure (atmospheric pressure~19.5 GPa) and temperature (80~690 K) with first-principles calculation, we systematically studied the lattice dynamics and phonon dispersion of Fe3GaTe2. Our results show that the phonon energies of Fe3GaTe2 located at 126.0 cm-1 and 143.5 cm-1 originate from the anharmonic and harmonic vibration modes, respectively. Furthermore, the first room-temperature spin-phonon coupling in vdW ferromagnet is observed with strength of ~0.81 cm-1 at 300 K, by identifying Raman anomalies in both phonon energy and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of below Curie temperature of Fe3GaTe2. Our findings are valuable for fundamental and applied studies of vdW materials under variable conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A heterostructure of Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$TiO$_3$/La$_{1.1}$Sr$_{0.9}$NiO$_3$ /SrTiO$_3$ has been analysed by magnetic sector secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The stoichiometry parameter $x$ of the top layer was made varying continuously from 0 to 1 along the width of the sample by combinatorial pulsed laser deposition. Prior to SIMS analysis, the composition gradient of Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$TiO$_3$ was quantitatively characterized by chemical characterizations including wavelength and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopies. Even if the Ti content is constant into Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$TiO$_3${}, its ionic yield exhibits an increasing trend as Ba is substituted by Sr. Such a phenomenon can be explained by the variation of the neighbouring atoms chemistry which affects the ionization probability of titanium during the sputtering process. In addition to the continuously varying composition, the oxide multilayer sample features sharp interfaces hence the in-depth resolution under our analysing conditions has been investigated too. The modelling of the interface crossing profiles reveals that the instrumental contribution to the profile broadening is as low as 5 nm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how generative machine learning can be used for the rapid computation of strongly dynamical electron diffraction directly from crystal structures, specifically in large-angle convergent-beam electron diffraction (LACBED) patterns. We find that a conditional generative adversarial network can learn the connection between the projected potential from a cubic crystal's unit cell and the corresponding LACBED pattern. Our model can generate diffraction patterns on a GPU many orders of magnitude faster than existing direct simulation methods. Furthermore, our approach can accurately retrieve the projected potential from diffraction patterns, opening a new approach for the inverse problem of determining crystal structure.</description>

Abstract: We present an approach to modifying Transformer architectures by integrating graph-aware relational reasoning into the attention mechanism, merging concepts from graph neural networks and language modeling. Building on the inherent connection between attention and graph theory, we reformulate the Transformer's attention mechanism as a graph operation and propose Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention. This method leverages advanced graph modeling strategies, including Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) and Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA), to enrich the representation of relational structures. Our approach captures complex dependencies and generalizes across tasks, as evidenced by a reduced generalization gap and improved learning performance. Additionally, we expand the concept of graph-aware attention to introduce Sparse GIN-Attention, a fine-tuning approach that employs sparse GINs. By interpreting attention matrices as sparse adjacency graphs, this technique enhances the adaptability of pre-trained foundational models with minimal computational overhead, endowing them with graph-aware capabilities. Sparse GIN-Attention fine-tuning achieves improved training dynamics and better generalization compared to alternative methods like low-rank adaption (LoRA). We discuss latent graph-like structures within traditional attention mechanisms, offering a new lens through which Transformers can be understood. By evolving Transformers as hierarchical GIN models for relational reasoning. This perspective suggests profound implications for foundational model development, enabling the design of architectures that dynamically adapt to both local and global dependencies. Applications in bioinformatics, materials science, language modeling, and beyond could benefit from this synthesis of relational and sequential data modeling, setting the stage for interpretable and generalizable modeling strategies.</description>

      <title>Comment on 2501.17230 and 2502.00103 "Phonon-mediated electron attraction in SrTiO3 via the generalized Frohlich and deformation potential mechanisms" and "Theory of ab initio downfolding with arbitrary range electron-phonon coupling"</title>

Abstract: This comment critically examines the claims made in arXiv papers arXiv:2501.17230 and arXiv:2502.00103, which argue that a multiplicity of polar optical phonons can generate a long-range attractive interaction via a generalized Frohlich coupling. I identify a fundamental flaw in their derivation, showing that their result relies on an unphysical assumption--specifically, neglecting the intermode Coulomb interactions between different polar optical phonons. By restoring these missing interactions I show the screened Coulomb interaction is always repulsive in the static limit.</description>

      <title>Possible quantum spin liquid state of CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ is a recently found two-dimensional triangular lattice antiferromagnet without showing magnetic order. We grew high-quality CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ single crystals and studied the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and thermal conductivity. The dc magnetic susceptibility and magnetization reveal its nature of effective spin-1/2, easy axis anisotropy, and antiferromagnetic spin coupling. The ultralow-temperature ac susceptibility and specific heat data indicate the absence of any phase transition down to 20 mK. The ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) at zero magnetic field exhibits a non-zero residual term $\kappa_0/T =$ 0.0056 W/K$^2$m. Although the magnetic field dependence of $\kappa$ is rather weak, the 14 T thermal conductivity shows an essential zero residual term. All these results point to a possible ground state of quantum spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Spin injection and detection in all-van der Waals 2D devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we report efficient out-of-plane spin injection and detection in an all-van der Waals based heterostructure using only exfoliated 2D materials. We demonstrate spin injection by measuring spin-valve and Hanle signals in non-local transport in a stack of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT), hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and graphene layers. FGT flakes form the spin aligning electrodes necessary to inject and detect spins in the graphene channel. The hBN tunnel barrier provides a high-quality interface between the ferromagnetic electrodes and graphene, eliminating the conductivity mismatch problem, thus ensuring efficient spin injection and detection with spin injection efficiencies of up to $P=40$\%. Our results demonstrate that FGT/hBN/graphene heterostructures form a promising platform for realizing 2D van der Waals spintronic devices.</description>
