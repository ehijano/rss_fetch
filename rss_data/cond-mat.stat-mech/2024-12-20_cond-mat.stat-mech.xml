      <title>Many-body spectral transitions through the lens of variable-range SYK2 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a cornerstone in the study of quantum chaos and holographic quantum matter. Real-world implementations, however, deviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the robustness of its chaotic properties. In this work, we investigate a quadratic SYK model with distance-dependent interactions governed by a power-law decay. By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounded Current Fluctuation in One-Dimensional Driven Diffusive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current fluctuation in one-dimensional driven diffusive systems is reported to have a upper bound that is set by its mean value together with the driving force. The resulting inequality arises from interactions between the diffusive particles, and the bound is approached in near-equilibrium systems or far-from-equilibrium systems with weak interactions between the diffusive particles. Three systems of increasing physical complexity are used to illustrate how the inequality is arrived at. The first system consists of only two reservoirs with particles randomly exchange between them at constant rates. For this system, the bound is shown to be saturated. The second one is the symmetric simple exclusion process, where the inequality is rigorously proven. The third one is the transport of charged particles driven by an external electric field, and numerical studies for this system also support the existence of the inequality.</description>

      <title>The Casimir effect in wetting layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a long time, the study of thermal effects at three-dimensional (3D) short-ranged wetting transitions considered only the effect of interfacial fluctuations. We show that an entropic Casimir contribution, missed in previous treatments, produces significant effects when it is included; in particular, mean-field predictions are no longer obtained when interfacial fluctuations are ignored. The Casimir term arises from the many different microscopic configurations that correspond to a given interfacial one. By employing a coarse-graining procedure, starting from a microscopic Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian, we identify the interfacial model for 3D wetting and the exact form of the Casimir term. The Casimir contribution does not alter the Nakanishi-Fisher surface phase diagram; it significantly increases the adsorption near a first-order wetting transition and completely changes the predicted critical singularities of tricritical wetting, including the nonuniversality occurring in 3D arising from interfacial fluctuations. We illustrate how the Casimir term leads to a reappraisal of the critical singularities at wetting transitions.</description>

      <title>Current Fluctuations in One-Dimensional Diffusion-Reaction Systems via Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an innovative application of tensor networks to the study of current fluctuations in a typical one-dimensional diffusion-reaction system -- semiconductor. Two kinds of species of charge carriers, holes and electrons, diffuse in this system with the pair-generation and -recombination reaction occurring between them. The tensor networks are used to numerically calculate the cumulant generating function of the current statistics. By comparing the cases whether the reaction is turned on or off, the influence of the reaction on current fluctuations is clearly manifested, and this provides a numerical evidence of an interesting inequality setting an upper bound on the diffusivity in terms of the mean current and the driving force or affinity.</description>

      <title>Phase transition in evolving networks that combine preferential attachment and random node deletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical results are presented for the structure of networks that evolve via a preferential-attachment-random-deletion (PARD) model in the regime of overall network growth and in the regime of overall contraction. The phase transition between the two regimes is studied. At each time step a node addition and preferential attachment step takes place with probability $P_{\rm add}$, and a random node deletion step takes place with probability $P_{\rm del} = 1 - P_{\rm add}$. The balance between growth and contraction is captured by the parameter $\eta = P_{\rm add} - P_{\rm del}$, which in the regime of overall network growth satisfies $0 &lt; \eta \le 1$ and in the regime of overall network contraction $-1 \le \eta &lt; 0$. Using the master equation and computer simulations we show that for $-1 &lt; \eta &lt; 0$ the time-dependent degree distribution $P_t(k)$ converges towards a stationary form $P_{\rm st}(k)$ which exhibits an exponential tail. This is in contrast with the power-law tail of the stationary degree distribution obtained for $0 &lt; \eta \le 1$. Thus, the PARD model has a phase transition at $\eta=0$, which separates between two structurally distinct phases. At the transition, for $\eta=0$, the degree distribution exhibits a stretched exponential tail. While the stationary degree distribution in the phase of overall growth represents an asymptotic state, in the phase of overall contraction $P_{\rm st}(k)$ represents an intermediate asymptotic state of a finite life span, which disappears when the network vanishes.</description>

      <title>The Diffusive Nature of Housing Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the French housing market prices in the period 1970-2022, with high-resolution data from 2018 to 2022. The spatial correlation of the observed price field exhibits logarithmic decay characteristic of the two-dimensional random diffusion equation -- local interactions may create long-range correlations. We introduce a stylized model, used in the past to model spatial regularities in voting patterns, that accounts for both spatial and temporal correlations with reasonable values of parameters. Our analysis reveals that price shocks are persistent in time and their amplitude is strongly heterogeneous in space. Our study confirms and quantifies the diffusive nature of housing prices that was anticipated long ago (Clapp et al. 1994, Pollakowski et al. 1997), albeit on much restricted, local data sets.</description>

      <title>Tracer and current fluctuations in driven diffusive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting particles diffusing in single-file is a fundamental model of transport in narrow channels where particles cannot bypass each other. An important result has been obtained by Kollmann for the mean square displacement of a tracer for any such single-file model. However, since then, no general result has been obtained in the important case where the particles are driven by an external field. Here, we fill this gap and determine the fluctuations and the skewness of the tracer's position for any driven diffusive system. In addition, we also consider a variety of important observables such as the integrated current, the response of the system to the perturbation induced by the displacement of the tracer, and the correlations between several tracers. Furthermore, we also unveil fundamental relations underlying the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of driven diffusive systems. This work constitutes a first step toward a full description of driven one-dimensional systems of interacting particles.</description>

      <title>Paradoxical non-Gaussian behavior in fractional Laplace motion with drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fractional Laplace motion (FLM) obtained from subordination of fractional Brownian motion to a gamma process, in the presence of an external drift that acts on the composite process or of an internal drift acting solely on the parental process. We derive the statistical properties of this FLM process and find that the external drift does not influence the mean-squared displacement (MSD), whereas the internal drift leads to normal diffusion, dominating at long times in the subdiffusive Hurst exponent regime. We also investigate the intricate properties of the probability density function (PDF), demonstrating that it possesses a central Gaussian region, whose expansion in time is influenced by FBM's Hurst exponent. Outside of this region the PDF follows a non-Gaussian pattern. The kurtosis of this FLM process converges toward the Gaussian limit at long times insensitive to the extreme non-Gaussian tails. Additionally, in the presence of the external drift, the PDF remains symmetric and centered at $x=vt$. In contrast, for the internal drift this symmetry is broken. The results of our computer simulations are fully consistent with the theoretical predictions. The FLM model is suitable for describing stochastic processes with a non-Gaussian PDF and long-ranged correlations of the motion.</description>

      <title>Expansion into the vacuum of stochastic gases with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a system of many point particles initially concentrated in a small region in $d$ dimensions. Particles undergo overdamped motion caused by pairwise interactions through the long-ranged repulsive $r^{-s}$ potential; each particle is also subject to Brownian noise. When $s&lt;d$, the expansion is governed by non-local hydrodynamic equations. In the one-dimensional case, we deduce self-similar solutions for all $s\in (-2,1)$. The expansion of Coulomb gases remains well-defined in the infinite-particle limit: The density is spatially uniform and inversely proportional to time independent of the spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>The liquid-liquid phase transition of hydrogen and its critical point: Analysis from ab initio simulation and a machine-learned potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate high-pressure hydrogen in its liquid phase close to molecular dissociation using a machine-learned interatomic potential. The model is trained with density functional theory (DFT) forces and energies, with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional. We show that an accurate NequIP model, an E(3)-equivariant neural network potential, accurately reproduces the phase transition present in PBE. Moreover, the computational efficiency of this model allows for substantially longer molecular dynamics trajectories, enabling us to perform a finite-size scaling (FSS) analysis to distinguish between a crossover and a true first-order phase transition. We locate the critical point of this transition, the liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT), at 1200-1300 K and 155-160 GPa, a temperature lower than most previous estimates and close to the melting transition.</description>

      <title>From Nonequilibrium to Equilibrium: Insights from a Two-Population Occupation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In socioeconomic systems, nonequilibrium dynamics naturally stem from the generically non-reciprocal interactions between self-interested agents, whereas equilibrium descriptions often only apply to scenarios where individuals act with the common good in mind. We bridge these two contrasting paradigms by studying a Sakoda-Schelling occupation model with both individualistic and altruistic agents, who, in isolation, follow nonequilibrium and equilibrium dynamics respectively. We investigate how the relative fraction of these two populations impacts the behavior of the system. In particular, we find that when fluctuations in the agents' decision-making process are small (high rationality), a very moderate amount of altruistic agents mitigates the sub-optimal concentration of individualists in dense clusters. In the regime where fluctuations carry more weight (low rationality), on the other hand, altruism progressively allows the agents to coordinate in a way that is significantly more robust, which we understand by reducing the model to a single effective population studied through the lens of active matter physics. We highlight that localizing the altruistic intervention at the right point in space may be paramount for its effectiveness.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the nonequilibrium conductance matrix for open stationary Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) described by a deterministic mass action kinetic equation. As an illustration, we determine the nonequilibrium conductance matrix of a CRN made of two sub-networks, called chemical modules, in two different ways: First by computing the nonequilibrium conductances of the modules that are then serially connected. Second by computing directly the nonequilibrium conductance of the CRN directly. The two approaches coincide, as expected from our theory of thermodynamic circuits. We end by discussing the advantages of splitting a CRN into smaller chemical modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the current-force characteristics of the serial (respectively parallel) association of two ThermoElectric Converters (TEC) using the laws of resistance (respectively conductance) matrix addition. Each TEC is modeled by a non-equilibrium conductance/resistance matrix describing the current-force characteristics of the TEC in stationary non-equilibrium. For TECs in series, we investigate the continuity of the potentials (and their derivatives) at their interfaces when thermoelectric coefficients are equal or not. We also study the current-dependent boundary conditions (for each sub-device) that significantly modify the conversion process. For TECs in parallel, we show that our result is compatible with the previously mentioned internal current loops even in open circuit boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in a Network with Assortative Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we employed the Ising model to identify phase transitions in a magnetic system where the degree distribution of the network follows a power-law and the connections are assortatively mixed. In the Ising model, the spins assume only two values, $\sigma = \pm 1$, and interact through ferromagnetic coupling $J$. The network is characterized by four variable parameters: $\alpha$ denotes the degree distribution exponent, the minimum degree $k_0$, the maximum degree $k_m$, and the $p_r$ represents the assortativity or disassortativity of the network. To investigate the effect of degree correlations on the critical behavior of the system, we fix $k_0=4$, $k_m=10$, and $\alpha=1$, and vary $p_r$ to obtain an assortative mixing of edges. As result, we have calculated the phase transition points of the system, and the critical exponents related to magnetization $\beta$, magnetic susceptibility $\gamma$, and the correlation length $\nu$.</description>

      <title>Effective Energy, Interactions And Out Of Equilibrium Nature Of Scalar Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the effective energy, $E_\text{eff}$ of a stationary probability distribution is a challenge for non-equilibrium steady states. Its solution could offer a novel framework for describing and analyzing non-equilibrium systems. In this work, we address this issue within the context of scalar active matter, focusing on the continuum field theory of Active Model B+. We show that the Wavelet Conditional Renormalization Group method allows us to estimate the effective energy of active model B+ from samples obtained by numerical simulations. We investigate the qualitative changes of $E_\text{eff}$ as the activity level increases. Our key finding is that in the regimes corresponding to low activity and to standard phase separation the interactions in $E_\text{eff}$ are short-ranged, whereas for strong activity the interactions become long-ranged and lead to micro-phase separation. By analyzing the violation of Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem and entropy production patterns, which are directly accessible within the WCRG framework, we connect the emergence of these long-range interactions to the non-equilibrium nature of the steady state. This connection highlights the interplay between activity, range of the interactions and the fundamental properties of non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion of Superparamagnetic Walkers with Tailored Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From life sciences and ecology to quantum physics and finance, anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets.</description>

      <title>Correlations, Spectra and Entaglement Transitions in Ensembles of Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate ensembles of Matrix Product States (MPSs) generated by quantum circuit evolution followed by projection onto MPSs with a fixed bond dimension $\chi$. Specifically, we consider ensembles produced by: (i) random sequential unitary circuits, (ii) random brickwork unitary circuits, and (iii) circuits involving both unitaries and projective measurements. In all cases, we characterize the spectra of the MPS transfer matrix and show that, for the first two cases in the thermodynamic limit, they exhibit a finite universal value of the spectral gap in the limit of large $\chi$, albeit with different spectral densities. We show that a finite gap in this limit does not imply a finite correlation length, as the mutual information between two large subsystems increases with $\chi$ in a manner determined by the entire shape of the spectral density. The latter differs for different types of circuits, indicating that these ensembles of MPS retain relevant physical information about the underlying microscopic dynamics. In particular, in the presence of monitoring, we demonstrate the existence of a measurement-induced entanglement transition (MIPT) in MPS ensembles, with the averaged dimension of the transfer matrix's null space serving as the effective order parameter.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of the Dicke-Ising Model via Digital-Analog Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''. Here, we propose a digital-analog quantum simulator for this model based on an ensemble of interacting qubits coupled to a single-mode photonic resonator. We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schr\"odinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</description>

      <title>Braiding for the win: Harnessing braiding statistics in topological states to win quantum games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal quantum games provide proof of principle that quantum resources can confer advantage at certain tasks. They also provide a compelling way to explore the computational utility of phases of matter on quantum hardware. In a recent manuscript [Hart et al., arXiv:2403.04829] we demonstrated that a toric code resource state conferred advantage at a certain nonlocal game, which remained robust to small deformations of the resource state. In this manuscript we demonstrate that this robust advantage is a generic property of resource states drawn from topological or fracton ordered phases of quantum matter. To this end, we illustrate how several other states from paradigmatic topological and fracton ordered phases can function as resources for suitably defined nonlocal games, notably the three-dimensional toric-code phase, the X-cube fracton phase, and the double-semion phase. The key in every case is to design a nonlocal game that harnesses the characteristic braiding processes of a quantum phase as a source of contextuality. We unify the strategies that take advantage of mutual statistics by relating the operators to be measured to order and disorder parameters of an underlying generalized symmetry-breaking phase transition. Finally, we massively generalize the family of games that admit perfect strategies when codewords of homological quantum error-correcting codes are used as resources.</description>

Abstract: The development of laser science and technology have stimulated the study of condensed matter physics, especially, dynamical or non-equilibrium nature in solids. The laser technique in terahertz (THz) regime, whose photon energy is comparable to those of typical collective modes in solids such as magnetic excitations, phonons, etc., has remarkably proceeded in the last decade. Theoretical tools for non-equilibrium states have also progressed. Thanks to these backgrounds, magneto-optics, especially, the study of controlling magnetism with laser, now enters a new stage. For such controls, Floquet engineering is a key concept, which means the method of controlling static properties of targets with high-frequency external fields like laser. I review the theoretical foundation of Floquet engineering and its application to magnetic insulators. Basic magnetic quantities such as magnetization, spin chirality, and spin current are shown to be controlled with intense THz laser or wave.</description>

      <title>Towards a mathematical framework for modelling cell fate dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An adult human body is made up of some 30 to 40 trillion cells, all of which stem from a single fertilized egg cell. The process by which the right cells appear to arrive in their right numbers at the right time at the right place -- development -- is only understood in the roughest of outlines. This process does not happen in isolation: the egg, the embryo, the developing foetus, and the adult organism all interact intricately with their changing environments. Conceptual and, increasingly, mathematical approaches to modelling development have centred around Waddington's concept of an epigenetic landscape. This perspective enables us to talk about the molecular and cellular factors that contribute to cells reaching their terminally differentiated state: their fate. The landscape metaphor is however only a simplification of the complex process of development; it for instance does not consider environmental influences, a context which we argue needs to be explicitly taken into account and from the outset. When delving into the literature, it also quickly becomes clear that there is a lack of consistency and agreement on even fundamental concepts; for example, the precise meaning of what we refer to when talking about a `cell type' or `cell state.' Here we engage with previous theoretical and mathematical approaches to modelling cell fate -- focused on trees, networks, and landscape descriptions -- and argue that they require a level of simplification that can be problematic. We introduce random dynamical systems as one natural alternative. These provide a flexible conceptual and mathematical framework that is free of extraneous assumptions. We develop some of the basic concepts and discuss them in relation to now `classical' depictions of cell fate dynamics, in particular Waddington's landscape.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion at various length scales with hydrodynamic and direct interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brownian motion is essential for describing diffusion in systems ranging from simple to complex liquids. Unlike simple liquids, which consist of only a solvent, complex liquids, such as colloidal suspensions or the cytoplasm of a cell, are mixtures of various constituents with different shapes and sizes. Describing Brownian motion in such multiscale systems is extremely challenging because direct and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (and their interplay) play a pivotal role. Diffusion of small particles is mainly governed by a low viscous character of the solution, whereas large particles experience a highly viscous flow of the complex liquid on the macro scale. A quantity that encodes hydrodynamics on both length scales is the wave-vector-dependent viscosity. Assuming this quantity to be known -- in contrast to most studies in which the solvent shear viscosity is given -- provides a new perspective on studying the diffusivity of a tracer, especially in situations where the tracer size can vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we start systematic studies of exact formal microscopic expressions for the short- and long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a single probe particle in a complex liquid in terms of short-ranged hydrodynamic response kernels. We study Brownian motion as a function of the probe size, contrasting most theories that focus on self-diffusion as a function of the crowder volume fraction. We discuss the limits of small and large probe sizes for various levels of approximations in our theory, and discuss the current successes and shortcomings of our approach.</description>

Abstract: The quantum extremal island rule allows us to compute the Page curves of Hawking radiation in semi-classical gravity. In this work, we study the connection between these calculations and the thermalisation of chaotic quantum many-body systems, using a coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics known as the entanglement membrane. Starting from a double-holographic model of eternal two-sided asymptotically AdS$_d$ ($d&gt;2$) black hole each coupled to a flat $d$-dimensional bath, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglement membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi-classical gravity and a chaotic quantum many-body system calculation of the Page curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extension of Landau's theory of phase transitions by incorporating the topology of the order parameter. When the order parameter comprises several components arising from multiplicity in the same irreducible representation of symmetry, it can possess a nontrivial topology and acquire a Berry phase under the variation of thermodynamic parameters. To illustrate this idea, we investigate the superconducting phase transition of an electronic system with tetragonal symmetry and an attractive interaction involving two partial waves, both transforming in the trivial representation. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation in the adiabatic limit, we show that the order parameter acquires a Berry phase after a cyclic evolution of parameters. We study two concrete models -- one preserving time-reversal symmetry and one breaking it -- and demonstrate that the nontrivial topology of the order parameter originates from thermodynamic analogs of gapless Dirac and Weyl points in the phase diagram. Finally, we identify an experimental signature of the topological Berry phase in a Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>A Finite-Time Quantum Otto Engine subject to Control Noise and Enhancement Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Circuits 2: Nonequilibrium conductance matrix for a thermoelectric converter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the linear regime, Onsager's response matrix provides the coupling between heat and charge currents crossing a section of thermoelectric materials of infinitesimal thickness. Integrating this response over the finite thickness of a one-dimensional Thermoelectric Converter (TEC) leads to quadratic heat-force characteristics (Joule's law) and linear current-voltage characteristics (Ohm's law). However, these non-linear characteristic equations are not matrix relation anymore. This prevents from determining the currents degree of coupling, albeit its central role for optimizing energy conversion. Based on current conservation laws, i.e., the linear dependence between internal physical currents (crossing a section of material) or between external ones (exchanged with the environment), we distinguish two relevant basis of physical and fundamental currents. For those, we define non-equilibrium conductance matrices providing the current-force relations of a TEC in any convenient basis. In doing so, we introduce a degree of coupling between heat and charge currents, in line with the work of Kedem and Caplan but beyond weakly irreversible thermodynamics. This demonstrates by example that non-equilibrium conductance matrices constitute effective models for driven systems, as Onsager response matrices do in the linear regime. The sequel papers of this series focus on associating systems modeled in such way.</description>

Abstract: We identify a pseudolocal conserved charge in the Fredkin and Motzkin quantum spin chains and explore its consequences for the hydrodynamics of systems with Fredkin- or Motzkin-type kinetic constraints. We use this quantity to formulate an exact upper bound ${\cal O}(L^{-5/2})$ on the gap of the Fredkin and Motzkin spin chains. Our results establish that transport in kinetically constrained dynamical systems with Fredkin or Motzkin constraints is subdiffusive, with dynamical exponent $z \geq 5/2$.</description>

      <title>New renormalization group study of the 3-state Potts model and related statistical models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical behavior of three-state statistical models invariant under the full symmetry group $S_3$ and its dependence on space dimension have been a matter of interest and debate. In particular, the phase transition of the 3-state Potts model in three dimensions is believed to be of the first order, without a definitive proof of absence of scale invariance in three-dimensional field theory with $S_3$ symmetry. This scale invariance should appear as a non-trivial fixed point of the renormalization group, which has not been found. Our new search, with the non-perturbative renormalization group, finds such a fixed point, as a bifurcation from the trivial fixed point at the critical space dimension $d=10/3$, which extends continuously to $d=3$. It does not correspond to a second-order phase transition of the 3-state Potts model, but is interesting in its own right. In particular, it shows how the $\varepsilon$-expansion can fail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptation refers to the ability to recover and maintain ``normal'' function upon perturbations of internal or external conditions and is essential for sustaining life. Biological adaptation mechanisms are dissipative, i.e. they require a supply of energy such as the coupling to the hydrolysis of ATP. Via evolution the underlying biochemical machinery of living organisms evolved into highly optimized states. However, in the case of adaptation processes two quantities are optimized simultaneously, the adaptation speed or accuracy and the thermodynamic cost. In such cases one typically faces a trade-off, where improving one quantity implies worsening the other. The solution is no longer unique but rather a Pareto set -- the set of all physically attainable protocols along which no quantity can be improved without worsening another. Here we investigate Pareto fronts in adaptation-dissipation trade-offs for a cellular thermostat and a minimal ATP-driven receptor-ligand reaction network. We find convex sections of Pareto fronts to be interrupted by concave regions, implying the coexistence of distinct optimization mechanisms. We discuss the implications of such ``compromise-optimal'' solutions and argue that they may endow biological systems with a superior flexibility to evolve, resist, and adapt to different environments.</description>

Abstract: We present analytical results for the joint probability distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ of first return (FR) times t and of the number of distinct sites s visited by a random walk (RW) on a one dimensional lattice before returning to the origin. The RW on a one dimensional lattice is recurrent, namely the probability to return to the origin is $P_{R}=1$. However the mean $\langle T_{FR}\rangle$ of the distribution $P(T_{FR}=t)$ of first return times diverges. Similarly, the mean $\langle S\rangle$ of the distribution $P(S=s)$ of the number of distinct sites visited before returning to the origin also diverges. The joint distribution $P(T_{FR}=t,S=s)$ provides a formulation that controls these divergences and accounts for the interplay between the kinetic and geometric properties of first return trajectories. We calculate the conditional distributions $P(T_{FR}=t|S=s)$ and $P(S=s|T_{FR}=t)$. We find that the conditional expectation value of first return times of trajectories that visit s distinct sites is ${\mathbb E}[T_{FR}|S=s]=\frac{2}{3}(s^2+s+1)$, and the variance is $Var(T_{FR}|S=s)=\frac{4}{45}(s-1)(s+2)(s^2+s-1)$. We also find that in the asymptotic limit, the conditional expectation value of the number of distinct sites visited by an RW that first returns to the origin at time $t=2n$ is ${\mathbb E}[S|T_{FR}=2n] \simeq \sqrt{\pi n}$, and the variance is $Var(S|T_{FR}=2n) \simeq \pi\left(\frac{\pi}{3}-1\right)n$. These results go beyond the important recent results of Klinger et al. [{\it Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 105}, 034116 (2022)], who derived a closed form expression for the generating function of the joint distribution, but did not go further to extract an explicit expression for the joint distribution itself. The joint distribution provides useful insight on the efficiency of random search processes, in which the aim is to cover as many sites as possible in a given number of steps.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Entanglement in the Measurement-Altered Quantum Ising Chain</title>

Abstract: Understanding the influence of measurements on the properties of many-body systems is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics and for quantum technologies. This paper explores how a finite density of stochastic local measurement modifies a given state's entanglement structure. Considering various measurement protocols, we explore the typical quantum correlations of their associated projected ensembles arising from the ground state of the quantum Ising model. Using large-scale numerical simulations, we demonstrate substantial differences among inequivalent measurement protocols. Surprisingly, we observe that forced on-site measurements can enhance both bipartite and multipartite entanglement. We present a phenomenological toy model and perturbative calculations to analytically support these results. Furthermore, we extend these considerations to the non-Hermitian Ising model, naturally arising in optically monitored systems, and we show that its qualitative entanglement features are not altered by a finite density of projective measurements. Overall, these results reveal a complex phenomenology where local quantum measurements do not simply disentangle degrees of freedom, but may actually strengthen the entanglement in the system.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal alignment induces asymmetric clustering in active mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneity is ubiquitous in biological and synthetic active matter systems that are inherently out of equilibrium. Typically, such active mixtures involve not only conservative interactions between the constituents, but also non-reciprocal couplings, whose full consequences for the collective behavior still remain elusive. Here, we study a minimal active non-reciprocal mixture with both, symmetric isotropic and non-reciprocal polar interactions. By combining a hydrodynamic theory derived from microscopic equations and particle-based simulations, we provide a scale-bridging view on the rich dynamics that occur even in absence of oscillatory instabilities. We show, in particular, that non-reciprocal alignment alone induces asymmetrical clustering at otherwise fully symmetric parameters. These density inhomogeneities go beyond the typical band formation in Vicsek-like systems. Within the asymmetric clustering state, single-species clusters chase more dilute accumulations of the other species.</description>

      <title>Dynamical structures in phase-separating non-reciprocal polar active mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases whose character depends on the type and degree of non-reciprocity. In this study, we theoretically investigate dynamical structures in a mixture of non-reciprocally aligning polar active particles with repulsion, focusing on the performance on (and connection between) different levels of description. Linear stability analyses of the associated continuum model predict a profound influence of non-reciprocity, leading to phase separation, (anti-)flocking and asymmetric clustering behavior. On the microscopic level, particle simulations confirm the emergence of these dynamical phases and allow for a more in-depth investigation of (microscopic) properties, including orientational correlations and susceptibilities. The drastic impact of orientational couplings alone on the density dynamics is demonstrated in particle simulations without repulsion, where non-reciprocal alignment leads to the asymmetric formation of single-species polarized clumps. Overall, our findings demonstrate that certain dynamical properties, like a chase-and-run behavior in the asymmetrical clustering phase, are overlooked in mean-field continuum theory, making microscopic simulations an indispensable tool for studying the effects of non-reciprocal alignment couplings.</description>

      <title>Rigidity transition of a highly compressible granular medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wide range of disordered materials, from biological to geological assemblies, feature discrete elements undergoing large shape changes. How significant geometrical variations at the microscopic scale affect the response of the assembly, in particular rigidity transitions, is an ongoing challenge in soft matter physics. However, the lack of a model granular-like experimental system featuring large and versatile particle deformability impedes advances. Here, we explore the oscillatory shear response of a sponge-like granular assembly composed of highly compressible elastic rings. We highlight a progressive rigidity transition, switching from a yielded phase to a solid one by increasing density or decreasing shear amplitude. The rearranging yielded state consists of crystal clusters separated by melted regions; in contrast, the solid state remains amorphous and absorbs all imposed shear elastically. We rationalize this transition by uncovering an effective, attractive shear force between rings that emerges from a friction-geometry interplay. If friction is sufficiently high, the extent of the contacts between rings, captured analytically by elementary geometry, controls the rigidity transition.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent theory for sound propagation in a simple model of a disordered, harmonic solid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a self-consistent theory for sound propagation in a simple model of a disordered solid. The solid is modeled as a collection of randomly distributed particles connected by harmonic springs with strengths that depend on the interparticle distances, i.e the Euclidean random matrix model of Mezard et al. [Nucl. Phys. 559B, 689 (1999)]. The derivation of the theory combines two exact projection operator steps and a factorization approximation. Within our approach the square of the speed of sound is non-negative. The unjamming transition manifests itself through vanishing of the speed of sound.</description>

      <title>Hair cells in the cochlea must tune resonant modes to the edge of instability without destabilizing collective modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sound produces surface waves along the cochlea's basilar membrane. To achieve the ear's astonishing frequency resolution and sensitivity to faint sounds, dissipation in the cochlea must be canceled via active processes in hair cells, effectively bringing the cochlea to the edge of instability. But how can the cochlea be globally tuned to the edge of instability with only local feedback? To address this question, we use a discretized version of a standard model of basilar membrane dynamics, but with an explicit contribution from active processes in hair cells. Surprisingly, we find the basilar membrane supports two qualitatively distinct sets of modes: a continuum of localized modes and a small number of collective extended modes. Localized modes sharply peak at their resonant position and are largely uncoupled. As a result, they can be amplified almost independently from each other by local hair cells via feedback reminiscent of self-organized criticality. However, this amplification can destabilize the collective extended modes; avoiding such instabilities places limits on possible molecular mechanisms for active feedback in hair cells. Our work illuminates how and under what conditions individual hair cells can collectively create a critical cochlea.</description>

Abstract: Understanding how macroscopic systems exhibit irreversible thermal behavior has been a long-standing challenge, first brought to prominence by Boltzmann. Recent advances have established rigorous conditions for isolated quantum systems to equilibrate to a maximum entropy state, contingent upon weak assumptions. These theorems, while powerful, apply for a sudden quench. However, natural processes involve finite-time perturbations or quenches, which raises a crucial question: Can these systems still equilibrate under more realistic, finite-time dynamics? In this work, we extend the established results to account for finite-time quenches, demonstrating that even under finite-time perturbations, the system will equilibrate provided it populates many significant energy levels. While the mathematical proof is more intricate than in the instantaneous case, the physical conclusion remains the same: sufficient perturbation leads to equilibration. Our results provide a broader and more physically realistic framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum systems</description>

      <title>Thermalization and hydrodynamic long-time tails in a Floquet system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. As an example, we investigate numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subject to a stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates which conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamics field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially, and which of them decay with a hydrodynamics long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators which can be defined on four neighboring sites. We show that all operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially and investigate a selected set of slowly decaying operators.</description>

      <title>Mode analysis of Nambu-Goldstone modes in U(1) charged first-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a mode analysis of a general U(1)-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of the effective field theory of dissipative fluids in a Minkowski background. The most general quadratic action for collective excitations around hydrodynamic solutions -- specifically, the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes associated with the symmetry-breaking pattern induced by external fields -- is derived. It is found that the hydrodynamical frame invariants write the first-order dispersion relations in the low energy limit. In thermodynamical viscous fluids realized by integrating out fast modes, unitarity and local KMS symmetry for its underlying UV theory are guaranteed. Then, we find that first-order hydrodynamics are stable if the null energy condition is satisfied. As the NG modes nonlinearly realize the diffeomorphism symmetries, our mode analysis is valid in any coordinate systems, including Lorentz-transformed references. We also comment on the causal structure for the diffusive modes based on the retarded Green functions for the stochastic NG mode.</description>

      <title>Ultimate precision limit of quantum thermal machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost, a principle formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation states that the relative variance of thermodynamic currents, calculated as the variance divided by the squared mean, decreases as entropy production increases. This means that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. In this Letter, we establish the ultimate limits of precision for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. We derive bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables, applicable to any unitary evolution of the composite system. These bounds are governed by the \textit{minimum eigenvalue factor}, which serves as a maximal entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and parallels the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamic. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence in the initial environmental state affects these fundamental bounds, showing that the presence of coherence can actually improve the ultimate precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines and the role of quantum effects in thermodynamic processes.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced phase transitions and critical phases in nonreciprocal non-Hermitian quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</description>
