      <title>An Anisotropic Constitutive Relationship by a Series of 8 Chain Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperelastic models have been widely used to model polymers and soft tissues. However, most hyperelastic models are phenomenological material models. Based on statistical mechanics and molecular chain configuration, 8 chain model or Arruda-Boyce model is a physical model which can be used to understand how microstructures of chains affect macroscopic mechanical properties of polymers and soft tissues. Mechanical properties of many polymers and soft tissues are directional dependent. Polymer matrix can be reinforced by fibers. For soft tissues, ligaments and tendons will lead to anisotropic properties. Since matrix and reinforcements are composed of similar microstructural molecular chains, they can be modeled by using the same mathematical model. In this paper, a series of 8 chain models is used to understand composite properties. That is, an isotropic 8 chain model will be used to model matrix and anisotropic 8 chain models will be used to model fibers. Replacing I_1 in isotropic 8 chain model with I_4 in anisotropic 8 chain model is physically corresponding to changing representative 8 chain cubic cell to 8 chain slender cell. This treatment not only simplifies exist anisotropic mathematical structures but also keeps microscopic physics of 8 chain model unchanged.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: AI-assisted exploration and active design of polymers with high intrinsic thermal conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing polymers with high intrinsic thermal conductivity (TC) is critically important for the thermal management of organic electronics and photonics. However, this is a challenging task owing to the diversity of the chemical space and the barriers to advanced synthetic experiments/characterization techniques for polymers. In this Tutorial, the fundamentals and implementation of combining classical molecular dynamics simulation and machine learning (ML) for the development of polymers with high TC are comprehensively introduced. We begin by describing the core components of a universal ML framework, involving polymer datasets, property calculators, feature engineering and informatics algorithms. Then, the process of constructing interpretable regression algorithms for TC prediction is introduced, aiming to extract the underlying relationships between microstructures and TCs for polymers. We also explore the design of sequence-ordered polymers with high TC using lightweight and mainstream active learning algorithms. Lastly, we conclude by addressing the current limitations and suggesting potential avenues for future research on this topic.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic approximants bridging quasicrystals and modulated structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aperiodic crystals constitute a fascinating class of materials that includes incommensurate (IC) modulated structures and quasicrystals (QCs). Although these two categories share a common foundation in the concept of superspace, the relationship between them has remained enigmatic and largely unexplored. Here, we show "any metallic-mean" QCs, surpassing the confines of Penrose-like structures, and explore their connection with IC modulated structures. In contrast to periodic approximants of QCs, our work introduces the pivotal role of "aperiodic approximants", articulated through a series of $k$-th metallic-mean tilings serving as aperiodic approximants for the honeycomb crystal, while simultaneously redefining this tiling as a metallic-mean IC modulated structure, highlighting the intricate interplay between these crystallographic phenomena. We extend our findings to real-world applications, discovering these unique tiles in a terpolymer/homopolymer blend and applying our QC theory to a colloidal simulation displaying planar IC structures. In these structures, domain walls are viewed as essential components of a quasicrystal, introducing additional dimensions in superspace. Our research provides a fresh perspective on the intricate world of aperiodic crystals, shedding light on their broader implications for domain wall structures across various fields.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic material properties determine contact mechanics of hydrogel spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular materials are ubiquitous in nature and industry; their mechanical behavior has been of academic and engineering interest for centuries. One of the reasons for their rather complex mechanical behavior is that stresses exerted on a granular material propagate only through contacts between the grains. These contacts can change as the packing evolves. This makes any deformation and mechanical response from a granular packing a function of the nature of contacts between the grains and the material response of the material the grains are made of. We present a study in which we isolate the role of the grain material in the contact forces acting between two particles sliding past each other. We use hydrogel particles and find that a viscoelastic material model, in which the shear modulus decays with time, coupled with a simple Coulomb friction model captures the experimental results. The results suggest that the particle material evolution itself may play a role in the collective behavior of granular materials.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of branched copolymers in dilute solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the universal conformational properties of complex copolymer macromolecules, based on two topologies: the rosette structure containing $f_c$ linear branches and $f_r$ closed loops grafted to the central core, and the symmetric pom-pom structure, consisting of a backbone linear chain terminated by two branching points with functionalities $f$. We assume that the constituent strands (branches) of these structures can be of two different chemical species $a$ and $b$. Depending on the solvent conditions, the inter- or intrachain interactions of some links may vanish, which corresponds to $\Theta$-state of the corresponding polymer species. Applying both the analytical approach within the frames of direct polymer renormalization and numerical simulations based on the lattice model of polymer, we evaluated the set of parameters characterizing the size properties of constituent parts of two complex topologies and estimated quantitatively the impact of interactions between constituent parts on these size characteristics.</description>

      <title>Superadiabatic dynamical density functional theory for colloidal suspensions under homogeneous steady-shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superadiabatic dynamical density functional theory (superadiabatic-DDFT) is a promising new method for the study of colloidal systems out-of-equilibrium. Within this approach the viscous forces arising from interparticle interactions are accounted for in a natural way by treating explicitly the dynamics of the two-body correlations. For bulk systems subject to spatially homogeneous shear we use the superadiabatic-DDFT framework to calculate the steady-state pair distribution function and the corresponding viscosity for low values of the shear-rate. We then consider a variant of the central approximation underlying this superadiabatic theory and obtain an inhomogeneous generalization of a rheological bulk theory due to Russel and Gast. This paper thus establishes for the first time a connection between DDFT approaches, formulated to treat inhomogeneous systems, and existing work addressing nonequilibrium microstructure and rheology in bulk colloidal suspensions.</description>

      <title>Finite size effects and optimization of the calculation of the surface tension in surfactant mixtures at liquid/vapour interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface tension of monolayers with mixtures of anionic and nonionic surfactant at the liquid/vapour interface is studied. Previous works have observed that calculations of the surface tension of simple fluids show artificial oscillations for small interfacial areas, indicating that the surface tension data fluctuate due to the finite size effects and periodic boundary conditions. In the case of simulations of monolayers composed of surfactant mixtures, the surface tension not only oscillates for small areas but can also give non-physical data, such as negative values. Analysis of the monolayers with different surfactant mixtures, ionic (DTAB, CTAB, SDS) and nonionic (SB3-12), was done for density profiles, parameters of order and pair correlation functions for small and large box areas and all of them present similar behaviour. The fluctuations and the non-physical values of the surface tension are corrected when boxes with large interfacial areas are considered. The results indicate that in order to obtain reliable values of the surface tension, in computer simulations, it is important to choose not only the correct force field but also the appropriate size of the simulation box.</description>

      <title>Phase separation dynamics in a symmetric binary mixture of ultrasoft particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase separation plays an role in determining the self-assembly of biological and soft-matter systems. In biological systems, liquid-liquid phase separation inside a cell leads to the formation of various macromolecular aggregates. The interaction among these aggregates is soft, i.e., these can significantly overlap at a small energy cost. From the computer simulation point of view, these complex macromolecular aggregates are generally modeled by the so-called soft particles. The effective interaction between two particles is defined via the generalized exponential potential (GEM-n) with n = 4. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we study the phase separation dynamics of a size-symmetric binary mixture of ultrasoft particles. We find that when the mixture is quenched to a lower temperature below the critical temperature, the two components spontaneously start to separate. Domains of the two components form, and the equal-time order parameter reveals that the domains grow in a power-law manner with exponent 1/3, which is consistent with the Lifshitz-Slyozov law for conserved systems. Further, the static structure factor shows a power-law decay with exponent 4 consistent with the Porod law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research focuses on the unique phase behavior of non-spherical patchy colloids in porous environments. Based on the theory of scaled particle (SPT), methods have been refined and applied to analyze the thermodynamic properties of non-spherical patchy particles in a disordered porous medium. Utilizing the associative theory of liquids in conjunction with SPT, we investigated the impact of associative interactions and connections between the functional nodes of particles on the formation of the nematic phase. Calculations of orientational and spatial distributions were conducted, which helped to understand the phase behavior of particles during the transition from isotropic to nematic phase under the spatial constraints imposed by the disordered matrix of the porous medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porous media, while ubiquitous across many engineering disciplines, is inherently difficult to characterize due to their innate stochasticity and heterogeneity. The key for predicting porous material behavior comes down to the structuring of its microstructure, where the linkages of microstructural properties to mesoscale effects remain as one of the key questions in unlocking understanding of this class of materials. One proposed method of linking scales comes down to using Minkowski functionals -- geometric morphometers that describe the spatial and topological features of a convex space -- to draw connections from microstructural form to mesoscale features. In this work, chemical equilibrium and kinetics on a microstructure surface were explored, with Minkowski functionals used as the basis for relating microstructural geometry to chemical performance. Using surface CRNs to model chemical behavior -- a novel asynchronous cellular automaton -- linkages were found between the Minkowski functionals and equilibrium equilibrium constant, as well as properties related to the dynamics of the system's reaction quotient.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear spontaneous flow instability in active nematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active nematics exhibit spontaneous flows through a well-known linear instability of the uniformly-aligned quiescent state. Here we show that even a linearly stable uniform state can experience a nonlinear instability, resulting in a discontinuous transition to spontaneous flows. In this case, quiescent and flowing states may coexist. Through a weakly nonlinear analysis and a numerical study, we trace the bifurcation diagram of striped patterns and show that the underlying pitchfork bifurcation switches from supercritical (continuous) to subcritical (discontinuous) by varying the flow-alignment parameter. We predict that the discontinuous spontaneous flow transition occurs for a wide range of parameters, including systems of contractile flow-aligning rods. Our predictions are relevant to active nematic turbulence and can potentially be tested in experiments on either cell layers or active cytoskeletal suspensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover unexpected connections between packing configurations and rare fluctuations in dense systems of active particles subject to pulsation of size. Using large deviation theory, we examine biased ensembles which select atypical realizations of the dynamics exhibiting high synchronization in particle size. We show that the order emerging at high bias can manifest as distinct dynamical states with either a finite or a vanishing size current. Remarkably, transitions between these states arise from changing the system geometry at fixed bias and constant density. We rationalize such transitions as stemming from a change in the packing configurations favored by the geometry. Specifically, we reveal that a master curve in the unbiased dynamics, correlating polydispersity and current, helps predict the dynamical state emerging in the biased dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that deformation waves can propagate under suitable geometries when biasing with local order.</description>

      <title>Role of Fragility of the Glass Formers in the Yielding Transition under Oscillatory Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of the fragility of glass formers on the yielding transition under oscillatory shear via extensive computer simulations. Employing sphere assemblies interacting with a harmonic potential as our model glass former, we tune fragility by changing the system's density - higher density corresponds to large fragility. Our study reveals significant differences in the yielding transition between strong and fragile glass formers. While both glass formers exhibit similar behaviour under poorly annealed initial conditions, the yielding transition shifts to larger values with increased annealing for fragile glasses while remaining relatively constant for strong glasses. We rationalize our results by introducing a new elastoplastic model, which qualitatively reproduces the simulation results and offers valuable insight into the physics of yielding transition under oscillatory shear deformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulus-induced volumetric phase transition in gels may be potentially exploited for various bio-engineering and mechanical engineering applications. Since the discovery of the phenomenon in the 1970s, extensive experimental research has helped in understanding the phase transition and related critical phenomena. Yet, little insight is available on the evolving microstructure. In this article, we aim at unravelling certain geometric aspects of the micromechanics underlying discontinuous phase transition in polyacrylamide gels. Towards this, we use geometric thermodynamics and a Landau-Ginzburg type free energy functional involving a squared gradient, in conjunction with Flory-Huggins theory. We specifically exploit Ruppeiner's approach of Riemannian geometry-enriched thermodynamic fluctuation theory that has been previously employed to investigate phase transitions in van der Waals fluids and black holes. The framework equips us with a scalar curvature that relates to the microstructural interactions of a gel during phase transition and at critical points. This curvature also provides an insight into the universality class of phase transition and the nature of polymer-polymer interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tissue homeostasis, the biological process of maintaining a steady state in tissue via control of cell proliferation, death, and metabolic function, is essential for the development, growth, maintenance, and proper function of living organisms. Disruptions to this process can lead to serious diseases and even death. In this study, we use the vertex model for the cell-level description of tissue mechanics to investigate the impact of the tissue microenvironment and local mechanical properties of cells on homeostasis in confined epithelial tissues. We find a dynamic steady state, where the balance between cell divisions and removals sustains homeostasis. By characterising homeostasis in terms of cell count, tissue area, and the cells' neighbour count distribution, we identify the factors that govern regulated and ordered tissue growth. This work, therefore, sheds light on the mechanisms underlying tissue homeostasis and highlights the importance of mechanics in the control of biological processes such as tissue development and disease pathology.</description>

      <title>Shaping a Surface Microdroplet by Marangoni Forces along a Moving Contact Line of Four Immiscible Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to transfer microdroplets between fluid phases offers numerous advantages in various fields, enabling better control, manipulation, and utilization of small volumes of fluids in pharmaceutical formulations, microfluidics, and lab-on-a-chip devices, single-cell analysis or droplet-based techniques for nanomaterial synthesis. This study focuses on the stability and morphology of a sessile oil microdroplet at the four-phase contact line of solid-water-oil-air during the droplet transfer from underwater to air. We observed a distinct transition in microdroplet dynamics, characterized by a shift from a scenario dominated by Marangoni forces to one dominated by capillary forces. In the regime dominated by Marangoni forces, the oil microdroplets spread in response to the contact between the water-air interface and the water-oil interface and the emergence of an oil concentration gradient along the water-air interface. The spreading distance along the four-phase contact line follows a power law relationship of $t^{3/4}$, reflecting the balance between Marangoni forces and viscous forces. On the other hand, in the capillarity-dominated regime, the oil microdroplets remain stable at the contact line and after being transferred into the air. We identify the crossover between these two regimes in the parameter space defined by three factors: the approaching velocity of the solid-water-air contact line ($v_{cl}$), the radius of the oil microdroplet ($r_o$), and the radius of the water drop ($r_w$). Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use the four-phase contact line for shaping oil microdroplets using a full liquid process by the contact line lithography. The findings in this study may be also applied to materials synthesis where nanoparticles, microspheres, or nanocapsules are produced by microdroplet-based techniques.</description>

      <title>Enhanced extracellular matrix remodeling due to embedded spheroid fluidization</title>

Abstract: Tumor spheroids are in vitro three-dimensional, cellular collectives consisting of cancerous cells. Embedding these spheroids in an in vitro fibrous environment, such as a collagen network, to mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM) provides an essential platform to quantitatively investigate the biophysical mechanisms leading to tumor invasion of the ECM. To understand the mechanical interplay between tumor spheroids and the ECM, we computationally construct and study a three-dimensional vertex model for a tumor spheroid that is mechanically coupled to a cross-linked network of fibers. In such a vertex model, cells are represented as deformable polyhedrons that share faces. Some fraction of the boundary faces of the tumor spheroid contain linker springs connecting the center of the boundary face to the nearest node in the fiber network. As these linker springs actively contract, the fiber network remodels. By toggling between fluid-like and solid-like spheroids via changing the dimensionless cell shape index, we find that the spheroid rheology affects the remodeling of the fiber network. More precisely, fluid-like spheroids displace the fiber network more on average near the vicinity of the spheroid than solid-like spheroids. We also find more densification of the fiber network near the spheroid for the fluid-like spheroids. These spheroid rheology-dependent effects are the result of cellular motility due to active cellular rearrangements that emerge over time in the fluid-like spheroids to generate spheroid shape fluctuations. Our results uncover intricate morphological-mechanical interplay between an embedded spheroid and its surrounding fiber network with both spheroid contractile strength and spheroid shape fluctuations playing important roles in the pre-invasion stages of tumor invasion.</description>

      <title>Tuning upstream swimming of micro-robots by shape and cargo size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2004.05694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The navigation of micro-robots in complex flow environments is controlled by rheotaxis, the reorientation with respect to flow gradients. Here we demonstrate how payloads can be exploited to enhance the motion against flows. Using fully resolved hydrodynamic simulations, the mechanisms are described that allow micro-robots of different shapes to reorient upstream. We find that cargo pullers are the fastest at most flow strengths, but pushers feature a non-trivial optimum as a function of the counter flow strength. Moreover, the rheotactic performance can be maximised by tuning the micro-robot shape or cargo size. These results may be used to control micro-swimmer navigation, but they also apply to rheotaxis in microbial ecology and the prevention of bacterial contamination dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the temperature dependence of the density of states of liquids at low energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report neutron-scattering measurements of the density of states (DOS) of water and liquid Fomblin in a wide range of temperatures. In the liquid phase, we confirm the presence of a universal low-energy linear scaling of the experimental DOS as a function of the frequency, $g(\omega)= a(T) \omega$, which persists at all temperatures. The low-frequency scaling of the DOS exhibits a sharp jump at the melting point of water, below which the standard Debye's law, $g(\omega) \propto \omega^2$, is recovered. On the contrary, in Fomblin, we observe a continuous transition between the two exponents reflecting its glassy dynamics, which is confirmed by structure measurements. More importantly, in both systems, we find that the slope $a(T)$ grows with temperature following an exponential Arrhenius-like form, $a(T) \propto \exp(-\langle E \rangle /T)$. We confirm this experimental trend using molecular dynamics simulations and show that the prediction of instantaneous normal mode (INM) theory for $a(T)$ is in qualitative agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Stringlet Excitation Model of the Boson Peak</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The boson peak (BP), a low-energy excess in the vibrational density of states over the Debye contribution, is often identified as a characteristic of amorphous solid materials. Despite decades of efforts, its microscopic origin still remains a mystery. Recently, it has been proposed, and corroborated with simulations, that the BP might stem from intrinsic localized modes involving one-dimensional (1D) string-like excitations (``stringlets"). We build on a theory originally proposed by Lund that describes the localized modes as 1D vibrating strings, but we specify the stringlet size distribution to be exponential, as observed in simulations. We provide an analytical prediction for the BP frequency $\omega_{BP}$ in the temperature regime well below the observed glass transition temperature $T_g$. The prediction involves no free parameters and accords quantitatively with prior simulation observations in 2D and 3D model glasses based on inverse power law potentials. The comparison of the string model to observations is more uncertain when compared to simulations of an Al-Sm metallic glass material at temperatures well above $T_g$. Nonetheless, our stringlet theory of the BP naturally reproduces the softening of the BP frequency upon heating and offers an analytical explanation for the experimentally observed scaling with the shear modulus in the glass state and changes in this scaling in simulations of glass-forming liquids. Finally, the theoretical analysis highlights the existence of a strong damping for the stringlet modes above $T_g$, which leads to a large low-frequency contribution to the 3D vibrational density of states, observed in both experiments and simulations.</description>

Abstract: Liquid crystals consisting of biaxial particles can exhibit a much richer phase behavior than their uniaxial counterparts. Usually, one has to rely on simulation results to understand the phase diagram of these systems, since very few analytical results exist. In this work, we apply fundamental measure theory, which allows us to derive free energy functionals for hard particles from first principles and with high accuracy, to systems of hard cylinders, cones and spherotriangles. We provide a general recipe for incorporating biaxial liquid crystal order parameters into fundamental measure theory and use this framework to obtain the phase boundaries for the emergence of orientational order in the considered systems. Our results provide insights into the phase behavior of biaxial nematic liquid crystals and, in particular, into methods for their analytical investigation.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Disordered Hyperuniformity in Melts of Linear Diblock Copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform (DHU) systems are recently discovered exotic states of matter, where (normalized) large-scale density fluctuations are completely suppressed as in crystals, even though the systems are isotropic and lack conventional long-range order. Despite recent success, realizing such systems using bottom-up approaches remains challenging. Here, we study the large-scale behavior of neat melts of linear diblock copolymers using large-cell self-consistent field theory (SCFT) simulations. We initialize SCFT simulations using point patterns that correspond to the local energy minimum of the so-called Quantizer energy, a geometric functional related to the free energy of copolymeric self-assemblies. Upon relaxation via the SCFT simulations, we obtain a new class of metastable disordered micelle mesophases that are hyperuniform. Moreover, we find that DHU micelle mesophases possess very similar free energies to the thermodynamically stable body-centered cubic sphere mesophases and are also much more favorable energetically than previously obtained liquid-like packings. Our findings shed light on the design of novel disordered hyperuniform materials using bottom-up approaches, and suggest new possibilities for technological applications, e.g., novel non-iridescent structural colors.</description>

      <title>Noether invariance theory for the equilibrium force structure of soft matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give details and derivations for the Noether invariance theory that characterizes the spatial equilibrium structure of inhomogeneous classical many-body systems, as recently proposed and investigated for bulk systems [F. Samm\"uller $\textit{et al.}$, Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{130}$, 268203 (2023)]. Thereby an intrinsic thermal symmetry against a local shifting transformation on phase space is exploited on the basis of the Noether theorem for invariant variations. We consider the consequences of the shifting that emerge at second order in the displacement field that parameterizes the transformation. In a natural way the standard two-body density distribution is generated. Its second spatial derivative (Hessian) is thereby balanced by two further and different two-body correlation functions, which respectively introduce thermally averaged force correlations and force gradients in a systematic and microscopically sharp way into the framework. Separate exact self and distinct sum rules hold expressing this balance. We exemplify the validity of the theory on the basis of computer simulations for the Lennard-Jones gas, liquid, and crystal, the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen fluid, monatomic Molinero-Moore water at ambient conditions, a three-body-interacting colloidal gel former, the Yukawa and soft-sphere dipolar fluids, and for isotropic and nematic phases of Gay-Berne particles. We describe explicitly the derivation of the sum rules based on Noether's theorem and also give more elementary proofs based on partial phase space integration following Yvon's theorem.</description>

      <title>Order in disordered packings with and without permutation symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A disordered solid, such as an athermal jammed packing of soft spheres, exists in a rugged potential-energy landscape in which there are a myriad of stable configurations that defy easy enumeration and characterization. Nevertheless, in three-dimensional monodisperse particle packings, we demonstrate an astonishing regularity in the distribution of basin volumes. The probability of landing randomly in a basin is proportional to its volume. Ordering the basins according to their probability, $P(n)$, from the largest at $n=1$ to smaller at larger $n$, we find approximately: $P(n) \propto n^{-1}$. This order, persisting up to the largest systems for which we can collect sufficient data, has implications for the dynamics of a system as it evolves under perturbations. In monodisperse packings there is ``permutation symmetry'' since identical particles can always be interchanged without affecting the system or its properties. Introducing any distribution of radii breaks this symmetry and leads to a proliferation of distinct configurations. We present an algorithm that partially restores permutation symmetry to such polydisperse packings.</description>

      <title>Universal Hyperuniformity in Active Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that dry scalar-order active field theories (AFTs) are universally hyperuniform, i.e., density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in the long-time limit regardless of the integrability or functional form of the active contributions up to third order in gradient terms. These AFTs include Active model B, Active model B+, and effective Cahn-Hilliard models. Moreover, density variances and spectral densities are virtually indistinguishable from that of passive phase-separated hyperuniform fields. Higher moments of the density fluctuations, however, reveal activity-dependent higher-order correlations that are not captured by conventional two-point measures that characterize hyperuniformity.</description>

      <title>Elevated temperature effects (T &gt; 100 {\deg}C) on the interfacial water and microstructure swelling of Na-montmorillonite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Montmorillonite-based barriers are key elements of the engineered barrier systems (EBS) in geological disposal facilities (GDF). Their performance at temperatures above 100 {\deg}C is not sufficiently understood to assess the possibility of raising the temperature limits in GDF designs that could reduce construction costs and CO2 footprint. The present work provides new fundamental insights through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Na-montmorillonite's water-clay interactions and swelling pressure at temperatures 298-500 K and basal spacings of 1.5-3.5 nm. At temperatures above 100 {\deg}C, the swelling behaviour is governed by the attractive van der Waals force and the repulsive hydration force instead of the repulsive electrostatic (double layer) force. The swelling pressure reduction with increasing temperature is related to the weakened hydration repulsion and electric double layer repulsion, which result from the deterioration of the interlayer water layer structure and the shrinkage of the electric double layer. The applicability and breakdown of the classic Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory at elevated temperatures are examined. By excluding the osmotic contribution in the DLVO theory, the summation of the van der Waals interaction in DLVO and an additional non-DLVO hydration interaction can predict our MD system's swelling under high temperatures. The findings of this study provide a fundamental understanding of the swelling behaviour and the underlying molecular-level mechanisms of the clay microstructure under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Persistent homology and topological statistics of hyperuniform point clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity, the suppression of density fluctuations at large length scales, is observed across a wide variety of domains, from cosmology to condensed matter and biological systems. Although the standard definition of hyperuniformity only utilizes information at the largest scales, hyperuniform configurations have distinctive local characteristics. However, the influence of global hyperuniformity on local structure has remained largely unexplored; establishing this connection can help uncover long-range interaction mechanisms and detect hyperuniform traits in finite-size systems. Here, we study the topological properties of hyperuniform point clouds by characterizing their persistent homology and the statistics of local graph neighborhoods. We find that varying the structure factor results in configurations with systematically different topological properties. Moreover, these topological properties are conserved for subsets of hyperuniform point clouds, establishing a connection between finite-sized systems and idealized reference arrangements. Comparing distributions of local topological neighborhoods reveals that the hyperuniform arrangements lie along a primarily one-dimensional manifold reflecting an order-to-disorder transition via hyperuniform configurations. The results presented here complement existing characterizations of hyperuniform phases of matter, and they show how local topological features can be used to detect hyperuniformity in size-limited simulations and experiments.</description>
