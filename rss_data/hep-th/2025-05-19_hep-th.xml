      <title>Taxonomy of branes in infinite distance limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I consider flat slices of moduli spaces where the $(-\nabla \log T)$-vectors of particle-towers and branes are constant, and I show that the Emergent String Conjecture constrains these vectors to reside on lattices. In asymptotic limits, this results in exponentially separated, discretized hierarchies of energy scales. I further identify conditions that determine whether a given lattice site must be populated, and I show that only a finite set of configurations satisfies these conditions. I classify all such configurations for 0d, 1d, and 2d moduli spaces in theories with 3 to 11 spacetime dimensions, and I argue that 11d is the maximal spacetime dimension compatible with my assumptions. Remarkably, this classification reproduces the detailed particle and brane content of various string theory examples with 32, 16, and 8 supercharges. It also describes some examples where the assumptions I use are violated, suggesting that my assumptions can be relaxed and the scope of this classification can be expanded. It might also predict new branes. For instance, if heterotic string theory is described by this classification, then it must possess non-BPS branes with D-brane-like tensions. Similarly, if this classification applies to the Dark Dimension Scenario with an extra modulus, then it requires strings with tensions at or below the GUT scale.</description>

      <title>A differential equation for a class of correlation kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new differential equation is derived for an object ${\widehat S}(E,E^\prime,x)$, which when integrated over the appropriate range in $x$, yields the kernel $K(E,E^\prime)$ with which $n$-point correlation functions can be computed in a wide class of models. When $E{=}E^\prime$, the equation reduces to the equation for the diagonal resolvent ${\widehat R}(E,x)$ of the Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian ${H}{=}{-}\hbar^2\partial_x^2{+}u(x)$ that is familiar from the classic work of Gel'fand and Dikii, and which appears in many areas of physics. This more general equation may also prove to be useful in a wide range of applications. Some special cases relevant to random matrix theory are explored using analytical and numerical methods.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{I}$-Extremization for AdS$_4$ Black Holes: Master Volume, Free Energy, and Baryonic Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we proposed an entropy function for AdS$_4$ BPS black holes in M-theory with general magnetic charges, resolving a long-standing puzzle about baryonic charges in three-dimensional holography and offering a prediction for the large-$N$ limit of several partition functions whose saddle points have yet to be found. The entropy function is constructed from the master volume of the internal manifold. In this paper, we prove that the entropy of a general class of black holes based on toric geometry can indeed be reformulated as an $\mathcal{I}$-extremization problem, and we provide a set of examples. As an aside, we also simplify existing proofs of the equivalence between $a$-, $c$-, and $F$-extremizations and their gravitational duals.</description>

      <title>The Beauty of Self-Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-duality plays a very important role in many applications in field theories possessing topological solitons. In general, the self-duality equations are first order partial differential equations such that their solutions satisfy the second order Euler-Lagrange equations of the theory. The fact that one has to perform one integration less to construct self-dual solitons, as compared to the usual topological solitons, is not linked to the use of any dynamically conserved quantity. It is important that the topological charge admits an integral representation, and so there exists a density of topological charge. The homotopic invariance of it leads to local identities, in the form of second order differential equations. The magic is that such identities become the Euler-Lagrange equations of the theory when the self-duality equations are imposed. We review some important structures underlying the concept of self-duality, and show how it can be applied to kinks, lumps, monopoles, Skyrmions and instantons.</description>

      <title>Improved Holographic QCD on a Curved Background: an Application of Dynamical System Theory in Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite-curvature phase diagram of IHQCD, a bottom-up holographic model for large $N_c$ non-supersymmetric YM$_4$, is investigated. This holographic theory belongs to a class of Einstein-Dilaton theories that exhibit no scaling in the IR. We use advanced techniques from dynamical system theory to address this problem that is harder than other holographic setups. We classify all solutions where the dual theory is defined on a constant curvature manifold, both with positive and negative curvature. For general theories in this class a quantum phase transition occurs at finite curvature. For IHQCD in particular, we find that the phase transition occurs at zero curvature.</description>

      <title>Towards local and compositional measurements in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universal framework for the joint measurement of multiple localized observables in quantum field theory satisfying spacetime locality and compositionality is still lacking. We present an approach to the problem that is based on the one hand on the positive formalism, an axiomatic framework, where it is clear from the outset that we satisfy locality and compositionality, while also having a consistent probabilistic interpretation. On the other hand, the approach is based on standard tools from quantum field theory, in particular the path integral and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. After an overview of the conceptual foundations we introduce the modulus-square construction as a formalization of the measurement process for an important class of observables including quadratic observables. We show that this construction has many of the desired properties, including positivity, locality, single measurement recovery and compositionality. We introduce a renormalization scheme for the measurement of quadratic observables that also satisfies compositionality, in contrast to previous renormalization schemes. We discuss relativistic causality, confirming that measurements in our scheme are indeed localized in the spacetime regions where the underlying observables have support.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Stability and Critical Exponents of the Neutral (S-type) Gubser-Rocha Model with Momentum Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (S-type) Gubser-Rocha model is a holographic model, which can be derived from the maximal gauged supergravity in four dimensions. With an appropriate choice of the boundary action, this model exhibits a continuous phase transition in the neutral limit. In this paper, we investigate several aspects of this phase transition. Firstly, we show that the critical exponents of the phase transition match those in the mean-field percolation theory. Subsequently, we also investigate the dynamical stability, and the emergence of the Nambu-Goldstone modes by analyzing the quasinormal modes of the perturbation fields. The dynamical stability agrees with the thermodynamic stability. In addition, we find that there is an emergent Nambu-Goldstone mode in the broken phase of the S-type model.</description>

      <title>Upper bound of holographic entanglement entropy combinations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a systematic formalism to evaluate the upper bound of a large family of holographic entanglement entropy combinations when fixing $n$ subsystems and fine-tuning one other subsystem. The upper bound configurations and values of these entropy combinations can be derived and classified. The upper bound of these entropy combinations reveals holographic $n+1$-partite entanglement that $n$ fixed subsystems participate in. In AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$, and even higher-dimensional holography, one can, in principle, find different formulas of upper bound values, reflecting the fundamental difference in entanglement structure in different dimensions.</description>

      <title>Electric-Magnetic Duality for Symmetric Tensor Gauge Theories and Immobile $p$-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study electric-magnetic duality in Lorentz invariant symmetric tensor gauge theories, where immobile charged particles - fractons - arise due to the generalized current conservation $\partial_{\mu} \partial_{\nu} J^{\mu \nu} = 0$ and the fracton gauge principle. We show that the duality in the symmetric gauge theories holds only in four-dimensional spacetime. In higher dimensions, the duality does not hold with only the symmetric gauge fields but tensor fields with more complex symmetries come into play. Furthermore, we show that a hierarchy for the symmetric gauge field theories of higher ranks is interpreted by the bi-form calculus. We also discuss the restricted immobility of $p$-branes in the mixed symmetric gauge theories. As a byproduct, we find that novel self-duality conditions are defined as BPS equations in the four-dimensional Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Magnetic monopoles in Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, BPS models built from the coupling of Yang-Mills-Higgs Lagrangian to impurities are investigated. We first consider scalar impurities, which in the BPS limit generate monopoles similar to those obtained in a previously considered class of $\mathrm{SU(2)}\times\mathrm{Z}_2$ or $\mathrm{SU(2)}\times\mathrm{SU(2)}$ models. We then focus on coupling with nonabelian impurities, defined as fixed backgrounds produced from fields transforming under the adjoint representation of SU(2), with a coupling chosen to preserve half of the BPS sectors. The nature of this coupling, the ensuing Bogomol'nyi bound and BPS equations, as well as the effect of these impurities in the abelianization that leads to the emergence of a U(1) gauge group are investigated. We study in greater detail impurities with spherical symmetry, and examine the manner in which impurity coupling changes the asymptotic behavior and range of monopole interactions. Moreover, we introduce a method that can be used to approximate solutions with the use of small perturbations around the Prasad-Sommerfield monopole, and discuss the possibility of extending the aforementioned results to dyons. In order to exemplify the most important properties of the theory, several specific impurity models are presented, with the respective monopole solutions are found numerically. These solutions present novel internal structure and multiple features that would not be possible in the original theory.</description>

      <title>Features of the Partition Function of a $\Lambda&gt;0$ Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider properties of the gravitational path integral, ${Z}_{\text{grav}}$, of a four-dimensional gravitational effective field theory with $\Lambda&gt;0$ at the quantum level. To leading order, ${Z}_{\text{grav}}$ is dominated by a four-sphere saddle subject to small fluctuations. Beyond this, ${Z}_{\text{grav}}$ receives contributions from additional geometries that may include Einstein metrics of positive curvature. We discuss how a general positive curvature Einstein metric contributes to ${Z}_{\text{grav}}$ at one-loop level. Along the way, we discuss Einstein-Maxwell theory with $\Lambda&gt;0$, and identify an interesting class of closed non-Einstein gravitational instantons. We provide a detailed study for the specific case of $\mathbb{C}P^2$ which is distinguished as the saddle with second largest volume and positive definite tensor eigenspectrum. We present exact one-loop results for scalar particles, Maxwell theory, and Einstein gravity about the Fubini-Study metric on $\mathbb{C}P^2$.</description>

      <title>Truly Confining Supersymmetric Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify ``truly confining'' (t-confining) supersymmetric gauge theories, in which no center charges can be screened, and Wilson loops in the fundamental representation are therefore expected to exhibit an area law. In all cases, we identify the condensation of certain ``magnetic'' operators. Many of them have more than three branches, and one with vanishing superpotential, a phenomenon not previously observed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a local, diff-invariant quantum effective action for gravity that captures the trace anomaly via a counter-term. We discuss why this counter-term is the most significant among infinitely many possible ones, and show how the counter-term leads to a scattering amplitude that is strongly coupled at arbitrarily low energies. We show how the introduction of a new sector with spontaneously broken scale invariance removes the strong coupling problem, and discuss some physical consequences due to the new sector. Three Appendices summarize quantum effective actions -- highlighting connections between their local, and seemingly non-local formulations -- for the scale anomaly in 4D QED, for the axial anomaly in 2D QED, and for the scale anomaly in a 2D sigma model.</description>

      <title>Higher-spin effects in black hole and neutron star binary dynamics: worldline supersymmetry beyond minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inclusion of spin effects in the binary dynamics for black hole and neutron stars is crucial for the computation of gravitational wave observables. Worldline supersymmetric models have shown to be particularly efficient at this task up to quadratic order in spin, but progress at higher orders has been hampered by no-go-theorems. In this work we propose a novel approach to overcome this problem by extending the supersymmetry beyond minimal coupling. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by computing an all-order in spin and linear in curvature, manifestly supersymmetric Hamiltonian, as well as a cubic order in spin Hamiltonian in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. In doing so, we identify a criterion that uniquely determines the Kerr geometry in terms of worldline supersymmetry. Equipped with these Hamiltonians, we demonstrate the exponentiation of three-point and Compton amplitudes using the recently proposed Generalized Wilson line approach.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the Kerr-(A)dS metric as a type II(D) solution in six dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the class of six-dimensional $\Lambda$-vacuum spacetimes which admit a non-degenerate multiple Weyl aligned null direction l (thus being of Weyl type~II or more special) with a ``generic'' optical matrix. Subject to an additional assumption on the asymptotic fall-off of the Weyl tensor, we obtain the most general metric of this class, which is specified by one discrete (normalized) and three continuous parameters. All solutions turn out to be Kerr--Schild spacetimes of type~D and, in passing, we comment on their Kerr--Schild double copy. We further show that the obtained family is locally isometric to the general doubly-spinning Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metric with the NUTs parameters switched off. In particular, the Kerr-(A)dS subclass and its extensions (i.e., analytic continuation and ``infinite-rotation'' limit) are recovered when certain polynomial metric functions are assumed to be fully factorized. As a side result, a unified metric form which encompasses all three branches of the extended Kerr-(A)dS family in all even dimensions is presented in an appendix.</description>

      <title>Quark Propagator at one-loop in the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Refined Gribov-Zwanziger scenario is a local and renormalizable setup in which infinitesimal Gribov copies are eliminated and further non-perturbative effects are accounted for. The gluon propagator that arises from this framework fits lattice data very well in the Landau gauge. We investigate the coupling of quarks to this setting at one-loop order by computing the quark propagator. The fermionic sector is introduced by a minimal coupling and the non-perturbative effects are transmitted to the matter sector through gluonic loops which, in this case, carry information from the elimination of infinitesimal Gribov copies and the formation of condensates. We compare our findings with available lattice data both for the unquenched gluon propagator as well as for the quark propagator in the Landau gauge. Our results are comparable with those obtained in the Curci-Ferrari model at one-loop order. In particular, we are able to fit the unquenched gluon propagator and use the fixed parameters to predict the quark mass function and find good agreement with lattice data. However, the quark dressing function does not agree, even at a qualitative level, with lattice data in the infrared. This is agreement with the analogue computation in Curci-Ferrari model. Inspired by the developments in the Curci-Ferrari results, such a disagreement is likely to be cured by the inclusion of two-loops corrections. Finally, we compare the present minimal coupling with a non-perturbative matter coupling proposed in the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger literature.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Magnetogenesis at the Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous CP violation during the electroweak phase transition can induce a twisting of the magnetic field configuration of Standard Model dumbbells, resulting in sizable intergalactic magnetic fields and a small baryon asymmetry, in agreement with observations. We demonstrate this by coupling the electroweak gauge group of the Standard Model to an axion-like particle with a non-vanishing velocity. Studying the resulting monopole, string and dumbbell configurations, we conclude that the helicity fraction of the magnetic fields generated at the electroweak phase transition is roughly given by the dimensionless axion velocity.</description>

      <title>Suggestions of decreasing dark energy from supernova and BAO data: an update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous work 2305.04946, we found that supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation data support the hypothesis that late time cosmic acceleration is caused by the potential energy of a scalar field descending its potential, as suggested by holographically defined models of quantum gravity. In this note, we update our analysis using the Dark Energy Survey 5 year supernova data set (DES-SN5YR) and the baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2). Approximating the scalar potential via a first order Taylor series $V \approx V_0 + V_1 \phi$ about the present value, and making use of only recent-time data from DES-SN5YR and DESI DR2, we find that the slope parameter is constrained as $V_1 = 1.49 \pm 0.25$ in a standard likelihood analysis. This is naively a $&gt;5 \sigma$ discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM (which has $V_1 =0$), though a more detailed analysis not assuming a Gaussian likelihood distribution suggests $4 \sigma$ significance. Based only on the $\Delta \chi^2 = -13.7$ improvement of fit while ignoring parameter space volumes disfavours $\Lambda$CDM at a $3 \sigma$ significance level. These significance measures are substantially improved from our previous analysis using older data sets. We also reproduce the DESI DR2 parameter constraints based on the same combination of data and find that the $\Lambda$CDM is more strongly disfavoured in the context of the linear potential extension (dubbed $V_0V_1$) as compared with the $w_0 w_a$ extension of $\Lambda$CDM. A caveat is that for both $w_0 w_a$ and $V_0 V_1$, much of the significance relies on the historical $z &lt; 0.1$ supernova samples included in the DES-SN5YR data set.</description>

      <title>Precise calculation of the EFT likelihood with primordial non-Gaussianities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a precise calculation of the EFT conditional likelihood for large-scale structure (LSS) via the saddle-point expansion method in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG). The precision is manifested at two levels: one corresponding to the consideration of higher-order noise terms, and the other to the inclusion of contributions around the saddle points. In computing the latter, we encounter the same issue of the negative modes as in the context of false vacuum decay, which necessitates deforming the original integration contour into the combination of the steepest descent contours to ensure a convergent and real result. We demonstrate through detailed calculations that, upon the incorporation of leading-order PNG, both types of extensions introduce irreducible field-dependent contributions to the conditional likelihood. This insight motivates the systematic inclusion of additional effective terms within the forward modeling framework. Our work facilitates Bayesian forward modeling under non-Gaussian initial conditions, thereby enabling more stringent constraints on the parameters describing PNG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equivalence principle for test gravitational physics strongly constrains dynamics of spacetime, providing a powerful criterion for selecting candidate theories of gravity. However, checking its validity for a particular theory is often a very difficult task. We devise here a simple theoretical criterion for identifying equivalence principle violations in black hole thermodynamics. Employing this criterion, we prove that Lanczos-Lovelock gravity violates the strong equivalence principle, leaving general relativity as the only local, diffeomorphism-invariant theory compatible with it. However, we also show that certain nonlocal expressions for black hole entropy appear to obey the strong equivalence principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent work [Phys. Rev. D 111, 104040] shows that the curvature singularity of a black hole can vanish at a fine-tuned mass value, which implies that regular black holes could be special states in black hole evolution. We study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the Bardeen black hole and its singular counterparts under scalar and electromagnetic perturbations, employing the WKB method and time-domain analysis, respectively. The time-domain analysis results suggest that echo signals may emerge in the QNMs of singular black hole states. Furthermore, we investigate the null geodesics of these black holes. We find that a black hole with singularity may possess two light rings, whereas regular black holes consistently maintain only one light ring. Similar conclusions are also valid for the regular Hayward black hole and its singular counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the effective string model for the triply heavy quark system, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present analytical and numerical studies of the three-quark potential for isosceles and collinear geometries. In the general case, we derive the asymptotic expression of the potential in the infrared limit. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension and interpret the transition between two distinct regimes, occurring when one of the triangle's angles formed by the quarks is equal to $\frac{2}{3}\pi$, as a breaking of permutational symmetry. This symmetry breaking implies the emergence of a heavy quark dressed by gluons, transforming in the two-index antisymmetric representation. Additionally, we discuss various aspects of the $Y$- and $\Delta$-laws, diquarks, and connections to lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Generalized Parton Distributions from Lattice QCD with Asymmetric Momentum Transfer: Tensor Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calculation of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in lattice QCD was traditionally done by calculating matrix elements in the symmetric frame. Recent advancements have significantly reduced computational costs by calculating these matrix elements in the asymmetric frame, allowing us to choose the momentum transfer to be in either the initial or final states only. The theoretical methodology requires a new parametrization of the matrix element to obtain Lorentz-invariant amplitudes, which are then related to the GPDs. The formulation and implementation of this approach have already been established for the unpolarized and helicity GPDs. Building upon this idea, we extend this formulation to the four leading-twist quark transversity GPDs ($H_T$, $E_T$, $\widetilde{H}_T$, $\widetilde{E}_T$). We also present numerical results for zero skewness using an $N_f=2+1+1$ ensemble of twisted mass fermions with a clover improvement. The light quark masses employed in these calculations correspond to a pion mass of about 260 MeV. Furthermore, we include a comparison between the symmetric and asymmetric frame calculations to demonstrate frame independence of the Lorentz-invariant amplitudes. Analysis of the matrix elements in the asymmetric frame is performed at several values of the momentum transfer squared, $-t$, ranging from 0.17 GeV$^2$ to 2.29 GeV$^2$.</description>

      <title>Thermal Static Potential and Pseudo-Scalar Quarkonium Spectral Functions from 2+1 Flavor Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quarkonia, which are bound states of a heavy quark and antiquark, play a key role in probing the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The dynamics of quarkonia in the QGP are encoded in their finite-temperature spectral functions. In this work, we estimate the quarkonium spectral functions in the pseudo-scalar channel using 2+1 flavor lattice QCD with a pion mass of $320\,\text{MeV}$, at temperatures of $220\,\text{MeV}\,(1.2\,T_{pc}),\,251\,\text{MeV}\,(1.4\,T_{pc})\,\text{and}\,293\,\text{MeV}\,(1.6\,T_{pc})$. Reconstructing the spectral function from the Euclidean lattice correlator is a well-known ill-posed problem, requiring additional physics-motivated input. We address this by smoothly matching contributions from different frequency regions of the spectral function, using appropriate physics valid for each region. The spectral function around $\omega \sim 2\,M_q$ is obtained using a non-perturbative complex potential, while for $\omega \gg 2\,M_q$ it is modeled using results from vacuum perturbation theory. Since the pseudoscalar channel does not receive a transport contribution near $\omega \sim 0$, we find that the combination of these two regions already provides a good description of the relativistic lattice pseudoscalar correlator. We observe a substantial thermal width in the $\eta_c(1S)$ state, indicating that pseudoscalar charmonium ($\eta_c$) is nearing dissolution at the studied temperatures. In comparison, the $\eta_b$ ground state exhibits little change and remains well-defined.</description>

Abstract: We construct a family of lattice models which possess subsystem non-invertible symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order and analyze their interface modes protected by the symmetry, whose codimension turns out to be more than one. We also propose 2+1d lattice models which belong to two different weak SPT phases distinguished by a combination of translational symmetry and non-invertible symmetry. We show that the interface between them exhibits an exotic Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly coming from the symmetry which cannot be written as a direct product of an internal symmetry and the lattice translational symmetry.</description>

Abstract: In this paper a relation between entangled states and geometry is studied. In particular, the area of 2D parallelogram is obtained from an entangled 4-qubit state. In addition, the vector area of a 3D parallelogram is derived from entangled 6-qubit states. Moreover, the volume of a 3D parallelepiped is deduced from an entangled 9-qubit state. Furthermore, it has been provided the quantum circuit in qiskit code for these entangled states. It is worth mentioning that parallelograms and parallelepipeds serve as fundamental building blocks for more sophisticated geometric structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advances, both theoretical and experimental, in our understanding of quantum many-body dynamics. Given this problem's high complexity, it is surprising that a substantial amount of this progress can be ascribed to exact analytical results. Here we review dual-unitary circuits as a particular setting leading to exact results in quantum many-body dynamics. Dual-unitary circuits constitute minimal models in which space and time are treated on an equal footings, yielding exactly solvable yet possibly chaotic evolution. They were the first in which current notions of quantum chaos could be analytically quantified, allow for a full characterisation of the dynamics of thermalisation, scrambling, and entanglement (among others), and can be experimentally realised in current quantum simulators. Dual-unitarity is a specific fruitful implementation of the more general idea of space-time duality in which the roles of space and time are exchanged to access relevant dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: It is shown how to non-perturbatively define a random matrix model that captures key physics of ${\cal N}{=}2$ Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) supergravity, going well beyond the perturbative topological expansion defined recently by Turiaci and Witten. A decomposition into an infinite family of certain multicritical models is derived, leading to the definition of a non-linear differential equation from which the physics may be computed. BPS states are naturally described by the model. The non-perturbative completions of the spectral densities for non-BPS multiplets are readily extracted.</description>

Abstract: A random matrix model definition of a family of ${\cal N}{=}1$ supersymmetric extensions of the Virasoro minimal string of Collier, Eberhardt, M\"{u}hlmann, and Rodriguez is presented. An analysis of the defining string equations shows that the models all naturally have unambiguous non-perturbative completions, which are explicitly supplied by the double-scaled orthogonal polynomial techniques employed. Perturbatively, the multi-loop correlation functions of the model define a special supersymmetric class of ``quantum volumes'', generalizing the prototype case, some of which are computed.</description>

Abstract: Acoustic black holes, analogs of gravitational black holes created in fluid systems, have recently been embedded within Schwarzschild spacetime using the Gross-Pitaevskii theory, leading to configurations with both event and acoustic horizons. This study examines the motion of vortices, modeled as unit-mass relativistic test particles, around a slow-rotating curved acoustic black hole. We analyse the stability of circular orbits, identifying the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), and investigate the chaotic dynamics of vortices perturbed from unstable circular orbits near the acoustic horizon. Using the Lyapunov exponent to quantify this chaos, we assess whether it satisfies the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound $(\lambda \le 2 \pi T_H)$, a limit established for gravitational black holes in general relativity. Our results show that, in non-extremal cases $(\xi &gt; 4)$, the Lyapunov exponent respects the bound near the horizon, while in extremal cases $(\xi = 4)$, it is violated due to vanishing surface gravity. These findings highlight similarities between acoustic and gravitational black holes, advancing the analogy in the context of chaos and orbital dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We study on-shell scattering amplitudes for continuous-spin particles (CSPs). Poincar\'e invariance, little-group $ISO(2)$ covariance, analyticity, and on-shell factorisation (unitarity) impose stringent conditions on these amplitudes. We solve them by realizing a non-trivial representation for all little-group generators on the space of functions of bi-spinors. The three-point amplitudes are uniquely determined by matching their high-energy limit to that of definite-helicity (ordinary) massless particles. Four-point amplitudes are then bootstrapped using consistency conditions, allowing us to analyze the theory in a very transparent way, without relying on any off-shell Lagrangian formulation. We present several examples that highlight the main features of the resulting scattering amplitudes. We discuss CSP's amplitudes as a new infrared deformation of ordinary massless amplitudes, which is controlled by the scale of the Pauli-Lubanski vector squared, as opposed to the familiar mass deformation. Finally, we explore under which conditions it is possible to relax some assumptions, such as strict on-shell factorisation, analyticity, or others. In particular, we also investigate how continuous-spin particles may couple to gravity and electromagnetism, in a loose version of $S$-matrix principles.</description>

      <title>Foliated Asymptotically Safe Gravity: Lorentzian Signature Fluctuations from the Wick Rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymptotic Safety constitutes a promising mechanism for a consistent and predictive high-energy completion of the gravitational interactions. To date, most results on the interacting renormalization group fixed point underlying the construction are obtained for Euclidean signature spacetimes. In this work, we use the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) decomposition of the metric degrees of freedom and investigate the relations between the Euclidean and Lorentzian renormalization group flows resulting from the analytic continuation of the lapse function. We discuss the general conditions which guarantee the equivalence of the beta functions. These insights are illustrated based on the flow of the graviton two-point function within the Einstein-Hilbert truncation, demonstrating agreement of the Euclidean and Lorentzian settings. Hence the UV- and IR-completions identified in the Euclidean case are robust when changing spacetime signature. We take this as an important indicator that the Euclidean asymptotic safety mechanism carries over to Lorentzian signature spacetimes.</description>

      <title>AInstein: Numerical Einstein Metrics via Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new semi-supervised machine learning package is introduced which successfully solves the Euclidean vacuum Einstein equations with a cosmological constant, without any symmetry assumptions. The model architecture contains subnetworks for each patch in the manifold-defining atlas. Each subnetwork predicts the components of a metric in its associated patch, with the relevant Einstein conditions of the form $R_{\mu \nu} - \lambda g_{\mu \nu} = 0$ being used as independent loss components (here $\mu,\nu = 1, 2, \cdots, n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the Riemannian manifold, and the Einstein constant $\lambda \in \{+1, 0, -1\}$). To ensure the consistency of the global structure of the manifold, another loss component is introduced across the patch subnetworks which enforces the coordinate transformation between the patches, $g' = J^T g J$, for an appropriate analytically known Jacobian $J$. We test our method for the case of spheres represented by a pair of patches in dimensions 2, 3, 4, and 5. In dimensions 2 and 3, the geometries have been fully classified. However, it is unknown whether a Ricci-flat metric can exist on spheres in dimensions 4 and 5. This work hints against the existence of such a metric.</description>

      <title>Constant maps in equivariant topological strings and geometric modeling of fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the equivariant generalization of topological strings on toric manifolds, focusing in particular on defining the contributions of constant maps in the genus expansion of the partition function. This approach regularizes the integration over non-compact Calabi-Yau spaces, producing finite results at each order in the expansion, as illustrated by a broad set of explicit examples. Our investigation highlights the geometric modeling of flux compactifications and clarifies the link between the effective supergravity framework and the equivariant topological string formalism, building on recent developments by Martelli and Zaffaroni. We conclude that the connection between topological string theory and supergravity/field theory involves switching between geometric moduli and fluxes, shedding light on the role of ensemble averages in string theory. We propose an exact non-perturbative holographic match with the corresponding M2-brane partition functions, which we test perturbatively at all orders in the gauge group rank $N$ in a companion paper. A special case of our proposal for vanishing flux reformulates the Ooguri--Strominger--Vafa conjecture within the equivariant topological string framework.</description>

      <title>Cuscuton Bounce Beyond the Linear Regime: Bispectrum and Strong Coupling Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cuscuton Gravity is characterized as a scalar field that can be added to general relativity without introducing any new dynamical degrees of freedom on a cosmological background. Yet, it modifies gravity such that spacetime singularities can be avoided. This has led to the Cuscuton bounce, a nonsingular cosmology that has been shown to be linearly stable, which is a rare feat. Upon introducing mechanisms known to generate a near-scale-invariant power spectrum of isocurvature perturbations in the prebounce contracting phase, we perform an extensive linear analysis of all scalar perturbations as they evolve through the Cuscuton bounce, both analytically and numerically. Then, after deriving the third-order perturbed action for our theory, we compare the magnitude of its terms (on shell) to those in the second-order action. We show that perturbativity is maintained in the infrared throughout the evolution, including through the bounce. In the ultraviolet, we show that a hierarchy of scales is maintained, with the strong coupling scale well above the relevant background energy scale at all times. We reconfirm these results by computing the three-point functions in various limits and demonstrate that the models do not have any strong coupling problems and furthermore that there is negligible non-Gaussianities on observable scales. Consequently, the primary potential source of observable non-Gaussianities may only arise from the conversion of isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations. The whole scenario is thus a robust, stable, weakly coupled nonsingular cosmological model, consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>What happens due to the baby universe effect in JT gravity? -Analysis of correlation functions and ERB length at late time using three approaches-</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the correlation function in JT gravity using three approaches: by summing over all geodesics connecting boundary operators, integrating over the region of moduli space determined by the ``no-shortcut condition'' introduced by D.Stanford and Z.Yang, and using the formula for the universal spectral density correlation in the $\tau$-scaling limit. We find that the behaviors of the three results coincide at late times: they all exhibit a ``ramp'' instead of permanent decay. Using the third approach we also confirm that the ``plateau'' appears after $T_H=2\pi e^{S_0}\hat{\rho}_0(E)$. Overall, our results are consistent with the SFF analysis.
  We also calculate the ERB length $\langle \ell(T) \rangle$ using the three approaches and find that the results are in good agreement with each other. We also find that the $\langle \ell(T) \rangle$ grows as a cubic function in $T$ due to the contribution from geometry including one observable baby universe, and converges to a constant after $T=T_H$. For the geometry with one baby universe, we compute the size $\langle b(T) \rangle$ of the baby universe and find that it is of the same order as $\langle \ell(T) \rangle$. This result is consistent with the baby universe emission mechanism claimed by P.Saad.</description>

      <title>On BRST Lagrangian formulation for massive higher-spin fields in $4D$ Minkowski space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a brief overview of the BRST approach to the gauge invariant Lagrangian formulation for free massive higher-spin bosonic fields focusing on two specific aspects. First, the theory is considered in four dimensional flat space in terms of spin-tensor fields with two component undotted and dotted indices. This leads to a significant simplification of the whole approach in comparison with the one where the fields with vector indices were used, since now there is no need to introduce a constraint responsible for the traces of the fields into the BRST charge. Second, we develop an extremely simple and clear procedure to eliminate all the auxiliary fields and prove that the BRST equations of motion identically reproduce the basic conditions for irreducible representations of the Poinc\'are group with a given mass and spin. Similar to the massless theory, the final Lagrangian for massive higher-spin fields is formulated in triplet form. The BRST formulation leads to a system of fields that are clearly subdivided into the basic spin $s$ field, Zinoviev-like auxiliary fields, Singh-Hagen-like auxiliary fields, and special BRST auxiliary fields. The auxiliary fields can be partially eliminated by gauge fixing and/or using the equations of motion. This allows one to obtain formally different (with different numbers of auxiliary fields) but equivalent Lagrangian formulations.</description>

      <title>Yang-Lee Quantum Criticality in Various Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Yang-Lee universality class arises when imaginary magnetic field is tuned to its critical value in the paramagnetic phase of the $d&lt;6$ Ising model. In $d=2$, this non-unitary Conformal Field Theory (CFT) is exactly solvable via the $M(2,5)$ minimal model. As found long ago by von Gehlen using Exact Diagonalization, the corresponding real-time, quantum critical behavior arises in the periodic Ising spin chain when the imaginary longitudinal magnetic field is tuned to its critical value from below. Even though the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian, the energy levels are real due to the $PT$ symmetry. In this paper, we explore the analogous quantum critical behavior in higher dimensional non-Hermitian Hamiltonians on regularized spheres $S^{d-1}$. For $d=3$, we use the recently invented, powerful fuzzy sphere method, as well as discretization by the platonic solids cube, icosahedron and dodecaherdron. The low-lying energy levels and structure constants we find are in agreement with expectations from the conformal symmetry. The energy levels are in good quantitative agreement with the high-temperature expansions and with Pad\'{e} extrapolations of the $6-\epsilon$ expansions in Fisher's $i\phi^3$ Euclidean field theory for the Yang-Lee criticality. In the course of this work, we clarify some aspects of matching between operators in this field theory and quasiprimary fields in the $M(2,5)$ minimal model. For $d=4$, we obtain new results by replacing the $S^3$ with the self-dual polytope called the $24$-cell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the double-scaled SYK model (DSSYK) reduces to JT gravity with a negative cosmological constant by zooming in on the lower edge $E=-E_0$ of the spectrum. We find that the de Sitter JT gravity (i.e. JT gravity with a positive cosmological constant) is reproduced from DSSYK by taking a scaling limit around the upper edge $E=E_0$ of the spectrum. We also argue that the appearance of de Sitter JT gravity is consistent with the behavior of the classical solution of the sine dilaton gravity.</description>

Abstract: Bialynicki-Birula and Charzynski argued that a gravitational wave emitted during the merger of a black hole binary may be approximated by a circularly polarized wave which may in turn trap particles [1]. In this paper we consider particle motion in a class of gravitational waves which includes, besides circularly polarized periodic waves (CPP) [2], also the one proposed by Lukash [3] to study anisotropic cosmological models. Both waves have a 7-parameter conformal symmetry which contains, in addition to the generic 5-parameter (broken) Carroll group, also a 6th isometry. The Lukash spacetime can be transformed by a conformal rescaling of time to a perturbed CPP problem. Bounded geodesics, found both analytically and numerically, arise when the Lukash wave is of Bianchi type VI. Their symmetries can also be derived from the Lukash-CPP relation. Particle trapping is discussed.</description>

Abstract: Ocneanu's tube algebra provides a finite algorithm to compute the Drinfeld center of a fusion category. In this work we reveal the universal property underlying the tube algebra. Take a base category $\mathcal V$ which is strongly concrete, bicomplete, and closed symmetric monoidal. For physical applications one takes $\mathcal V=\mathbf{Vect}$ the category of vector spaces. Given a $\mathcal V$-enriched rigid monoidal category $\mathcal C$ (not necessarily finite or semisimple) we define the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ using coends valued in $\mathcal V$. Our main theorem established the relation between (the category of representations of) the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ and the Drinfeld center $Z(\mathcal C)$: $Z(\mathcal C)\hookrightarrow \mathrm{Fun}(\mathbb X \mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V)\cong Z(\mathcal C\hookrightarrow\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))\hookrightarrow Z(\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))$. Physically, besides viewing the tube category as a version of TFT with domain being the tube, we emphasize the "Wick-rotated" perspective, that the morphisms in $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ are the local tensors of fixed-point matrix product operators which preserves the symmetry $\mathcal C$ in one spatial dimension. We provide a first-principle flavored construction, from microscopic quantum degrees of freedom and operators preserving the symmetry, to the macroscopic universal properties of the symmetry which form the Drinfeld center. Our work is thus a proof to the 1+1D topological holography in a very general setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inflationary models that involve bursts of particle production generate bump-like features in the primordial power spectrum of density perturbations. These features influence the evolution of density fluctuations, leaving their unique signatures in cosmological observations. A detailed investigation of such signatures would help constrain physical processes during inflation. With this motivation, the goal of this paper is two-fold. First, we conduct a detailed analysis of the effects of bump-like primordial features on the sky-averaged 21 cm signal. Using semi-numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the primordial features can significantly alter the ionization history and the global 21 cm profile, making them a promising probe of inflationary models. We found a special scale (namely, the turnover wavenumber, $k^{\rm turn}$) at which the effect of primordial bump-like features on the global 21 cm profile vanishes. Also, we found that the behaviour of the primordial features on the global profile and ionization history are quite opposite for $k &gt; k^{\rm turn}$ and $k &lt; k^{\rm turn}$. We trace the root cause of these behaviours to the effects of primordial features on the halo mass function at high redshifts. Furthermore, we discuss the degeneracy between the astrophysical parameters and the primordial features in detail. Secondly, for a fixed set of astrophysical parameters, we derive upper limits on the amplitude of bump-like features in the range $10^{-1} &lt; k\,[{\rm Mpc}^{-1}] &lt; 10^2$ using current limits on optical depth to reionization from CMB data by Planck.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrinos based on quantum field theory. Since the Hamiltonian under the Majorana mass term does not conserve lepton number, the eigenstates of lepton number change continuously over time. Therefore, the transition amplitude is described by the inner product of the eigenstates of lepton number at the time of the neutrino production and the detection. With the Bogoliubov transformation, we successfully relates the lepton number eigenstates at different times. This method enables us to understand the time variation of lepton number induced by chiral oscillations in terms of transition probabilities. We also present the physical picture that emerges through the Bogoliubov transformation.</description>

Abstract: Alexei Alexandrovich Starobinsky was one of the greatest cosmologists of all times, who made fundamental contributions to gravitational theory and cosmology based on geometrical ideas in physics, in the spirit of Einstein. One of his big achievements is the famous Starobinsky model of cosmological inflation in the early universe, proposed in 1979-1980. In this memorial paper, the Starobinsky inflation model is systematically reviewed from the modern perspective. Its deformation to include production of primordial black holes is proposed, and possible quantum corrections in the context of superstring theory and the Swampland Program are discussed. Starobinsky inflation also leads to the universal reheating mechanism for particle production after inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To date, no observational confirmation of dark matter particles has been found. In this paper, we put forward an alternative approach to inferring evidence for dark matter through modified gravity, without invoking fundamental dark matter particles. Specifically, we explore the possibility of extracting signatures of Kaluza-Klein gravity through the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect. Kaluza-Klein theory has recently been proposed as an alternative to the dark sector, and predicts a tower of particles, including spin-0 and spin-1 gravitons alongside the usual spin-2 gravitons, which can gravitationally couple to matter. We thus analyze a quantum system in free fall around a gravitating body in the presence of a modified Yukawa-like gravitational potential, and determine the gravitational phase induced by the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the Kaluza-Klein model. Our results reveal that, in addition to the usual result from General Relativity, the quantum wave function of the system exhibits an additional effect: a splitting of the energy levels with a new quantum number due to the extra vector gravitational degrees of freedom. The energy splitting difference between general relativity and Kaluza-Klein gravity is found to be of the order of meV for an atomic system and eV for a nuclear system. Similar values also arise in generic modified gravity models and can be feasibly tested in the future. Numerical estimates for the graviton mass are also provided, and potential imprints on gravitational waves are mentioned.</description>

      <title>RG-stable parameter relations of a scalar field theory in absence of a symmetry</title>

Abstract: The stability of tree-level relations among the parameters of a quantum field theory with respect to renormalization group (RG) running is typically explained by the existence of a symmetry. We examine a toy model of a quantum field theory of two real scalars in which a tree-level relation among the squared-mass parameters of the scalar potential appears to be RG-stable without the presence of an appropriate underlying symmetry. The stability of this relation with respect to renormalization group running can be explained by complexifying the original scalar field theory. It is then possible to exhibit a symmetry that guarantees the relations of relevant beta functions of squared-mass parameters of the complexified theory. Among these relations, we can identify equations that are algebraically identical to the corresponding equations that guarantee the stability of the relations among the squared-mass parameters of the original real scalar field theory where the symmetry of the complexified theory is no longer present.</description>

Abstract: We suggest that a gauge theory CP-violating phase could be degenerate with a magnetic dual of a $4$-form flux. Discrete discharge of this flux by membrane nucleations could reduce the total CP-violating phase to below $10^{-10}$ well before BBN if the charge and the tension of the membranes are in the $\sim keV$ range.</description>

      <title>Accretion inside astrophysical objects : Effects of rotation and viscosity</title>

Abstract: Sub-solar mass black holes could show up in gravitational wave observations in future and near-solar mass black holes might have been involved in the events GW190425 and GW190814. Since they cannot form from the stellar evolution, their creation requires exotic mechanisms. One such mechanism involves the capture of dark matter particles by stellar objects and their thermalization. When the criterion for the collapse of these dark matter particles is satisfied, a tiny endoparasitic black hole (EBH) forms and then it accretes matter from the host. The EBH may transmute the host into a black hole of nearly the same mass as the host or lesser, depending on the type of accretion. We examine this complex and poorly-explored accretion mechanism, considering the effects of rotation and viscosity but ignoring some other effects, such as those of pressure and magnetic field, as the first step. Using a general framework to assess the effects of rotation and viscosity on accretion, we show that the accretion could be stalled in some white dwarfs, but not in neutron stars. The stalled accretion should cause an opening in the host's polar regions, the extent of which depends on the mass and spin of the host.</description>
