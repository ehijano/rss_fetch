      <title>Science development study for the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) - Solar and stellar observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths offer a complementary perspective on our Sun and other stars, offering significant insights into both the thermal and magnetic composition of their chromospheres. Despite the fundamental progress in (sub-)millimeter observations of the Sun, some important aspects require diagnostic capabilities that are not offered by existing observatories. In particular, simultaneously observations of the radiation continuum across an extended frequency range would facilitate the mapping of different layers and thus ultimately the 3D structure of the solar atmosphere. Mapping large regions on the Sun or even the whole solar disk at a very high temporal cadence would be crucial for systematically detecting and following the temporal evolution of flares, while synoptic observations, i.e., daily maps, over periods of years would provide an unprecedented view of the solar activity cycle in this wavelength regime. As our Sun is a fundamental reference for studying the atmospheres of active main sequence stars, observing the Sun and other stars with the same instrument would unlock the enormous diagnostic potential for understanding stellar activity and its impact on exoplanets. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), a single-dish telescope with 50\,m aperture proposed to be built in the Atacama desert in Chile, would be able to provide these observational capabilities. Equipped with a large number of detector elements for probing the radiation continuum across a wide frequency range, AtLAST would address a wide range of scientific topics including the thermal structure and heating of the solar chromosphere, flares and prominences, and the solar activity cycle. In this white paper, the key science cases and their technical requirements for AtLAST are discussed.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Measurement of the Double-Star System WDS 09168-3407 B 1118</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present updated measurements for the position angle and separation of the double-star WDS 09168-3407 B 1118, incorporating data from our observation, Gaia Early Data Release 3 mission, and historical records. Our findings indicate a position angle of 341.4{\deg} and separation of 3.36". Additionally, we utilized parallax and the ratio of proper motion metric (rPM) values to evaluate the potential binarity of the system. Our analysis suggests that the system may be gravitationally bound.</description>

      <title>Episodic energy release during the main- and post-impulsive phase of a solar flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When and where the magnetic field energy is released and converted in eruptive solar flares remains an outstanding topic in solar physics. To shed light on this question, here we report multi-wavelength observations of a C9.4-class eruptive limb flare that occurred on 2017 August 20. The flare, accompanied by a magnetic flux rope eruption and a white light coronal mass ejection, features three post-impulsive X-ray and microwave bursts immediately following its main impulsive phase. For each burst, both microwave and X-ray imaging suggest that the non-thermal electrons are located in the above-the-loop-top region. Interestingly, contrary to many other flares, the peak flux of the three post-impulsive microwave and X-ray bursts shows an increase for later bursts. Spectral analysis reveals that the sources have a hardening spectral index, suggesting a more efficient electron acceleration into the later post-impulsive bursts. We observe a positive correlation between the acceleration of the magnetic flux rope and the non-thermal energy release during the post-impulsive bursts in the same event. Intriguingly, different from some other eruptive events, this correlation does not hold for the main impulse phase of this event, which we interpret as energy release due to the tether-cutting reconnection before the primary flux rope acceleration occurs. In addition, using footpoint brightenings at conjugate flare ribbons, a weakening reconnection guide field is inferred, which may also contribute to the hardening of the non-thermal electrons during the post-impulsive phase.</description>

      <title>Distribution and evolution of Li abundance in red clump stars can be explained by the internal gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of Li phenomena in red clump (RC) stars can give us a deeper understanding of the structure and evolution of stars. \citet{2022ApJ...933...58C} explained the RC Li abundance distributions naturally using only standard post main sequence (MS) Li evolution models when the distribution of progenitor masses and the depletion of Li during the MS observed in MS stars were considered, thus neither extra Li depletion nor Li creation mechanism is required. Nevertheless, it is interesting to consider the effects of mixing caused by some extra mechanisms. By constructing different models, we find that the mixing caused by internal gravity waves can explain the observed Li abundances of RC stars with low mass progenitors. To explain that, we rely on the extra mixing induced by internal gravity waves that are excited at the bottom of the convective envelope at the red giant branch (RGB) stage. During the RGB stage, introducing the internal gravity waves can improve the diffusion coefficient and strengthen the mixing effect. The effective enrichment of Li occurs at the late RGB stage and requires the diffusion coefficient of H-burning shell to reach $\rm \sim 10^{8}\,cm^{2}\,s^{-1}$. Our models predict that the Li abundance decreases from $\rm \sim 1.5\,dex$ to $\rm \sim 0.0\,dex$ at the end of core He-burning stage, thereby revealing the $\sim 99\%$ of the observed Li abundance distribution. The thermohaline mixing regulates the Li abundance of RGB stars, which combines with the internal gravity waves can explain the Li abundances of most giants.</description>

      <title>Linear Theory of Visco-Resistive Tearing Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a new linear theory of tearing instability is shown, where the modified LSC (Loureiro, Schekochihin, and Cowley) theory [36] developed from the original LSC theory [8] is extended from inviscid-resistive MHD to viscous-resistive MHD. In contrast to FKR [2] and original LSC theories, the upstream open boundary condition is implemented at a finite point $\xi_c$, which is an additional control parameter to determine the solutions. This paper firstly studies when the resistivity and viscosity are uniform in space. In addition, some variations in the nonuniformity are studied. It is shown that the non-uniformity can enhance the linear growth rate, rather than uniform case. Unexpectedly, this suggests that the forward cascade process of plasmoid instability (PI) does not stop, i.e., the finite differential MHD simulations fail. To stop the forward cascade, uniform viscosity is required not only in the inner region of the current sheet but also in the outer region. In the uniform case, the critical condition is predicted to be $2P_m/(S \xi_{c})=0.06$, beyond which the tearing instability, i.e., the forward cascade, stops. Here, $S$ is the Lundquist number, $P_m$ is the magnetic Prandtl number, and $\xi_{c}$ is the distance between the upstream open boundary and neutral sheet, where the current sheet thickness is fixed at $\xi_0=1.307$. According to the critical condition, the resistivity and viscosity employed in most MHD simulations of PI are too small to stop the forward cascade. This critical condition may be also applicable for the trigger problem of the current sheet destabilization in substorms and solar flares.</description>

      <title>Modelling ion acceleration and transport in corotating interaction regions: the mass-to-charge ratio dependence of the particle spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of perpendicular diffusion in shaping energetic ion spectrum in corotating interaction regions (CIRs), focusing on its mass-to-charge ($A/Q$) dependence. We simulate a synthetic CIR using the EUropean Heliospheric FORcasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA) and model the subsequent ion acceleration and transport by solving the focused transport equation incorporating both parallel and perpendicular diffusion. Our results reveal distinct differences in ion spectra between scenarios with and without perpendicular diffusion. In the absence of perpendicular diffusion, ion spectra near CIRs show a strong $(A/Q)^{\epsilon}$ dependence with $\epsilon$ depending on the turbulence spectral index, agreeing with theoretical predictions. In contrast, the incorporation of perpendicular diffusion, characterized by a weak $A/Q$ dependence, leading to similar spectra for different ion species. This qualitatively agrees with observations of energetic particles in CIRs.</description>

      <title>Observation and Modeling of the circular polarization of the Cr I magnetic field induced transition at 533.03 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the circular polarization of the magnetic field induced transition (MIT) between the $3d^5(^6S)4d\ ^7D_2$ and $3d^5(^6S)4p\ ^7P_4^\circ$ states of \ion{Cr}{1} at 533.03~nm (wavelength in air). The fractional circular polarization $V/I$ of this spectral line resulting from the solution of the radiation transfer problem in a sunspot model permeated by a homogeneous magnetic field of 3~kG shows amplitudes of about $2\%$. Spectro-polarimetric observations of two sunspots were obtained with the Zurich Imaging Polarimeter-3 at the Istituto ricerche solari Aldo e Cele Dacc\`o (IRSOL) observatory observatory in Locarno, Switzerland. The observed $V/I$ profiles show approximately anti-symmetrical shapes with an amplitude of around $0.1\%$ and $0.2\%$ for the two sunspots. The center of this profile coincides with the wavelengths predicted for the above-mentioned MIT. We apply an inversion code to the spectro-polarimetric data of the \ion{Cr}{1} permitted lines at 532.91 and 532.98~nm, as well as to the MIT line at 533.03~nm, to infer a stratification of the emitting atmosphere. We compare the $V/I$ profiles synthesized in the inferred atmosphere models with the observations, showing that the observed signal likely corresponds to the MIT line.</description>

      <title>A study of Be stars in the time domain. I. Spectral data and polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first part of a spectroscopic and polarimetric study on a sample of 58 Be stars that have been measured since 1998. The aim of the study is to understand the timescales of disk variability, formation and dissipation as a function of the properties (mass, luminosity and rotational velocity) of the underlying B star. In this paper we classified the sample based on the presence of emission or absorption of the H$\alpha$ line, and the shape of the peak as single or double peak, as well as noting changes between emission and non-emission states. We find a probability of $\sim 0.75$ percent per year that an object in the sample will undergo such a change. We also present re-derived values of the projected rotational velocities for the sample. When we compare our polarization values with those from the literature, we find that most of the stars do not show a change in the value of the polarization angle, however a small number show significant changes which could be attributed to either disk strength (optical depth) or geometry changes. Finally we show how, by combining the (interstellar corrected) degree of polarization and the projected rotational velocity, we can construct an inclination angle-free parameter that includes the true equatorial velocity. Using this inclination angle-independent parameter we show that the populations of single and double peak stars are indistinguishable, giving further evidence that Be star line profiles are essentially inclination angle driven.</description>

      <title>Solar Wind Driven from GONG Magnetograms in the Last Solar Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous study, Huang et al. (2023) used the Alfven Wave Solar atmosphere Model (AWSoM), one of the widely used solar wind models in the community, driven by ADAPT-GONG magnetograms to simulate the solar wind in the last solar cycle and found that the optimal Poynting flux parameter can be estimated from either the open field area or the average unsigned radial component of the magnetic field in the open field regions. It was also found that the average energy deposition rate (Poynting flux) in the open field regions is approximately constant. In the current study, we expand the previous work by using GONG magnetograms to simulate the solar wind for the same Carrington rotations and determine if the results are similar to the ones obtained with ADAPT-GONG magnetograms. Our results indicate that similar correlations can be obtained from the GONG maps. Moreover, we report that ADAPT-GONG magnetograms can consistently provide better comparisons with 1 AU solar wind observations than GONG magnetograms, based on the best simulations selected by the minimum of the average curve distance for the solar wind speed and density.</description>

      <title>Adjusting the Potential Field Source Surface Height Based on MHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A potential field solution is widely used to extrapolate the coronal magnetic field above the Sun's surface to a certain height. This model applies the current-free approximation and assumes that the magnetic field is entirely radial beyond the source surface height, which is defined as the radial distance from the center of the Sun. Even though the source surface is commonly specified at 2.5 Rs (solar radii), previous studies have suggested that this value is not optimal in all cases. In this study, we propose a novel approach to specify the source surface height, by comparing the areas of the open magnetic field regions from the potential field solution with predictions made by a magnetohydrodynamics model, in our case the Alfven Wave Solar atmosphere Model. We find that the adjusted source surface height is significantly less than 2.5 Rs near solar minimum, and slightly larger than 2.5 Rs near solar maximum. We also report that the adjusted source surface height can provide a better open flux agreement with the observations near the solar minimum, while the comparison near the solar maximum is slightly worse.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the stellar activity of M dwarfs. II. Relationship between Ca, H$\alpha$, and Na chromospheric emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromospheric emission estimated in the core of different lines, such as Ca II H &amp; K, Na D1 and D2, and Halpha, is not always correlated between lines, as the Ca II H &amp; K and Halpha emission time series are anti-correlated for a few percent of the stars, contrary to what is observed on the Sun. This puzzling result has been observed for both solar-type and M stars. Our objective is to characterise these relationships in more detail using complementary criteria, based on a set of spectra obtained with HARPS for a large sample of M dwarfs, to evaluate whether or not additional processes are required to explain the observations. We analysed the time average and variability of the Ca, Na, and Halpha emissions for 177 M0-M8 stars. We computed synthetic Halpha time series based on different assumptions of plage properties. The statistical properties of our sample, in terms of correlations and slopes between indices at different timescales, differ from what we previously obtained for FGK stars, with fewer stars with a null correlation, and a weaker dependence of the correlations on timescale. However, there can be a large dispersion from one season to another for stars. We find a clear indication of a change in the slope sign from the relation between averaged Ca (or Na) and Halpha for the most massive M dwarfs, as well as a change in slope in the Na-Ca relation. At this stage, we are not able to find simple plage properties that, alone, are sufficient to reproduce the observations. Simulations shows that it is not straightforward to compare the temporal variability correlation and the integrated indices and demonstrate the need for complex activity patterns to explain some of the observations. We conclude that the relation between these indices exhibits a large diversity in behaviour. More detailed simulations with complex activity patterns are necessary to understand these observations.</description>

      <title>Lithium Abundances from the LAMOST Med-Resolution Survey Data Release 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium is a fragile but crucial chemical element in the universe, exhibits interesting and complex behaviors. Thanks to the massive spectroscopic data from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) medium-resolution survey (MRS), we can investigate the lithium abundances in a large and diverse sample of stars, which could bring vital help to study the origin and evolution of lithium. In this work, we use the Li 6,707.8 {\AA} line to derive the lithium abundance through a template-matching method. A catalog of precise lithium abundance is presented for 795,384 spectra corresponding to 455,752 stars from the LAMOST MRS Data Release (DR) 9. Comparing our results with those of external high-resolution references we find a good consistency with a typical deviation of {\sigma} A(Li) ~ 0.2 dex. We also analyze the internal errors using stars that have multiple LAMOST MRS observations, which will reach as low as 0.1 dex when the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the spectra &gt; 20. Besides, our result indicates that a small fraction of giant stars still exhibit surprisingly high amount of lithium contents, and 967 stars are identified as Li-rich giants with A(Li) &gt; 1.5 dex, accounting for ~ 2.6% of our samples. If one takes into account the fact that nearly all stars deplete lithium during the main sequence, then the fraction of Li-rich stars may exceed 2.6% much. This new catalog covers a wide range of stellar evolutionary stages from pre-main sequence to giants, and will provide help to the further study of the chemical evolution of lithium.</description>

      <title>"Gene": A personal tribute to the Life and Science of Eugene Newman Parker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review provides a brief account of the life of Eugene Parker (1927-2022) and discusses his contributions to plasma astrophysics. Growing up in Michigan, he went to graduate school at Caltech and then worked at the University of Utah before shifting to the University of Chicago, where he spent the rest of his illustrious career. Parker's most important scientific works are discussed in the context of the historical development of plasma astrophysics. In the study of the Sun, he made enormous contributions both to the MHD of the solar convection zone (including the formulation of turbulent dynamo theory) and to the understanding of the outer solar atmosphere (including the theory of coronal heating and the prediction of the solar wind). Parker's non-solar contributions include the Parker instability in the interstellar gas and the Parker limit of magnetic monopoles. We also try to convey an idea of Parker's highly individualistic personality and his very unique way of doing science.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous FUV and NUV observations of T Tauri stars with UVIT/AstroSat: probing accretion process in young stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from simultaneous FUV and NUV observations of T-Tauri stars (TTSs) in the Taurus molecular cloud with UVIT/AstroSat. This is the very first UVIT study of TTSs. From the spectral energy distribution of TTSs from FUV to IR, we show that classical TTSs (CTTSs) emit significantly higher UV excess compared to weak-line TTSs (WTTSs). The equivalent black-body temperatures corresponding to the UV excess in CTTSs ($&gt;10^4$ K) are also found to be relatively higher than that in WTTSs ($&lt;8500$ K). From the UV excess, we have re-classified two WTTSs (BS Tau, V836 Tau) as CTTSs, which has been supported by the follow-up optical spectroscopic study using the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), showing strong H$\alpha$ line emission. We find that CTTS show strong excess emission in both FUV ($&gt;$10$^7$) and NUV ($&gt;$10$^3$) bands, while WTTS show strong excess only in the FUV ($\lesssim$10$^5$), suggesting that excess emission in NUV can be used as a tool to classify the TTSs. We also find a linear correlation between UV luminosity (a primary indicator of mass accretion) and H$\alpha$ luminosity (a secondary indicator of mass accretion) with a slope of 1.21$\pm$0.17 and intercept of 2.18$\pm$0.56.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic and Photometric Behaviour of LP Ori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed spectroscopic and photometric analyses on the early B-type LP Ori young stellar object located in the Orion Nebula. The high-resolution spectra of LP Ori was obtained at the Ankara University Kreiken Observatory in 2023, while all spectra recorded over the past 19 years were extracted from the ESO and ESPaDOnS archives. In these spectra of LP Ori, there is typically an emission observed in the core of the Balmer profile. This structure is accompanied by a $\sim$14-year interval inverse P-Cygni repetition superimposed on the Balmer profile. Additionally, an emission in the $\lambda$5875 He~I line is visible in the spectra in the year 2023. When this emission is considered together with the inverse P-Cygni structures, these observations suggest that LP Ori is a Herbig Ae/Be star. The abundance pattern of LP Ori is close to solar with the exception of a slightly rich helium and slightly poor Al abundance. Additionally, the spectral energy distribution of LP Ori was constructed to confirm the infrared excess caused by its circumstellar disk. Furthermore, the photometric analysis performed on the TESS observations of LP Ori shows significant photometric variability and the frequency analysis reveals a $\beta$~Cephei star in its forthcoming evolution.</description>

      <title>Generalized Coronal Loop Scaling Laws and Their Implication for Turbulence in Solar Active Region Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent coronal loop modeling has emphasized the importance of combining both Coulomb collisions and turbulent scattering to characterize field-aligned thermal conduction, which invokes a hybrid loop model. In this work we generalize the hybrid model by incorporating nonuniform heating and cross section that are both formulated by a power-law function of temperature. Based on the hybrid model solutions, we construct scaling laws that relate loop-top temperature ($T_a$) and heating rate ($H_a$) to other loop parameters. It is found that the loop-top properties for turbulent loops are additionally power-law functions of turbulent mean free path ($\lambda_T$), with the functional forms varying from situation to situation that depends on the specification of the heating and/or areal parameters. More importantly, both a sufficiently footpoint-concentrated heating and a cross-sectional expansion with height can effectively weaken (strengthen) the negative (positive) power-law dependence of $T_a$ ($H_a$) on $\lambda_T$. The reason lies in a notable reduction of heat flux by footpoint heating and/or cross-sectional expansion in the turbulence-dominated coronal part, where turbulent scattering introduces a much weaker dependence of the conduction coefficient on temperature. In this region, therefore, the reduction of the heat flux predominately relies on a backward flattening of the temperature gradient. Through numerical modeling that incorporates more realistic conditions, this scenario is further consolidated. Our results have important implication for solar active region (AR) loops. With the factors of nonuniform heating and cross section taken into account, AR loops can bear relatively stronger turbulence while still keeping a physically reasonable temperature for nonflaring loops.</description>

      <title>The SPHERE view of the Orion star-forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SPHERE/IRDIS H-band data for a sample of 23 stars in the Orion Star forming region observed within the DESTINYS (Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars) program. We use polarization differential imaging in order to detect scattered light from circumstellar dust. From the scattered light observations we characterize the disk orientation, radius and contrast. We analyse the disks in context of the stellar parameters and the environment of the Orion star-forming region. We use ancillary X-shooter spectroscopic observations to characterize the central stars in the systems. We furthermore use a combination of new and archival ALMA mm-continuum observations to characterize the dust masses present in the circumstellar disks. Within our sample we detect extended circumstellar disks in 10 of 23 systems. Of these, three are exceptionally extended (V351 Ori, V599 Ori and V1012 Ori) and show scattered light asymmetries which may indicate perturbations by embedded planets or (in the case of V599 Ori) by an outer stellar companion. Our high resolution imaging observations are also sensitive to close (sub)stellar companions and we detect 9 such objects in our sample of which 5 were previously unknown. We find in particular a possible sub-stellar companion (either a very low mass star or a high mass brown dwarf) 137 au from the star RY Ori. We find a strong anti-correlation between disk detection and multiplicity, with only 2 of our 10 disk detections located in stellar multiple systems. We also find a correlation between scattered light contrast and the millimetre flux suggesting that disks that have a high dust content are typically bright in near-infrared scattered light. Conversely we do not find significant correlations between scattered light contrast of the disks and the stellar mass or age.</description>

      <title>The classical T Tauri star CI Tau observed with SPIRou: magnetospheric accretion and planetary formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report new observations of the classical T~Tauri star CI~Tau with the SPIRou near-infrared spectropolarimeter and velocimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) in late 2019, 2020 and 2022, complemented with observations obtained with the ESPaDOnS optical spectropolarimeter at CFHT in late 2020. From our SPIRou and ESPaDOnS spectra, to which we applied Least-Squares Deconvolution, we infer longitudinal fields clearly modulated with the 9-d rotation period of CI~Tau. Using Zeeman-Doppler imaging, we reconstruct the large-scale magnetic topology, first from SPIRou data only in all three seasons, then from our 2020 SPIRou and ESPaDOnS data simultaneously. We find that CI~Tau hosts a mainly axisymmetric poloidal field, with a 1~kG dipole slightly tilted to the rotation axis and dark spots close to the pole that coincide with the footpoints of accretion funnels linking the star to the inner disc. Our results also suggest that CI~Tau accretes mass from the disc in a stable fashion. We further find that radial velocities (RV) derived from atomic and CO lines in SPIRou spectra are both rotationally modulated, but with a much lower amplitude than that expected from the putative candidate planet CI~Tau~b. We confirm the presence of a RV signal at a period of 23.86~d reported in a separate analysis, but detect it clearly in CO lines only and not in atomic lines, suggesting that it likely traces a non-axisymmetric structure in the inner disc of CI~Tau rather than a massive close-in planet.</description>

      <title>BSN: Photometric Light Curve Analysis of Two Contact Binary Systems LS Del and V997 Cyg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The light curve analyses and orbital period variations for two contact binary stars, LS Del and V997 Cyg, were presented in this work which was conducted in the frame of the Binary Systems of South and North (BSN) Project. Ground-based photometric observations were performed at two observatories in France. We used the TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) data for extracting times of minima and light curve analysis of the target systems. The O-C diagram for both systems displays a parabolic trend. LS Del and V997 Cyg's orbital periods are increasing at a rate of dP/dt= 7.20*10^{-08} d yr^{-1} and dP/dt= 2.54*10^{-08} d yr^{-1}, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the mass is being transferred from the less massive star to the more massive component with a rate of dM/dt= -1.96*10^{-7} M_Sun yr^{-1} for the LS Del system, and dM/dt= -3.83*10^{-7} M_Sun yr^{-1} for V997 Cyg. The parameters of the third possible object in the system were also considered. The PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code was used to analyze the light curves. The light curve solutions needed a cold starspot due to the asymmetry in the LS Del system's light curve maxima. The mass ratio, fill-out factor, and star temperature all indicate that both systems are contact binary types in this investigation. Two methods were used to estimate the absolute parameters of the systems: one method used the parallax of Gaia DR3, and the other used a P-M relationship. The positions of the systems were also depicted on the M-L, M-R, q-L_{ratio}, and logM_{tot}-logJ_0 diagrams. We recommended that further observations and investigations be done on the existence of the fourth body in this system.</description>

      <title>Direct Imaging of MHD Wave Mode Conversion Near a 3D Null Point on the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual conversion of various kinds of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves can have profound impacts on wave propagation, energy transfer, and heating of the solar chromosphere and corona. Mode conversion occurs when an MHD wave travels through a region where the Alfv\'en and sound speeds are equal (e.g., a 3D magnetic null point). Here we report the first EUV imaging of mode conversion from a fast-mode to a slow-mode MHD wave near a 3D null point using Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) observations. An incident fast EUV wavefront associated with an adjacent eruptive flare propagates laterally through a neighboring pseudostreamer. Shortly after the passage of the fast EUV wave through the null point, a slow-mode wave appears near the null that propagates upward along the open structures and simultaneously downward along the separatrix encompassing the fan loops of the pseudostreamer base. These observations suggest the existence of mode conversion near 3D nulls in the solar corona, as predicted by theory and MHD simulations. Moreover, we observe decaying transverse oscillations in both the open and closed structures of the pseudostreamer, along with quasiperiodic type III radio bursts indicative of repetitive episodes of electron acceleration.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRCam Imaging of Young Stellar Objects III: Detailed Imaging of the Nebular Environment Around the HL Tau Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) program "Direct Imaging of YSOs" (program ID 1179), we use JWST NIRCam's direct imaging mode in F187N, F200W, F405N, and F410M to perform high contrast observations of the circumstellar structures surrounding the protostar HL Tau. The data reveal the known stellar envelope, outflow cavity, and streamers, but do not detect any companion candidates. We detect scattered light from an in-flowing spiral streamer previously detected in $\textrm{HCO}^+$ by ALMA, and part of the structure connected to the c-shaped outflow cavity. For detection limits in planet mass we use BEX evolutionary tracks when $M_\textrm{p}&lt;2M_\textrm{J}$ and AMES-COND evolutionary tracks otherwise, assuming a planet age of 1 Myr (youngest available age). Inside the disk region, due to extended envelope emission, our point-source sensitivities are $\sim5$ mJy ($37~M_{\rm J}$) at 40 AU in F187N, and $\sim0.37$ mJy ($5.2~M_{\rm J}$) at 140 AU in F405N. Outside the disk region, the deepest limits we can reach are $\sim0.01$ mJy ($0.75~M_{\rm J}$) at a projected separation of $\sim525$ AU.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) Science: Our Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As we learn more about the multi-scale interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy, we develop a greater understanding for the complex relationships between the large-scale diffuse gas and dust in Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs), how it moves, how it is affected by the nearby massive stars, and which portions of those GMCs eventually collapse into star forming regions. The complex interactions of those gas, dust and stellar populations form what has come to be known as the ecology of our Galaxy. Because we are deeply embedded in the plane of our Galaxy, it takes up a significant fraction of the sky, with complex dust lanes scattered throughout the optically recognisable bands of the Milky Way. These bands become bright at (sub-)millimetre wavelengths, where we can study dust thermal emission and the chemical and kinematic signatures of the gas. To properly study such large-scale environments, requires deep, large area surveys that are not possible with current facilities. Moreover, where stars form, so too do planetary systems, growing from the dust and gas in circumstellar discs, to planets and planetesimal belts. Understanding the evolution of these belts requires deep imaging capable of studying belts around young stellar objects to Kuiper belt analogues around the nearest stars. Here we present a plan for observing the Galactic Plane and circumstellar environments to quantify the physical structure, the magnetic fields, the dynamics, chemistry, star formation, and planetary system evolution of the galaxy in which we live with AtLAST; a concept for a new, 50m single-dish sub-mm telescope with a large field of view which is the only type of facility that will allow us to observe our Galaxy deeply and widely enough to make a leap forward in our understanding of our local ecology.</description>

      <title>Advancing parabolic operators in thermodynamic MHD models II: Evaluating a Practical Time Step Limit for Unconditionally Stable Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unconditionally stable time stepping schemes are useful and often practically necessary for advancing parabolic operators in multi-scale systems. However, serious accuracy problems may emerge when taking time steps that far exceed the explicit stability limits. In our previous work, we compared the accuracy and performance of advancing parabolic operators in a thermodynamic MHD model using an implicit method and an explicit super time-stepping (STS) method. We found that while the STS method outperformed the implicit one with overall good results, it was not able to damp oscillatory behavior in the solution efficiently, hindering its practical use. In this follow-up work, we evaluate an easy-to-implement method for selecting a practical time step limit (PTL) for unconditionally stable schemes. This time step is used to `cycle' the operator-split thermal conduction and viscosity parabolic operators. We test the new time step with both an implicit and STS scheme for accuracy, performance, and scaling. We find that, for our test cases here, the PTL dramatically improves the STS solution, matching or improving the solution of the original implicit scheme, while retaining most of its performance and scaling advantages. The PTL shows promise to allow more accurate use of unconditionally stable schemes for parabolic operators and reliable use of STS methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on determining the characteristics of the young open cluster NGC 6383. To achieve this, the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm is utilized to identify potential cluster members based on proper motions and parallaxes from Gaia Data Release 3. Various parameters of NGC 6383, such as tidal radius, core radius, distance through parallax and isochrone-fitting, proper motion, age, metallicity, and relevant others, are assessed. To perform this analysis, we utilize an extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, the No-U-Turn Sampler. The results of this analysis point out that NGC 6383 is a very young open cluster $(\sim 1 - 4~\mathrm{Myr})$, with a distance of $\sim 1.1~\mathrm{kpc}$.</description>

      <title>JWST MIRI/MRS Observations of T Cha: Discovery of a Spatially Resolved Disk Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding when and how circumstellar disks disperse is crucial to constrain planet formation and migration. Thermal winds powered by high-energy stellar photons have long been theorized to drive disk dispersal. However, evidence for these winds is currently based only on small (~3-6 km/s) blue-shifts in [Ne II] 12.81 um lines, which does not exclude MHD winds. We report JWST MIRI MRS spectro-imaging of T Cha, a disk with a large dust gap (~30 au in radius) and blue-shifted [Ne II] emission. We detect four forbidden noble gas lines, [Ar II], [Ar III], [Ne II], and [Ne III], of which [Ar III] is the first detection in any protoplanetary disk. We use line flux ratios to constrain the energy of the ionizing photons and find that Argon is ionized by EUV whereas Neon is most likely ionized by X-rays. After performing continuum and Point Spread Function (PSF) subtraction on the IFU cube, we discover a spatial extension in the [Ne II] emission off the disk continuum emission. This is the first spatially resolved [Ne II] disk wind emission. The mostly ionic spectrum of T Cha, in combination with the extended [Ne II] emission, points to an evolved stage for any inner MHD wind and is consistent with the existence of an outer thermal wind ionized and driven by high-energy stellar photons. This work acts as a pathfinder for future observations aiming at investigating disk dispersal using JWST.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Dependence of Microlensing Planet Frequency on The Host Star Mass and Galactocentric Distance by using a Galactic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the dependence of planet frequency on host star mass, $M_{\rm L}$, and distance from the Galactic center, $R_{\rm L}$, using a sample of planets discovered by gravitational microlensing. We compare the two-dimensional distribution of the lens-source proper motion, $\mu_{\rm rel}$, and the Einstein radius crossing time, $t_{\rm E}$, measured for 22 planetary events from \citet{suz16} with the distribution expected from Galactic model. Assuming that the planet-hosting probability of a star is proportional to $M_{\rm L}^m R_{\rm L}^r$, we calculate the likelihood distribution of $(m,r)$. We estimate that $r = 0.10^{+0.51}_{-0.37}$ and $m = 0.50^{+0.90}_{-0.70}$ under the assumption that the planet-hosting probability is independent of the mass ratio. %This result suggests that planets are uniformly distributed in the Galaxy and more massive stars are more likely to possess planets. We also divide the planet sample into subsamples based on their mass ratio, $q$, and estimate that $m=-0.08^{+0.95}_{-0.65}$ for $q &lt; 10^{-3}$ and $1.25^{+1.07}_{-1.14}$ for $q &gt; 10^{-3}$. Although uncertainties are still large, this result implies a possibility that in orbits beyond the snowline, massive planets are more likely to exist around more massive stars whereas low-mass planets exist regardless of their host star mass.</description>

      <title>Density jump for oblique collisionless shocks in pair plasmas: physical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless shocks are frequently analyzed using the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) formalism, even though MHD assumes a small mean free path. Yet, isotropy of pressure, fruit of binary collisions and assumed in MHD, may not apply in collisionless shocks. This is especially true within a magnetized plasma, where the field can stabilize an anisotropy.
  In a previous article \citep{BretJPP2022b}, a model was presented capable of dealing with the anisotropies that may arise at the front crossing. It was solved for any orientation of the field with respect to the shock front. Yet, for some values of the upstream parameters, several downstream solutions were found.
  Here, we complete the work started in \cite{BretJPP2022b} by showing how to pick the physical solution out of the ones offered by the algebra. This is achieved by 2 means: 1) selecting the solution that has the downstream field obliquity closest to the upstream one. This criterion is exemplified on the parallel case and backed up by Particle-in-Cell simulations. 2) Filtering out solutions which do not satisfy a criteria already invoked to trim multiple solutions in MHD: the evolutionarity criterion, that we assume valid in the collisionless case.
  The end result is a model in which a given upstream configuration results in a unique, or none (like in MHD), downstream configuration. The largest departure from MHD is found for the case of a parallel shock.</description>

      <title>Nucleosynthesis in the Innermost Ejecta of Magnetorotational Supernova Explosions in 3-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions powered by rotation and magnetic fields present an interesting astrophysical site for nucleosynthesis that potentially contributes to the production of $r$-process elements. Here we present yields of the innermost ejecta in 3D magnetorotational CCSN models simulated using the CoCoNuT-FMT code. Strong magnetic fields tap the rotational energy of the proto-neutron star and lead to earlier and more energetic ($\sim 3\times 10^{51}$ erg) explosions than typical neutrino-driven CCSNe. Compared to a reference non-magnetic model, the ejecta in the magnetorotational models have much more neutron-rich components with Ye down to $\sim$0.25. Our post-processing calculations with the reaction network SkyNet show significant production of weak $r$-process elements up to mass number $\sim$130. We find negligible differences in the synthesis of heavy elements between two magnetorotational models with different initial field strength of 10$^{10}$ and 10$^{12}$ G, in accord with their similar explosion dynamics. The magnetorotational models produce about $\sim$0.19 and 0.14 Msun of radioactive $^{56}$Ni, on the low end of inferred hypernova nickel masses. The yields are publicly available at Zenodo: doi:10.5281/zenodo.10578981 for comparison with stellar abundance patterns, inclusion in modelling galactic chemical evolution, and comparison with other yield calculations. Our results add to the yet restricted corpus of nucleosynthesis yields from 3D magnetorotational supernova simulations and will help quantify yield uncertainties.</description>

Abstract: We used VLT/SPHERE to observe 20 systems in the Cha I cloud in polarized scattered light in the near-infrared. We combined the scattered light observations with existing literature data on stellar properties and with archival ALMA continuum data to study trends with system age and dust mass. We also connected resolved near-infrared observations with the spectral energy distributions of the systems. In 13 of the 20 systems included in this study we detected resolved scattered light signals from circumstellar dust. For the CR Cha, CT Cha, CV Cha, SY Cha, SZ Cha, and VZ Cha systems we present the first detailed descriptions of the disks in scattered light. The observations found typically smooth or faint disks, often with little substructure, with the notable exceptions of SZ Cha, which shows an extended multiple-ringed disk, and WW Cha, which shows interaction with the cloud environment. New high S/N K- band observations of the HD 97048 system in our survey reveal a significant brightness asymmetry that may point to disk misalignment and subsequent shadowing of outer disk regions, possibly related to the suggested planet candidate in the disk. We resolve for the first time the stellar binary in the CS Cha system. Multiple wavelength observations of the disk around CS Cha have revealed that the system contains small, compact dust grains that may be strongly settled, consistent with numerical studies of circumbinary disks. We find in our sample that there is a strong anti-correlation between the presence of a (close) stellar companion and the detection of circumstellar material with five of our seven nondetections located in binary systems.</description>

      <title>The SPHERE view of the Taurus star-forming region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sample of planet-forming disks observed by high-contrast imaging campaigns over the last decade is mature enough to enable the demographical analysis of individual star-forming regions. We present the full census of Taurus sources with VLT/SPHERE polarimetric images available. The whole sample sums up to 43 targets (of which 31 have not been previously published) corresponding to one-fifth of the Class II population in Taurus and about half of such objects that are observable. A large fraction of the sample is apparently made up of isolated faint disks (equally divided between small and large self-shadowed disks). Ambient signal is visible in about one-third of the sample. This probes the interaction with the environment and with companions or the outflow activity of the system. The central portion of the Taurus region almost exclusively hosts faint disks, while the periphery also hosts bright disks interacting with their surroundings. The few bright disks are found around apparently older stars. The overall picture is that the Taurus region is in an early evolutionary stage of planet formation. Yet, some objects are discussed individually, as in an intermediate or exceptional stage of the disk evolution. This census provides a first benchmark for the comparison of the disk populations in different star forming regions.</description>

      <title>ROME IV. The Arecibo Search for Substellar Magnetospheric Radio Emissions in Purported Exoplanet-Hosting Systems at 5 GHz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma flow-obstacle interactions, such as those between an exoplanet's magnetosphere and the host star's stellar wind, may lead to detectable radio emissions. Despite many attempts to detect magnetospheric (auroral) radio emissions from exoplanets, a reproducible, unambiguous detection remains elusive. This fourth paper of the ROME (Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets) series presents the results of a targeted radio survey of nine nearby systems that host exoplanet, brown dwarf, and low-mass-stellar companions conducted with the Arecibo radio telescope at $\sim$5 GHz. This search for magnetospheric radio emissions has the greatest sensitivity ($\sim$1 mJy during $&lt;$1 s integration times) and collected full Stokes parameters over the largest simultaneous bandpass of any survey to date. It is also the first survey to search for radio emission from brown dwarfs of spectral class Y, which may illuminate open questions regarding their magnetism, interior and atmospheric structure, and formation histories. No magnetospheric radio emissions from substellar companions were detected. These results are examined within the context of recent theoretical work on plasma flow-obstacle interactions, and radio emissions observed from the solar system planets and ultracool dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Latitude-dependent Atmospheric Waves and Long-period Modulations in Luhman 16 B from the Longest Lightcurve of an Extrasolar World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the longest photometric monitoring of up to 1200 hours of the strongly variable brown-dwarf binaries Luhman 16 AB and provide evidence of $\pm$5% variability on a timescale of several-to-hundreds of hours for this object. We show that short-period rotational modulation around 5 hours (k = 1 wavenumber) and 2.5 hours (k = 2 wavenumber) dominate the variability under 10 hours, where the planetary-scale waves model composed of k = 1 and k = 2 waves provides good fits to both the periodogram and light curve. In particular, models consisting of three to four sine waves could explain the variability of light curve durations up to 100 hours. We show that the relative range of k = 2 periods is narrower compared to k = 1 period. Using simple models of zonal banding in Solar System giants, we suggest that the difference in period range arises from the difference in windspeed distribution at low and mid-to-high latitudes in the atmosphere. Lastly, we show that Luhman 16 AB also exhibits long-period $\pm$5% variability with periods ranging from 15 hours up to 100 hours over the longest monitoring of this object. Our results on k = 1 and k = 2 waves and long-period evolution are consistent with previous 3D atmosphere simulations, demonstrating that both latitude-dependent waves and slow-varying atmospheric features are potentially present in Luhman 16 AB atmospheres and are significant contribution to the light curve modulation over hundreds of rotations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsator, SMSS J184506-300804 (SMSS-BLAP-1) in Data Release 2 of the SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey. We conduct high-cadence photometric observations in the $u$ band to confirm a periodic modulation of the lightcurve. SMSS-BLAP-1 has a ~19-min pulsation period with an amplitude of 0.2 mag in $u$ band, and is similar to the classical BLAPs found by OGLE. From spectroscopic observations with the Wide-Field Spectrograph on the ANU 2.3m telescope, we confirm it as a low-gravity BLAP: best-fit parameters from the non-LTE Tlusty model are estimated as $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 29,020$^{+193}_{-34}$ K, $\log g$ = 4.661$^{+0.008}_{-0.143}$ (cm s$^{-2}$), and $\log$ n(He)/n(H) = -2.722$^{+0.057}_{-0.074}$ dex. However, our BLAP exhibits a very He-deficient atmosphere compared to both low- and high-gravity BLAPs, which have $\log$ n(He)/n(H) in the range -0.41~-2.4.</description>

      <title>Damped kink motions in a system of two solar coronal tubes with elliptic cross-sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study is motivated by observations of coordinated transverse displacements in neighboring solar active region loops, addressing specifically how the behavior of kink motions in straight two-tube equilibria is impacted by tube interactions and tube cross-sectional shapes.We work with linear, ideal, pressureless magnetohydrodynamics. Axially standing kink motions are examined as an initial value problem for transversely structured equilibria involving two identical, field-aligned, density-enhanced tubes with elliptic cross-sections (elliptic tubes). Continuously nonuniform layers are implemented around both tube boundaries. We numerically follow the system response to external velocity drivers, largely focusing on the quasi-mode stage of internal flows to derive the pertinent periods and damping times. The periods and damping times we derive for two-circular-tube setups justify available modal results found with the T-matrix approach. Regardless of cross-sectional shapes, our nonuniform layers feature the development of small-scale shears and energy accumulation around Alf\'ven resonances, indicative of resonant absorption and phase-mixing. As with two-circular-tube systems, our configurational symmetries make it still possible to classify lower-order kink motions by the polarization and symmetric properties of the internal flows; hence such mode labels as $S_x$ and $A_x$. However, the periods and damping times for two-elliptic-tube setups further depend on cross-sectional aspect ratios, with $A_x$ motions occasionally damped less rapidly than $S_x$ motions. We find uncertainties up to $\sim 20\%$ ($\sim 50\%$) for the axial Alfven time (the inhomogeneity lengthscale) if the periods (damping times) computed for two-elliptic-tube setups are seismologically inverted with canonical theories for isolated circular tubes.</description>

      <title>The Binary Broadening Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extended formalism for the spectral broadening function (BF) based on the multiplication rule of block matrices. The formalism, which we named the binary broadening function (BBF), can produce decomposed BFs for individual components of a binary star system by using two spectral templates. The decomposed BFs can be used to derive precise rotational profiles and radial velocities for individual components. We test the BBF on simulated spectra and actual observational spectra to show that the method is feasible on spectroscopic binaries, even when the spectral lines of two stellar components are heavily blended. To demonstrate the capability of the method, we conduct a simulation of `sketching' (imaging) a transiting circumbinary exoplanet using the BBF. We also discuss issues of implementation such as the variation of BBF with biased templates, the pros and cons of BBF, and cases when the method is not applicable.</description>

      <title>A Short Intense Dynamo at the Onset of Crystallization in White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of large magnetic fields ($\gtrsim 10^6~\mathrm{G}$) in isolated white dwarfs is not clear. One possible explanation is that crystallization of the star's core drives compositional convection, which when combined with the star's rotation, can drive a dynamo. However, whether convection is efficient enough to explain the large intensity of the observed magnetic fields is still under debate. Recent work has shown that convection in cooling white dwarfs spans two regimes: efficient convection at the onset of crystallization, and thermohaline convection during most of the star's cooling history. Here, we calculate the properties of crystallization-driven convection for cooling models of several white dwarfs of different masses. We combine mixing-length theory with scalings from magneto-rotational convection to estimate the typical magnitude of the convective velocity and induced magnetic field for both scenarios. In the thermohaline regime, we find velocities $\sim 10^{-6}$--$10^{-5}~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$, with fields restricted to $\lesssim~100~\mathrm{G}$. However, when convection is efficient, the flow velocity can reach magnitudes of $\sim 10^2$--$10^3~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$, with fields of $\sim 10^6$--$10^8~\mathrm{G}$, independent of the star's rotation rate. Thus, dynamos driven at the onset of crystallization could explain the large intensity magnetic fields measured for single white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Small amplitude red giants elucidate the nature of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch as a standard candle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) is an important standard candle for determining luminosity distances. Although several $10^5$ small amplitude red giant stars (SARGs) have been discovered, variability was previously considered irrelevant for the TRGB as a standard candle. Here, we show that all stars near the TRGB are SARGs that follow several period-luminosity sequences, of which sequence A is younger than sequence B as predicted by stellar evolution. We measure apparent TRGB magnitudes, m$_{\mathrm{TRGB}}$, in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using Sobel filters applied to photometry from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment and the ESA Gaia mission, and we identify several weaknesses in a recent LMC-based TRGB calibration used to measure the Hubble constant. We consider four samples: all Red Giants (RGs), SARGs, and sequences A &amp; B. The B-sequence is best suited for measuring distances to old RG populations, with M$_{\mathrm{F814W,0}}$ = -4.025 $\pm$ 0.014(stat.) $\pm$ 0.033(syst.) mag assuming the LMC's geometric distance. Control of systematics is demonstrated using detailed simulations. Population diversity affects m$_{\mathrm{TRGB}}$ at a level exceeding the stated precision: the SARG and A-sequence samples yield 0.039 mag and 0.085 mag fainter (at 5{\sigma} significance) m$_{\mathrm{TRGB}}$ values, respectively. Ensuring equivalent RG populations is crucial to measuring accurate TRGB distances. Additionally, luminosity function smoothing ($\sim$ 0.02 mag) and edge detection response weighting (as much as -0.06 mag) can further bias TRGB measurements, with the latter introducing a tip-contrast relation. We are optimistic that variable red giants will enable further improvements to the TRGB as a standard candle.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos are known to play important roles in many astrophysical scenarios from the early period of the big bang to current stellar evolution being a unique messenger of the fusion reactions occurring in the center of our sun. In particular, neutrinos are crucial in determining the dynamics and the composition evolution in explosive events such as core-collapse supernovae and the merger of two neutron stars. In this paper, we review the current understanding of supernovae and binary neutron star mergers by focusing on the role of neutrinos therein. Several recent improvements on the theoretical modeling of neutrino interaction rates in nuclear matter as well as their impact on the heavy element nucleosynthesis in the supernova neutrino-driven wind are discussed, including the neutrino-nucleon opacity at the mean field level taking into account the relativistic kinematics of nucleons, the effect due to the nucleon-nucleon correlation, and the nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. We also review the framework used to compute the neutrino-nucleus interactions and the up-to-date yield prediction for isotopes from neutrino nucleosynthesis occurring in the outer envelope of the supernova progenitor star during the explosion. Here improved predictions of energy spectra of supernova neutrinos of all flavors have had significant impact on the nucleosynthesis yields. Rapid progresses in modeling the flavor oscillations of neutrinos in these environments, including several novel mechanisms for collective neutrino oscillations and their potential impacts on various nucleosynthesis processes are summarized.</description>

Abstract: In the centers of dense star clusters, close encounters between stars and compact objects are likely to occur. We study tidal disruption events of main-sequence (MS) stars by stellar-mass black holes (termed $\mu$TDEs), which can shed light on the processes occurring in these clusters, including being an avenue in the mass growth of stellar-mass BHs. Using the moving-mesh hydrodynamics code \texttt{AREPO}, we perform a suite of hydrodynamics simulations of partial $\mu$TDEs of realistic, \texttt{MESA}-generated MS stars by varying the initial mass of the star ($0.5\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$ and $1\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$), the age of the star (zero-age, middle-age and terminal-age), the mass of the black hole ($10\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$ and $40\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$) and the impact parameter (yielding almost no mass loss to full disruption). We then examine the dependence of the masses, spins, and orbital parameters of the partially disrupted remnant on the initial encounter parameters. We find that the mass lost from a star decreases exponentially with increasing distance of approach and that a $1\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$ star loses lesser mass than a $0.5\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$. Moreover, a more evolved star is less susceptible to mass loss. Tidal torques at the closest approach spin up the remnant by factors of $10^2$--$10^4$ depending on the impact parameter. The remnant star can be bound (eccentric) or unbound (hyperbolic) to the black hole: hyperbolic orbits occur when the star's central density concentration is relatively low and the black hole-star mass ratio is high, which is the case for the disruption of a $0.5\,{\rm M}_{\rm \odot}$ star. Finally, we provide best-fit analytical formulae for a range of parameters that can be incorporated into cluster codes to model star-black hole interaction more accurately.</description>

      <title>The Multi-layer Nature of Molecular Gas toward the Cygnus Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the physical properties and 3D distribution of molecular clouds (MCs) toward the Cygnus region using the MWISP CO survey and Gaia DR3 data. Based on Gaussian decomposition and clustering for $\rm ^{13}CO$ lines, over 70% of the fluxes are recovered. With the identification result of $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures, two models are designed to measure the distances of the molecular gas in velocity crowding regions. The distances of more than 200 large $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures are obtained toward the 150 square degree region. Additionally, tens of the identified MC structures coincide well with masers and/or intense mid-IR emission. We find multiple gas layers toward the region: (1) the extensive gas structures composing the Cygnus Rift from 700 pc to 1 kpc across the whole region; (2) the $\sim$ 1.3 kpc gas layer mainly in the Cygnus X South region; and (3) the 1.5 kpc dense filament at the Cygnus X North region and many cometary clouds shaped by Cygnus OB2. We also note that the spatial distribution of YSO candidates is generally consistent with the molecular gas structures. The total molecular mass of the Cygnus region is estimated to be $\sim 2.7\times10^{6}~M_{\odot}$ assuming an X-factor ratio $X_{\rm CO} = 2 \times 10^{20} \rm cm^{-2} (K\cdot km\cdot s^{-1})^{-1}$. The foreground Cygnus Rift contributes $\sim$25% of the molecular mass in the whole region. Our work presents a new 3D view of the MCs distribution toward the Cygnus X region, as well as the exact molecular gas mass distribution in the foreground Cygnus Rift.</description>
