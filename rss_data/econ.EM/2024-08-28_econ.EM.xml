      <title>Double/Debiased CoCoLASSO of Treatment Effects with Mismeasured High-Dimensional Control Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an estimator for treatment effects in high-dimensional settings with additive measurement error, a prevalent challenge in modern econometrics. We introduce the Double/Debiased Convex Conditioned LASSO (Double/Debiased CoCoLASSO), which extends the double/debiased machine learning framework to accommodate mismeasured covariates. Our principal contributions are threefold. (1) We construct a Neyman-orthogonal score function that remains valid under measurement error, incorporating a bias correction term to account for error-induced correlations. (2) We propose a method of moments estimator for the measurement error variance, enabling implementation without prior knowledge of the error covariance structure. (3) We establish the $\sqrt{N}$-consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimator under general conditions, allowing for both the number of covariates and the magnitude of measurement error to increase with the sample size. Our theoretical results demonstrate the estimator's efficiency within the class of regularized high-dimensional estimators accounting for measurement error. Monte Carlo simulations corroborate our asymptotic theory and illustrate the estimator's robust performance across various levels of measurement error. Notably, our covariance-oblivious approach nearly matches the efficiency of methods that assume known error variance.</description>

      <title>Forecasting with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systematically biased forecasts are typically interpreted as evidence of forecasters' irrationality and/or asymmetric loss. In this paper we propose an alternative explanation: when forecasts inform economic policy decisions, and the resulting actions affect the realization of the forecast target itself, forecasts may be optimally biased even under quadratic loss. The result arises in environments in which the forecaster is uncertain about the decision maker's reaction to the forecast, which is presumably the case in most applications. We illustrate the empirical relevance of our theory by reviewing some stylized properties of Green Book inflation forecasts and relating them to the predictions from our model. Our results point out that the presence of policy feedback poses a challenge to traditional tests of forecast rationality.</description>

      <title>kendallknight: An R Package for Efficient Implementation of Kendall's Correlation Coefficient Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kendallknight package introduces an efficient implementation of Kendall's correlation coefficient computation, significantly improving the processing time for large datasets without sacrificing accuracy. The kendallknight package, following Knight (1966) and posterior literature, reduces the computational complexity resulting in drastic reductions in computation time, transforming operations that would take minutes or hours into milliseconds or minutes, while maintaining precision and correctly handling edge cases and errors. The package is particularly advantageous in econometric and statistical contexts where rapid and accurate calculation of Kendall's correlation coefficient is desirable. Benchmarks demonstrate substantial performance gains over the base R implementation, especially for large datasets.</description>
