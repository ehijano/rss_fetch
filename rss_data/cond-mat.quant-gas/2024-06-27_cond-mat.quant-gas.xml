      <title>Topological Dynamics and Correspondences in Composite Exceptional Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of novel phases and the elucidation of correspondences between topological invariants and their intriguing properties are pivotal in the realm of topological physics. Here, we investigate a complex exceptional structure, termed the composite exceptional ring (CER), composed of a third-order exceptional ring and multiple Weyl exceptional rings. We establish a direct correspondence between Chern numbers and the distinctive behaviors exhibited by these exceptional structures. Notably, we demonstrate that band braiding during quasistatic encircling processes correlates with bands possessing nontrivial Chern numbers, leading to triple (double) periodic spectra for cases with topologically nontrivial (trivial) middle bands. Moreover, the Chern numbers predict mode transfer behaviors during dynamical encircling process. We propose experimental schemes to realize CER in cold atoms, emphasizing the critical role of Chern numbers as both a measurable quantity and a descriptor of the exceptional physics inherent to dissipative systems. The discovery of CER opens significant avenues for expanding the scope of topological classifications in non-Hermitian systems, with promising applications in quantum computing and metrology.</description>

      <title>Dressed-State Spectroscopy and Magic Trapping of Microwave-Shielded NaCs Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the optical polarizability of microwave-shielded ultracold NaCs molecules in an optical dipole trap. While dressing a pair of rotational states with a microwave field, we observe a marked dependence of the optical polarizability on the intensity and detuning of the dressing field. To precisely characterize differential energy shifts between dressed rotational states, we establish dressed-state spectroscopy. For strong dressing fields, we find that a magic rotational transition can be engineered and demonstrate its insensitivity to laser intensity fluctuations. The results of this work have direct relevance for evaporative cooling and the recent demonstration of molecular Bose-Einstein condensates [Bigagli, et al., Nature (2024)] and may open a door to precision microwave spectroscopy in interacting many-body systems of microwave-shielded molecules.</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Michael E. Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros have been used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. The success of Fisher zeros however seems limited, and it is unclear how they can be employed to shed light on quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the (analytically continued) one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude and the scaling of recurrence time at the quantum critical point. We further point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The analytical results are corroborated by numerical tensor renormalization group which elevates the approach outlined here to a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>CoOMBE: A suite of open-source programs for the integration of the optical Bloch equations and Maxwell-Bloch equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The programs described in this article and distributed with it aim (1) at integrating the optical Bloch equations governing the time evolution of the density matrix representing the quantum state of an atomic system driven by laser or microwave fields, and (2) at integrating the 1D Maxwell-Bloch equations for one or two laser fields co-propagating in an atomic vapour. The rotating wave approximation is assumed. These programs can also be used for more general quantum dynamical systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. They are written in Fortran 90; however, their use does not require any knowledge of Fortran programming. Methods for solving the optical Bloch equations in the rate equations limit, for calculating the steady-state density matrix and for formulating the optical Bloch equations in the weak probe approximation are also described.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in open quantum systems: strong, weak, and strong-to-weak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depending on the coupling to the environment, symmetries of open quantum systems manifest in two distinct forms, the strong and the weak. We study the spontaneous symmetry breaking among phases with different symmetries. Concrete Liouvillian models with strong and weak symmetry are constructed, and different scenarios of symmetry-breaking transitions are investigated from complementary approaches. It is demonstrated that strong symmetry always spontaneously breaks into the corresponding weak symmetry. For strong $U(1)$ symmetry, we show that strong-to-weak symmetry breaking leads to gapless Goldstone modes dictating diffusion of the symmetry charge in translational invariant systems. We conjecture that this relation among strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, gapless modes, and symmetry-charge diffusion is general for continuous symmetries. It can be interpreted as an "enhanced Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem" for open quantum systems, according to which the gapless spectrum does not require non-integer filling. We also investigate the scenario where the strong symmetry breaks completely. In the symmetry-broken phase, we identify an effective Keldysh action with two Goldstone modes, describing fluctuations of the order parameter and diffusive hydrodynamics of the symmetry charge, respectively. For a particular model studied here, we uncover a transition from a symmetric phase with a "Bose surface" to a symmetry-broken phase with long-range order induced by tuning the filling. It is also shown that the long-range order of $U(1)$ symmetry breaking is possible in spatial dimension $d\geq 3$, in both weak and strong symmetry cases. Our work outline the typical scenarios of spontaneous symmetry breaking in open quantum systems, and highlights their physical consequences.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of spin-momentum entanglement from superradiant phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring operational regimes of many-body cavity QED with multi-level atoms remains an exciting research frontier for their enhanced storage capabilities of intra-level quantum correlations. In this work, we consider an experimentally feasible many-body cavity QED model describing a four-level system, where each of those levels is formed from a combination of different spin and momentum states of ultra-cold atoms in a cavity. The resulting model comprises a pair of Dicke Hamiltonians constructed from pseudo-spin operators, effectively capturing two intertwined superradiant phase transitions. The phase diagram reveals regions featuring weak and strong entangled states of spin and momentum atomic degrees of freedom. These states exhibit different dynamical responses, ranging from slow to fast relaxation, with the added option of persistent entanglement temporal oscillations. We discuss the role of cavity losses in steering the system's dynamics into such entangled states and propose a readout scheme that leverages different light polarizations within the cavity. Our work paves the way to connect the rich variety of non-equilibrium phase transitions that occur in many-body cavity QED to the buildup of quantum correlations in systems with multi-level atom descriptions.</description>

      <title>Fate of the Mollow triplet in strongly-coupled atomic arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subwavelength arrays of quantum emitters have emerged as an interesting platform displaying prominent collective effects that can be harnessed for applications. Here we study such arrays under strong coherent driving, realizing an open quantum many-body problem in a strongly non-linear regime. We show that the spectrum of scattered light, characterized by the famous Mollow triplet for a single atom, develops a characteristic lineshape with flat sidebands determined by dipolar interactions. Remarkably, this is independent of the specific geometry, but is sensitive to the ordered arrangement of the atoms. This lineshape therefore characterizes atomic arrays and distinguishes them from disordered ensembles and non-interacting emitters. Our predictions are based on a novel dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) approach to the problem, paving the way for further studies of these systems.</description>

      <title>Photon-assisted tunneling resonantly controlling spin current of a spin-orbit-coupled atom in a toroidal trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The periodic flashing potential has proven to be a powerful tool for investigating directed atomic currents. By applying the flashing ring-shaped potential to spin-orbit (SO) coupled, noninteracting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) systems, through photon-assisted tunneling (resonance) techniques, we demonstrate the generation of tunable alternating (AC) spin and atomic mass currents that can be precisely controlled in terms of direction and strength. The underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon is that the flashing potential supplies enough photons to induce Rabi oscillations and provides momentum transfer for spin and atomic transport. As the single-particle ground state of the unperturbed SO-coupled BEC depends on the Raman coupling strength, we demonstrate how to generate and control AC spin currents in the cases where the initial state resides in a single-well or double-well phase. In particular, we realize and explain the mechanism of generating a net AC spin current without mass current through single-photon resonance processes. It is shown that these interesting resonance phenomena can be analytically described only by the simple three-level model, which creates the possibility of transparent controls of spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>A hybrid atom tweezer array of nuclear spin and optical clock qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While data qubits with a long coherence time are essential for the storage of quantum information, ancilla qubits are pivotal in quantum error correction (QEC) for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The recent development of optical tweezer arrays, such as the preparation of large-scale qubit arrays and high-fidelity gate operations, offers the potential for realizing QEC protocols, and one of the important next challenges is to control and detect ancilla qubits while minimizing atom loss and crosstalk. Here, we present the realization of a hybrid system consisting of a dual-isotope ytterbium (Yb) atom array, in which we can utilize a nuclear spin qubit of fermionic ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$ as a data qubit and an optical clock qubit of bosonic ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$ as an ancilla qubit with a capacity of non-destructive qubit readout. We evaluate the crosstalk between qubits regarding the impact on the coherence of the nuclear spin qubits from the imaging light for ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$. The Ramsey sequence with a 556 nm probe beam shows negligible influence on the coherence up to 100 ms exposure time. In the Hahn-echo sequence with a 399 nm probe and 556 nm cooling beams for ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$, we observe retaining a 98.4(2.1) % coherence under 30 ms exposure. This result highlights the potential of the hybrid-Yb atom array for ancilla-qubit-based QEC protocols.</description>
