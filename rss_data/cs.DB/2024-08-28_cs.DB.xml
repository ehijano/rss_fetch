      <title>Cost-Aware Uncertainty Reduction in Schema Matching with GPT-4: The Prompt-Matcher Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schema matching is the process of identifying correspondences between the elements of two given schemata, essential for database management systems, data integration, and data warehousing. The inherent uncertainty of current schema matching algorithms leads to the generation of a set of candidate matches. Storing these results necessitates the use of databases and systems capable of handling probabilistic queries. This complicates the querying process and increases the associated storage costs. Motivated by GPT-4 outstanding performance, we explore its potential to reduce uncertainty. Our proposal is to supplant the role of crowdworkers with GPT-4 for querying the set of candidate matches. To get more precise correspondence verification responses from GPT-4, We have crafted Semantic-match and Abbreviation-match prompt for GPT-4, achieving state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets DeepMDatasets 100% (+0.0) and Fabricated-Datasets 91.8% (+2.2) recall rate. To optimise budget utilisation, we have devised a cost-aware solution. Within the constraints of the budget, our solution delivers favourable outcomes with minimal time expenditure.
  We introduce a novel framework, Prompt-Matcher, to reduce the uncertainty in the process of integration of multiple automatic schema matching algorithms and the selection of complex parameterization. It assists users in diminishing the uncertainty associated with candidate schema match results and in optimally ranking the most promising matches. We formally define the Correspondence Selection Problem, aiming to optimise the revenue within the confines of the GPT-4 budget. We demonstrate that CSP is NP-Hard and propose an approximation algorithm with minimal time expenditure. Ultimately, we demonstrate the efficacy of Prompt-Matcher through rigorous experiments.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Data Democratization: A Multifaceted Investment for an Equitable Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The urgent need for data democratization in scientific research was the focal point of a panel discussion at SC23 in Denver, Colorado, from November 12 to 17, 2023. This article summarizes the outcomes of that discussion and subsequent conversations. We advocate for strategic investments in financial, human, and technological resources for sustainable data democratization. Emphasizing that data is central to scientific discovery and AI deployment, we highlight barriers such as limited access, inadequate financial incentives for cross-domain collaboration, and a shortage of workforce development initiatives. Our recommendations aim to guide decision-makers in fostering an inclusive research community, breaking down research silos, and developing a skilled workforce to advance scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Galley: Modern Query Optimization for Sparse Tensor Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tensor programming abstraction has become the key . This framework allows users to write high performance programs for bulk computation via a high-level imperative interface. Recent work has extended this paradigm to sparse tensors (i.e. tensors where most entries are not explicitly represented) with the use of sparse tensor compilers. These systems excel at producing efficient code for computation over sparse tensors, which may be stored in a wide variety of formats. However, they require the user to manually choose the order of operations and the data formats at every step. Unfortunately, these decisions are both highly impactful and complicated, requiring significant effort to manually optimize. In this work, we present Galley, a system for declarative sparse tensor programming. Galley performs cost-based optimization to lower these programs to a logical plan then to a physical plan. It then leverages sparse tensor compilers to execute the physical plan efficiently. We show that Galley achieves high performance on a wide variety of problems including machine learning algorithms, subgraph counting, and iterative graph algorithms.</description>

      <title>Text2SQL is Not Enough: Unifying AI and Databases with TAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI systems that serve natural language questions over databases promise to unlock tremendous value. Such systems would allow users to leverage the powerful reasoning and knowledge capabilities of language models (LMs) alongside the scalable computational power of data management systems. These combined capabilities would empower users to ask arbitrary natural language questions over custom data sources. However, existing methods and benchmarks insufficiently explore this setting. Text2SQL methods focus solely on natural language questions that can be expressed in relational algebra, representing a small subset of the questions real users wish to ask. Likewise, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) considers the limited subset of queries that can be answered with point lookups to one or a few data records within the database. We propose Table-Augmented Generation (TAG), a unified and general-purpose paradigm for answering natural language questions over databases. The TAG model represents a wide range of interactions between the LM and database that have been previously unexplored and creates exciting research opportunities for leveraging the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LMs over data. We systematically develop benchmarks to study the TAG problem and find that standard methods answer no more than 20% of queries correctly, confirming the need for further research in this area. We release code for the benchmark at https://github.com/TAG-Research/TAG-Bench.</description>

      <title>Finding Convincing Views to Endorse a Claim</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies investigated the challenge of assessing the strength of a given claim extracted from a dataset, particularly the claim's potential of being misleading and cherry-picked. We focus on claims that compare answers to an aggregate query posed on a view that selects tuples. The strength of a claim amounts to the question of how likely it is that the view is carefully chosen to support the claim, whereas less careful choices would lead to contradictory claims. We embark on the study of the reverse task that offers a complementary angle in the critical assessment of data-based claims: given a claim, find useful supporting views. The goal of this task is twofold. On the one hand, we aim to assist users in finding significant evidence of phenomena of interest. On the other hand, we wish to provide them with machinery to criticize or counter given claims by extracting evidence of opposing statements.
  To be effective, the supporting sub-population should be significant and defined by a ``natural'' view. We discuss several measures of naturalness and propose ways of extracting the best views under each measure (and combinations thereof). The main challenge is the computational cost, as na\"ive search is infeasible. We devise anytime algorithms that deploy two main steps: (1) a preliminary construction of a ranked list of attribute combinations that are assessed using fast-to-compute features, and (2) an efficient search for the actual views based on each attribute combination. We present a thorough experimental study that shows the effectiveness of our algorithms in terms of quality and execution cost. We also present a user study to assess the usefulness of the naturalness measures.</description>

      <title>Scalable, reproducible, and cost-effective processing of large-scale medical imaging datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curating, processing, and combining large-scale medical imaging datasets from national studies is a non-trivial task due to the intense computation and data throughput required, variability of acquired data, and associated financial overhead. Existing platforms or tools for large-scale data curation, processing, and storage have difficulty achieving a viable cost-to-scale ratio of computation speed for research purposes, either being too slow or too expensive. Additionally, management and consistency of processing large data in a team-driven manner is a non-trivial task. We design a BIDS-compliant method for an efficient and robust data processing pipeline of large-scale diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted MRI data compatible with low-cost, high-efficiency computing systems. Our method accomplishes automated querying of data available for processing and process running in a consistent and reproducible manner that has long-term stability, while using heterogenous low-cost computational resources and storage systems for efficient processing and data transfer. We demonstrate how our organizational structure permits efficiency in a semi-automated data processing pipeline and show how our method is comparable in processing time to cloud-based computation while being almost 20 times more cost-effective. Our design allows for fast data throughput speeds and low latency to reduce the time for data transfer between storage servers and computation servers, achieving an average of 0.60 Gb/s compared to 0.33 Gb/s for using cloud-based processing methods. The design of our workflow engine permits quick process running while maintaining flexibility to adapt to newly acquired data.</description>

      <title>KGPrune: a Web Application to Extract Subgraphs of Interest from Wikidata with Analogical Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become ubiquitous publicly available knowledge sources, and are nowadays covering an ever increasing array of domains. However, not all knowledge represented is useful or pertaining when considering a new application or specific task. Also, due to their increasing size, handling large KGs in their entirety entails scalability issues. These two aspects asks for efficient methods to extract subgraphs of interest from existing KGs. To this aim, we introduce KGPrune, a Web Application that, given seed entities of interest and properties to traverse, extracts their neighboring subgraphs from Wikidata. To avoid topical drift, KGPrune relies on a frugal pruning algorithm based on analogical reasoning to only keep relevant neighbors while pruning irrelevant ones. The interest of KGPrune is illustrated by two concrete applications, namely, bootstrapping an enterprise KG and extracting knowledge related to looted artworks.</description>

      <title>GNN: Graph Neural Network and Large Language Model for Data Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our algorithm GNN: Graph Neural Network and Large Language Model for Data Discovery inherit the benefits of \cite{hoang2024plod} (PLOD: Predictive Learning Optimal Data Discovery), \cite{Hoang2024BODBO} (BOD: Blindly Optimal Data Discovery) in terms of overcoming the challenges of having to predefine utility function and the human input for attribute ranking, which helps prevent the time-consuming loop process. In addition to these previous works, our algorithm GNN leverages the advantages of graph neural networks and large language models to understand text type values that cannot be understood by PLOD and MOD, thus making the task of predicting outcomes more reliable. GNN could be seen as an extension of PLOD in terms of understanding the text type value and the user's preferences, not only numerical values but also text values, making the promise of data science and analytics purposes.</description>

      <title>Styx: Transactional Stateful Functions on Streaming Dataflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing stateful cloud applications, such as low-latency workflows and microservices with strict consistency requirements, remains arduous for programmers. The Stateful Functions-as-a-Service (SFaaS) paradigm aims to serve these use cases. However, existing approaches either provide serializable transactional guarantees at the level of individual functions, or separate application logic from the state and use inefficient transactional protocols. These design choices increase the execution latency, limiting the adoption of SFaaS systems.
  In this paper, we present Styx, a novel SFaaS runtime that executes serializable transactions across functions with exactly-once guarantees. Styx extends a deterministic transactional protocol to support an arbitrary call graph of stateful functions. It introduces a transaction-execution acknowledgment scheme that allows tracking a transactional workflow's SFaaS calls, guaranteeing atomicity and exactly-once processing. Finally, Styx features a function-execution caching mechanism and early transactional commit replies for optimized performance. Experiments with the YCSB-T, TPC-C, and Deathstar benchmarks show that Styx outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving at least one order of magnitude higher throughput while exhibiting near-linear scalability and low latency.</description>

      <title>Generating $SROI^-$ Ontologies via Knowledge Graph Query Embedding Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09212v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Query embedding approaches answer complex logical queries over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs) by computing and operating on low-dimensional vector representations of entities, relations, and queries. However, current query embedding models heavily rely on excessively parameterized neural networks and cannot explain the knowledge learned from the graph. We propose a novel query embedding method, AConE, which explains the knowledge learned from the graph in the form of $SROI^-$ description logic axioms while being more parameter-efficient than most existing approaches. AConE associates queries to a $SROI^-$ description logic concept. Every $SROI^-$ concept is embedded as a cone in complex vector space, and each $SROI^-$ relation is embedded as a transformation that rotates and scales cones. We show theoretically that AConE can learn $SROI^-$ axioms, and defines an algebra whose operations correspond one to one to $SROI^-$ description logic concept constructs. Our empirical study on multiple query datasets shows that AConE achieves superior results over previous baselines with fewer parameters. Notably on the WN18RR dataset, AConE achieves significant improvement over baseline models. We provide comprehensive analyses showing that the capability to represent axioms positively impacts the results of query answering.</description>
