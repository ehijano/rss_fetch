      <title>Enriched $C^1$ finite elements for crack problems in simplified strain gradient elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new type of triangular $C^1$ finite elements developed for the plane strain crack problems within the simplified strain gradient elasticity (SGE). The finite element space contains a conventional fifth-degree polynomial interpolation that was originally developed for the plate bending problems and subsequently adopted for SGE. The enrichment is performed by adding the near-field analytic SGE solutions for crack problems preserving $C^1$ continuity of interpolation. This allows us an accurate representation of strain and stress fields near the crack tip and also results in the direct calculation of the amplitude factors of SGE asymptotic solution and related value of J-integral (energy release rate). The improved convergence of presented formulation is demonstrated within mode I and mode II problems. Size effects on amplitude factors and J-integral are also evaluated. It is found that amplitude factors of SGE asymptotic solution exhibit a linear dependence on crack size for relatively large cracks.</description>

      <title>Ohm's law, Joule heat, and Planckian dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We will show that the Planckian dissipation observed in strange metals including cuprate superconductors can be attributed to the dissipation due to the gauge fluctuation of the Berry connection. In the due course, we revisit the well-studied dissipation problem, Joule heating by electric current in metallic wires. It is known that Poynting's theorem explains it in a strange manner: The energy for the Joule heat enters from the outside of the wire as radiation; and consumed in the wire. This explanation is rectified by considering the generation of the chemical potential gradient inside the wire by the battery connection. Then, the Joule heat is obtained as the energy of the emitted radiation from the wire with its energy supplied by the connected battery. We also examine discharging of a capacitor and supercurrent flow through the Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Exceptional Skin Effect on a Non-Hermitian Flat band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat band and non-Hermitian are both significant conceptions in modern physics. In this study, we delve into the behaviours of flat bands in non-Hermitian systems, focusing on the interplay between the flat band and its dispersive counterparts, investigating the exceptional points (EPs) formed by them together, and the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) on the flat band correspondingly generated, which we name as the exceptional skin effect (ESE). Employing non-Hermitian flat band under chiral/sublattice symmetry, where energy remains highly degenerate, we explore their unique properties. Unlike traditional NHSE which requires the enclosing of a non-zero area in the Bloch complex energy spectrum, the ESE on flat band can be generated with a Bloch complex energy spectrum consisting of one single point, i.e. enclosing no area. By analytically tuning non-Hermitian parameters, changes in the complex energy spectrum and Riemann surfaces are observed, revealing the formation of EPs through the hybridization of flat and dispersive bands while maintaining the dimension of the Hilbert subspace. Additionally, the wave functions of flat band exhibit ESE in specific parameter regions, contrary to the existing frameworks. Experimental validation is conducted using an elastic wave system with actively modulated non-Hermitian parameters, showcasing the impact on flat-band states and confirming the formation of ESE due to flat band-dispersive bands hybridization and correspondingly formed EPs. These results offer novel insights into non-Hermitian physics and present potential directions for further researches and applications in this field.</description>
