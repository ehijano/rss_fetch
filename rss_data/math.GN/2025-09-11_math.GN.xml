      <title>Bi-Equivariant Extensions Of Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of bi-equivariant extension of continuous maps of binary $G$-spaces is considered. The concept of a structural map of distributive binary $G$-spaces is introduced, and a theorem on the bi-equivariant extension of structural maps is proven. A theorem on the bi-equivariant extension of continuous maps defined on the cross sections of a distributive binary $G$-space is also proven.</description>

      <title>Lotz-Peck-Porta and Rosenthal's theorems for spaces $C_p(X)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a Tychonoff space $X$ by $C_p(X)$ we denote the space $C(X)$ of continuous real valued functions on $X$ endowed with the pointwise topology. We prove that an infinite compact space $X$ is scattered if and only if every closed infinite-dimensional subspace in $C_p(X)$ contains a copy of $c_0$ (with the pointwise topology) which is complemented in the whole space $C_p(X)$. This provides a $C_p$-version of the theorem of Lotz, Peck and Porta for Banach spaces $C(X)$ and $c_0$. Applications will be provided. We prove also a $C_p$-version of Rosenthal's theorem by showing that for an infinite compact $X$ the space $C_p(X)$ contains a closed copy of $c_{0}(\Gamma)$ (with the pointwise topology) for some uncountable set $\Gamma$ if and only if $X$ admits an uncountable family of pairwise disjoint open subsets of $X$. Illustrating examples, additional supplementing $C_p$-theorems and comments are included.</description>

      <title>Skorokhod's topologies on path space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skorokhod's J1 and M1 topologies are standard tools in proving limit theorems for stochastic processes. Motivated by applications, we extend these topologies so that they are capable of describing the convergence of a sequence of functions that are not all defined on the same domain. Traditionally, the J1 and M1 topologies are defined using time changes. Instead, we base our definitions on the point of view that the graph of a cadlag function can naturally be viewed as a compact set that is equipped with a total order. The distance between two graphs is then measured by matching points on one graph with points on the other graph in a way that respects the total order. We treat the J1 and M1 topologies in a unified framework and simplify the existing theory. We introduce a space of paths, elements of which are cadlag functions defined on an arbitrary closed subset of the real line. We show that this space is Polish and derive compactness criteria. Specialised to functions that are all defined on the same domain, this yields new proofs of known results.</description>

      <title>Generic Compacta from Relations between Finite Graphs: Theory Building and Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent work, the authors developed a simple method of constructing topological spaces from certain well-behaved partially ordered sets -- those coming from sequences of relations between finite sets. This method associates a given poset with its spectrum, which is a compact T_1 topological space.
  In this paper, we focus on the case where such finite sets have a graph structure and the relations belong to a given graph category. We relate topological properties of the spectrum to combinatorial properties of the graph categories involved. We then utilise this to exhibit elementary combinatorial constructions of well-known continua as Fra\"iss\'e limits of finite graphs in categories with relational morphisms.</description>

      <title>Countably compact inverse semigroups and Nyikos' problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A regular separable first-countable countably compact space is called a Nyikos space. In this paper, we give a partial solution to an old problem of Nyikos by showing that each locally compact Nyikos inverse topological semigroup is compact. Also, we show that a topological semigroup $S$ that contains a dense inverse subsemigroup is a topological inverse semigroup, provided (i) $S$ is compact, or (ii) $S$ is countably compact and sequential. The latter result solves a problem of Banakh and Pastukhova and provides the automatic continuity of inversion in certain compact-like inverse semigroups.</description>

      <title>Involutive quantales and quantale-enriched involutive topological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of involutive quantales, with a particular focus on quantic frames. We extend the axiomatic foundations of quantale-enriched topological spaces to include closure under the anti-homomorphic involution, facilitating a balanced topologization of the spectrum of unital $C^*$-algebras that encompasses both closed right and left ideals through the concept of quantic frames. Specifically, certain subspaces of pure states are identified as strongly Hausdorff separated quantale-enriched involutive topological spaces.</description>
