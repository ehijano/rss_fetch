      <title>Herzog ideals and $F$-singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the connection between Herzog ideals (i.e., ideals with a squarefree Gr\"obner degeneration) and $F$-singularities. More precisely, we show that, in positive characteristic, homogeneous Herzog ideals define $F$-anti-nilpotent rings, and we inquire, in characteristic 0, on a surprising relationship between being Herzog ideals after a change of coordinates and defining rings of dense open $F$-pure type.</description>

      <title>Probabilities of random monomial ideals associated to large graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the Erd\H{o}s R\'enyi model, we propose a new model for freesquare random monomial ideals generated by edges and covers of a graph. This permit us to investigate the conditions of normality for which we obtain asymptotic results. We also elaborate on asymptotic results for other invariants such as the Krull dimension (for which we obtain threshold function), the regularity and the $v$-number.</description>

      <title>Elimination ideals of Pl\"ucker ideals and algebras with straightening laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the Pl\"ucker ideal defining the Grassmannian is generated by quadratic Pl\"ucker relations. These relations form a reverse lexicographic Gr\"obner basis and endow the Pl\"ucker algebra with the structure of an algebra with straightening laws (ASL). In this paper, we study quadratically generated projections of the Grassmannian of lines $\mathrm{Gr}(2,n)$. We then combinatorially characterize the Gorenstein ASL subalgebras of the Pl\"ucker algebra of $\mathrm{Gr}(2,n)$.</description>

      <title>Frobenius Number Of Almost Symmetric Numerical Generalized Almost Arithmetic Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let a, k, h, c be positive integers and d a non zero integer. Recall that a numerical generalized almost arithmetic semigroup S is a semigroup minimally generated by relatively prime positive integers a, ha + d, ha + 2d, . . . , ha + kd, c, that is its embedding dimension is k + 2. In a previous work, the authors described the Ap{\'e}ry set and a Gr{\"o}bner basis of the ideal defining S under one technical assumption, the complete version will be published in a forthcoming paper. In this paper we continue with this assumption and we describe the Pseudo Frobenius set. As a consequence we give a complete description of S when it is symmetric or almost symmetric as well as generalize and extend the previous results of Ignacio Garc{\'i}a-Marco, J. L. Ram{\'i}rez Alfons{\'i}n and O. J. R{{\o}}dseth; we also find a quadratic formula for its Frobenius number that generalizes some results of J.C. Rosales, and P.A. Garc{\'i}a-S{\'a}nchez. Moreover, for given numbers a, d, k, h, c, a simple algorithm allows us to determine if S is almost symmetric or not and furthermore to find its type and Frobenius number.</description>

      <title>Factoriality and Class Groups of Upper Cluster Algebras and Finite Laurent Intersection Rings: A Computational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study factoriality and the class groups of locally acyclic cluster algebras. To do so, we introduce a new class of rings called finite Laurent intersection rings (FLIRs), which includes locally acyclic cluster algebras, full-rank upper cluster algebras, and certain generalized upper cluster algebras and Laurent phenomenon algebras. Our main results are algorithms to compute the class group of an explicit FLIR, to determine factoriality, and to compute all factorizations of a given element. The algorithms are based on multivariate polynomial factorizations, avoiding computationally expensive Gr\"obner basis calculations.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of complete intersection dimensions of RHom and Ext modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the implications of the finiteness of complete intersection dimensions for RHom complexes and Ext modules. We prove various stability results and criteria for detecting finite complete intersection homological dimension of complexes and modules. In addition, we introduce and explore the concept of CI-perfect modules. We also study the vanishing of Ext when certain Hom module have finite complete intersection homological dimension. In this direction, we improve a result by Ghosh and Samanta, prove the Auslander-Reiten conjecture for finitely generated modules $M$ over a Noetherian local ring $R$ such that $\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,R)$ or $\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,M)$ has finite complete intersection injective dimension, and provide Gorenstein criteria.</description>

      <title>Certificate for Orthogonal Equivalence of Real Polynomials by Polynomial-Weighted Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose that $f(x) \in \mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ and $g(x) \in \mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ are two real polynomials of degree $d$ in $n$ variables. If the polynomials $f$ and $g$ are the same up to orthogonal symmetry a natural question is then what element of the orthogonal group induces the orthogonal symmetry; i.e. to find the element $R\in O(n)$ such that $f(Rx)=g(x)$. One may directly solve this problem by constructing a nonlinear system of equations induced by the relation $f(Rx)=g(x)$ along with the identities of the orthogonal group however this approach becomes quite computationally expensive for larger values of $n$ and $d$. To give an alternative and significantly more scalable solution to this problem, we introduce the concept of Polynomial-Weighted Principal Component Analysis (PW-PCA). We in particular show how PW-PCA can be effectively computed and how these techniques can be used to obtain a certificate of orthogonal equivalence, that is we find the $R\in O(n)$ such that $f(Rx)=g(x)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an explicit basis for the $\operatorname{SU}(2)$-invariant space of the exterior power $\wedge_{2k} \mathbb{C}^{2m}$ via the combinatorics of plane partitions. In quantum chemistry, this is the space of spin adapted quantum states of an electronic system with $m$ spin orbitals and $k$ electron pairs. We construct our basis by identifying the invariant space with an Artinian commutative ring called the excitation ring. We compute a Gr\"obner basis and enumerate its standard monomials via an explicit bijection to Dyck paths counted by the Narayana numbers.</description>

Abstract: The cave polynomial of a polymatroid was recently introduced and used to study the syzygies of polymatroidal ideals. We study the combinatorial relationships between three formulas for the cave polynomial. As an application, we interpret the Snapper polynomial in terms of these three formulas.</description>

      <title>On a minimal free resolution of the residue field over a local ring of codepth 3 of class $T$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be any noetherian local ring with residue field $k$, and $A$ the homology of the Koszul complex on a minimal set of generators of the maximal ideal of $R$. In this paper, we show that a minimal free resolution of $k$ over $R$ can be obtained from a graded minimal free resolution of $k$ over $A$. More precisely, this is done by the iterated mapping cone construction, introduced by the authors in a previous work, using specific choices of ingredients. As applications, using this general perspective, we exhibit a minimal free resolution of $k$ over a complete intersection ring of any codepth, and explicitly construct a minimal free resolution of $k$ over a noetherian local ring of codepth 3 of class $T$ in terms of Koszul blocks.</description>

      <title>Homological shifts of powers a complementary edge ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13267v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The homological shift algebra and the projective dimension function of complementary edge ideals are investigated. Let $G$ be a connected graph, and let $I$ be its complementary edge ideal. For bipartite graphs $G$, we show that the projective dimension of $I^s$ increases strictly with $s$ until reaching its maximum value. For trees and cycles, explicit expressions for the projective dimension of $I^s$ are provided, along with detailed descriptions of their homological shift algebras. In particular, it is shown that the $i$-th homological shift algebra of such ideals is generated in degree at most $i$. Additionally, we prove that if $G$ is a tree, then the homological shift ideal $\mathrm{HS}_i(I^i)$, when divided by a suitable monomial, becomes a Veronese-type ideal, and every Veronese-type ideal arises in this manner.</description>

      <title>Generalized binomial edge ideals are Cartwright-Sturmfels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binomial edge ideals associated to a simple graph G were introduced by Herzog and collaborators and, independently, by Ohtani. They became an ``instant classic" in combinatorial commutative algebra with more than 100 papers devoted to their investigation over the past 15 years. They exhibit many striking properties, including being radical and, moreover, Cartwright-Sturmfels. Using the fact that binomial edge ideals can be seen as ideals of 2-minors of a matrix of variables with two rows, generalized binomial edge ideals of 2-minors of matrices of m rows were introduced by Rauh and proved to be radical. The goal of this paper is to prove that generalized binomial edge ideals are Cartwright-Sturmfels. On the way we provide results on ideal constructions preserving the Cartwright-Sturmfels property. We also give examples and counterexamples to the Cartwright-Sturmfels property for higher minors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a well-known result that, after adding one Cohen real, the transcendence degree of the reals over the ground-model reals is continuum. We extend this result for a set $X$ of finitely many Cohen reals, by showing that, in the forcing extension, the transcendence degree of the reals over a combination of the reals in the extension given by each proper subset of $X$ is also maximal. This answers a question of Kanovei and Schindler.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00443v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the definable rank of an ordered field, ordered abelian group and ordered set, respectively. We study the relation between the definable rank of an ordered field and the definable rank of the value group of its natural valuation. Similarly, we compare the definable rank of an ordered abelian group to that of its value set with respect to the natural valuation. We describe the definable rank on the group-level by characterizing the definable convex subgroups. We also give a detailed comparison of field- and group-level, in particular for ordered fields with henselian natural valuation. We investigate definability of final segments in ordered sets and introduce definable condensation as a tool for further study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there are only finitely many finite fields whose members are the sum of an $n$-potent element and a $5$-potent element. Combining this with the algorithmic results provided by S.D. Cohen {\it et al.}, we confirm in the affirmative the conjecture in \cite{Cohen} concerning all finite fields satisfying this condition. Furthermore, we obtain several elementary results for General problem, proving that the number of finite fields satisfying general condition is also finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Ramos and Whiting showed that any generalized cluster algebra of geometric type is isomorphic to a quotient of a subalgebra of a certain cluster algebra. Based on their idea and method, we show that the same property holds for any generalized cluster algebra with $y$-variables in an arbitrary semifield. We also present the relations between the $C$-matrices, the $G$-matrices, and the $F$-polynomials of a generalized cluster pattern and those of the corresponding composite cluster pattern.</description>
