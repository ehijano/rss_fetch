      <title>Artificial Intelligence health advice accuracy varies across languages and contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using basic health statements authorized by UK and EU registers and 9,100 journalist-vetted public-health assertions on topics such as abortion, COVID-19 and politics from sources ranging from peer-reviewed journals and government advisories to social media and news across the political spectrum, we benchmark six leading large language models from in 21 languages, finding that, despite high accuracy on English-centric textbook claims, performance falls in multiple non-European languages and fluctuates by topic and source, highlighting the urgency of comprehensive multilingual, domain-aware validation before deploying AI in global health communication.</description>

      <title>Energy Security and Resilience: Reviewing Concepts and Advancing Planning Perspectives for Transforming Integrated Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent events, including the pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions, and climate change impacts, have exposed the critical need to ensure energy security and resilience in energy systems. We review existing definitions and interrelations between energy security and resilience, conceptualising these terms in the context of energy system transformations. We introduce a classification of disturbances into shock events and slow burn processes to highlight key challenges to energy system resilience. Examples illustrate their distinct impacts on technical, economic, and environmental system performance over time. We compile relevant recourse options across resilience capacity levels and system planning horizons to address these challenges, emphasising actionable strategies for an increasingly integrated energy system. Finally, we propose policy recommendations to integrate shock events and slow burn processes into future energy system planning, enabling forward-looking decision-making and system design to analyse and mitigate potential disruptions.</description>

      <title>Democracy and Growth in the 21st Century</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.07617v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that, in the 21st century, democracy has persistent negative impacts on growth in GDP and night-time light intensity. This finding emerges from five different instrumental variable strategies that account for potential invalidity in some of the instruments. Our analysis also suggests a key mechanism: In this century, many electoral democracies shift toward populism and protectionism. These political changes weaken trade and investment, collectively dampening economic growth. Democracies also experienced lower growth in subjective life satisfaction among citizens. However, democracy causes slower growth in CO2 emissions and energy use, suggesting a trade-off between economic growth and socio-environmental performance.</description>

      <title>Reputation-Driven Adoption and Avoidance of Algorithmic Decision Aids in Credence Goods Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In credence goods markets such as health care or repair services, consumers rely on experts with superior information to adequately diagnose and treat them. Experts, however, are constrained in their diagnostic abilities, which hurts market efficiency and consumer welfare. Technological breakthroughs that substitute or complement expert judgments have the potential to alleviate consumer mistreatment. This article studies how competitive experts adopt novel diagnostic technologies when skills are heterogeneously distributed and obfuscated to consumers. We differentiate between novel technologies that increase expert abilities, and algorithmic decision aids that complement expert judgments, but do not affect an expert's personal diagnostic precision. When consumers build up beliefs about an expert's type through repeated interactions, we show that high-ability experts may strategically forego the decision aid in order to escape a pooling equilibrium by differentiating themselves from low-ability experts. Without future visits, signaling concerns cause all experts to randomize their investment choice, leading to under-utilization from low-ability experts and over-utilization from high-ability experts. Results from two online experiments support our hypotheses. High-ability experts are significantly less likely than low-ability experts to invests into an algorithmic decision aid if reputation building is possible. Otherwise, there is no difference, and experts who believe that consumers play a signaling game randomize their investment choice.</description>

      <title>Package Bids in Combinatorial Electricity Auctions: Selection, Welfare Losses, and Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge in combinatorial auctions is designing bid formats that accurately capture agents' preferences while remaining computationally feasible. This is especially true for electricity auctions, where complex preferences complicate straightforward solutions. In this context, we examine the XOR package bid, the default choice in combinatorial auctions and adopted in European day-ahead and intraday auctions under the name "exclusive group of block bids". Unlike parametric bid formats often employed in US power auctions, XOR package bids are technology-agnostic, making them particularly suitable for emerging demand-side participants. However, the challenge with package bids is that auctioneers must limit their number to maintain computational feasibility. As a result, agents are constrained in expressing their preferences, potentially lowering their surplus and reducing overall welfare. To address this issue, we propose decision support algorithms that optimize package bid selection, evaluate welfare losses resulting from bid limits, and explore alternative bid formats. In our analysis, we leverage the fact that electricity prices are often fairly predictable and, at least in European auctions, tend to approximate equilibrium prices reasonably well. Our findings offer actionable insights for both auctioneers and bidders.</description>
