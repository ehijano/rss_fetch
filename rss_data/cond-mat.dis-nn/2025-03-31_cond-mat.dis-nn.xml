      <title>Many-body Localization in a Slowly Varying Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study many-body localization (MBL) in a nearest-neighbor hopping 1D lattice with a slowly varying (SV) on-site potential $U_j = \lambda\cos(\pi\alpha j^s)$ with $0&lt;s&lt;1$. The corresponding non-interacting 1D lattice model is known to have single-particle localization with mobility edges. Using exact diagonalization, we find that the MBL of this model has similar features to the conventional MBL of extensively studied random or quasiperiodic (QP) models, including the transitions of eigenstate entanglement entropy (EE) and level statistics, and the logarithmic growth of EE. To further investigate the universal properties of this MBL transition in the asymptotic regime, we implement a real-space renormalization group (RG) method. RG analysis shows a subvolume scaling $\sim L^{d_{\rm MBL}}$ with $d_{\rm MBL} \approx 1-s$ of the localization length (length of the largest thermal clusters) in this MBL phase. In addition, we explore the critical properties and find universal scalings of the EE and localization length. From these quantities, we compute the critical exponent $\nu$ using different parameters $s$ (characterizing different degrees of spatial variation of the imposed potential), finding the critical exponent staying around $\nu\approx2$. This exponent $\nu \approx 2$ is close to that of the QP model within the error bars but differs from the random model. This observation suggests that the SV model and the QP model may belong to the same universality class, which is, however, likely distinct from the random universality class.</description>

      <title>ML-based Method for Solving the Microkinetic Model of Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis with Varying Catalyst/Reactor Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a physics-informed machine learning framework to accelerate the computation of the microkinetic model of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. A neural network, trained within the NVIDIA Modulus framework, approximates the fraction of vacant catalytic sites with high accuracy. The combination of implicit differentiation and the Newton-Raphson method enhances derivative calculations, ensuring physical consistency. Computational efficiency improves significantly, with speedups up to $ 10^4 $ times on a GPU. This versatile methodology generalizes across catalysts and reactors, offering a robust tool for chemical engineering applications, including model approximation and catalyst parameter fitting from experimental data.</description>

      <title>A Hermitian bypass to the non-Hermitian quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Describing systems with non-Hermitian (NH) operators remains a challenge in quantum theory due to instabilities (e.g., exceptional points and decoherence) arising from interactions with the environment. We propose a framework to express the energy states of NH Hamiltonians using a well-defined basis (dub computational basis) derived from a related Hermitian operator. This suitably shifts the singularities from the basis states to the expansion coefficients, allowing for their easier mathematical treatment and parametric control. Furthermore, we introduce a `space-time' transformation on the computational basis that defines a generic dual space map for the energy states. Interestingly, this transformation leads to a symmetry for real/imaginary energy values, revealing the existence of weaker condition than hermiticity or the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. This leads to clearer understanding and novel interpretations of key features like exceptional points, dual space, and weaker symmetry-enforced real eigenvalues. The applicability of our framework extends to various branches of physics where NH operators manifest as ladder operators, order parameters, self-energies, projectors, and other entities.</description>

      <title>Characterizing dynamical criticality of many-body localization transitions from the Fock-space perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the nature of many-body localization transitions (MBLTs) and their potential critical behaviors has remained a challenging problem. In this work, we study the dynamics of the displacement, quantifying the spread of the radial probability distribution in the Fock space, for three systems with MBLTs, i.e., the Hamiltonian models with quasiperiodic and random fields, as well as a random-circuit Floquet model of a MBLT. We then perform a finite-size scaling analysis of the long-time averaged displacement by considering two types of ansatz for MBLTs, i.e., continuous and BKT transitions. The data collapse based on the assumption of a continuous phase transition with power-law correlation length reveals that the scaling exponent of the MBLT induced by random field is close to that of the Floquet model, but significantly differes from the quasiperiodic model. Additionally, we find that the BKT-type scaling provides a more accurate description of the MBLTs in the random model and the Floquet model, yielding larger (finite-size) critical points compared to those obtained from power-law scaling. Our work highlights that the displacement is a valuable tool for studying MBLTs, as relevant to ongoing experimental efforts.</description>

      <title>Engineering-Oriented Design of Drift-Resilient MTJ Random Number Generator via Hybrid Control Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) have shown great promise as hardware sources for true random number generation (TRNG) due to their intrinsic stochastic switching behavior. However, practical deployment remains challenged by drift in switching probability caused by thermal fluctuations, device aging, and environmental instability. This work presents an engineering-oriented, drift-resilient MTJ-based TRNG architecture, enabled by a hybrid control strategy that combines self-stabilizing feedback with pulse width modulation. A key component is the Downcalibration-2 scheme, which updates the control parameter every two steps using only integer-resolution timing, ensuring excellent statistical quality without requiring bit discarding, pre-characterization, or external calibration. Extensive experimental measurements and numerical simulations demonstrate that this approach maintains stable randomness under dynamic temperature drift, using only simple digital logic. The proposed architecture offers high throughput, robustness, and scalability, making it well-suited for secure hardware applications, embedded systems, and edge computing environments.</description>

      <title>Direct comparison of stochastic driven nonlinear dynamical systems for combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in industrial applications. However, finding optimal or close-to-optimal solutions can often be extremely hard. Because some of these problems can be mapped to the ground-state search of the Ising model, tremendous effort has been devoted to developing solvers for Ising-type problems over the past decades. Recent advances in controlling and manipulating both quantum and classical systems have enabled novel computing paradigms such as quantum simulators and coherent Ising machines to tackle hard optimization problems. Here, we examine and benchmark several physics-inspired optimization algorithms, including coherent Ising machines, gain-dissipative algorithms, simulated bifurcation machines, and Hopfield neural networks, which we collectively refer to as stochastic-driven nonlinear dynamical systems. Most importantly, we benchmark these algorithms against random Ising problems with planted solutions and compare them to simulated annealing as a baseline leveraging the same software stack for all solvers. We further study how different numerical integration techniques and graph connectivity affect performance. This work provides an overview of a diverse set of new optimization paradigms.</description>
