      <title>EPi-cKANs: Elasto-Plasticity Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks Using Chebyshev Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks are predominantly used to develop data-driven constitutive models for granular materials. They offer a compelling alternative to traditional physics-based constitutive models in predicting nonlinear responses of these materials, e.g., elasto-plasticity, under various loading conditions. To attain the necessary accuracy, MLPs often need to be sufficiently deep or wide, owing to the curse of dimensionality inherent in these problems. To overcome this limitation, we present an elasto-plasticity informed Chebyshev-based Kolmogorov-Arnold network (EPi-cKAN) in this study. This architecture leverages the benefits of KANs and augmented Chebyshev polynomials, as well as integrates physical principles within both the network structure and the loss function. The primary objective of EPi-cKAN is to provide an accurate and generalizable function approximation for non-linear stress-strain relationships, using fewer parameters compared to standard MLPs. To evaluate the efficiency, accuracy, and generalization capabilities of EPi-cKAN in modeling complex elasto-plastic behavior, we initially compare its performance with other cKAN-based models, which include purely data-driven parallel and serial architectures. Furthermore, to differentiate EPi-cKAN's distinct performance, we also compare it against purely data-driven and physics-informed MLP-based methods. Lastly, we test EPi-cKAN's ability to predict blind strain-controlled paths that extend beyond the training data distribution to gauge its generalization and predictive capabilities. Our findings indicate that, even with limited data and fewer parameters compared to other approaches, EPi-cKAN provides superior accuracy in predicting stress components and demonstrates better generalization when used to predict sand elasto-plastic behavior under blind triaxial axisymmetric strain-controlled loading paths.</description>

      <title>Stronger when wet: Water-resistant chitinous objects via zero-waste coordination with metal ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastics have become integral to our society due to their durability and water stability, which is achieved through strong intermolecular interactions. However, these properties also make them persistent disruptors of ecological cycles, in contrast with biological structures, which work with their environments to achieve both excellent mechanical properties and ecological integration. This study takes inspiration from the arthropod cuticle to adapt Earth's second most abundant organic molecule for use in water. The process involves the vitrification of chitosan with small traces of nickel to create a dynamic network of intermolecular bonds using environmental water, resulting in a material that increases its strength to values well above commodity plastics when wet. The approach preserves the molecule's original chemistry and therefore its seamless integration into Earth's metabolism while avoiding the use of the strong organic solvents typically associated with biomolecules. The method demonstrates the potential for a paradigm shift in manufacturing, with zero waste production of both consumables and large objects that could meet the global demand for plastic.</description>

      <title>KPROJ: A Program for Unfolding Electronic and Phononic Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a program named KPROJ that unfolds the electronic and phononic band structure of materials modeled by supercells. The program is based on the $\textit{k}$-projection method, which projects the wavefunction of the supercell onto the ${\textbf{k}}$-points in the Brillouin zone of the artificial primitive cell. It allows for obtaining an effective "local" band structure by performing partial integration over the wavefunctions, e.g., the unfolded band structure with layer-projection for interfaces and the weighted band structure in the vacuum for slabs. The layer projection is accelerated by a scheme that combines the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the inverse FFT algorithms. It is now interfaced with a few first-principles codes based on plane waves such as VASP, Quantum Espresso, and ABINIT. In addition, it also has interfaces with ABACUS, a first-principles simulation package based on numerical atomic basis sets, and PHONOPY, a program for phonon calculations.</description>

      <title>Absence of Phonon Softening across a Charge Density Wave Transition due to Quantum Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome metals have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics due to their potential to host exotic quantum states. Among these, CsV3Sb5 has attracted significant attention for the unusual coexistence of charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity, presenting an ideal system for exploring novel electronic and phononic phenomena. The nature of CDW formation in CsV3Sb5 has sparked considerable debate. Previous studies have suggested that the underlying mechanism driving the CDW transition in CsV3Sb5 is distinct from conventional ones, such as electron-phonon coupling and Fermi surface nesting. In this study, we examine the origin of the CDW state via ab initio finite-temperature simulations of the lattice dynamics associated with CDW structures in CsV3Sb5. Through a comparative study of CsV3Sb5 and 2H-NbSe2, we demonstrate that the experimental absence of phonon softening in CsV3Sb5 and the presence of a weakly first order transition can be attributed to quantum zero-point motion of the lattice, which leads to smearing of the CDW landscape and effectively stabilizes the pristine structure even below the CDW transition temperature. We argue that this surprising behavior could cause coexistence of pristine and CDW structures across the transition and lead to a weak first-order transition. We further discuss experimental implications and use the simulation to interpret coherent phonon spectroscopy results in single crystalline CsV3Sb5. These findings not only refine our fundamental understanding of CDW transitions, but also highlight the surprising role of quantum effects in influencing macroscopic properties of relatively heavy-element materials like CsV3Sb5. Our results provide crucial insights into the formation mechanism of CDW materials that exhibit little to no phonon softening, including cuprates, aiding in the understanding of the CDW phase in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Anharmonicity Dictates the Thermal Conductivity of Gallium Oxide ($\beta-Ga_2O_3$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\beta-Ga_2O_3$ is a promising material candidate for next-generation high power devices even as its low thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) limits utilization due to an inability to sufficiently dissipate heat. Despite its importance, a significant discrepancy persists between experimental results and computational models regarding $\beta-Ga_2O_3$'s anisotropic thermal conductivity. Specifically, computational results are within experimental error bounds for $\kappa_{100}$ and $\kappa_{001}$ while underpredicting $\kappa_{010}$, suggesting that the bare phonon models used in literature are missing essential physics related to the anisotropic thermal transport. In response, we compute the anisotropic $\kappa$ using first-principles and the Pierels-Boltzmann transport equation (PBTE) under different approximations. For the simplest model, we consider the heat carriers to be harmonic phonons with scattering rates obtained perturbatively. These results are then compared to those obtained by including phonon renormalization and four-phonon scattering. Our results show that accounting for phonon renormalization resolves the discrepancy between experiment and theory. This is because phonon renormalization leads to an anisotropic $\kappa$ enhancement caused by directionally-dependent changes in the phonon group velocities accompanied by a general increase in phonon lifetime. Owing to the crucial role of these anharmonic interactions in accurately describing anisotropic thermal transport, we also explore the anharmonicity of individual atoms and show that the octahedrally-coordinated gallium atom is the most anharmonic and thus most likely responsible for the failure of the harmonic phonon model to describe thermal transport in this material. Finally, we demonstrate that atomic anharmonicities could be used as a useful metric to guide the tailoring of vibrational properties.</description>

      <title>Observation of Giant Nernst plateau in ideal 1D Weyl Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for a giant Nernst effect beyond conventional mechanisms offers advantages for developing advanced thermoelectric devices and understanding charge-entropy conversion. Here, we study the Seebeck and Nernst effects of HfTe5 over a wide range of magnetic fields. By tracking the unusual magneto-thermoelectric responses, we reveal two magnetic-field-driven phase transitions proposed for weak topological insulators: the gap-closing transition of the zeroth Landau bands and the topological Lifshitz transition. After the magnetic fields exceed approximately ten times the quantum limit, we observe that the Nernst signal no longer varies with the fields, forming a plateau with a remarkably large value, reaching up to 50 {\mu}V/K at 2 K. We theoretically explain the giant Nernst plateau as a unique signature of the ideal 1D Weyl phase formed in such high fields. Our findings expand the understanding of ideal Weyl physics and open new avenues for realizing novel thermoelectric effects without fundamental constraints.</description>

      <title>Ferroaxial phonons in chiral and polar NiCo2TeO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perfect circular dichroism has been observed in the Raman scattering by the optical phonons in single chiral domain NiCo2TeO6 crystals. The selection rules for the optical phonons are determined by the combination of the chiral structure C and the electric polarization P along the c-axis. These two symmetry operations are equivalent to the ferroaxial order (C dot P) = A, so the observed optical phonons are referred to as "ferroaxial". For a given Raman scattering geometry the observed effect may also be described as a complete non-reciprocal propagation of the optical phonons, whose preferable vector direction is determined by the sign of C dot P. The combination of Raman scattering and polarization plane rotation of the transmitted white light allows for identification of the direction of electric polarization P in mono domain chiral crystals.</description>

      <title>Combining Reinforcement Learning with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for Efficient Design of TiAl/TiAlN Atomic-Scale Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ti/TiN coatings are utilized in a wide variety of engineering applications due to their superior properties such as high hardness and toughness. Doping Al into Ti/TiN can also enhance properties and lead to even higher performance. Therefore, studying the atomic-level behavior of the TiAl/TiAlN interface is important. However, due to the large number of possible combinations for the 50 mol% Al-doped Ti/TiN system, it is time-consuming to use the DFT-based Monte Carlo method to find the optimal TiAl/TiAlN system with a high work of adhesion. In this study, we use a graph convolutional neural network as an interatomic potential, combined with reinforcement learning, to improve the efficiency of finding optimal structures with a high work of adhesion. By inspecting the features of structures in neural networks, we found that the optimal structures follow a certain pattern of doping Al near the interface. The electronic structure and bonding analysis indicate that the optimal TiAl/TiAlN structures have higher bonding strength. We expect our approach to significantly accelerate the design of advanced ceramic coatings, which can lead to more durable and efficient materials for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Towards chemical accuracy for chemi- and physisorption with an efficient density functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding molecular adsorption on surfaces underpins many problems in chemistry and materials science. Accurately and efficiently describing the adsorption has been a challenging task for first-principles methods as the process can involve both short-range chemical bond formations and long-range physical interactions, e.g., the van der Waals (vdW) interaction. Density functional theory presents an appealing choice for modeling adsorption reactions, though calculations with many exchange correlation density functional approximations struggle to accurately describe both chemical and physical molecular adsorptions. Here, we propose an efficient density functional approximation that is accurate for both chemical and physical adsorption by concurrently optimizing its semilocal component and the long-range vdW correction against the prototypical adsorption CO/Pt(111) and Ar$_2$ binding energy curve. The resulting functional opens the door to accurate and efficient modeling of general molecular adsorption.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative calculation of exchange coupling parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exchange coupling parameters $J_{ij}$ within the Heisenberg model and its extensions are crucial for understanding magnetic behavior at the atomic level. To calculate $J_{ij}$ from first principles, perturbative methods based on the magnetic force theorem (MFT), commonly referred to as the Liechtenstein's method, has been widely employed. However, the quantitative accuracy of $J_{ij}$ obtained through this perturbative technique remains questionable. In this paper, we nonperturbatively calculate $J_{ij}$ for several systems of both fundamental and applied significance, including perovskite SrMnO$_3$, neodymium-magnet compounds, and elemental 3$d$ transition metals, and compare these results with those obtained using the conventional MFT-based method. The nonperturbative approach consistently yields reliable results, whereas the MFT-based method exhibits issues in both quantitative and, at times, qualitative accuracy. As discussed later in this paper, these discrepancies arise from neglected contributions within the MFT-based methods. Our nonperturbative scheme is highly versatile and offers strong prospects as a new platform for analyzing and designing spintronics materials, where developing accurate magnetic models is essential.</description>

      <title>Change in Magnetic Order in NiPS3 Single Crystals Induced by a Molecular Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intercalation is a robust method for tuning the physical properties of a vast number of van der Waals (vdW) materials. However, the prospects of using intercalation to modify magnetism in vdWs systems and the associated mechanisms have not been investigated adequately. In this work, we modulate magnetic order in an XY antiferromagnet NiPS3 single crystals by introducing pyridine molecules into the vdWs gap under different thermal conditions. X-ray diffraction measurements indicated pronounced changes in the lattice parameter beta, while magnetization measurements at in-plane and out-of-plane configurations exposed reversal trends in the crystals Neel temperatures through intercalation-de-intercalation processes. The changes in magnetic ordering were also supported by three-dimensional thermal diffusivity experiments. The preferred orientation of the pyridine dipoles within vdW gaps was deciphered via polarized Raman spectroscopy. The results highlight the relation between the preferential alignment of the intercalants, thermal transport, and crystallographic disorder along with the modulation of anisotropy in the magnetic order. The theoretical concept of double-exchange interaction in NiPS3 was employed to explain the intercalation-induced magnetic ordering. The study uncovers the merit of intercalation as a foundation for spin switches and spin transistors in advanced quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Formation of cellular/lamellar nanostructure in Sm$_2$Co$_{17}$-type binary and ternary Sm-Co-Zr magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2:17 SmCo magnets with a quinary composition of Sm(Co,Cu,Fe,Zr)$_{7+{\delta}}$ are industrially relevant hard magnets used in high temperature and corrosive environments. Their complex cellular/lamellar nanostructure, consisting of ordered 2:17 phase cells, 1:5 phase cell boundaries and Z-phase (Zr-rich) lamellae, is essential for their high coercivity. However, the system's complexity makes it challenging to determine the contribution of each element or microstructural feature to coercivity. To disentangle the microstructure-property relationships, we simplified the system to binary and ternary SmCo$_{7.7-x}$Zr$_x$ (with $x = 0$ and 0.1) magnets and conducted detailed micro- to atomic-scale analyses. Only Zr-containing magnets formed a cellular/lamellar nanostructure akin to industrial magnets, in Zr-rich regions with at least 1 at.% Zr, but without achieving high coercivity due to low elemental gradients in absence of Cu across cell boundaries. Data from Zr-poor areas of SmCo$_{7.6}$Zr$_{0.1}$ suggests that 2:17 phase twin boundaries facilitate cellular nanostructure formation by providing inhomogeneities for heterogeneous nucleation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to three-dimensional (3D) crystals that melt via a first-order transition, two-dimensional (2D) crystals can exhibit various melting scenarios under different temperatures, pressures, and particle interactions, particularly when they can form partially ordered intermediate phases between crystal and liquid. The existing 2D melting theories predict some scenarios, but do not exclude other possibilities. A recent simulation observed five melting scenarios including two new types by tuning the shape of polygonal particles.</description>

      <title>Emission enhancement and bandgap narrowing in $Cs_2TeBr_6$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure-induced emission enhancement and bandgap narrowing in vacancy-ordered halide double perovskite $Cs_2TeBr_6$ are extensively investigated through photoluminescence and absorption experiments. The below bandgap broad emission is attributed to self-trapped excitons recombination. The $Cs_2TeBr_6$ crystal, consisting of undistorted octahedra, exhibits substantial emission enhancement due to the lowering of the energy barrier between $^3P_1$ and self-trapped exciton states, as well as the suppression of nonradiative energy loss with increasing pressure. In the Raman measurements, the observed behavior of full width at half maximum of all Raman modes implies dominant electron-phonon interactions rather than anharmonic interactions between phonons. The pressure-dependent X-ray diffraction measurements reveal an anomalous behaviour in the normalized pressure as a function of the Eulerian strain.</description>

      <title>Hexagonal boron nitride crystal growth in the Li3BN2-BN system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) presents valuable intrinsic properties and attracts considerable attention for the development of novel two-dimensional (2D) materials-based technologies. Even though huge efforts have been made to improve the bottom-up synthesis of integrated and high quality hBN, the devices presenting the best performances are still made using hBN exfoliated from bulk crystals. In this context, we explore the Polymer-Derived Ceramics (PDC) route coupled to a high temperature process that produces millimetric and high quality hBN crystals. By investigating the (micro)structure of several samples, we demonstrate that the crystal growth occurs by segregation from a Li3BN2-BN solution upon cooling and from hBN seeds. In particular, we show that crystallization can occur at a temperature as low as 1400{\textdegree}C. Overall, these results show that hBN crystal growth in the Li3BN2-BN system is compatible with conventional flux methods that may be the most promising platform for continuous seeded hBN crystal growth.</description>

      <title>Hole Capture-Structural Relaxation Mechanism of Defect Generation in Ionizing-irradiated $a$-SiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The permanent ionization damage of semiconductor devices in harsh radiation environments stems from $E'_\gamma$ defect centers generation in the $a$-SiO$_2$ dielectric or isolation layers, but the long-standing "hole transport-trapping" generation mechanism encounters dilemmas to explain recent experiments. In this work, we propose a new "hole capture-structural relaxation" (HCSR) mechanism, based on spin-polarized first-principles calculations of oxygen vacancies ($V_{\rm O}$'s) in $a$-SiO$_2$. It is found that due to an electronic metastability caused by the localization of defect electronic states, the previously suggested puckered precursor, $V_{O\gamma}$, cannot exist in $a$-SiO$_2$, and the $E'_\gamma$ centers can arise from a structural relaxation of dimer $V_{O\delta}$ after nonradiative capture of irradiation-induced valence band holes. We demonstrate that, such an HCSR mechanism can consistently explain the basic but puzzling temperature and electric-field dependences in recent experiments. Moreover, by using reaction rate theory, we derive an analytical formula to uniformly describe the sublinear experimental data over a wide dose and temperature range. This work not only provides a rationale for defect generation in ionizing-irradiated $a$-SiO$_2$, but also offer a general approach to understanding the irradiation physics in alternative dielectrics and wide-band gap semiconductors with intrinsic electronic metastability.</description>

      <title>Defect-tolerant electron and defect-sensitive phonon transport in quasi-2D conjugated coordination polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials, enabling direct waste-heat to electricity conversion, need to be highly electrically conducting while simultaneously thermally insulating. This is fundamentally challenging since electrical and thermal conduction are usually coupled. Here, we discover that quasi-2D conjugated coordination polymer films exhibit this ideal mix of antithetical properties due to coexistence of defect-tolerant charge transport and defect-sensitive heat propagation. The former is highlighted by the highest conductivities &gt; 2000 S cm-1 with metallic temperature dependence observed in disordered films with paracrystallinity &gt; 10%, while the latter manifests in low, temperature-activated lattice thermal conductivities (&lt; 0.38 W m-1 K-1) originating from small-amplitude, quasi-harmonic lattice dynamics with disorder-limited lifetimes and vibrational scattering length on the order of interatomic spacing. Based on temperature-dependent thermoelectric and magnetotransport experiments we identify a two-carrier (hole-electron), ambipolar metallic transport regime as the origin of relatively small Seebeck coefficients in these materials. Our findings identify conjugated coordination polymers as attractive materials for applications in thermoelectric energy harvesting, (bio)electronics and energy storage.</description>

      <title>Unraveling structural, electronic, and magnetic ambiguities in Pb1-{\delta}CrO3 with an insulating charge-transfer band structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a recently-identified Mott system, PbCrO3 remains largely unexplored, especially for its band structure, leading to many contentious issues on its structural, electronic, and magnetic properties. Here we present a comprehensive study of two different Pb1-{\delta}CrO3 ({\delta} = 0 and 0.15) samples with involving atomic deficiency prepared under pressure. By means of the state-of-the-art diffraction techniques, crystal structure of PbCrO3 is definitively determined to adopt the pristine Pm-3m symmetry, rather than other previously misassigned structures of M2-Pm-3m and Pmnm. The two materials exhibit a similar charge-transfer-type insulating band structure, and the charge-transfer effect splits both Cr2p and Pb4f orbitals, rationalizing doublet splitting of the associated spectral lines. Nearly identical nominal cationic valence states of Cr4+ and Pb2+ are identified for this oxide system, hence calling into question the validity of recently-proposed charge disproportionation mechanisms. Besides, Pb0.85CrO3 exhibits an anomalously higher N\'eel temperature of ~240 K than that of PbCrO3 (i.e., ~200 K), likely due to the deficiency-induced enhancements of Cr: 3d-O:2p orbital overlap and magnetic exchange. These findings provide many solid evidences to look into the fundamental properties of this important material system.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics and mixing of polar phonons in the rare-earth orthoferrite TbFeO$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth orthoferrites are a promising platform for antiferromagnetic spintronics with a rich variety of terahertz spin and lattice dynamics phenomena. For instance, it has been experimentally demonstrated that the light-driven optical phonons can coherently manipulate macroscopic magnetic states via nonlinear magnetophononic effects. Here using TbFeO$_{3}$ as an example, we reveal the origin of the mode mixing between the LO and TO phonons, which is important for understanding of nonlinear phononics. We performed a comprehensive study of the lattice dynamics of the TbFeO$_{3}$ single crystal by polarized infrared and Raman scattering spectroscopic techniques, and experimentally obtained and carefully analyzed the spectra of anisotropic complex dielectric functions in the far-infrared spectral range. This allowed us to reliably identify the symmetries and parameters of most infrared- and Raman-active phonons. Next, the experimental studies were supplemented by the lattice dynamics calculations which allowed us to propose the normal mode assignments. We reveal that the relation between LO and TO polar phonons is complex and does not strictly follow the ``LO-TO rule'' due to the strong mode mixing. We further analyze how displacements of different ions contribute to phonon modes and reveal that magnetic Fe ions are not involved in Raman-active phonons, thus shedding light on a lack of spin phonon coupling for such phonons. The obtained results establish a solid basis for further in-depth experimental research in the field of nonlinear phononics and magnetophononics in rare-earth orthoferrites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of band offsets at semiconductor interfaces has been one of Alfonso Baldereschi most cherished topics, to which he has made significant contributions, both directly and by enticing peers and disciples, including myself, to delve deeply into it. In this tribute, I recount how a brilliant idea of his for modeling band offsets in a class of semiconductor heterojunctions led to one of our most cited works and brought about the birth of pseudopotential alchemy. This model provides a powerful tool to both compute and fathom the electronic and structural properties of composite semiconductors, such as heterojunctions and alloys, by treating them as small perturbations with respect to a virtual crystal, a system in which different chemical elements occupying crystallographically equivalent lattice sites are represented by an average pseudopotential. This note is intended as a tribute to the fond memories I have of the time spent with, and the science learned from, Alfonso. No attempt will be made at bibliographic completeness in the niche field of pseudopotential alchemy, let alone the much broader one of semiconductor heterojunctions.</description>

      <title>The potential of Brillouin Spectroscopy for investigating the mechanical properties of hydrogels during dehydration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogels are attractive and versatile gel-based structures consisting of three-dimensional networks of hydrophilic polymers with unique properties that can retain a large amount of water and be tailor-designed according to specific requirements, and thus, suitable for numerous commercial areas (i.e., medicine, agriculture, electronics, cosmetics, etc.). However, since these materials can be very soft and flexible, mechanical characterization is challenging. This study explores the mechanical properties of a cellulose-based hydrogel using the optical, non-contact technique Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy (BLS). Two differently dried hydrogel samples were investigated and pre-characterized for their morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and their mechanical performance by tensile testing. Then, BLS spectra were recorded to characterize the material's stiffness, indicating that the structural arrangement of the material due to the drying procedure (the density) is the main factor limiting the material's strength. By further analyzing the effect of moisture and the changes during drying, we characterize the mechanical behavior of organic hydrogel films and sponges and their dehydration evolution to understand the liquid-solid transition.</description>

      <title>Adaptive AI-Driven Material Synthesis: Towards Autonomous 2D Materials Growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are poised to revolutionize current solid-state technology with their extraordinary properties. Yet, the primary challenge remains their scalable production. While there have been significant advancements, much of the scientific progress has depended on the exfoliation of materials, a method that poses severe challenges for large-scale applications. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in materials science, innovative synthesis methodologies are now on the horizon. This study explores the forefront of autonomous materials synthesis using an artificial neural network (ANN) trained by evolutionary methods, focusing on the efficient production of graphene. Our approach demonstrates that a neural network can iteratively and autonomously learn a time-dependent protocol for the efficient growth of graphene, without requiring pretraining on what constitutes an effective recipe. Evaluation criteria are based on the proximity of the Raman signature to that of monolayer graphene: higher scores are granted to outcomes whose spectrum more closely resembles that of an ideal continuous monolayer structure. This feedback mechanism allows for iterative refinement of the ANN's time-dependent synthesis protocols, progressively improving sample quality. Through the advancement and application of AI methodologies, this work makes a substantial contribution to the field of materials engineering, fostering a new era of innovation and efficiency in the synthesis process.</description>

      <title>Methods of Fitting experimental data in several amplifiers for single spot radiometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single spot radiometers are widely used to estimate temperature of body heated by high temperature, specially blast furnace, glass fusion, boiler of power plant, and so on. In previous papers on single spot radiometer a heated body was deduced according to interpolation functions between heated body temperature and photocurrent, which had previously measured. However, fitting functions required for current-to-voltage converter, non-inverting amplifier, and logarithmic amplifier have never reported. Therefore, in this paper the fitting functions are reported that can obtain the relationship between radiance temperatures of a body and outputs of amplifiers in single spot radiometer.</description>

      <title>Delayed recovery in a dense suspension of core-shell attractive particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft particulate glasses are dense suspensions of jammed particles that flow like liquids under external shear and recover their solid-like properties almost instantly upon flow cessation. Here, we consider a dense suspension of core-shell attractive particles whose polymer brush allows for a delayed recovery that we monitor by time-resolved mechanical spectroscopy. Viscoelastic spectra recorded upon flow cessation show a striking power-law behavior and can be rescaled onto a master curve that hints at a time-connectivity superposition principle. Additionally, the non-linear response of this soft glass, measured at various aging times, shows a ductile-to-brittle transition, which suggests that the interactions between the particles display a progressive repulsive-to-attractive transition. These results depict an original scenario for the delayed recovery involving a time-dependent interaction potential in which attractive hydrophobic forces are only activated when neighboring particles deform their polymer shell and come in close contact.</description>

      <title>Colloquium: Quantum Properties and Functionalities of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competing magnetic interactions may stabilize smooth magnetization textures that can be characterized by a topological winding number. Such textures, which are spatially localized within a two-dimensional plane, are commonly known as skyrmions. On the classical level, their significance for fundamental science and their potential for applications, ranging from spintronic devices to unconventional computation platforms, have been intensively investigated in recent years. This Colloquium considers quantum effects associated with skyrmion textures: their theoretical origins, the experimental and material challenges associated with their detection, and the promise of exploiting them for quantum operations. Starting with classical skyrmions, we discuss their magnon and electron excitations and show how hybrid architectures offer new platforms for engineering quantum orders, including topological superconductivity. We then focus on the quantization of the skyrmion texture itself and formulate the long-time skyrmion dynamics in terms of collective coordinates. Next, we discuss the quantization of helicity and phenomena of macroscopic quantum tunneling: key concepts that fundamentally distinguish quantum skyrmions from their classical counterparts. Looking ahead, we propose material classes suitable for the realization of skyrmions in quantum spin systems and identify device architectures with the promise of achieving quantum operations. We close by addressing the advances in experimental methods which will be a prerequisite for resolving the quantum aspects of topological spin patterns, sensing their local dynamical response, and achieving their predicted functionalities in magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Spatially Selective Acoustic Pressure Reporting Using Antibubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound offers promising applications in biology and chemistry, but quantifying local ultrasound conditions remains challenging due to the lack of non-invasive measurement tools. We introduce antibubbles as novel optical reporters of local ultrasound pressure. These liquid-core, air-shell structures encapsulate fluorescent payloads, releasing them upon exposure to low-intensity ultrasound. We demonstrate their versatility by fabricating antibubbles with hydrophilic and hydrophobic payloads, revealing payload-dependent encapsulation efficiency and release dynamics. Using acoustic holograms, we showcase precise spatial control of payload release, enabling visualization of complex ultrasound fields. High-speed fluorescence imaging reveals a gentle, single-shot release mechanism occurring within 20-50 ultrasound cycles. It is thus possible to determine via an optical fluorescence marker what the applied ultrasound pressure was. This work thereby introduces a non-invasive method for mapping ultrasound fields in complex environments, potentially accelerating research in ultrasound-based therapies and processes. The long-term stability and versatility of these antibubble reporters suggest broad applicability in studying and optimizing ultrasound effects across various biological and chemical systems.</description>

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in high repetition-rate extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light sources and photoelectron analyzers have led to dramatic advances in the performance of time-resolved photoemission experiments. In this perspective article, we discuss the application of cavity-enhanced high-order harmonic generation (CE-HHG), with repetition rates exceeding 10 MHz, to photoemission experiments using advanced endstations incorporating time-of-flight photoelectron analyzers.

Abstract: For the quality inspection of carbon fiber sheet molding compounds, polarization imaging is a promising alternative to more established methods like computed tomography, since it is cheaper, faster, and provides a larger field-of-view. For uni- and bidirectional carbon fiber reinforced composite materials, machine vision cameras with on-chip polarized image sensors have been successfully validated for visualizing fiber orientation. Although this imaging technique is already being applied to multidirectional materials, to our knowledge, it has not yet been validated for such materials. In this paper, fiber orientations obtained by angle of linear polarization images (AOLP) of commercially available pressed carbon fiber sheet molding compound materials are compared with orientations estimated from computed tomography scans. The fiber orientations in the computed tomography images are estimated using the maximal response of anisotropic Gaussian filters and the deviation between orientations estimated from polarization and computed tomography images is calculated. Both imaging methods showed encouraging visual similarity, but also notable numerical differences, which are discussed in depth. Moreover, it is shown that the surface layer fiber orientation is representative of the fiber orientation through the entire specimen.</description>

      <title>Narrowband gamma-ray radiation generation by acoustically driven crystalline undulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a novel scheme for the controlled generation of of tunable narrowband gamma-ray radiation by ultra-relativistic positron beams inside acoustically driven periodically bent crystals. A novel acoustic crystalline undulator is presented, in which excitation of a silicon single crystal along the (100) planar direction by a piezoelectric transducer periodically modulates the crystal lattice in the [100] axial direction. An ultra-relativistic positron beam is directed diagonally into the crystal and propagates along the (110) planes. The lattice modulation forces the positrons to follow periodic trajectories,resulting in the emission of undulator radiation in the MeV range. A computational methodology for the design and development of such acoustically based light sources is presented together with the results of simulations demonstrating the favourable properties of the proposed technology. The longitudinal acoustic strains induced in the crystal by high-frequency piezoelectric elements are calculated by finite element simulations. The resulting bending profiles of the deformed crystal planes are used as geometrical conditions in the relativistic molecular dynamics simulations that calculate the positron trajectories and the spectral distribution of the emitted radiation. The results show a strong enhancement of the emitted radiation within a narrow spectral band defined by the bending period, demonstrating the feasibility and potential of the proposed technology.</description>

      <title>Multiple scales homogenisation of a porous viscoelastic material with rigid inclusions: application to lithium-ion battery electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the mechanical behaviour of the composite materials used in modern lithium-ion battery electrodes. These contain relatively high modulus active particle inclusions within a two-component matrix of liquid electrolyte which penetrates the pore space within a viscoelastic polymer binder. Deformations are driven by a combination of (i) swelling/contraction of the electrode particles in response to lithium insertion/extraction, (ii) swelling of the binder as it absorbs electrolyte, (iii) external loading and (iv) flow of the electrolyte within the pores. We derive the macroscale response of the composite using systematic multiple scales homomgenisation by exploiting the disparity in lengthscales associated with the size of an electrode particle and the electrode as a whole. The resulting effective model accurately replicates the behaviour of the original model (as is demonstrated by a series of relevant case studies) but, crucially, is markedly {simpler and hence} cheaper to solve. This is significant practical value because it facilitates low-cost, realistic computations of the mechanical states of battery electrodes, thereby allowing model-assisted development of battery designs that are better able to withstand the mechanical abuse encountered in practice and ultimately paving the way for longer-lasting batteries.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent Multiplexing with Solid-State Integrated Hybrid Superconducting Electronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) of cryogenic signal lines is a promising technique that can significantly reduce the required space, minimize the cooldown time, and increase the number of measurable quantum devices per cooldown. Here, we report the TDM of supercurrent with a 1-input-8-outputs voltage-actuated hybrid superconducting demultiplexer for the first time. The device comprises 14 ON/OFF InAsOI-based superconducting Josephson Field Effect Transistors (JoFETs) routed with Al traces. Each JoFET features Al as a superconductor and HfO2 as a gate insulator, and it can entirely suppress the switching current and increase the normal-state resistance by 20 times with a gate voltage of -4.5 V. The superconducting demultiplexer operates up to 100 MHz at 50 mK, features an insertion loss of ~ 0 dB in the superconducting state, and an OFF/ON ratio of ~ 17.5 dB in a 50-Ohm-matched cryogenic measurement setup. The frequency operation range can be extended by designing the demultiplexer with a proper microwave signal transport layout minimizing, at the same time, the impact of the parasitic electrical elements. These achievements open up the practical implementation of superconducting TDM as a key to drastically reducing I/O lines, costs, and space occupation in a cryostat, enabling the scalability of superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin Hall effect protected by spin U(1) quasisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, where electrons with opposite spin channels are deflected to opposite sides of a two-dimensional system with a quantized conductance, was believed to be characterized by a nontrivial topological index $Z_{2}$. However, spin mixing effects in realistic materials often lead to deviation of the spin Hall conductance from exact quantization. In this Letter, we present a universal symmetry indicator for diagnosing QSH effect in realistic materials, termed spin U(1) quasisymmetry. Such a symmetry eliminates the first-order spin-mixing perturbation and thus protects the near-quantization of SHC, applicable to time-reversal-preserved cases with either $Z_{2}=1$ or $Z_{2}=0$, as well as time-reversal-broken scenarios. We propose that spin U(1) quasisymmetry is hidden in the subspace spanned by the doublets with unquenched orbital momentum and emerges when SOC is present, which can be realized in 19 crystallographic point groups. Particularly, we identify a previous overlooked even spin Chern phase with a trivial $Z_{2}$ index as an ideal platform for achieving a near-double-quantized SHC, as exemplified by twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides and monolayer RuBr$_{3}$. Our work offers a new perspective for understanding QSH effect and significantly expands the material pool for the screening of exemplary material candidates.</description>

      <title>Dynamical manipulation of polar topologies from acoustic phonon pumping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the recent discovery of polar topologies, a recurrent question has been in the way to remotely tune them. Many efforts have focused on the pumping of polar optical phonons from optical methods but with limited success, as only switching between specific phases has been achieved so far. Additionally, the correlation between optical pulse characteristics and the resulting phase remains poorly understood. Here, we propose an alternative approach and demonstrate the deterministic and dynamical tailoring of polar topologies using instead acoustic phonon pumping. Our second-principles simulations reveal that by pumping specific longitudinal and transverse acoustic phonons, various topological textures can be induced in materials like BaTiO$_\mathrm{3}$ or PbTiO$_\mathrm{3}$. This method leverages the strong coupling between polarization and strain in these materials, enabling predictable and dynamical control of polar patterns. Our findings open up an alternative possibility for the manipulation of polar textures, inaugurating a promising research direction.</description>

      <title>Variable Temperature and Carrier-Resolved Photo-Hall Measurements of High-Performance Selenium Thin-Film Solar Cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selenium is an elemental semiconductor with a wide bandgap suitable for a range of optoelectronic and solar energy conversion technologies. However, developing such applications requires an in-depth understanding of the fundamental material properties. Here, we study the properties of the majority and minority charge carriers in selenium using a recently developed carrier-resolved photo-Hall technique, which enables simultaneous mapping of the mobilities and concentrations of both carriers under varying light intensities. Additionally, we perform temperature-dependent Hall measurements to extract information about the acceptor level and ionization efficiency. Our findings are compared to results from other advanced characterization techniques, and the inconsistencies are outlined. Finally, we characterize a high-performance selenium thin-film solar cell and perform device simulations to systematically address each discrepancy and accurately reproduce experimental current-voltage and external quantum efficiency measurements. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the optoelectronic properties and carrier dynamics in selenium, which may guide future improvements and facilitate the development of higher-efficiency selenium solar cells.</description>

Abstract: The electron spin polarization on half-metallic double-perovskites is usually conditioned to the ordered rock-salt arrangement of the transition-metal ions along the lattice. In this work, we investigate a polycrystalline sample of the Ca1.5La0.5MnRuO6 compound by employing x-ray powder diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, x-ray absorption and magnetic circular dichroism at the Mn-L2,3 and Ru-M2,3 edges, magnetometry, electrical transport and first principles calculations in order to show that this is a fully disordered material exhibiting near room temperature ferrimagnetism and half-metallic conductivity, with significant intergrain tunneling magnetoresistance. These unprecedented results are compared to those of archetypical ordered double-perovskites, and discussed in terms of the Mn and Ru valences and their orbital hybridization.</description>

      <title>A Framework of SO(3)-equivariant Non-linear Representation Learning and its Application to Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05722v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose both a theoretical and a methodological framework to address a critical challenge in applying deep learning to physical systems: the reconciliation of non-linear expressiveness with SO(3)-equivariance in predictions of SO(3)-equivariant quantities. Inspired by covariant theory in physics, we present a solution by exploring the mathematical relationships between SO(3)-invariant and SO(3)-equivariant quantities and their representations. We first construct theoretical SO(3)-invariant quantities derived from the SO(3)-equivariant regression targets, and use these invariant quantities as supervisory labels to guide the learning of high-quality SO(3)-invariant features. Given that SO(3)-invariance is preserved under non-linear operations, the encoding process for invariant features can extensively utilize non-linear mappings, thereby fully capturing the non-linear patterns inherent in physical systems. Building on this, we propose a gradient-based mechanism to induce SO(3)-equivariant encodings of various degrees from the learned SO(3)-invariant features. This mechanism can incorporate non-linear expressive capabilities into SO(3)-equivariant representations, while theoretically preserving their equivariant properties as we prove, establishing a strong foundation for regressing complex SO(3)-equivariant targets. We apply our theory and method to the electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction tasks, experimental results on eight benchmark databases covering multiple types of systems and challenging scenarios show substantial improvements on the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy of deep learning paradigm. Our method boosts Hamiltonian prediction accuracy by up to 40% and enhances downstream physical quantities, such as occupied orbital energy, by a maximum of 76%.</description>

      <title>A frustrated antipolar phase analogous to classical spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of magnetic frustration in classical spin systems was motivated by the prediction and discovery of classical spin liquid states. These uncommon magnetic phases are characterized by a massive degeneracy of their ground state implying a finite magnetic entropy at zero temperature. While the classical spin liquid state was originally predicted in the Ising triangular lattice antiferromagnet in 1950, this state has never been experimentally observed in any triangular magnets. We report here the discovery of an electric analogue of classical spin liquids on a triangular lattice of uniaxial electric dipoles in EuAl12O19 . This new type of frustrated antipolar phase is characterized by a highly degenerate state at low temperature implying an absence of long-range antiferroelectric order, despite short-range antipolar correlations. Its dynamics are governed by a thermally activated process, slowing down upon cooling towards a complete freezing at zero temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In designing material functionalities for transition metal oxides, lattice structure and d-orbital occupancy are key determinants. However, the modulation of these two factors is inherently limited by the need to balance thermodynamic stability, growth kinetics, and stoichiometry precision, particularly for metastable phases. We introduce a methodology, namely the gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GOALL-Epitaxy), enhancing oxidation power 3-4 orders of magnitude beyond oxide molecular beam epitaxy (OMBE) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD), while ensuring atomic-layer-by-layer growth of designed complex structures. Thermodynamic stability is markedly augmented with stronger oxidation at elevated temperatures, whereas growth kinetics is sustained by laser ablation at lower temperatures. We demonstrate the accurate growth of complex nickelates and cuprates, especially an artificially designed structure with alternating single and double NiO2 layers possessing distinct nominal d-orbital occupancy, as a parent of high-temperature superconductor. The GOALL-Epitaxy enables material discovery within the vastly broadened growth parameter space.</description>

      <title>Field-induced spin liquid in the decorated square-kagome antiferromagnet nabokoite KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum antiferromagnets realizing the square-kagome lattice are proving to be a promising platform for nontrivial phenomena in frustrated magnetism. We carry out a theoretical analysis of the recently synthesized compound nabokoite {\nab} based on a density functional theory energy mapping which establishes an unusual Heisenberg Hamiltonian with a hierarchy of couplings which suggests a description in terms of effective spin liquid models. Owing to the decoration of the square-kagome lattice with a seventh Cu site, nabokoite is characterized by highly frustrated square pyramids that are antiferromagnetically coupled in a chiral arrangement. Employing classical Monte Carlo simulations, we are able to explain the two transitions observed in the low-temperature magnetization curve from the experimental measurements. Remarkably, we show that the low-field phase is only realized when the inter-layer coupling is included. On the other hand, the intermediate-field phase is also found in a purely two-dimensional model and is described by a spin liquid featuring a subextensive degeneracy with a ferrimagnetic component. We show that this phase can be approximated by a checkerboard lattice in a magnetic field. We finally assess the effects of quantum fluctuations in zero fields using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group method and predict the spin structure factor for comparison with future neutron scattering measurements.</description>
