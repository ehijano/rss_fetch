      <title>Shadow Area and Degrees-of-Freedom for Free-Space Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of degrees-of-freedom (NDoF) in a communication system is limited by the number of antenna ports, element shapes, positions, and the propagation environment. As the number of antenna elements increases within a given region, the NDoF eventually saturates due to correlation of the radiated fields. The maximal NDoF can be determined numerically for communication between two regions using singular value decomposition of a channel model representing wave propagation between densely sampled sources at the transmitter and fields at the receiver. This paper provides a straightforward analytical estimate of the NDoF for arbitrarily shaped transmitter and receiver regions. The analysis show that the NDoF for electrically large regions is approximated by the mutual shadow area of the regions, measured in wavelengths. Several setups illustrate the results, which are then compared with numerical evaluations of the singular values of the propagation channel. These new analytical expressions also simplify to previously established results based on Weyl's law and the paraxial approximation.</description>

      <title>Movable Frequency Diverse Array for Wireless Communication Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency diverse array (FDA) is a promising antenna technology to achieve physical layer security by varying the frequency of each antenna at the transmitter. However, when the channels of the legitimate user and eavesdropper are highly correlated, FDA is limited by the frequency constraint and cannot provide satisfactory security performance. In this paper, we propose a novel movable FDA (MFDA) antenna technology where the positions of antennas can be dynamically adjusted in a given finite region. Specifically, we aim to maximize the secrecy capacity by jointly optimizing the antenna beamforming vector, antenna frequency vector and antenna position vector. To solve this non-convex optimization problem with coupled variables, we develop a two-stage alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) method. Moreover, to evaluate the security performance provided by MFDA, we introduce two benchmark schemes, i.e., phased array (PA) and FDA. Simulation results demonstrate that MFDA can significantly enhance security performance compared to PA and FDA. In particular, when the frequency constraint is strict, MFDA can further increase the secrecy capacity by adjusting the positions of antennas instead of the frequencies.</description>

      <title>Wireless-Powered Mobile Crowdsensing Enhanced by UAV-Mounted RIS: Joint Transmission, Compression, and Trajectory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) enables data collection from massive devices to achieve a wide sensing range. Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising paradigm for prolonging the operation time of MCS systems by sustainably transferring power to distributed devices. However, the efficiency of WPT significantly deteriorates when the channel conditions are poor. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can serve as active or passive relays to enhance the efficiency of WPT in unfavourable propagation environments. Therefore, to explore the potential of jointly deploying UAVs and RISs to enhance transmission efficiency, we propose a novel transmission framework for the WPT-assisted MCS systems, which is enhanced by a UAV-mounted RIS. Subsequently, under different compression schemes, two optimization problems are formulated to maximize the weighted sum of the data uploaded by the user equipments (UEs) by jointly designing the WPT and uploading time, the beamforming matrics, the CPU cycles, and the UAV trajectory. A block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on the closed-form beamforming designs and the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated problems. Furthermore, to highlight the insight of the gains brought by the compression schemes, we analyze the energy efficiencies of compression schemes and confirm that the gains gradually reduce with the increasing power used for compression. Simulation results demonstrate that the amount of collected data can be effectively increased in wireless-powered MCS systems.</description>

      <title>Low-Coherence Sequence Design Under PAPR Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-coherence sequences with low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) are crucial for multi-carrier wireless communication systems and are used for pilots, spreading sequences, and so on. This letter proposes an efficient low-coherence sequence design algorithm (LOCEDA) that can generate any number of sequences of any length that satisfy user-defined PAPR constraints while supporting flexible subcarrier assignments in orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems. We first visualize the low-coherence sequence design problem under PAPR constraints as resolving collisions between hyperspheres. By iteratively adjusting the radii and positions of these hyperspheres, we effectively generate low-coherence sequences that strictly satisfy the imposed PAPR constraints. Simulation results (i) confirm that LOCEDA outperforms existing methods, (ii) demonstrate its flexibility, and (iii) highlight its potential for various application scenarios.</description>

      <title>i-CardiAx: Wearable IoT-Driven System for Early Sepsis Detection Through Long-Term Vital Sign Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sepsis is a significant cause of early mortality, high healthcare costs, and disability-adjusted life years. Digital interventions like continuous cardiac monitoring can help detect early warning signs and facilitate effective interventions. This paper introduces i-CardiAx, a wearable sensor utilizing low-power high-sensitivity accelerometers to measure vital signs crucial for cardiovascular health: heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and respiratory rate (RR). Data collected from 10 healthy subjects using the i-CardiAx chest patch were used to develop and evaluate lightweight vital sign measurement algorithms. The algorithms demonstrated high performance: RR (-0.11 $\pm$ 0.77 breaths\min), HR (0.82 $\pm$ 2.85 beats\min), and systolic BP (-0.08 $\pm$ 6.245 mmHg). These algorithms are embedded in an ARM Cortex-M33 processor with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support, achieving inference times of 4.2 ms for HR and RR, and 8.5 ms for BP. Additionally, a multi-channel quantized Temporal Convolutional Neural (TCN) Network, trained on the open-source HiRID dataset, was developed to detect sepsis onset using digitally acquired vital signs from i-CardiAx. The quantized TCN, deployed on i-CardiAx, predicted sepsis with a median time of 8.2 hours and an energy per inference of 1.29 mJ. The i-CardiAx wearable boasts a sleep power of 0.152 mW and an average power consumption of 0.77 mW, enabling a 100 mAh battery to last approximately two weeks (432 hours) with continuous monitoring of HR, BP, and RR at 30 measurements per hour and running inference every 30 minutes. In conclusion, i-CardiAx offers an energy-efficient, high-sensitivity method for long-term cardiovascular monitoring, providing predictive alerts for sepsis and other life-threatening events.</description>

      <title>TinyBird-ML: An ultra-low Power Smart Sensor Node for Bird Vocalization Analysis and Syllable Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animal vocalisations serve a wide range of vital functions. Although it is possible to record animal vocalisations with external microphones, more insights are gained from miniature sensors mounted directly on animals' backs. We present TinyBird-ML; a wearable sensor node weighing only 1.4 g for acquiring, processing, and wirelessly transmitting acoustic signals to a host system using Bluetooth Low Energy. TinyBird-ML embeds low-latency tiny machine learning algorithms for song syllable classification. To optimize battery lifetime of TinyBird-ML during fault-tolerant continuous recordings, we present an efficient firmware and hardware design. We make use of standard lossy compression schemes to reduce the amount of data sent over the Bluetooth antenna, which increases battery lifetime by 70% without negative impact on offline sound analysis. Furthermore, by not transmitting signals during silent periods, we further increase battery lifetime. One advantage of our sensor is that it allows for closed-loop experiments in the microsecond range by processing sounds directly on the device instead of streaming them to a computer. We demonstrate this capability by detecting and classifying song syllables with minimal latency and a syllable error rate of 7%, using a light-weight neural network that runs directly on the sensor node itself. Thanks to our power-saving hardware and software design, during continuous operation at a sampling rate of 16 kHz, the sensor node achieves a lifetime of 25 hours on a single size 13 zinc-air battery.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning In-Sensors: Computation-enabled Intelligent Sensors For Next Generation of IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart sensors are an emerging technology that allows combining the data acquisition with the elaboration directly on the Edge device, very close to the sensors. To push this concept to the extreme, technology companies are proposing a new generation of sensors allowing to move the intelligence from the edge host device, typically a microcontroller, directly to the ultra-low-power sensor itself, in order to further reduce the miniaturization, cost and energy efficiency. This paper evaluates the capabilities of a novel and promising solution from STMicroelectronics. The presence of a floating point unit and an accelerator for binary neural networks provide capabilities for in-sensor feature extraction and machine learning. We propose a comparison of full-precision and binary neural networks for activity recognition with accelerometer data generated by the sensor itself. Experimental results have demonstrated that the sensor can achieve an inference performance of 10.7 cycles/MAC, comparable to a Cortex-M4-based microcontroller, with full-precision networks, and up to 1.5 cycles/MAC with large binary models for low latency inference, with an average energy consumption of only 90 $\mu$J/inference with the core running at 5 MHz.</description>

      <title>Wireless Communications in Doubly Selective Channels with Domain Adaptivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21514v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless communications are significantly impacted by the propagation environment, particularly in doubly selective channels with variations in both time and frequency domains. Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a promising solution; however, its high equalization complexity, if performed in the delay-Doppler domain, limits its universal application. This article explores domain-adaptive system design, dynamically selecting best-fit domains for modulation, pilot placement, and equalization based on channel conditions, to enhance performance across diverse environments. We examine domain classifications and connections, signal designs, and equalization techniques with domain adaptivity, and finally highlight future research opportunities.</description>

      <title>Scheduling Quantum Annealing for Active User Detection in a NOMA Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active user detection in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network is a major challenge for 5G/6G applications. However, classical algorithms that can perform this task suffer either from complexity or reduced performances. This work aims at proposing a quantum annealing approach to overcome this trade-off. Firstly, we show that the maximum a posteriori decoder of the activity pattern of the network can be seen as the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian. For N users in a network with perfect channels, we propose a universal control function to schedule the annealing process. Our approach avoids to continuously compute the optimal control function but still ensures high success probability while demanding a lower annealing time than a linear control function. This advantage holds even in the presence of imperfections in the network.</description>

      <title>Blind and robust estimation of adaptive optics point spread function and diffuse halo with sharp-edged objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context . Initially designed to detect and characterise exoplanets, extreme adaptive optics (AO) systems open a new window onto the Solar System by resolving its small bodies. Nonetheless, their study remains limited by the accuracy of the knowledge of the AO-corrected point spread function (AO-PSF) that degrades their image and produces a bright halo, potentially hiding faint moons in their close vicinity. Aims . To overcome the random nature of AO-PSFs, I aim to develop a method that blindly recovers the PSF and its faint structured extensions directly into the data of interest, without any prior on the instrument or the object's shape. The objectives are both to deconvolve the object and to properly estimate and remove its surrounding halo to highlight potential faint companions. Methods . My method first estimated the PSF core via a parametric model fit, under the assumption of a sharp-edged flat object. Then, the resolved object and the PSF extensions were alternatively deconvolved with a robust method, insensitive to model outliers, such as cosmic rays or unresolved moons. Finally, the complex halo produced by the AO system was modelled and removed from the data. Results . The method is validated on realistic simulations with an on-sky AO-PSF from the SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument. On real data, the proposed blind deconvolution algorithm strongly improves the image sharpness and retrieves details on the surface of asteroids. In addition, their moons are visible in all tested epochs despite important variability in turbulence conditions. Conclusions . My method shows the feasibility of retrieving the complex features of AO-PSFs directly from the data of interest. It paves the way towards more precise studies of asteroid surfaces and the discovery and characterisation of Solar System moons in archival data or with future instruments on extremely large telescopes with ever more complex AO-PSFs.</description>

      <title>Cell-free Massive MIMO with Sequential Fronthaul Architecture and Limited Memory Access Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) is a paradigm that can improve users' spectral efficiency (SE) far beyond traditional cellular networks. Increased spatial diversity in CFmMIMO is achieved by spreading the antennas into small access points (APs), which cooperate to serve the users. Sequential fronthaul topologies in CFmMIMO, such as the daisy chain and multi-branch tree topology, have gained considerable attention recently. In such a processing architecture, each AP must store its received signal vector in the memory until it receives the relevant information from the previous AP in the sequence to refine the estimate of the users' signal vector in the uplink. In this paper, we adopt vector-wise and element-wise compression on the raw or pre-processed received signal vectors to store them in the memory. We investigate the impact of the limited memory capacity in the APs on the optimal number of APs. We show that with no memory constraint, having single-antenna APs is optimal, especially as the number of users grows. However, a limited memory at the APs restricts the depth of the sequential processing pipeline. Furthermore, we investigate the relation between the memory capacity at the APs and the rate of the fronthaul link.</description>

      <title>Physical Modelling and Cancellation of External Passive Intermodulation in FDD MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the physical approach to model external (air-induced) passive intermodulation (PIM) is presented in a frequency-division duplexing (FDD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with an arbitrary number of transceiver chains. The external PIM is a special case of intermodulation distortion (IMD), mainly generated by metallic objects possessing nonlinear properties ("rusty bolt" effect). Typically, such sources are located in the near-field or transition region of the antenna array. PIM products may fall into the receiver band of the FDD system, negatively affecting the uplink signal. In contrast to other works, this one directly simulates the physical external PIM. The system includes models of a point-source external PIM, a finite-length dipole antenna, a MIMO antenna array, and a baseband multicarrier 5G NR OFDM signal. The Channel coefficients method for multi-PIM-source compensation is replicated to verify the proposed external PIM modelling approach. Simulation results of artificially generated PIM cancellation show similar performance as real-life experiments. Therefore, the proposed approach allows testing PIM compensation algorithms on large systems with many antennas and arbitrary array structures. This eliminates the need for experiments with real hardware at the development stage of the PIM cancellation algorithm.</description>

      <title>Who should I trust? A Visual Analytics Approach for Comparing Net Load Forecasting Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Net load forecasting is crucial for energy planning and facilitating informed decision-making regarding trade and load distributions. However, evaluating forecasting models' performance against benchmark models remains challenging, thereby impeding experts' trust in the model's performance. In this context, there is a demand for technological interventions that allow scientists to compare models across various timeframes and solar penetration levels. This paper introduces a visual analytics-based application designed to compare the performance of deep-learning-based net load forecasting models with other models for probabilistic net load forecasting. This application employs carefully selected visual analytic interventions, enabling users to discern differences in model performance across different solar penetration levels, dataset resolutions, and hours of the day over multiple months. We also present observations made using our application through a case study, demonstrating the effectiveness of visualizations in aiding scientists in making informed decisions and enhancing trust in net load forecasting models.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication in IRS-assisted High-Mobility Systems: Design, Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in high-mobility systems with the aid of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). To exploit the benefits of Delay-Doppler (DD) spread caused by high mobility, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)-based frame structure and transmission framework are proposed. {In such a framework,} we first design a low-complexity ratio-based sensing algorithm for estimating the velocity of mobile user. Then, we analyze the performance of sensing and communication in terms of achievable mean square error (MSE) and achievable rate, respectively, and reveal the impact of key parameters. Next, with the derived performance expressions, we jointly optimize the phase shift matrix of IRS and the receive combining vector at the base station (BS) to improve the overall performance of integrated sensing and communication. Finally, extensive simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in high-mobility systems.</description>

Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode multiplexing has the potential to achieve high spectrum-efficiency communications at the same time and frequency by using orthogonal mode resource. However, the vortex wave hollow divergence characteristic results in the requirement of the large-scale receive antenna, which makes users hardly receive the OAM signal by size-limited equipment. To promote the OAM application in the next 6G communications, this paper proposes the cooperative OAM wireless (COW) communication scheme, which can select the cooperative users (CUs) to form the aligned antennas by size-limited user equipment. First, we derive the feasible radial radius and selective waist radius to choose the CUs in the same circle with the origin at the base station. Then, based on the locations of CUs, the waist radius is adjusted to form the receive antennas and ensure the maximum intensity for the CUs. Finally, the cooperative formation probability is derived in the closed-form solution, which can depict the feasibility of the proposed COW communication scheme. Furthermore, OAM beam steering is used to expand the feasible CU region, thus achieving higher cooperative formation probability. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived cooperative formation probability in mathematical analysis is very close to the statistical probability of cooperative formation, and the proposed COW communication scheme can obtain higher spectrum efficiency than the traditional scheme due to the effective reception of the OAM signal.</description>

      <title>TinyChirp: Bird Song Recognition Using TinyML Models on Low-power Wireless Acoustic Sensors</title>

Abstract: Monitoring biodiversity at scale is challenging. Detecting and identifying species in fine grained taxonomies requires highly accurate machine learning (ML) methods. Training such models requires large high quality data sets. And deploying these models to low power devices requires novel compression techniques and model architectures. While species classification methods have profited from novel data sets and advances in ML methods, in particular neural networks, deploying these state of the art models to low power devices remains difficult. Here we present a comprehensive empirical comparison of various tinyML neural network architectures and compression techniques for species classification. We focus on the example of bird song detection, more concretely a data set curated for studying the corn bunting bird species. The data set is released along with all code and experiments of this study. In our experiments we compare predictive performance, memory and time complexity of classical spectrogram based methods and recent approaches operating on raw audio signal. Our results indicate that individual bird species can be robustly detected with relatively simple architectures that can be readily deployed to low power devices.</description>

      <title>RF Power Transmission for Self-sustaining Miniaturized IoT Devices</title>

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) wireless power transfer is a promising technology that has the potential to constantly power small Internet of Things (IoT) devices, enabling even battery-less systems and reducing their maintenance requirements. However, to achieve this ambitious goal, carefully designed RF energy harvesting (EH) systems are needed to minimize the conversion losses and the conversion efficiency of the limited power. For intelligent internet of things sensors and devices, which often have non-constant power requirements, an additional power management stage with energy storage is needed to temporarily provide a higher power output than the power being harvested. This paper proposes an RF wireless power energy conversion system for miniaturized IoT composed of an impedance matching network, a rectifier, and power management with energy storage. The proposed sub-system has been experimentally validated and achieved an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 30 % for an input power of -10 dBm and a peak efficiency of 57 % at 3 dBm.</description>

      <title>Precoding Based Downlink OAM-MIMO Communications with Rate Splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) and rate splitting (RS) are the potential key techniques for the future wireless communications. As a new orthogonal resource, OAM can achieve the multifold increase of spectrum efficiency to relieve the scarcity of the spectrum resource, but how to enhance the privacy performance imposes crucial challenge for OAM communications. RS technique divides the information into private and common parts, which can guarantee the privacies for all users. In this paper, we integrate the RS technique into downlink OAM-MIMO communications, and study the precoding optimization to maximize the sum capacity. First, the concentric uniform circular arrays (UCAs) are utilized to construct the downlink transmission framework of OAM-MIMO communications with RS. Particularly, users in the same user pair utilize RS technique to obtain the information and different user pairs use different OAM modes. Then, we derive the OAM-MIMO channel model, and formulate the sum capacity maximization problem. Finally, based on the fractional programming, the optimal precoding matrix is obtained to maximize the sum capacity by using quadratic transformation. Extensive simulation results show that by using the proposed precoding optimization algorithm, OAM-MIMO communications with RS can achieve higher sum capacity than the traditional communication schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For users in hotspot region, orbital angular momentum (OAM) can realize multifold increase of spectrum efficiency (SE), and the flying base station (FBS) can rapidly support the real-time communication demand. However, the hollow divergence and alignment requirement impose crucial challenges for users to achieve air-to-ground OAM communications, where there exists the line-of-sight path. Therefore, we propose the air-to-ground cooperative OAM communication (ACOC) scheme, which can realize OAM communications for users with size-limited devices. The waist radius is adjusted to guarantee the maximum intensity at the cooperative users (CUs). We derive the closed-form expression of the optimal FBS position, which satisfies the antenna alignment for two cooperative user groups (CUGs). Furthermore, the selection constraint is given to choose two CUGs composed of four CUs. Simulation results are provided to validate the optimal FBS position and the SE superiority of the proposed ACOC scheme.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Functional Insufficiencies and Triggering Conditions to Improve the SOTIF of an MPC-based Trajectory Planner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21569v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated and autonomous driving has made a significant technological leap over the past decade. In this process, the complexity of algorithms used for vehicle control has grown significantly. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a prominent example, which has gained enormous popularity and is now widely used for vehicle motion planning and control. However, safety concerns constrain its practical application, especially since traditional procedures of functional safety (FS), with its universal standard ISO26262, reach their limits. Concomitantly, the new aspect of safety-of-the-intended-function (SOTIF) has moved into the center of attention, whose standard, ISO21448, has only been released in 2022. Thus, experience with SOTIF is low and few case studies are available in industry and research. Hence this paper aims to make two main contributions: (1) an analysis of the SOTIF for a generic MPC-based trajectory planner and (2) an interpretation and concrete application of the generic procedures described in ISO21448 for determining functional insufficiencies (FIs) and triggering conditions (TCs). Particular novelties of the paper include an approach for the out-of-context development of SOTIF-related elements (SOTIF-EooC), a compilation of important FIs and TCs for a MPC-based trajectory planner, and an optimized safety concept based on the identified FIs and TCs for the MPC-based trajectory planner.</description>

      <title>Robust Simultaneous Multislice MRI Reconstruction Using Deep Generative Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging is a powerful technique for accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions. However, SMS reconstruction remains challenging due to the complex signal interactions between and within the excited slices. This study presents a robust SMS MRI reconstruction method using deep generative priors. Starting from Gaussian noise, we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) to gradually recover the individual slices through reverse diffusion iterations while imposing data consistency from the measured k-space under readout concatenation framework. The posterior sampling procedure is designed such that the DDPM training can be performed on single-slice images without special adjustments for SMS tasks. Additionally, our method integrates a low-frequency enhancement (LFE) module to address a practical issue that SMS-accelerated fast spin echo (FSE) and echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences cannot easily embed autocalibration signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods and generalizes well to unseen datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Solor-pikachu/ROGER after the review process.</description>

Abstract: The task of indoor positioning is fundamental to several applications, including navigation, healthcare, location-based services, and security. An emerging field is inertial navigation for pedestrians, which relies only on inertial sensors for positioning. In this paper, we present inertial pedestrian navigation models and learning approaches. Among these, are methods and algorithms for shoe-mounted inertial sensors and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) with unconstrained inertial sensors. We also address three categories of data-driven PDR strategies: activity-assisted, hybrid approaches, and learning-based frameworks.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Wireless Communication Resource Allocation for Cyber-Physical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of novel industrial applications at the wireless edge, such as smart grids and vehicle networks, demands the advancement of cyber-physical systems. The performance of CPSs is closely linked to the last-mile wireless communication networks, which often become bottlenecks due to their inherent limited resources. Current CPS operations often treat wireless communication networks as unpredictable and uncontrollable variables, ignoring the potential adaptability of wireless networks, which results in inefficient and overly conservative CPS operations. Meanwhile, current wireless communications often focus more on throughput and other transmission-related metrics instead of CPS goals. In this study, we introduce the framework of goal-oriented wireless communication resource allocations, accounting for the semantics and significance of data for CPS operation goals. This guarantees optimal CPS performance from a cybernetic standpoint. We formulate a bandwidth allocation problem aimed at maximizing the information utility gain of transmitted data brought to CPS operation goals. Since the goal-oriented bandwidth allocation problem is a large-scale combinational problem, we propose a divide-and-conquer and greedy solution algorithm. The information utility gain is first approximately decomposed into marginal utility information gains and computed in a parallel manner. Subsequently, the bandwidth allocation problem is reformulated as a knapsack problem, which can be further solved greedily with a guaranteed sub-optimality gap. We further demonstrate how our proposed goal-oriented bandwidth allocation algorithm can be applied in four potential CPS applications, including data-driven decision-making, edge learning, federated learning, and distributed optimization.</description>

      <title>Stimulus-Informed Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis for Group Analysis of Neural Responses to Natural Stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various new brain-computer interface technologies or neuroscience applications require decoding stimulus-following neural responses to natural stimuli such as speech and video from, e.g., electroencephalography (EEG) signals. In this context, generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) is often used as a group analysis technique, which allows the extraction of correlated signal components from the neural activity of multiple subjects attending to the same stimulus. GCCA can be used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the stimulus-following neural responses relative to all other irrelevant (non-)neural activity, or to quantify the correlated neural activity across multiple subjects in a group-wise coherence metric. However, the traditional GCCA technique is stimulus-unaware: no information about the stimulus is used to estimate the correlated components from the neural data of several subjects. Therefore, the GCCA technique might fail to extract relevant correlated signal components in practical situations where the amount of information is limited, for example, because of a limited amount of training data or group size. This motivates a new stimulus-informed GCCA (SI-GCCA) framework that allows taking the stimulus into account to extract the correlated components. We show that SI-GCCA outperforms GCCA in various practical settings, for both auditory and visual stimuli. Moreover, we showcase how SI-GCCA can be used to steer the estimation of the components towards the stimulus. As such, SI-GCCA substantially improves upon GCCA for various purposes, ranging from preprocessing to quantifying attention.</description>

      <title>On the Accuracy of Phase Extraction from a Known-Frequency Noisy Sinusoidal Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03935v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate phase extraction from sinusoidal signals is a crucial task in various signal processing applications. While prior research predominantly addresses the case of asynchronous sampling with unknown signal frequency, this study focuses on the more specific situation where synchronous sampling is possible, and the signal's frequency is known. In this framework, a comprehensive analysis of phase estimation accuracy in the presence of both additive and phase noises is presented. A closed-form expression for the asymptotic Probability Density Function (PDF) of the resulting phase estimator is validated by simulations depicting Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) trends in different noise scenarios. This estimator is asymptotically efficient, converging rapidly to its Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). Three distinct RMSE behaviours were identified based on SNR, sample count (N), and noise level: (i) saturation towards a random guess at low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), (ii) linear decrease with the square roots of N and SNR at moderate noise levels, and (iii) saturation at high SNR towards a noise floor dependent on the phase noise level. By quantifying the impact of sample count, additive noise, and phase noise on phase estimation accuracy, this work provides valuable insights for designing systems requiring precise phase extraction, such as phase-based fluorescence assays or system identification.</description>

Abstract: One rarely addressed direction in the context of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing, with the potential to enable use cases like intrusion detection and to increase the value that wireless networks can bring. However, ISAC networks impose challenges for sensing due to their communication-oriented design. For instance, time division duplex transmission creates spectral holes in time, resulting in spectral replicas in the radar image. To counteract this, we evaluate different channel state information processing strategies and discuss their tradeoffs. We further propose an ensemble of techniques to detect targets in NLOS conditions. Our approaches are validated with experiments using a millimeter wave ISAC proof of concept in a factory-like environment. The results show that target detection in NLOS is generally possible with ISAC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based approach for Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation using a Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) or Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) under a Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) scenario. The key innovation is the employment of a novel Neural Network (NN) layer, referred to as the NN-based RIS layer, within a generic network structure.
  The NN-based RIS layer is designed to learn the optimal RIS phase shifts that are tailored for the DoA estimation task. To achieve this, the pre-processed real-valued observations are fed into the RIS layer, which has a specialized structure. Unlike regular neural network layers, the weights of the NN-based RIS layer are constrained to be sinusoidal functions, with the phase arguments being the tunable parameters during the training process. This allows the layer to emulate the functionality of an RIS.
  Accordingly, the standard feed-forward and back-propagation procedures are modified to accommodate the unique structure of the NN-based RIS layer. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed machine learning-based approach outperforms conventional non-learning-based methods for DoA estimation under most practical SNR ranges in an RIS-assisted scheme, also it shows a better tracking capability.</description>

      <title>K-Deep Simplex: Deep Manifold Learning via Local Dictionaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02134v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose K-Deep Simplex(KDS) which, given a set of data points, learns a dictionary comprising synthetic landmarks, along with representation coefficients supported on a simplex. KDS employs a local weighted $\ell_1$ penalty that encourages each data point to represent itself as a convex combination of nearby landmarks. We solve the proposed optimization program using alternating minimization and design an efficient, interpretable autoencoder using algorithm unrolling. We theoretically analyze the proposed program by relating the weighted $\ell_1$ penalty in KDS to a weighted $\ell_0$ program. Assuming that the data are generated from a Delaunay triangulation, we prove the equivalence of the weighted $\ell_1$ and weighted $\ell_0$ programs. We further show the stability of the representation coefficients under mild geometrical assumptions. If the representation coefficients are fixed, we prove that the sub-problem of minimizing over the dictionary yields a unique solution. Further, we show that low-dimensional representations can be efficiently obtained from the covariance of the coefficient matrix. Experiments show that the algorithm is highly efficient and performs competitively on synthetic and real data sets.</description>

      <title>Localization from structured distance matrices via low-rank matrix recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining the configuration of $n$ points by using their distances to $m$ nodes, referred to as anchor nodes. One sampling scheme is Nystrom sampling, which assumes known distances between the anchors and between the anchors and the $n$ points, while the distances among the $n$ points are unknown. For this scheme, a simple adaptation of the Nystrom method, which is often used for kernel approximation, is a viable technique to estimate the configuration of the anchors and the $n$ points. In this manuscript, we propose a modified version of Nystrom sampling, where the distances from every node to one central node are known, but all other distances are incomplete. In this setting, the standard Nystrom approach is not applicable, necessitating an alternative technique to estimate the configuration of the anchors and the $n$ points. We show that this problem can be framed as the recovery of a low-rank submatrix of a Gram matrix. Using synthetic and real data, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can exactly recover configurations of points given sufficient distance samples. This underscores that, in contrast to methods that rely on global sampling of distance matrices, the task of estimating the configuration of points can be done efficiently via structured sampling with well-chosen reliable anchors. Finally, our main analysis is grounded in a specific centering of the points. With this in mind, we extend previous work in Euclidean distance geometry by providing a general dual basis approach for points centered anywhere.</description>

      <title>Sense-Then-Train: An Active-Sensing-Based Beam Training Design for Near-Field MIMO Systems</title>

Abstract: An active-sensing-based sense-then-train (STT) scheme is proposed for beam training in near-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Compared to conventional codebook-based schemes, the proposed STT scheme is capable of not only addressing the complex spherical-wave propagation but also effectively exploiting the additional degrees-of-freedoms (DoFs). The STT scheme is tailored for both single-beam and multi-beam cases. 1) For the single-beam case, the STT scheme first utilizes a sensing phase to estimate a low-dimensional representation of the near-field MIMO channel in the truncated wavenumber domain. Then, in the subsequent training phase, the neural network modules at transceivers are updated online to align beams, utilizing sequentially received ping-pong pilots. This approach can efficiently obtain the aligned beam pair without relying on predefined codebooks or training datasets. 2) For the multi-beam case, based on the single-beam STT, a Gram-Schmidt method is further utilized to guarantee the orthogonality between beams in the training phase. Numerical results unveil that 1) the proposed STT scheme can significantly enhance the beam training performance in the near field compared to the conventional far-field codebook-based schemes, and 2) the proposed STT scheme can perform fast and low-complexity beam training, while achieving a near-optimal performance without full channel state information in both cases.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Grouping Index Modulation Design for MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Index modulation (IM) significantly enhances the spectral efficiency of fluid antennas (FAs) enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which is named FA-IM. However, due to the dense distribution of ports on the FA, the wireless channel exhibits a high spatial correlation, leading to severe performance degradation in the existing FA-IM-assisted MIMO systems. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel fluid antenna grouping index modulation (FA-GIM) scheme to mitigate the high correlation between the activated ports. Specifically, considering the characteristics of the FA two-dimensional (2D) surface structure and the spatially correlated channel model in FA-assisted MIMO systems, a block grouping method is adopted, where adjacent ports are assigned to the same group. Subsequently, different groups independently perform port index selection and constellation symbol mapping, with only one port being activated within each group during each transmission interval. Numerical results show that, compared to state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed FA-GIM scheme consistently achieves significant bit error rate (BER) performance gains under various conditions. It has also been confirmed that the proposed scheme is both efficient and robust, enhancing the performance of FA-assisted MIMO systems.</description>
