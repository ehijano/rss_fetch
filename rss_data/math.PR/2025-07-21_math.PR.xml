      <title>Hadamard fractional Brownian motion: path properties and Wiener integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called Hadamard fractional Brownian motion, as defined in Beghin et al. (2025) by means of Hadamard fractional operators, is a Gaussian process which shares some properties with standard Brownian motion (such as the one-dimensional distribution). However, it also resembles the fractional Brownian motion in many other features as, for instance, self-similarity, long/short memory property, Wiener-integral representation. The logarithmic kernel in the Hadamard fractional Brownian motion represents a very specific and interesting aspect of this process. Our aim here is to analyze some properties of the process' trajectories (i.e. H\"{o}lder continuity, quasi-helix behavior, power variation, local nondeterminism) that are both interesting on their own and serve as a basis for the Wiener integration with respect to it. The respective integration is quite well developed, and the inverse representation is also constructed. We apply the derived ``multiplicative Sonine pairs'' to the treatment of the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space of the Hadamard fractional Brownian motion, and, as a result, we establish a law of iterated logarithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a study on SDEs with a bounded Borel drift b. We first remark that the original integration by parts formula due to P. Malliavin can be used to deal with derivatives with respect to space variables, then we obtain a link between the product of heat kernels and iterated divergences in Malliavin calculus. An explicit estimate for the derivative of solutions to SDE is obtained in terms of the L-infinity norm of b; as a result, we prove that the SDE defines a continuous flow of maps in Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Modulated Poisson-Dirichlet diffusions arising from inclusion processes with a slow phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mean-field inclusion processes with an additional slow phase, in which particle interactions occur at a vanishing rate proportional to the inverse system size. In the thermodynamic limit, such systems exhibit condensation at high particle density, forming clusters of diverging size. Our main result provides convergence in law of inclusion processes to a novel two-component infinite-dimensional stochastic diffusion, describing the co-evolution of the solid condensed and microscopic fluid phase. In particular, we establish non-trivial mass exchange between the two phases.
  The resulting scaling limit extends the Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion (Ethier and Kurtz, 1981), introducing an additional control process that modulates its parameters. Our result builds on classical estimates of generator differences, which in this setting yield non-vanishing deterministic error bounds. We provide the missing probabilistic ingredient by showing instantaneous condensation, with particle clusters concentrating on a vanishing volume fraction immediately. We further establish the well-posedness of the limiting dynamics generally as Feller processes on a compact state space.</description>

      <title>Strong Convergence of Multiplicative Brownian Motions on the General Linear Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the family of multiplicative Brownian motions $G_{\lambda,\tau}$ on the general linear group introduced by Driver-Hall-Kemp. They are parametrized by the real variance $\lambda\in \mathbb{R}$ and the complex covariance $\tau \in \mathbb{C}$ of the underlying elliptic Brownian motion. We show the almost sure strong convergence of the finite-dimensional marginals of $G_{\lambda,\tau}$ to the corresponding free multiplicative Brownian motion introduced by Hall-Ho: as the dimension tends to infinity, not only does the noncommutative distribution converge almost surely, but the operator norm does as well. This result generalizes the work of Collins-Dahlqvist-Kemp for the special case $(\lambda,\tau)=(1,0)$ which corresponds to the Brownian motion on the unitary group. Actually, this strong convergence remains valid when the family of multiplicative Brownian motions $G_{\lambda,\tau}$ is considered alongside a family of strongly converging deterministic matrices.</description>

      <title>A Durrett-Remenik particle system in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a branching-selection model of motionless particles in $\mathbb{R}^d$, with nonlocal branching, introduced by Durrett and Remenik in dimension $1$. The assumptions on the fitness function, $F$, and on the inhomogeneous branching distribution, are mild. The evolution equation for the macroscopic density is given by an integro-differential free boundary problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$, in which the free boundary represents the least $F$-value in the population. The main result is the characterization of the limit in probability of the empirical measure process in terms of the unique solution to this free boundary problem.</description>

      <title>Large deviations at the edge for 1D gases and tridiagonal random matrices at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model for a gas of $N$ confined particles subject to a two-body repulsive interaction, namely the one-dimensional log or Riesz gas. We are interested in the so-called \textit{high temperature} regime, \textit{ie} where the inverse temperature $\beta_N$ scales as $N\beta_N\rightarrow2P&gt;0$. We establish, in the log case, a large deviation (LD) principle and moderate deviations estimates for the largest particle $x_\mathrm{max}$ when appropriately rescaled . Our result is an extension of [Ben-Arous, Dembo, Guionnet 2001] and [Pakzad 2020 where such estimates were shown for the largest particle of the $\beta$-ensemble respectively at fixed $\beta_N=\beta&gt;0$ and $\beta_N\gg N^{-1}$. We show that the corresponding rate function is the same as in the case of iid particles. We also provide LD estimates in the Riesz case.
  Additionally, we consider related models of symmetric tridiagonal random matrices with independent entries having Gaussian tails; for which we establish the LD principle for the top eigenvalue. In a certain specialization of the entries, we recover the result for the largest particle of the log-gas. We show that LD are created by a few entries taking abnormally large values.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster algorithms for Potts lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo algorithms, like the Swendsen-Wang and invaded-cluster, sample the Ising and Potts models asymptotically faster than single-spin Glauber dynamics do. Here, we generalize both algorithms to sample Potts lattice gauge theory by way of a $2$-dimensional cellular representation called the plaquette random-cluster model. The invaded-cluster algorithm targets Potts lattice gauge theory at criticality by implementing a stopping condition defined in terms of homological percolation, the emergence of spanning surfaces on the torus. Simulations for $\mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_3$ lattice gauge theories on the cubical $4$-dimensional torus indicate that both generalized algorithms exhibit much faster autocorrelation decay than single-spin dynamics and allow for efficient sampling on $4$-dimensional tori of linear scale at least $40$.</description>

      <title>Eliciting reference measures of law-invariant functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Law-invariant functionals are central to risk management and assign identical values to random prospects sharing the same distribution under an atomless reference probability measure. This measure is typically assumed fixed. Here, we adopt the reverse perspective: given only observed functional values, we aim to either recover the reference measure or identify a candidate measure to test for law invariance when that property is not {\em a priori} satisfied. Our approach is based on a key observation about law-invariant functionals defined on law-invariant domains. These functionals define lower (upper) supporting sets in dual spaces of signed measures, and the suprema (infima) of these supporting sets -- if existent -- are scalar multiples of the reference measure. In specific cases, this observation can be formulated as a sandwich theorem.
  We illustrate the methodology through a detailed analysis of prominent examples: the entropic risk measure, Expected Shortfall, and Value-at-Risk. For the latter, our elicitation procedure initially fails due to the triviality of supporting set extrema. We therefore develop a suitable modification.</description>

      <title>On two fundamental properties of the zeros of spectrograms of noisy signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial distribution of the zeros of the spectrogram is significantly altered when a signal is added to white Gaussian noise. The zeros tend to delineate the support of the signal, and deterministic structures form in the presence of interference, as if the zeros were trapped. While sophisticated methods have been proposed to detect signals as holes in the pattern of spectrogram zeros, few formal arguments have been made to support the delineation and trapping effects. Through detailed computations for simple toy signals, we show that two basic mathematical arguments, the intensity of zeros and Rouch\'e's theorem, allow discussing delineation and trapping, and the influence of parameters like the signal-to-noise ratio. In particular, interfering chirps, even nearly superimposed, yield an easy-to-detect deterministic structure among zeros.</description>

      <title>Well posedness and propagation of chaos for multi-agent models with strategies and diffusive effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multi-agent model for individuals endowed with strategies and subject to diffusive effects is proposed. The microscopic state of each agent is described by a spatial position and a probability measure, interpreted as a mixed strategy, over a compact metric space. The evolution is governed by a non-local interaction mechanism and by stochastic effects acting on the spatial component of the state. The well-posedness of the multi-agent system and that of a certain McKean--Vlasov stochastic differential equation are proved. Eventually, a propagation of chaos result is obtained, which guarantees that the former model converges to the latter as the number of agents goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase transition for the homogeneous multi-component Curie-Weiss-Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the homogeneous multi-component Curie-Weiss-Potts model with $q \geq 3$ spins. The model is defined on the complete graph $K_{Nm}$, whose vertex set is equally partitioned into $m$ components of size $N$. For a configuration $\sigma: \{1, \cdots, Nm\} \to \{1, \cdots, q\},$ the Gibbs measure is defined by $$
  \mu_{N,\beta}(\sigma) =\frac{1}{Z_{N,\beta}} \exp\Big(\frac{\beta}{N} \sum_{v,w=1}^{Nm}\mathcal{J}(v,w)\, \mathbb{1}_{\{\sigma(v)=\sigma(w)\}}\Big), $$ where $Z_{N, \beta}$ is a normalizing constant, and $\beta&gt;0$ is the inverse temperature parameter. The interaction coefficients are $ \mathcal{J}(v, w) = \frac{J}{1 + (m-1) \lambda}$, for $v, w$ in the same component, and $\mathcal{J}(v, w) = \frac{J \lambda}{1 + (m-1)\lambda}$ for $v, w$ in the different components, where $\lambda \in (0, 1)$ is the relative strength of inter-component interaction to intra-component interaction, and $J&gt;0$ is the effective interaction strength. We identify a dynamical phase transition at the critical inverse temperature $\beta_{\operatorname{cr}} = \beta_{s}(q)/J$, where $\beta_{s}(q)$ is maximal inverse temperature guaranteeing a unique critical point of the free energy in the Curie-Weiss-Potts model arXiv:1204.4503. By extending the aggregate path method arXiv:1312.6728 to our multi-component setting, we prove $O(N \log N)$ mixing time in the high-temperature regime $\beta&lt;\beta_{s}(q)/J.$ In the low-temperature regime $\beta &gt; \beta_{s}(q)/J,$ we further show exponential mixing time by a metastability. This is the first result for the dynamical phase transition in the multi-component Potts model.</description>

      <title>Rumour Spreading Depends on the Latent Geometry and Degree Distribution in Social Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study push-pull rumour spreading in ultra-small-world models for social networks where the degrees follow a power-law distribution. In a non-geometric setting, Fountoulakis, Panagiotou and Sauerwald have shown that rumours always spread ultra-fast (SODA 2012), i.e. in doubly logarithmic time. On the other hand, Janssen and Mehrabian have found that rumours spread slowly (polynomial time) in a spatial preferential attachment model (SIDMA 2017). We study the question systematically for the model of Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRGs). Our results are two-fold: first, with Euclidean geometry slow, fast (polylogarithmic) and ultra-fast rumour spreading may occur, depending on the exponent of the power law and the strength of the geometry in the networks, and we fully characterise the phase boundaries in between. The regimes do not coincide with the graph distance regimes, i.e., polylogarithmic or even polynomial rumour spreading may occur even if graph distances are doubly logarithmic. We expect these results to hold with little effort for related models, e.g. Scale-Free Percolation. Second, we show that rumour spreading is always (at least) fast in a non-metric geometry. The considered non-metric geometry allows to model social connections where resemblance of vertices in a single attribute, such as familial kinship, already strongly indicates the presence of an edge. Euclidean geometry fails to capture such ties.
  For some regimes in the Euclidean setting, the efficient pathways for spreading rumours differ from previously identified paths. For example, a vertex of degree $d$ can transmit the rumour to a vertex of larger degree by a chain of length $3$, where one of the two intermediaries has constant degree, and the other has degree $d^{c}$ for some constant $c&lt;1$. Similar but longer chains of vertices, all having non-constant degree, turn out to be useful as well.</description>

Abstract: We obtain ergodic theorems for multiple iterated sums and integrals of the form $\Sigma^{(\nu)}(t)=\sum_{0\leq k_1&lt;...&lt;k_\nu\leq t}\xi(k_1)\otimes\cdots\otimes\xi(k_\nu)$, $t\in[0,T]$ and $\Sigma^{(\nu)}(t)=\int_{0\leq s_1\leq...\leq s_\nu\leq t}\xi(s_1)\otimes\cdots\otimes\xi(s_\nu)ds_1\cdots ds_\nu$ where $\{\xi(k)\}_{-\infty&lt;k&lt;\infty}$ and $\{\xi(s)\}_{-\infty&lt;s&lt;\infty}$ are vector processes for which standard ergodic theorems, i.e. when $\nu=1$, hold true. At the end we prove also a version of the Erd\" os--R\" enyi law of large numbers for iterated sums and integrals.</description>

      <title>Fractional Sobolev processes on Wasserstein spaces and their energy-minimizing particle representations with applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a probability-measure-valued process $(\mu_t)$, we aim to find, among all path-continuous stochastic processes whose one-dimensional time marginals coincide almost surely with $(\mu_t)$ (if there is any), a process that minimizes a given energy in expectation. Building on our recent study (arXiv:2502.12068), where the minimization of fractional Sobolev energy was investigated for deterministic paths on Wasserstein spaces, we now extend the results to the stochastic setting to address some applications that originally motivated our study. Two applications are given. We construct minimizing particle representations for processes on Wasserstein spaces on $\mathbb{R}$ with H\"{o}lder regularity, using optimal transportation. We prove the existence of minimizing particle representations for solutions to stochastic Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations on $\mathbb{R}^\mathrm{d}$ satisfying an integrability condition, using the stochastic superposition principle of Lacker--Shkolnikov--Zhang (J. Eur. Math. Soc. 25, 3229--3288 (2023)).</description>

      <title>Mixing properties of a class of nonuniformly expanding maps. Application to H{\"o}lderian invariance principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the mixing properties of a class of nonuniformly expanding maps when the return time to the basis has a weak moment of order p &gt;1, up to a slowly varying function. From these computations, we deduce an invariance principle in H{\"o}lder spaces for the partial sum process of Birkhoff sums of H{\"o}lder continuous observables. The results apply to a class of intermittent maps of the unit interval. For such a map, we also prove that the H{\"o}lder invariance principle remains true for BV observables.</description>

      <title>Large time cumulants of the KPZ equation on an interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation on the interval $[0,L]$ with Neumann type boundary conditions and boundary parameters $u,v$. We show that the $k$-th order cumulant of the height behaves as $c_k(L,u,v)\, t$ in the large time limit $t \to +\infty$, and we compute the coefficients $c_k(L,u,v)$. We obtain an expression for the upper tail large deviation function of the height. We also consider the limit of large $L$, with $u=\tilde u/\sqrt{L}$, $u=\tilde v/\sqrt{L}$, which should give the same quantities for the two parameter family $(\tilde u, \tilde v)$ KPZ fixed point on the interval. We employ two complementary methods. On the one hand we adapt to the interval the replica Bethe ansatz method pioneered by Brunet and Derrida for the periodic case. On the other hand, we perform a scaling limit using previous results available for the open ASEP. The latter method allows to express the cumulants of the KPZ equation in terms a functional equation involving an integral operator.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Random Sampling via Randomness Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ``Randomness recycling'' is a powerful algorithmic technique for reusing a fraction of the random information consumed by a probabilistic algorithm to reduce its entropy requirements. This article presents a family of randomness recycling algorithms for efficiently sampling a sequence $X_1, X_2, X_3, \dots$ of discrete random variables whose joint distribution follows an arbitrary stochastic process. We develop randomness recycling techniques to reduce the entropy cost of a variety of prominent sampling algorithms, which include uniform sampling, inverse transform sampling, lookup-table sampling, alias sampling, and discrete distribution generating (DDG) tree sampling. Our method achieves an expected amortized entropy cost of $H(X_1,\dots,X_k)/k + \varepsilon$ input bits per output sample using $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ space as $k\to\infty$, which is arbitrarily close to the optimal Shannon entropy rate of $H(X_1,\dots,X_k)/k$ bits per sample. The combination of space, time, and entropy properties of our method improves upon the Knuth and Yao entropy-optimal algorithm and Han and Hoshi interval algorithm for sampling a discrete random sequence.
  On the empirical side, we show that randomness recycling enables state-of-the-art runtime performance on the Fisher-Yates shuffle when using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator; and it can also speed up discrete Gaussian samplers. Accompanying the manuscript is a performant software library in the C programming language that uses randomness recycling to accelerate several existing algorithms for random sampling.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for toral partially hyperbolic endomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under natural assumptions on the observable, we prove a Central Limit Theorem, a Berry-Esseen Theorem, and a quantitative Local Limit Theorem for a broad class of partially hyperbolic endomorphisms of the two-dimensional torus. Our results apply, but are not limited to, skew-products and their perturbations, and they remain valid even when the system admits multiple, though finitely many, absolutely continuous ergodic invariant measures.</description>
