      <title>2DGH: 2D Gaussian-Hermite Splatting for High-quality Rendering and Better Geometry Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as a significant method in 3D reconstruction, enabling novel view synthesis and geometry reconstruction simultaneously. While the well-known Gaussian kernel is broadly used, its lack of anisotropy and deformation ability leads to dim and vague edges at object silhouettes, limiting the reconstruction quality of current Gaussian splatting methods. To enhance the representation power, we draw inspiration from quantum physics and propose to use the Gaussian-Hermite kernel as the new primitive in Gaussian splatting. The new kernel takes a unified mathematical form and extends the Gaussian function, which serves as the zero-rank term in the updated formulation. Our experiments demonstrate the extraordinary performance of Gaussian-Hermite kernel in both geometry reconstruction and novel-view synthesis tasks. The proposed kernel outperforms traditional Gaussian Splatting kernels, showcasing its potential for high-quality 3D reconstruction and rendering.</description>

      <title>RenDetNet: Weakly-supervised Shadow Detection with Shadow Caster Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing shadow detection models struggle to differentiate dark image areas from shadows. In this paper, we tackle this issue by verifying that all detected shadows are real, i.e. they have paired shadow casters. We perform this step in a physically-accurate manner by differentiably re-rendering the scene and observing the changes stemming from carving out estimated shadow casters. Thanks to this approach, the RenDetNet proposed in this paper is the first learning-based shadow detection model whose supervisory signals can be computed in a self-supervised manner. The developed system compares favourably against recent models trained on our data. As part of this publication, we release our code on github.</description>

      <title>Hoop Diagrams: A Set Visualization Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Hoop Diagrams, a new visualization technique for set data. Hoop Diagrams are a circular visualization with hoops representing sets and sectors representing set intersections. We present an interactive tool for drawing Hoop Diagrams and describe a user study comparing them with Linear Diagrams. The results show only small differences, with users answering questions more quickly with Linear Diagrams, but answering some questions more accurately with Hoop Diagrams. Interaction data indicates that those using set order and intersection highlighting were more successful at answering questions, but those who used other interactions had a slower response. The similarity in usability suggests that the diagram type should be chosen based on the presentation method. Linear Diagrams increase in the horizontal direction with the number of intersections, leading to difficulties fitting on a screen. Hoop Diagrams always have a square aspect ratio.</description>

      <title>Frankenstein: Generating Semantic-Compositional 3D Scenes in One Tri-Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Frankenstein, a diffusion-based framework that can generate semantic-compositional 3D scenes in a single pass. Unlike existing methods that output a single, unified 3D shape, Frankenstein simultaneously generates multiple separated shapes, each corresponding to a semantically meaningful part. The 3D scene information is encoded in one single tri-plane tensor, from which multiple Singed Distance Function (SDF) fields can be decoded to represent the compositional shapes. During training, an auto-encoder compresses tri-planes into a latent space, and then the denoising diffusion process is employed to approximate the distribution of the compositional scenes. Frankenstein demonstrates promising results in generating room interiors as well as human avatars with automatically separated parts. The generated scenes facilitate many downstream applications, such as part-wise re-texturing, object rearrangement in the room or avatar cloth re-targeting. Our project page is available at: https://wolfball.github.io/frankenstein/.</description>

      <title>Many-Worlds Inverse Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discontinuous visibility changes remain a major bottleneck when optimizing surfaces within a physically-based inverse renderer. Many previous works have proposed sophisticated algorithms and data structures to sample visibility silhouettes more efficiently.
  Our work presents another solution: instead of differentiating a tentative surface locally, we differentiate a volumetric perturbation of a surface. We refer this as a many-worlds representation because it models a non-interacting superposition of conflicting explanations (worlds) of the input dataset. Each world is optically isolated from others, leading to a new transport law that distinguishes our method from prior work based on exponential random media.
  The resulting Monte Carlo algorithm is simpler and more efficient than prior methods. We demonstrate that our method promotes rapid convergence, both in terms of the total iteration count and the cost per iteration.</description>
