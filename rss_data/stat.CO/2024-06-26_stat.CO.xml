      <title>Scalable Sampling of Truncated Multivariate Normals Using Sequential Nearest-Neighbor Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a linear-complexity method for sampling from truncated multivariate normal (TMVN) distributions with high fidelity by applying nearest-neighbor approximations to a product-of-conditionals decomposition of the TMVN density. To make the sequential sampling based on the decomposition feasible, we introduce a novel method that avoids the intractable high-dimensional TMVN distribution by sampling sequentially from $m$-dimensional TMVN distributions, where $m$ is a tuning parameter controlling the fidelity. This allows us to overcome the existing methods' crucial problem of rapidly decreasing acceptance rates for increasing dimension. Throughout our experiments with up to tens of thousands of dimensions, we can produce high-fidelity samples with $m$ in the dozens, achieving superior scalability compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. We study a tetrachloroethylene concentration dataset that has $3{,}971$ observed responses and $20{,}730$ undetected responses, together modeled as a partially censored Gaussian process, where our method enables posterior inference for the censored responses through sampling a $20{,}730$-dimensional TMVN distribution.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Partial Reduced-Rank Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced-rank (RR) regression may be interpreted as a dimensionality reduction technique able to reveal complex relationships among the data parsimoniously. However, RR regression models typically overlook any potential group structure among the responses by assuming a low-rank structure on the coefficient matrix. To address this limitation, a Bayesian Partial RR (BPRR) regression is exploited, where the response vector and the coefficient matrix are partitioned into low- and full-rank sub-groups. As opposed to the literature, which assumes known group structure and rank, a novel strategy is introduced that treats them as unknown parameters to be estimated. The main contribution is two-fold: an approach to infer the low- and full-rank group memberships from the data is proposed, and then, conditionally on this allocation, the corresponding (reduced) rank is estimated. Both steps are carried out in a Bayesian approach, allowing for full uncertainty quantification and based on a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler. It relies on a Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood and the Metropolized Shotgun Stochastic Search to estimate the group allocation efficiently. Applications to synthetic and real-world data reveal the potential of the proposed method to reveal hidden structures in the data.</description>

      <title>Mask-Guided Attention U-Net for Enhanced Neonatal Brain Extraction and Image Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce MGA-Net, a novel mask-guided attention neural network, which extends the U-net model for precision neonatal brain imaging. MGA-Net is designed to extract the brain from other structures and reconstruct high-quality brain images. The network employs a common encoder and two decoders: one for brain mask extraction and the other for brain region reconstruction. A key feature of MGA-Net is its high-level mask-guided attention module, which leverages features from the brain mask decoder to enhance image reconstruction. To enable the same encoder and decoder to process both MRI and ultrasound (US) images, MGA-Net integrates sinusoidal positional encoding. This encoding assigns distinct positional values to MRI and US images, allowing the model to effectively learn from both modalities. Consequently, features learned from a single modality can aid in learning a modality with less available data, such as US. We extensively validated the proposed MGA-Net on diverse datasets from varied clinical settings and neonatal age groups. The metrics used for assessment included the DICE similarity coefficient, recall, and accuracy for image segmentation; structural similarity for image reconstruction; and root mean squared error for total brain volume estimation from 3D ultrasound images. Our results demonstrate that MGA-Net significantly outperforms traditional methods, offering superior performance in brain extraction and segmentation while achieving high precision in image reconstruction and volumetric analysis. Thus, MGA-Net represents a robust and effective preprocessing tool for MRI and 3D ultrasound images, marking a significant advance in neuroimaging that enhances both research and clinical diagnostics in the neonatal period and beyond.</description>

      <title>Controlling Moments with Kernel Stein Discrepancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05408v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel Stein discrepancies (KSDs) measure the quality of a distributional approximation and can be computed even when the target density has an intractable normalizing constant. Notable applications include the diagnosis of approximate MCMC samplers and goodness-of-fit tests for unnormalized statistical models. The present work analyzes the convergence control properties of KSDs. We first show that standard KSDs used for weak convergence control fail to control moment convergence. To address this limitation, we next provide sufficient conditions under which alternative diffusion KSDs control both moment and weak convergence. As an immediate consequence we develop, for each $q &gt; 0$, the first KSDs known to exactly characterize $q$-Wasserstein convergence.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Look-ahead in Bayesian Optimization: Multilevel Monte Carlo is All you Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We leverage multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) to improve the performance of multi-step look-ahead Bayesian optimization (BO) methods that involve nested expectations and maximizations. Often these expectations must be computed by Monte Carlo (MC). The complexity rate of naive MC degrades for nested operations, whereas MLMC is capable of achieving the canonical MC convergence rate for this type of problem, independently of dimension and without any smoothness assumptions. Our theoretical study focuses on the approximation improvements for twoand three-step look-ahead acquisition functions, but, as we discuss, the approach is generalizable in various ways, including beyond the context of BO. Our findings are verified numerically and the benefits of MLMC for BO are illustrated on several benchmark examples. Code is available at https://github.com/Shangda-Yang/MLMCBO .</description>

      <title>Weighted Particle-Based Optimization for Efficient Generalized Posterior Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of statistical learning, the increasing volume of accessible data and increasing model complexity necessitate robust methodologies. This paper explores two branches of robust Bayesian methods in response to this trend. The first is generalized Bayesian inference, which introduces a learning rate parameter to enhance robustness against model misspecifications. The second is Gibbs posterior inference, which formulates inferential problems using generic loss functions rather than probabilistic models. In such approaches, it is necessary to calibrate the spread of the posterior distribution by selecting a learning rate parameter. The study aims to enhance the generalized posterior calibration (GPC) algorithm proposed by [1]. Their algorithm chooses the learning rate to achieve the nominal frequentist coverage probability, but it is computationally intensive because it requires repeated posterior simulations for bootstrap samples. We propose a more efficient version of the GPC inspired by sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers. A target distribution with a different learning rate is evaluated without posterior simulation as in the reweighting step in SMC sampling. Thus, the proposed algorithm can reach the desirable value within a few iterations. This improvement substantially reduces the computational cost of the GPC. Its efficacy is demonstrated through synthetic and real data applications.</description>
