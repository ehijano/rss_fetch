      <title>A Hilbert Series for Generalized Toric Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hilbert series for $5d$ Superconformal Field Theories (SCFTs) engineered by Generalized Toric Polygons (GTPs), which extend the geometric realization of these theories from toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds to theories associated to general webs of 5- and 7-branes. Smoothed T-cones provide fundamental building blocks of GTP tessellations, generalizing the role of minimal triangles in toric diagrams. Building on this construction, we propose an extension of the Martelli-Sparks-Yau algorithm for computing Hilbert series of toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds that computes the Ehrhart series directly from GTP tessellations. The Ehrhart series is an invariant under Hanany-Witten transitions, which translate geometrically into polytope mutations.</description>

      <title>A Brief Note on Complex AdS-Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of thermodynamics of asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces, it is often stated that at very low temperatures, there is only one saddle point available-namely, thermal AdS-and hence this sole saddle dictates the low-temperature behavior. However, AdS-Schwarzschild black holes continue to exist at low temperatures as complex saddle points. We point out that the real part of the on-shell action of these complex black holes is smaller than that of thermal AdS at the lowest temperatures, in AdS$_5$ and higher dimensions. So, na\"ively, they should be the "dominant" saddles. This raises a puzzle: if these complex black holes were indeed the relevant saddle points, the physics of the bulk and that of the dual gauge theory would completely disagree at low temperatures. Using a mini-superspace approximation and contour arguments, we argue that these complex black holes do not actually contribute to the gravitational path integral, regardless of the value of their on-shell action. So the standard conclusion that thermal AdS is the correct saddle at the lowest temperatures continues to hold. We also comment on two related matters: whether the Kontsevich-Segal criterion is useful in this setting, and whether the unstable small black hole contributes to the path integral in the high-temperature phase.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric lattice theories on curved space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to construct Hamiltonian lattice theories with one exact supersymmetry on arbitrary triangulations of curved space in any number of dimensions. Both bosons and fermions satisfy discrete K\"{a}hler-Dirac equations. The quantization of the fermions proceeds by imposing conventional anti-commutation relations while the bosons require a modification of the usual canonical commutator. On regular lattices we construct parity, time reversal and translation-by-one (shift) symmetries. We argue that the latter are generically non-invertible symmetries. We also show how to couple these degrees of freedom to background gauge fields which leads to a theory with enhanced supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Massive Spinning Fields During Inflation: Feynman rules and correlator comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of massive spinning fields during inflation and the resulting signatures in the cosmological correlators of inflaton perturbations computed in the Poincar\'{e} patch of de Sitter space. There are (at least) two ways to describe the fluctuations of such new spinning degrees of freedom and these are distinguished by the symmetries of the de Sitter group that they linearly realise. The primary question we ask is: do these two set-ups yield distinct signatures in cosmological observables? After systematically deriving the Feynman rules for exchange diagrams consisting of massive spinning fields, where we discover the necessity of \textit{effective propagators} that augment the naive Schwinger-Keldysh ones by delta functions corresponding to instantaneous propagation, we show that the two set-ups are indistinguishable at the level of the inflaton bispectrum but distinguishable at the level of the trispectrum and other higher-point correlation functions. The bispectrum is special since in the corresponding tree-level Feynman diagrams, only the helicity-zero modes of the spinning fields can propagate. The bispectrum correspondence holds up to the addition of contact diagrams arising from the self-interactions of the inflaton, and is consistent with the symmetries of the effective field theory inflation. Our results suggest that the cosmological collider signals in the bispectrum are universal and do not depend on the detailed description of the massive spinning field.</description>

      <title>Resolving BCFT bulk-cone singularities in braneworlds and top-down holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-point functions in BCFTs exhibit characteristic singularities compared to standard CFTs due to reflected light cones. In holographic BCFTs, further singularities, which need not be related to reflected light cones within the BCFT, can arise when the insertion points are connected by bulk null geodesics. The resulting `bulk-cone singularities' are expected to be an artifact of the `t Hooft limit and should be resolved in string theory. In this work we demonstrate the resolution of bulk-cone singularities in braneworld BCFT duals, where bulk-cone singularities arise from geodesics reflected off the end-of-the-world brane. We show that the geometry near the null geodesics is described by a pp-wave of shockwave form and incroporate string theory corrections, which bounds the two-point functions. We extend this discussion to top-down holography for D1/D5 BCFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, Moore and Singh used the theory of orbifold vertex operator algebras to explicitly construct an $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supercurrent in the Beauty and the Beast module of Dixon, Ginsparg, and Harvey. Using their techniques, we show that $\mathcal{N} = 1$ superconformal symmetry exists in all VOAs constructed as spin lifts of canonical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifolds of Niemeier lattice VOAs.</description>

      <title>Soft Unification of Exceptional EFTs in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover a surprising universal soft behaviour (USB) of a de Sitter (dS) S-matrix for \textit{all} exceptional effective field theories (EFTs) in dS space, stemming from the recently proposed generalised energy conservation (GEC) condition. At leading order in the soft limit, the dS S-matrices for all exceptional EFTs exhibit no scaling with the soft momentum, i.e. $\lim_{k\rightarrow 0}\mathcal{A}(k)\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$, a feature we term USB. We specifically show that USB fixes the four-point amplitudes in Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) theory and Special Galileon, and six-point amplitude in $SU(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) given the minimal derivative count. We then conjecture USB fixes the interactions of all exceptional EFTs to all orders, thereby providing a unification criterion for them. Our result further underpins the idea that $\Delta\geq 4$ exceptional theories in dS are characterised by the spectrum and stability requirement alone, resonating with the low energy theory of gravity--General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Extracting Edge Modes: Reduction of 3D and 2D Gravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the boundary reduction of 3D Einstein gravity and JT gravity into their respective edge mode theories - namely, the Liouville and Alekseev-Shatashvili, and Schwarzian models. By examining the roles of boundary conditions, canonical transformations, and differing formulations - metric versus Chern-Simons - we clarify how physical degrees of freedom become localized at the boundary and resolve several long-standing ambiguities in the reduction procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new plane-wave expansion of the Wightman functions of anti de Sitter scalar fields and showcase its conceptual and technical importance in AdS quantum field theory. We deduce from it a new integral representation of the Feynman propagator which helps in clarifying the relation between AdS Euclidean and Lorentzian Feynman diagrams in concrete examples. The plane-wave expansion makes it possible also to demonstrate numerous new nontrivial formulas for Bessel and Legendre functions, and we provide two examples.</description>

      <title>The Internal Structure of the Deconstructed Dirac Monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study the internal structure of the Dirac magnetic monopole in a deconstructed $U(1)$ gauge theory. The deconstructed $U(1)$ gauge theory has a product $U(1)^N$ gauge group, which breaks down to the diagonal $U(1)_{\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group. A linear superposition of the Dirac monopoles each from each $U(1)$ gauge group placed on top of each other in the 3D space constitutes a Dirac monopole with a unit magnetic charge under the unbroken $U(1)_{\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group. However, the Dirac monopole in each $U(1)$ gauge group has a fractional magnetic charge of the unbroken $U(1)_{\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group with the same sign, which makes these ``constituent'' Dirac monopoles repel each other. Therefore, for the ``composite'' Dirac monopole of the $U(1)_{\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group to be stable, there must be attractive forces that counter the repulsive magnetic Coulomb forces. I argue that such attractive forces are provided by the Nielsen-Olesen type magnetic flux tubes of unbroken gauge groups. This internal structure of the composite Dirac monopole of $U(1)_{\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group resembles the composite magnetic monopole found in the model constructed by Saraswat arXiv:1608.06951. I estimate the size of the Dirac monopole in $U(1)_{\mathrm{diag}}$ gauge group from the balance between the magnetic Coulomb forces and the forces from the tension of the magnetic flux tubes. Implications of the results for the Weak Gravity Conjecture are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Fixed points of classical gravity coupled with a Standard-Model-like theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling quantum field theory (QFT) \!-\! even free QFT \!-\! to gravity leads to well-known problems. In particular, the stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ (gravity's source) and its correlators typically diverge in the UV, creating a conflict between the wildly inhomogeneous spacetime we expect quantum mechanically and the weakly-curved, macroscopic spacetime we observe. Are there QFTs for which these divergences cancel? Here, for simplicity, we consider free quantum fields on a classical curved background. The aforementioned divergences are related to the running of the gravitational couplings. We calculate the corresponding beta functions, identifying a special class of QFTs with UV fixed points at which $\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle$ and all its correlators $\langle T\ldots T\rangle$ are UV finite. An intriguing example is a theory like the Standard Model (including right-handed neutrinos) with $12$ gauge fields, $3$ generations of $16$ Weyl fermions and $36$ four-derivative (Fradkin-Tseytlin) scalars. In the infrared, this theory has a positive Newton's constant $G$ and an arbitrarily small cosmological constant $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric truncation of N=3 dilaton Weyl multiplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a supersymmetric truncation of the N=3 dilaton Weyl multiplet with an R-symmetry $SU(2) \times U(1) \times U(1)$, to obtain a 32+32 off-shell representation of N=2 conformal supergravity. Independently, we construct another 32+32 off-shell multiplet in N=2 conformal supergravity by coupling the N=2 scalar-tensor multiplet to the N=2 standard Weyl multiplet. We then establish the equivalence between these two multiplets through a mapping. We observe that this multiplet is gauge equivalent to a Poincar\'e supergravity multiplet as it has all the compensators necessary to go from conformal supergravity to Poincar\'e supergravity.</description>

      <title>On Lagrangian formulations for (ir)reducible mixed-antisymmetric higher integer spin fields in Minkowski spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the results of Lagrangian formulations study to construct gauge-invariant Lagrangians for (ir)reducible integer higher-spin massless and massive representations of the Poincare group with a Young tableau $Y[\hat{s}_1,\hat{s}_2,\hat{s}_3]$ in $d$-dimensional flat space-time (as the probable candidates to describe the Dark Matter problem beyond the SM). These particles are described within a metric-like formulation by tensor fields with 3 groups of antisymmetric Lorentz indices $\Phi_{\mu^1[{\hat{s}_1}],\mu^2[{\hat{s}_2}], \mu^3[{\hat{s}_3}]}$ on a basis of the
  BRST method with complete, $Q$, and incomplete, $Q_c$, BRST operators. We found unconstrained (with $Q$) and constrained (with $Q_c$ and off-shell BRST invariant holonomic constraints) gauge Lagrangian formulations with different configuration spaces and reducibility stages. The deformation procedure to construct interacting gauge model with mixed-antisymmetric fields is proposed.</description>

      <title>Zeroth law of black hole thermodynamics for higher derivative Proca theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the constancy of surface gravity across a Killing horizon (not necessarily of bifurcate type) in arbitrary higher curvature theories of gravity coupled to Proca fields $-$ vector fields lacking $U(1)$ gauge invariance $-$ thus generalizing the zeroth law to this broader class of theories. This is achieved within the framework of effective field theory, where higher curvature contributions are treated perturbatively around the leading two derivative theory. The result holds to arbitrary order in the effective field theory expansion. The proof is based on boost-weight arguments; implementing these arguments in the presence of a Proca field introduces subtleties beyond those encountered in the pure-gravity case, which we address here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we examine in more detail the perturbative map between late-time correlators in de Sitter space and boundary correlators in Euclidean anti-de Sitter space, elaborating on the general construction presented in arXiv:2007.09993 and arXiv:2109.02725 for EFTs of bosonic spinning fields by treating explicitly the cases of gauge bosons and gravitons. In these cases, additional technical subtleties arise from the treatment of massless representations of the de Sitter isometry group in even boundary dimensions, which we clarify in this work. Finally, we emphasise that the relation between dS and EAdS perturbation theory is manifest in Mellin space. These results provide a streamlined framework for the study of cosmological correlators involving spinning fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Snyder space-time and its generalizations, including Yang and Snyder-de-Sitter spaces, which constitute manifestly Lorenz invariant noncommutative geometries. This work initiates a systematic study of gauge theory on such spaces in the semi-classical regime, formulated as Poisson gauge theory. As a first step, we construct the symplectic realization of the relevant noncommutative spaces, a prerequisite for defining Poisson gauge transformations and field strengths. We present a general method for representing the Snyder algebra and its extensions in terms of canonical phase space variables, enabling both the reproduction of known representations and the derivation of novel ones. These canonical constructions are employed to obtain explicit symplectic realizations for the Snyder-de-Sitter space and construct the deformed partial derivative which differentiates the underlying Poisson structure. Furthermore, we analyze the motion of freely falling particles in these backgrounds and comment on the geometry of the associated spaces.</description>

      <title>Self-dual monopole loops, instantons and confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the standard instanton analysis in 4d Yang-Mills is plagued with the instanton size moduli problem, which renders the instanton contribution to vacuum energy density (or one-instanton partition function) infrared divergent. The formalism also ignores the implications of long range (magnetic dipole type) $1/r^4$ interaction between the small instantons, since it is weaker than Coulomb interaction. We show that in $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, where finite action configurations are monopole loops, small loops at large separations also interact with the same type of $1/r^4$ interaction. If one ignores the classical interactions between monopoles, following the same idea as in Yang-Mills theory, the one-monopole partition function is also infrared divergent at strong coupling. However, $1/r^4$ interactions among small loops should be viewed as a consequence of multipole expansion, and emanate from $1/r^2$ interaction between current segments. Taking interactions into account, one can prove that the strongly coupled $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory is dual to a lattice abelian Higgs model, and more importantly, free of infrared divergences. The model exhibits mass gap and confinement by monopole condensation. We suggest that the structure of moduli space of instantons, ADHM data, and the long ranged classical interactions in pure Yang-Mills theory should be examined with this refined perspective. We conjecture that, in contradistinction to the current views on the subject, internal structure of instantons in Yang-Mills theory is responsible for confinement in $4d$ , similar to sigma model in $d=2$ dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a constructive method to maximize the expectation value of operators that implement a symmetry on a subsystem, making use of modular tools. More generally, we study the positive cones associated with a von Neumann algebra, as defined by Araki. Given a reference vector, an algebra, and a state on the algebra, the purification of the state in the cone $\alpha = 0$, associated with the reference vector and the algebra, yields the unique vector whose overlap with the reference vector is maximal among all possible purifications. This establishes that the supremum in Uhlmann's theorem is uniquely attained by this vector, thereby providing the fidelity between the given state and the state obtained by restricting the reference vector to the algebra. Moreover, this purification can be explicitly constructed using modular tools. In addition, given an automorphism of the algebra, we show how to construct isometries implementing the automorphism using the positive cones. We prove that the isometry constructed from the cone $\alpha = 0$ is the one with maximal expectation value among all possible isometries implementing the automorphism. We illustrate these ideas with two simple examples: one involving a system of two spins, and the other in the theory of the massless scalar field in 3+1 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Scalar quasinormal modes of magnetically charged black holes in a quintessence field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum for scalar perturbations of static, magnetically charged black holes in the presence of a quintessence field. The background geometry is obtained from the Einstein-Power-Maxwell action with a Kiselev-type contribution for quintessence. The associated master wave equation is solved using complementary numerical approaches, including high-order WKB expansions, the asymptotic iteration method, and time-domain integration, with cross-validation to ensure accuracy. The results show that magnetic charge generally lowers the oscillation frequency of fundamental modes, while the quintessence parameter modifies damping timescales. A dedicated analysis of the metric's derivation confirms the correct form of the magnetic charge term. We explore a theoretical parameter space to understand the mathematical behavior of the solution, including extreme regimes not intended to represent astrophysical realities. The computed scalar field spectra provide a foundational study for future work on gravitational perturbations. All numerical data and codes are provided to ensure reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and experimental basis for excluding Einstein-Cartan theory within the USMEG-EFT framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The USMEG-EFT framework~\cite{ChishtieEFT2025,ChishtieBreakdown2023} provides systematic quantum gravity through with 4D General Relativity (GR) achieving Standard Model-gravity unification. This work examines Einstein-Cartan theory against McKeon et al.'s claims~\cite{BrandtFrenkelMcKeon2024,McKeonBrandtFrenkel2025} regarding its viability for unification. McKeon et al.'s 2024 analysis omitted key interaction terms, missing Einstein-Cartan's central content. Their 2025 claim that unification requires Einstein-Cartan is incorrect. When fermions are included, Einstein-Cartan generates non-renormalizable four-fermion interactions producing catastrophic quartic divergences $\sim \kappa^4\Lambda^4$. Precision experiments exclude the theory: MICROSCOPE constrains equivalence principle violations at $10^{-15}$ while Einstein-Cartan predicts $10^{-12}$ effects. In contrast to these claims, the USMEG-EFT framework achieves unification using standard 4D GR through constraints, producing finite results with calculable coefficients while remaining experimentally compatible.</description>

      <title>Emanant and emergent symmetry-topological-order from low-energy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy emergent and emanant symmetries can be anomalous, higher-group, or non-invertible. Such symmetries are systematically captured by topological orders in one higher dimension, known as symmetry topological orders (symTOs). Consequently, identifying the emergent or emanant symmetry of a system is not simply a matter of determining its group structure, but rather of computing the corresponding symTO. In this work, we develop a method to compute the symTO of 1+1D systems by analyzing their low-energy spectra under closed boundary conditions with all possible symmetry twists. Applying this approach, we show that the gapless antiferromagnetic (AF) spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model possesses an exact emanant symTO corresponding to the $D_8$ quantum double, when restricted to the $\mathbb{Z}_2^x \times \mathbb{Z}_2^z$ subgroup of the $SO(3)$ spin-rotation symmetry and lattice translations. Moreover, the AF phase exhibits an emergent $SO(4)$ symmetry, whose exact components are described jointly by the symTO and the $SO(3)$ spin-rotations. Using condensable algebras in symTO, we further identify several neighboring phases accessible by modifying interactions among low-energy excitations: (1) a gapped dimer phase, connected to the AF phase via an $SO(4)$ rotation, (2) a commensurate collinear ferromagnetic phase that breaks translation by one site with a $\omega \sim k^2$ mode, (3) an incommensurate, translation-symmetric ferromagnetic phase featuring both $\omega \sim k^2$ and $\omega \sim k$ modes, connected to the previous phase by an $SO(4)$ rotation, and (4) an incommensurate ferromagnetic phase that breaks translation by one site with both $\omega \sim k^2$ and $\omega \sim k$ modes.</description>

      <title>Renormalon-based resummation for spacelike and timelike QCD quantities whose perturbation expansion has general form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generalisation of our previous approach of a renormalon-motivated resummation of the QCD observables. Previously it was applied to the spacelike observables whose perturbation expansion was $D(Q^2) = a(Q^2) + O(a^2)$, where $a(Q^2) \equiv \alpha_s(Q^2)/\pi$ is the running QCD coupling. Now we generalise the resummation to spacelike quantities $D(Q^2) = a(Q^2)^{\nu_0} + O(a^{\nu_0+1})$ and timelike quantities $F(\sigma) = a(\sigma)^{\nu_0} + O(a^{\nu_0+1})$, where $\nu_0$ is in general a noninteger number ($0&lt;\nu_0 \leq 1$). We evaluate with this approach a timelike quantity, namely the scheme-invariant factor of the Wilson coefficient of the chromomagnetic operator in the heavy-quark effective Lagrangian, and related quantities.</description>

      <title>Reionization optical depth and CMB-BAO tension in punctuated inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the standard six-parameter Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, a $2$-$3\sigma$ tension persists between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although this tension has often been interpreted as evidence for dynamical dark energy or a sum of neutrino masses below the established minimum, recent studies suggest it may instead originate from an underestimation of the reionization optical depth, particularly when inferred from large-scale CMB polarization. Jhaveri et al. propose that a suppression of large-scale primordial curvature power could partially cancel the contribution of $\tau$ to the CMB low-$\ell$ polarization power spectrum, leading to a biased low $\tau$ measurement in standard analyses. In this work, we investigate whether punctuated inflation - which generates a suppression of primordial power on large scales through a transient fast-roll phase - can raise the inferred $\tau$ value and thereby reconcile the consistency between CMB and BAO. For simple models with step-like features in the inflaton potential, we find that the constraint on $\tau$ and the CMB-BAO tension remain nearly identical to those in the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. We provide a physical explanation for this negative result.</description>

      <title>Matrix product state classification of 1D multipole symmetry protected topological phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially modulated symmetries are one of the new types of symmetries whose symmetry actions are position dependent. Yet exotic phases resulting from these spatially modulated symmetries are not fully understood and classified. In this work, we systematically classify one dimensional bosonic symmetry protected topological phases protected respecting multipole symmetries by employing matrix product state formalism. The symmetry action induces projective representations at the ends of an open chain, which we identify via group cohomology. In particular, for $r$-pole symmetries, for instance, $r$ = 0 (global), 1 (dipole), and 2 (quadrupole), the classification is determined by distinct components of second cohomology groups that encode the boundary projective representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological dynamics and predictions in the theory of warped massive gravity. This set-up postulates a five-dimensional ghost-free massive graviton with a brane-localized four-dimensional massive gravity potential, and has the virtue of raising the strong-coupling scale of the 4D theory. We identify two classes of models that lead to decoupled equations for the scale factor on the brane: one characterized by a particular choice of boundary conditions for the St\"uckelberg fields and one characterized by a special tuning between the coefficients of the 5D and 4D potentials. In the first case, we find interesting solutions including a cosmological bounce without the need of exotic matter. The second case leads to a modified Friedmann equation, and comparison with data shows the potential of the model to alleviate the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parke-Taylor functions are certain rational functions on the Grassmannian of lines encoding MHV amplitudes in particle physics. For $n$ particles there are $n!$ Parke-Taylor functions, corresponding to all orderings of the particles. Linear relations between these functions have been extensively studied in the last years. We here describe all non-linear polynomial relations between these functions in a simple combinatorial way and study the variety parametrized by them, called the Parke-Taylor variety. We show that the Parke-Taylor variety is linearly isomorphic to the log canonical embedding of the moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$ due to Keel and Tevelev, and that the intersection with the algebraic torus recovers the open part, $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$. We give an explicit description of this isomorphism. Unlike the log canonical embedding, this Parke-Taylor embedding respects the symmetry of the $n$ marked points and is constructed in a single-step procedure, avoiding the intermediate embedding into a product of projective spaces.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in hyperbolic spaces: Regular hyperbolic lattices and Ginzburg-Landau theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $s$-wave superconductivity in hyperbolic spaces using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory for discrete hyperbolic lattices and the Ginzburg-Landau theory for the continuous hyperbolic plane. Hyperbolic lattices maintain a finite fraction of boundary sites regardless of system size, thus fundamentally altering superconductivity through enhanced boundary effects absent in flat space. Within the BCS framework for hyperbolic lattices, uniform systems reproduce standard bulk behavior, whereas finite systems with open boundaries, studied through exact diagonalization and Cayley-tree approximations, exhibit boundary-enhanced superconductivity and boundary-only superconducting states that persist above the bulk critical temperature. Numerical studies further reveal that boundary termination critically determines superconducting properties; in particular, rough boundaries with dangling bonds generate zero-energy modes that raise critical temperatures by several times relative to smooth boundaries. Turning to the complementary Ginzburg-Landau analysis of the hyperbolic plane, we find that finite geometries permit radial variations of the condensate absent in infinite space. Owing to the interplay between coherence length and curvature radius, the theory exhibits two types of superconductivity even without magnetic fields, with vortices replaced by lines of vanishing order parameter in the nontrivial type. Our findings establish hyperbolic geometry as a platform for engineering boundary-controlled superconductivity, opening new directions for physics in curved spaces in condensed matter and holography.</description>

Abstract: We investigate neutron stars with nonlinear magnetic monopoles in the framework of the Einstein-nonlinear electrodynamics model, specifically within the Bardeen and Hayward models. Solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for three different equations of state, we find that upon reaching the critical magnetic charge $q_{c}$, neutron stars enter frozen states characterized by the critical horizon. This extends the concept of frozen states to compact objects composed of ordinary matter (non-field matter), thereby offering a new perspective for related research.</description>

Abstract: As in the gravitational context, one of the most challenging open question in analogue black holes formed in Bose-Einstein condensates concerns the backreaction of Hawking-like radiation on the condensate and its subsequent evolution. In this work we derive the basic equations describing this backreaction within the density-phase formalism, which avoids infrared divergences and is particularly well suited to one-dimensional configurations.</description>

      <title>Casimir scaling in glueballs in SU($N$) and Sp($2N$) gauge theories: hints from constituent approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the lattice glueball masses $M_G$ versus $N$ in SU($N$) and Sp($2N$) Yang-Mills theories scale as $\frac{M_G}{\sqrt\sigma}\sim \sqrt{\frac{C_2(adj)}{C_2(f)}}$, with $\sigma$ the fundamental string tension and $C_2(adj)$ and $C_2(f)$ the quadratic Casimir of the gauge algebra in the adjoint and fundamental representations. This scaling behaviour is followed by the great majority of available lattice glueball states, and may set constraints on $SU(3)$ models by imposing a specific behaviour at $N\neq 3$. The observed scaling is compatible with two assumptions: (1) The glueball masses are proportional to the square root of the adjoint string tension, $M_G\sim \sqrt\sigma_{adj}$; (2) The string tension follows the Casimir scaling, i.e. $\sigma_{adj}=\frac{C_2(adj)}{C_2(f)}\sigma$. In a constituent gluon picture, our results suggest a low-lying glueball spectrum made of two transverse constituent gluons bound by an adjoint string, completed by three transverse constituent gluons bound by a Y-junction of adjoint strings rather than a $\Delta-$shaped junction of fundamental strings.</description>

      <title>Trispectrum in Extended USR Model with Transition to SR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the trispectrum in a two-phase USR-SR setup of inflation in which the USR stage is extended in the initial phase of inflation while the second stage of inflation proceeds via a slow-roll phase. A key role is played by the sharpness parameter which controls how quickly the system reaches the final attractor phase after the USR stage. We employ both $\delta N$ and in-in formalisms and calculate trispectrum and the corresponding dimensionless parameters $g_{NL}$ and $\tau_{NL}$. We show that both approaches yield the same results and study the shapes of trispectrum in various configurations. It is shown that the maximum value of trispectrum occurs in the setup with an infinitely sharp transition to the attractor phase while much of trispectrum is washed out in the opposite limit of a mild transition.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-Weak Symmetry Breaking Phases in Steady States of Quantum Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed states can exhibit two distinct kinds of symmetries, either on the level of the individual states (strong symmetry), or only on the level of the ensemble (weak symmetry). Strong symmetries can be spontaneously broken down to weak ones, a mechanism referred to as Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SW-SSB). In this work, we first show that maximally mixed symmetric density matrices, which appear, for example, as steady states of symmetric random quantum circuits have SW-SSB when the symmetry is an on-site representation of a compact Lie or finite group. We then show that this can be regarded as an isolated point within an entire SW-SSB phase that is stable to more general quantum operations such as measurements followed by weak postselection. With sufficiently strong postselection, a second-order transition can be driven to a phase where the steady state is strongly symmetric. We provide analytical and numerical results for such SW-SSB phases and their transitions for both abelian $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and non-abelian $S_3$ symmetries in the steady state of Brownian random quantum circuits with measurements. We also show that such continuous SW-SSB transitions are absent in the steady-state of general strongly symmetric, trace-preserving quantum channels (including unital, Brownian, or Lindbladian dynamics) by analyzing the degeneracies of the steady states in the presence of symmetries. Our results demonstrate robust SW-SSB phases and their transitions in the steady states of noisy quantum operations, and provide a framework for realizing various kinds of mixed-state quantum phases based on their symmetries.</description>

      <title>Modular invariance groups and defect McKay-Thompson series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been known since 1992 that the McKay-Thompson series $T_g(q)$ of the Moonshine module form Hauptmoduln for genus zero subgroups of $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$. In 2021, Lin and Shao constructed a series analogous to the McKay-Thompson series (a twined partition function of the Monster CFT), but using a non-invertible topological defect rather than an element of the Monster group $\mathcal{M}$. This "defect McKay-Thompson series" was found to be invariant under a genus zero subgroup of $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$, but was shown not to be the Hauptmodul of the subgroup. Nevertheless, one might wonder if a weaker version of Borcherds' theorem holds for non-invertible defects: perhaps defect McKay-Thompson series enjoy genus zero invariance groups in $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$, whether or not they are Hauptmoduln for those groups. Using the decompositions of the monster stress tensor found in Bae et al. (2021), we construct several new defect McKay-Thompson series, study their modular properties, and determine their invariance groups in $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$. We discover that many of the invariance groups are not genus zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we approach certain black hole issues, including remnants, by providing a statistical description based on the weak gravity conjecture in the swampland program. Inspired by the Pauli exclusion principle in the context of the Fermi sphere, we derive an inequality which can be exploited to verify the instability manifestation of non-supersymmetric four dimensional black holes via a characteristic function. For several species, we show that this function is in agreement with the weak gravity swampland conjecture. Then, we deal with the cutoff issue as an interval estimation problem by putting an upper bound on the black hole mass scale matching with certain results reported in the literature. Using the developed formalism for the proposed instability scenarios, we provide a suppression mechanism to the remnant production rate. Furthermore, we reconsider the stability study of the Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. Among others, we show that the proposed instabilities prohibit naked singularity behaviors</description>

      <title>Unitary Rigid Supersymmetry for the Chiral Graviton and Chiral Gravitino in de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that a unitary supersymmetric quantum field theory (QFT) involving graviton and gravitino fields on fixed 4-dimensional de Sitter spacetime ($dS_{4}$) cannot exist due to known challenges associated with supersymmetry (SUSY) in $dS_{4}$. In this paper, we contradict this expectation by presenting a new unitary supersymmetric QFT on $dS_{4}$: the free supersymmetric theory of the chiral graviton and chiral gravitino fields. By chiral, we mean that the corresponding field strengths are anti-self-dual, and the gauge potentials are complex, each carrying a single complex propagating degree of freedom. The global SUSY transformations are generated by the standard Dirac Killing spinors of $dS_{4}$. The theory overcomes the known obstacles to unitary global SUSY on $dS_{4}$ by closing the commutator between two SUSY transformations on $so(4,2) \oplus u(1)$ rather than the de Sitter algebra $so(4,1)$. Crucially, the $so(4,2)$ symmetry is realised through unconventional conformal-like transformations. This free theory cannot become interacting while preserving SUSY in a way that makes the spin-2 sector the true graviton sector of General Relativity, as the three-graviton coupling cannot be $u(1)$-invariant. We establish the unitarity of the free supersymmetric theory in two complementary ways. First, by studying the action of the superalgebra generators on the space of physical gravitino and graviton mode solutions. Second, by quantising the fields and explicitly constructing the complex quantum supercharges $Q_{A}$ and $Q^{A\dagger}$, we show that the trace $\sum_{A} \{ Q_{A}, Q^{A \dagger} \}$ is positive-definite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a topological quantum field theory based on the moduli space of $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-instantons on 8-dimensional manifolds. Using the Mathai-Quillen formalism, we derive the action of the theory in purely geometric terms, which coincides with prior results in the literature. We then reformulate the theory within the AKSZ formalism, obtaining a Batalin-Vilkovisky action that, after gauge fixing, matches our Mathai-Quillen construction while making the BRST symmetry explicit and providing a natural framework for classical observables. We also show that the Batalin-Vilkovisky action can be elegantly recast as a Chern-Simons type theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a systematic formalism to evaluate the upper bound of a large family of holographic entanglement entropy combinations when fixing $n$ subsystems and fine-tuning one other subsystem. The upper bound configurations and values of these entropy combinations can be derived and classified. The upper bound of these entropy combinations reveals holographic $n+1$-partite entanglement that $n$ fixed subsystems participate in. In AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$, and even higher-dimensional holography, one can, in principle, find different formulas of upper bound values, reflecting the fundamental difference in entanglement structure in different dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We present a family of matrix models such that their partition functions are tau functions of the universal character (UC) hierarchy. This develops one of the topics of our previous paper arXiv:2410.14823. We found new matrix models associated with the product of two spheres with embedded graphs via a gluing matrix. We also generalize these studies to multi-matrix models case, which corresponds to the multi-component UC hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Localized Towers on the Composite Magnetic Monopole and the Weak Gravity Conjecture$=$Distance Conjecture Connection in Effective Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the energy spectrum of the composite magnetic monopole (CMM) in the model originally constructed in arXiv:1608.06951 to examine how the applicability of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) propagates to lower energy scales in the effective field theory (EFT) framework. This is motivated by the WGC$=$distance conjecture (DC) connection suggested in the literature. Assuming that the limits of the model parameters correspond to the boundaries of the moduli space in a UV theory, we showed that the parameter dependence of the energy spectrum of the CMM is broadly in accord with the prediction of the WGC$=$DC connection. However, unlike the original DC, the low-energy excitations of the CMM are localized on the CMM. This leads us to propose an extension of the DC to include the localized tower of excited states. We discuss the implications of this extension of the DC to the swampland constraints on EFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of framing in a family of 1/24 BPS Wilson loops in ABJ(M) theory, which define flows between 1/6 BPS and the 1/2 BPS superconformal fixed points. We analyze in perturbation theory how framing affects both the expectation values of these operators and the correlation functions of local insertions on the defect, as well as its interplay with RG flow and the g-theorem. We obtain a non-trivial identity between the one-point function of the defect stress tensor and a Q-exact correlator, which establishes a direct link between scale invariance, superconformal invariance and framing, and clarifies the deep connection between scale and cohomological anomalies. Finally, we propose a holographic interpretation of framing at strong coupling, identifying it with a coupling to the background B-field in the dual string theory.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Asymmetry and Quantum Mpemba Effect for Non-Abelian Global Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure that quantifies the degree of symmetry breaking at the level of a subsystem. In this work, we investigate the entanglement asymmetry in $\widehat{su}(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and discuss the quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry, the phenomenon that the more symmetry is initially broken, the faster it is restored. Due to the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem, we consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global symmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary operators in the fundamental and adjoint representations. In both cases, we study the real-time dynamics of the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetry and provide clear evidence of quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry. Furthermore, we find a new type of quantum Mpemba effect for the primary operator in the fundamental representation: increasing the rank $N$ leads to stronger initial symmetry breaking but faster symmetry restoration. Also, increasing the level $k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration. On the other hand, no such behavior is observed for adjoint case, which may suggest that this new type of quantum Mpemba effect is not universal.</description>

      <title>Higgs Field as Architect of a Geodesically Complete Universe and Agent for New Physics in Interiors of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Higgs boson is often compared to a small ripple on a vast, calm ocean. This "ocean" is the universal Higgs vacuum expectation value, about 246 GeV, permeating all space and generating particle masses. Its remarkable uniformity reflects the large-scale nature of the universe. Here I argue that the Higgs field plays a far deeper role. In regions of extreme gravity near singularities, it becomes a non-perturbative, space-time-dependent field that creates new space-time domains beyond gravitational singularities -- new regions governed by antigravity. This mechanism produces dramatic dynamics inside black holes and in the earliest universe, including restoration of the electroweak symmetry SU(2)xU(1) at singularities. The adjoining gravity and antigravity regions form a geodesically complete space-time bridged by traversable singularities -- absent in the Standard Model coupled to general relativity or its extensions such as string theory. In such a framework, the black hole information paradox admits a new, manifestly unitary resolution. Details of computations are developed in the companion paper [1]; here, only a brief outline is given.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Self-Correcting Quantum Memory and Single-shot Non-Clifford Gate beyond the $n^{1/3}$ Distance Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11719v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding, including Borromean ring type braiding which is a signature of non-Abelian topological order, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in (2+1)D. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in (5+1)D with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We prove the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probabilistic local cellular-automaton decoder. We also construct fault-tolerant non-Clifford CCZ logical gate using constant depth circuit from higher cup products in the 5D non-Abelian code. The use of higher-cup products and non-Pauli stabilizers allows us to get an $O(n^{2/5})$ distance overcoming the $O(n^{1/3})$ distance barrier in conventional topological stabilizer codes, including the 3D color code and the 6D self-correcting color code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This document, written by early career researchers (ECRs) in particle physics, aims to represent the perspectives of the European ECR community and serves as input for the 2025--2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics. With input from a community-wide survey, it highlights key challenges faced by ECRs -- career stability, funding access and long-term research opportunities -- while proposing policy recommendations and targeted initiatives. It underscores the importance of practices fostering diverse, equitable, inclusive and healthy workplaces, as well as of stronger ECR communities, and highlights how effective communication and interdisciplinary collaborations reinforce the societal relevance of particle physics and promote continued support for large-scale and long-term projects. Finally, the future of both collider and beyond-collider experiments is addressed, emphasising the critical role of ECRs in shaping future projects. The ECR contribution is formed of two parts: the ten-page executive summary submitted as input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update and, as backup document, this extended white paper providing additional context.</description>

      <title>Radiative transition of an atom falling into spherically symmetric Lorentz violating black hole background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the intriguing phenomenon of acceleration radiation exhibited by an atom falling into a black hole, as previously studied in Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 071301 (2018) . Our investigation focuses on examining the impact of Lorentz violation within the framework of the bumblebee gravity model on this phenomenon. We observe that the excitation probability although acquires Planck-like factor the exponential part of it acquires the Lorentz violation factor dependent frequency. However, equivalence principle is not violated. Then we calculate the horizon brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy for this black hole geometry. We observed that the HBAR entropy has the form similar to that of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy however it has been observed that it is also influenced by Lorentz violation associated to the Bumblebee theory. Additionally, we note that the Lorentz violation effect and conformal symmetry both affect the transition probabilities of a two-level atomic detector.</description>

      <title>Do QGP Droplets Drive Anisotropy in Small Systems? Insights from RHIC and the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy scaling functions for identified mesons and baryons are analyzed in large (Pb+Pb at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ and 5.02 TeV, Au+Au at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV), intermediate (Cu+Cu at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$~GeV), and small (p+Pb at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ and 8.16 TeV, p+Au, d+Au, and $^3$He+Au at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV) collision systems. The scaling functions' fidelity supports a hydrodynamic-like origin for anisotropies in the flow-dominated regime. Central Pb+Pb, Au+Au, and Cu+Cu reflect QGP-driven expansion with strong radial flow and significant jet quenching, while peripheral Pb+Pb and Cu+Cu exhibit hadronic-dominated dynamics. In contrast, central RHIC small systems show hadronic-dominated behavior, with strong re-scattering, negligible radial flow, and suppressed jet quenching, following the hierarchy p+Au $&gt;$ d+Au $&gt;$ $^3$He+Au. At the LHC, ultra-central p+Pb collisions display enhanced radial flow, reduced re-scattering, and small but nonzero jet quenching. Scaling violations at high $p_T$ reflect partial suppression of partonic energy loss. These findings demonstrate that QGP-like behavior in small systems depends sensitively on both system size and beam energy, and establish the scaling framework as a robust diagnostic of collectivity and medium properties across diverse collision conditions.</description>

      <title>Mutual Influence of Symmetries and Topological Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how the fusion 2-category symmetry of a fermionic (2+1)d QFT can be affected when one allows for stacking with TQFTs to be an equivalence relation for QFTs. Focusing on a simple kind of fermionic fusion 2-category described purely by group theoretical data, our results reveal that by allowing for stacking with $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_1$ as an equivalence relation enables a finite set of inequivalent modifications to the original fusion 2-categorical-symmetry. To put our results in a broader context, we relate the order of the symmetry modifications to the image of a map between groups of minimal nondegenerate extensions, and to the tangential structure set by the initial categorical symmetry on the background manifold for the QFT.</description>

      <title>On multi-propagator angular integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multi-propagator angular integrals, a class of phase-space integrals relevant to processes with multiple observed final states and a test-bed for transferring loop-integral technology to phase space integrals without reversed unitarity. We present an Euler integral representation similar to Lee-Pomeransky representation and explicitly describe a recursive IBP reduction and dimensional shift relations for the general case of $n$ denominators. On the level of master integrals, applying a differential equation approach, we explicitly calculate the previously unknown angular integrals with four denominators for any number of masses to finite order in $\varepsilon$. Extending the idea of dimensional recurrence, we explore the decomposition of angular integrals into branch integrals reducing the number of scales in the master integrals from $(n+1)n/2$ to $n+1$. To showcase the potential of this method, we calculate the massless three denominator integral to establish all-order results in $\varepsilon$ including a resummation of soft logarithms.</description>

      <title>Lattice study of two-dimensional SU(2) gauge theories with a single massless Majorana fermion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massless overlap fermions in the real representation of two dimensional $SU(N_c)$ gauge theories exhibit a mod($2$) index due to the rigidity of its spectrum when viewed as a function of the background gauge field - lattice gauge fields on a periodic torus come under two classes; ones that have one set of chirally paired zero modes and ones that do not. Focusing on $SU(2)$ and a single Majorana fermion in an integer representation, $J$; we present numerical evidence that shows only one of these classes survives the continuum limit and this depends on the boundary conditions of the fermion and the gauge field. As such, two of the four possible partition functions are zero in the continuum limit. By defining modified partition functions which do not include the zero modes of the overlap fermions in the fermion determinant, we are able to define an expectation value for a fermion bilinear as ratios of two mixed partition functions. This observable is referred to as the topological condensate and has a non-zero expectation value on any finite physical torus and also has a non-zero limit as the size of the torus is taken to infinity. We study the spectral density of fermions and the scaling of the lowest eigenvalue with the size of the torus to show the absence of any spontaneous symmetry breaking but the emergence of zero modes in the infinite volume limit where it is prohibited in finite volume. These results remain the same for $J = 1, 2, 3, 4$. These results motivate us to propose an independent plaquette model which reproduces the correct physics in the infinite volume limit using a single partition function.</description>

      <title>Unification of Gravity and Standard Model: Weyl-Dirac-Born-Infeld action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a unified (quantum) description, by the gauge principle, of gravity and Standard Model (SM), that generalises the Dirac-Born-Infeld action to the SM and Weyl geometry, hereafter called Weyl-Dirac-Born-Infeld action (WDBI). The theory is formulated in $d =4-2\epsilon$ dimensions. The WDBI action is a general gauge theory of SM and Weyl group (of dilatations and Poincar\'e symmetry), in the Weyl gauge covariant (metric!) formulation of Weyl geometry. The theory is SM and Weyl gauge invariant in $d=4-2\epsilon$ dimensions and there is no Weyl anomaly. The WDBI action has the unique elegant feature, not present in other gauge theories or even in string theory, that it is mathematically well-defined in $d=4-2\epsilon$ dimensions with no need to introduce in the action a UV regulator scale or field. This action actually {\it predicts} that gravity, through (Weyl covariant) space-time curvature $\hat R$, acts as UV regulator of both SM and gravity in $d=4$. A series expansion of the WDBI action (in dimensionless couplings) recovers in the leading order a Weyl gauge invariant version of SM and the Weyl (gauge theory of) quadratic gravity. The SM and Einstein-Hilbert gravity are recovered in the Stueckelberg broken phase of Weyl gauge symmetry, which restores Riemannian geometry below Planck scale. Sub-leading orders are suppressed by powers of (dimensionless) gravitational coupling ($\xi$) of Weyl quadratic gravity.</description>

      <title>Gluon Condensate via Dirac Spectral Density: IR Phase, Scale Anomaly and IR Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quark and gluon scalar densities, $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ and $\langle F^2 \rangle$, reflect the degree of scale-invariance violations in SU(N) gauge theories with fundamental quarks. It is known that $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ can be usefully scale-decomposed via spectral density $\rho(\lambda)$ of Dirac modes. Here I give such formula for $\langle F^2 \rangle$, which reveals that gluon condensate is a strictly UV quantity. For the recently-found IR phase [1,2], where the infrared (IR) degrees of freedom separate out and become independent of the system's bulk, it implies that $\langle F^2 \rangle$ due to this IR part vanishes. Its glue thus doesn't contribute to scale anomaly of the entire system and is, in this sense, scale invariant consistently with the original claim. Associated formulas are used us to define IR decoupling of glue, which may serve as an alternative indicator of IR phase transition. Using the simplest form of coherent lattice QCD, we express the effective action of full QCD entirely via Dirac spectral density.</description>

      <title>Classification of Higgs sectors from group theoretical properties of UV gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extended Higgs sectors are often introduced to explain phenomena beyond the standard model (BSM). The existence of multiple scalar fields may cause the Landau pole below the Planck scale. In this case, the low-energy theory may be replaced by an asymptotic-free gauge theory. In this paper, we consider an $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge theory with confinement as such an ultraviolet theory of the extended Higgs sectors. We investigate the relation between scalar particle contents at the low energy and group theoretical properties of fundamental fermions of the gauge theory. We find that particle contents of various extended Higgs sectors previously proposed to explain the BSM problems are deduced by each charge assignment of flavor symmetry of the fundamental fermions of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge symmetry. Our findings may provide a new picture for the ultraviolet completion of the extended Higgs sectors.</description>
