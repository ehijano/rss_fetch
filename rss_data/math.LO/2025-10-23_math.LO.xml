      <title>Martin's Conjecture in the Enumeration Degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Martin's Conjecture is that every definable function on the Turing degrees is either constant or increasing, and that every increasing function is an iterate of the Turing jump. This classification has already been corroborated for the class of uniformly invariant functions and a long-standing conjecture by Steel is that every definable function on the Turing degrees is equivalent to a uniformly invariant one. We explore whether a similar classification is possible in the enumeration degrees, an extension of the Turing degrees. We show that the spectrum of behaviors is much wider in the enumeration degrees, even for uniformly invariant functions. However, our main result is that uniformly invariant functions behave locally as nicely as possible: they are constant, increasing, or above the skip operator. As a consequence, we show that there is a definable function in the enumeration degrees that is not equivalent to a uniformly invariant one.</description>

      <title>The Modal Logic of Finitely Symmetry-Preserving Iterated Extensions is Exactly S4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the ZF-provable modal logic of the modality $\Box_{\mathrm{sym}}$, where $\Box_{\mathrm{sym}}\varphi$ means '$\varphi$ holds in every finite symmetry-preserving iteration' of the symmetric method. We prove that the exact logic is S4. Soundness (axioms T and 4) follows from reflexivity and transitivity of the underlying accessibility relation. Exactness is obtained by (i) a non-amalgamation lemma showing that axiom (.2) fails for finite symmetry-preserving iterations (no common finite symmetry-preserving iteration above the parent), and (ii) a $p$-morphism/finite-frame realization producing, within ZF, models whose $\Box_{\mathrm{sym}}$-theory matches any finite reflexive-transitive frame.</description>

      <title>Star operation, microscopic sets and porous sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the interplay between star operations, microscopic sets, and porous sets. The study focuses on the Galvin-Mycielski-Solovay theorem, which characterizes strongly measure zero sets and their interactions with meager sets. Results include the investigation of the star operation $\mathcal{F}^*$ and its properties. The paper also examines the relationship between porous sets and microscopic sets. Additionally, the work presents constructions of families $\mathcal{F}$ in $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Z}), \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Z}^\omega),$ and $\mathcal{P}(2^\omega)$ that satisfy $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F}^*$. Theorems and lemmas are provided to establish conditions under which $\mathcal{F}^{**} = \mathcal{F}$ and to analyze the implications of the Borel Conjecture and its dual. The paper concludes with a discussion of microscopic sets and their properties, including their interactions with porous sets and the non-equivalence of certain classes of sets.</description>

      <title>Integration in Hensel minimal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework of motivic integration in the style of Hrushovski--Kazhdan in arbitrary Hensel minimal fields of equicharacteristic zero. Hence our work generalizes that of Hrushovski--Kazhdan and Yin, but applies more broadly to discretely valued fields, almost real closed fields with analytic structure, pseudo-local fields, and coarsenings. In more detail, we obtain isomorphisms of Grothendieck rings of definable sets, with or without volume forms, in the valued field sort and in the leading term sort. Along the way we develop a theory of effective 1-h-minimal structures, where finite definable sets can be lifted from the leading term sort to the valued fields sort. We show that many natural examples of 1-h-minimal structures are effective, and develop dimension theory and a theory of differentiation in $\mathrm{RV}$ for effective structures.</description>

      <title>Remarks on a recent preprint of Chernikov and Towsner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this brief note, we first give a counterexample to a theorem in Chernikov and Towsner, arXiv:2510.02420(1). In arXiv:2510.02420(2), the theorem has changed but as we explain the proof has a mistake. The change in the statement, due to changes in the underlying definition, affects the paper's claims. Since that theorem had been relevant to connecting the work of their paper to Coregliano-Malliaris high-arity PAC learning, a connection which now disappears, we also explain why their definitions miss crucial aspects that our work was designed to grapple with.</description>

      <title>The Nikodym and Grothendieck properties of Boolean algebras and rings related to ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an ideal $\mathcal{I}$ in a $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebra $\mathcal{A}$, we show that if the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{A}\langle\mathcal{I}\rangle$ generated by $\mathcal{I}$ does not have the Nikodym property, then it does not have the Grothendieck property either. The converse however does not hold -- we construct a family of $\mathfrak{c}$ many pairwise non-isomorphic Boolean subalgebras of the power set $\wp(\omega)$ of the form $\wp(\omega)\langle\mathcal{I}\rangle$ which, when thought of as subsets of the Cantor space $2^\omega$, belong to the Borel class $\mathbb{F}_{\sigma\delta}$ and have the Nikodym property but not the Grothendieck property, and a family of $2^\mathfrak{c}$ many pairwise non-isomorphic non-analytic Boolean algebras of the form $\wp(\omega)\langle\mathcal{I}\rangle$ with the Nikodym property but without the Grothendieck property.
  Extending a result of Hern\'{a}ndez-Hern\'{a}ndez and Hru\v{s}\'{a}k, we show that for an analytic P-ideal $\mathcal{I}$ on $\omega$ the following are equivalent: 1) $\mathcal{I}$ is totally bounded, 2) $\mathcal{I}$ has the Local-to-Global Boundedness Property for submeasures, 3) $\wp(\omega)/\mathcal{I}$ contains a countable splitting family, 4) $\mbox{conv}\le_K\mathcal{I}$. Moreover, proving a conjecture of Drewnowski, Florencio, and Pa\'ul, we present examples of analytic P-ideals on $\omega$ with the Nikodym property but without the Local-to-Global Boundedness Property for submeasures (and so not totally bounded). Exploiting a construction of Alon, Drewnowski, and {\L}uczak, we also describe a family of $\mathfrak{c}$ many pairwise non-isomorphic ideals on $\omega$, induced by sequences of Kneser hypergraphs, which all have the Nikodym property but not the Nested Partition Property -- this answers a question of Stuart.
  Finally, Tukey reducibility of a class of ideals without the Nikodym property is studied.</description>

      <title>On better-quasi-ordering under graph minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the aftermath of the Robertson--Seymour Graph Minor Theorem, Thomas conjectured that the countable graphs are well-quasi-ordered under the minor relation. We prove that this conjecture, when restricted to graphs with no infinite paths (rays), is equivalent to the statement that the finite graphs are better-quasi-ordered, another well-known open problem. Even more, we prove that the latter implies that the countable rayless graphs are better-quasi-ordered.
  We prove several other statements to be equivalent to the above, one of which being that the rayless countable graphs of rank $\alpha$ can be decomposed into exactly $\aleph_0$ minor-twin classes for every ordinal $\alpha&lt;\omega_1$.
  By restricting the latter statement to trees, and combining it with Nash-Williams' theorem that the infinite trees are well-quasi-ordered, we deduce as a side result that a minor-closed family of N-labelled rayless forests is Borel -- in the Tychonoff product topology -- if and only if it does not contain all rayless forests.
  As another side-result, we prove Seymour's self-minor conjecture for rayless graphs of any cardinality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07777v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate iterations of consistency, local and uniform reflection over $\mathbf{HA}$ (Heyting Arithmetic). In the case of uniform reflection, we give a new proof of Dragalin's extension of Feferman's completeness theorem to $\mathbf{HA}$, drawing on Rathjen's proof of Feferman's classical result.</description>

      <title>A virtual five element basis for the uncountable linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for every Aronzsajn line A and every Countryman line C, there is a proper forcing extension in which A contains an isomorphic copy of either C or its converse C*. As a corollary, we obtain answers to several related questions asked by the second author in the literature: if there is an inaccessible cardinal, then there is a proper forcing extension in which the uncountable linear orders have a five element basis; BPFA implies the existence of a five element basis for the uncountable linear orders; BPFA is equiconsistent with the conjunction of BPFA and Aronszajn tree saturation. These results are derived from new preservation results concerning subtrees of Aronszajn trees, proper forcings, and countable support iterations, generalizing work of Miyamoto, Abraham, and Shelah.</description>

      <title>When any four solutions are independent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if any four distinct solutions of a rational difference equation are algebraically independent, then any number of distinct solutions to the equation are independent. A nontrivial variant of this result is given for autonomous difference equations or algebraic dynamical systems, where we show the degree of nonminimality is at most one. The results have a natural interpretation in terms of invariant or periodic subvarieties of algebraic dynamical systems and $\sigma$-varieties. Surprisingly, the proofs of these results rely on the classification of finite simple groups.</description>

      <title>Measure theory via Locales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to measure theory using the theory of locales. This includes concrete constructions of measure algebras associated to Radon measures, such as the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$, via Grothendieck topologies constructed from valuations, that circumvent the classical approach via $\sigma$-algebras. As an application we obtain a functorial construction of the induced measure $\mu_*$ on the locale of sublocales $\mathfrak{Sl}(X)$ of a Hausdorff space $X$ equipped with a Radon measure $\mu$, which in particular shows that $\mu_*$ is invariant under measure-preserving homeomorphisms. We furthermore give a construction of the measurable locale associated to a smooth manifold, functorial in submersions, as well as comparison results to classical measure theory.</description>
