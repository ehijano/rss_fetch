      <title>Establishing strong 1-boundedness via non-microstates free entropy techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, for many choices of finite tuples of generators $X = (x_1, \dots , x_d)$ of a tracial von Neumann algebra $(M, \tau)$ satisfying certain decomposition properties (non-primeness, possessing a Cartan subalgebra, or property $\Gamma$), one can find a diffuse, hyperfinite subalgebra $N \subseteq (W^*(X))^{\omega}$ (often in $W^*(X)$ itself), such that $W^*(N,X+\sqrt{t}S) = W^*(N,X,S)$ for all $t &gt; 0$. (Here $S$ is a free semicircular family, free from $\{X\} \cup N$). This gives a short non-microstates proof of strong 1-boundedness for such algebras.</description>

      <title>Variational formulae for entropy-like functionals for states in von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents variational formulae for entropy-like functionals, including Segal and R\'enyi entropies, for normal states on semifinite von Neumann algebras. The considered functionals are of the form $\tau(f(h))$ where $\tau$ is a normal faithful semifinite trace on this algebra, $h$ is a positive selfadjoint operator from $L^1(\M,\tau)$, and $f$ is an appropriate convex or concave function. The results cover both finite and semifinite algebras, and the obtained formulae generalise known results, in particular, those concerning relative entropy. Moreover, the connection between quantum entropies and the structure of abelian subalgebras is highlighted, providing new interpretations in the context of quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Scalability and asymptotic adjunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce relative Roe functors and show that for every pair of scalable proper metric spaces, the functor of continuous functions and the relative Roe functor, both associated with this pair, are asymptotically adjoint. While this asymptotic adjunction is weaker than the genuine one, it retains sufficient categorical properties to be intuitive and useful in applications. These results can be used to provide an unsuspended description of the Connes-Higson $E$-theory, establish connections between $E_{1}$-theory and extension theory, and express $K$-homology of compact metric spaces in terms the corresponding metric cones.</description>

      <title>Boundary representations, geometry of matrix ranges, and C$^*$-envelopes of finite-dimensional operator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analysis of the boundary representations and C$^*$-envelopes of some finite-dimensional operator systems $\mathcal R$ is undertaken by considering relationships between operator-theoretic properties of a $d$-tuple $\mathfrak x=(x_1,\dots, x_d)$ of elements in a unital C$^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$ and operator-system properties of the linear span $\mathcal O_{\mathfrak x}$ of $\{1_\mathcal A,x_1,x_1^*,\dots,x_d,x_d^*\}$. This approach lends itself well to the study of certain phenomena in single- and several-variable operator theory, such as the Smith-Ward property. The matrix range of a $d$-tuple of elements $\mathfrak x$ is matrix-affinely homeomorphic to the matrix state space of the operator system determined by $\mathfrak x$, and many of our methods connect the geometry of these compact matrix convex sets to operator system properties, including various forms of nuclearity and lifting properties.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in von Neumann Algebraic Quantum Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, states can be infinitely entangled across a pair of subsystems, but are there different forms of infinite entanglement? To understand entanglement in such systems, we use a framework in which subsystems are described by von Neumann algebras on the full system's Hilbert space. Although this approach has been known for over 50 years, an operational justification has been missing so far. We resolve this by deriving the von Neumann algebraic description of subsystems from operational axioms. This raises the question of how physical properties of the subsystem relate to algebraic properties. Our main result shows a surprisingly strong connection: The type classification of von Neumann algebras (types I, II, III, and their respective subtypes) is in one-to-one correspondence with a family of operational entanglement properties. For instance, Connes' classification of type III factors can be formulated in terms of the smallest achievable error when "embezzling" entanglement from the system. Our findings promote the type classification from algebraic bookkeeping to a classification of infinite quantum systems based on the kind of infinite entanglement that they support.</description>

      <title>Maximum principles for matrix-valued regular functions of a quaternionic variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quaternionic matrix-valued regular function is a map $F: \Omega \rightarrow M_n(\mathbb{H})$ whose entries are regular functions of a quaternion variable, where $\Omega$ is a domain in $\mathbb{H}$. Our aim is to bring out some maximum norm principles for such functions. We derive a decomposition theorem for such functions and also prove a Caratheodory-Rudin type approximation theorem for functions in the quaternionic right Schur class. This in turn yields that a $2 \times 2$ norm one matrix-valued function can be approximated by quaternionic rational inner functions.</description>

      <title>Second invariant cohomology of some finite-dimensional Hopf algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use categorical description of the invariant 2-cohomology group of Hopf algebra to compute such cohomology for two finite dimensional Hopf algebras: the group ring of $Z_8\rtimes Aut(Z_8)$ and Kac-Paljutkin algebra. For the first of these two examples, our categorical approach helps to settle the problem of computing this cohomology, which was left open in by Guillot and Kassel (\cite{dtwist}), where only some partial information about this cohomology was obtained.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of operator systems: tight extensions and noncommutative measurable structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a unital $C^*$-algebra generated by some separable operator system $S$. More than a decade ago, Arveson conjectured that $S$ is hyperrigid in $A$ if all irreducible representations of $A$ are boundary representations for $S$. Recently, a counterexample to the conjecture was found by Bilich and Dor-On. To circumvent the difficulties hidden in this counterexample, we exploit some of Pedersen's seminal ideas on noncommutative measurable structures and establish an amended version of Arveson's conjecture. More precisely, we show that all irreducible representations of $A$ are boundary representations for $S$ precisely when all representations of $A$ admit a unique "tight" completely positive extension from $S$. In addition, we prove an equivalence between uniqueness of such tight extensions and rigidity of completely positive approximations for representations of nuclear $C^*$-algebras, thereby extending the classical principle of Korovkin--Saskin for commutative algebras of continuous functions.</description>

      <title>Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the theory of copositive forms and the positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC.
  As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs.
  On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of (symmetric) states. We prove that the SOS hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy}-. In the setting of the DPS hierarchy for separability, we construct a large family of optimal entanglement witnesses that are not certifiable by any level of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy, answering a long standing open question from [DPS04]. Leveraging the duality, we also provide an explicit construction of (mixture of) bipartite Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $K_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.</description>

      <title>Twisted crossed products of Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a locally compact group $G$, a nondegenerate Banach algebra $A$ with a contractive approximate identity, a twisted action $(\alpha, \sigma)$ of $G$ on $A$, and a family $\mathcal{R}$ of uniformly bounded representations of $A$ on Banach spaces, we define the twisted crossed product $F_\mathcal{R}(G,A,\alpha, \sigma)$. When $\mathcal{R}$ consists of contractive representations, we show that $F_\mathcal{R}(G,A,\alpha, \sigma)$ is a Banach algebra with a contractive approximate identity, which can also be characterized by an isometric universal property.
  As an application, we specialize to the $L^p$-operator algebra setting, defining both the $L^p$-twisted crossed product and the reduced version. Finally, we give a generalization of the so-called Packer-Raeburn trick to the $L^p$-setting, showing that any $L^p$-twisted crossed product is "stably" isometrically isomorphic to an untwisted one.</description>
