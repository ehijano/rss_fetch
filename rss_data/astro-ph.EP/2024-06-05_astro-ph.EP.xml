      <title>Use the 4S (Signal-Safe Speckle Subtraction): Explainable Machine Learning reveals the Giant Exoplanet AF Lep b in High-Contrast Imaging Data from 2011</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main challenge of exoplanet high-contrast imaging (HCI) is to separate the signal of exoplanets from their host stars, which are many orders of magnitude brighter. HCI for ground-based observations is further exacerbated by speckle noise originating from perturbations in the Earth's atmosphere and imperfections in the telescope optics. Various data post-processing techniques are used to remove this speckle noise and reveal the faint planet signal. Often, however, a significant part of the planet signal is accidentally subtracted together with the noise. In the present work, we use explainable machine learning to investigate the reason for the loss of the planet signal for one of the most used post-processing methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We find that PCA learns the shape of the telescope point spread function for high numbers of PCA components. This representation of the noise captures not only the speckle noise, but also the characteristic shape of the planet signal. Building upon these insights, we develop a new post-processing method (4S) that constrains the noise model to minimize this signal loss. We apply our model to 11 archival HCI datasets from the VLT-NACO instrument in the L'-band and find that our model consistently outperforms PCA. The improvement is largest at close separations to the star ($\leq 4 \lambda /D$) providing up to 1.5 magnitudes deeper contrast. This enhancement enables us to detect the exoplanet AF Lep b in data from 2011, 11 years before its subsequent discovery. We present updated orbital parameters for this object.</description>

      <title>Chemical mapping of temperate sub-Neptune atmospheres: Constraining the deep-interior H2O/H2 using the atmospheric CO2/CH4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the envelope composition of sub-Neptune-type exoplanets is challenging due to the inherent degeneracy in their interior composition scenarios. Particularly, the H2O/H2 ratio, or can be expressed as the O/H ratio, in the planetary envelope provides crucial insights into the origin of these exoplanets relative to the ice line during formation. Using self-consistent radiative transfer modeling and a rate-based automatic chemical network generator combined with 1D photochemical kinetic-transport atmospheric modeling, we investigate atmospheres of temperate sub-Neptunes, ranging from H2-dominated to H2O-dominated scenarios with Teq = 250-400 K, using K2-18 b (Teq = 255 K), LP 791-18 c (Teq = 324 K), and TOI-270 d (Teq = 354 K) as examples. Our models indicate that using the atmospheric CO2/CH4 ratio to infer the deep-interior H2O/H2 ratio. Applying to recent JWST observations, our findings suggest K2-18 b likely has an interior highly enriched in water (approximately 50% H2O), exceeding the amount of water in a 100x solar metallicity scenario and suggesting a formation history that involved substantial accretion of ices. In contrast, TOI-270 d has an interior composition of approximately 25% H2O, which is comparable to the conventional metallicity framework with a metallicity higher than 100x solar metallicity. Furthermore, our models identify carbonyl sulfide (OCS) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) as strong indicators of at least a 10% water-rich envelope in temperate sub-Neptunes. These results provide a method to delineate the internal composition and formation mechanisms of sub-Neptunes with Teq&lt; ~500 K via atmospheric characterization through transmission spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Abundances of trace constituents in Jupiter's atmosphere inferred from Herschel/PACS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $Context.$ On October 31, 2009, the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) on board the Herschel Space Observatory observed far-infrared spectra of Jupiter between 50 and 220$\,\mu$m as part of the program "Water and Related Chemistry in the Solar System". $Aims.$ We investigate the disk-averaged chemical composition of Jupiter's atmosphere as a function of height using these observations. $Methods.$ We used the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) and the least-squares fitting technique to infer the abundances of trace constituents. $Results.$ The PACS data include numerous spectral lines attributable to ammonia (NH$_3$), methane (CH$_4$), phosphine (PH$_3$), water (H$_2$O), and deuterated hydrogen (HD) in the Jovian atmosphere. We infer an ammonia abundance profile that decreases from a mole fraction of $(1.7\pm 0.8)\times 10^{-4}$ at $p\sim 900\,$mbar to $(1.7\pm 0.9)\times 10^{-8}$ at $p\sim 275\,$mbar, following a fractional scale height of about 0.114. For phosphine, we find a mole fraction of $(7.2\pm 1.2)\times 10^{-7}$ at pressures higher than $(550\pm 100)\,$mbar and a decrease of its abundance at lower pressures following a fractional scale height of $(0.09\pm 0.02)$. Our analysis delivers a methane mole fraction of $(1.49\pm 0.09)\times 10^{-3}$. Analyzing the HD $R(0)$ line at $112.1\,\mu$m yields a new measurement of Jupiter's D/H ratio, $\text{D/H}=(1.5\pm 0.6)\times 10^{-5}$. Finally, the PACS data allow us to put the most stringent $3\sigma$ upper limits yet on the mole fractions of hydrogen halides in the Jovian troposphere. These new upper limits are $&lt;1.1\times 10^{-11}$ for hydrogen fluoride (HF), $&lt;6.0\times 10^{-11}$ for hydrogen chloride (HCl), $&lt;2.3\times 10^{-10}$ for hydrogen bromide (HBr) and $&lt;1.2\times 10^{-9}$ for hydrogen iodide (HI) and support the proposed condensation of hydrogen halides into ammonium halide salts in the Jovian troposphere.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Filtering, Sponge Layers, and Equatorial Jet Formation in a General Circulation Model of Gaseous Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General circulation models are a useful tool in understanding the three dimensional structure of hot Jupiter and sub-Neptune atmospheres; however, understanding the validity of the results from these simulations requires an understanding the artificial dissipation required for numerical stability. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the longitudinal filter and vertical ``sponge'' used in the Met Office's {\sc Unified Model} when simulating gaseous exoplanets. We demonstrate that excessive dissipation can result in counter-rotating jets and a catastrophic failure to conserve angular momentum. Once the dissipation is reduced to a level where a super-rotating jet forms, however, the jet and thermal structure are relatively insensitive to the dissipation, except in the nightside gyres where temperatures can vary by $\sim 100\,\mathrm{K}$. We do find, however, that flattening the latitudinal profile of the longitudinal filtering alters the results more than a reduction in the strength of the filtering itself. We also show that even in situations where the temperatures are relatively insensitive to the dissipation, the vertical velocities can still vary with the dissipation, potentially impacting physical processes that depend on the local vertical transport.</description>

      <title>Debris Disks can Contaminate Mid-Infrared Exoplanet Spectra: Evidence for a Circumstellar Debris Disk around Exoplanet Host WASP-39</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signal from a transiting planet can be diluted by astrophysical contamination. In the case of circumstellar debris disks, this contamination could start in the mid-infrared and vary as a function of wavelength, which would then change the observed transmission spectrum for any planet in the system. The MIRI/LRS WASP-39b transmission spectrum shows an unexplained dip starting at $\sim$10 $\mu$m that could be caused by astrophysical contamination. The spectral energy distribution displays excess flux at similar levels to that which are needed to create the dip in the transmission spectrum. In this article, we show that this dip is consistent with the presence of a bright circumstellar debris disk, at a distance of $&gt;$2 au. We discuss how a circumstellar debris disk like that could affect the atmosphere of WASP-39b. We also show that even faint debris disks can be a source of contamination in MIRI exoplanet spectra.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry, Gap Opening and High Accretion Rate on DM Tau: A Hypothesis Based on Interaction of Magnetized Disk Wind with Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over two hundred protoplanetary disk systems have been resolved by ALMA, and the vast majority suggest the presence of planets. The dust gaps in transition disks are considered evidence of giant planets sculpting gas and dust under appropriate disk viscosity. However, the unusually high accretion rates in many T Tauri stars hosting transition disks challenge this theory. As the only disk currently observed with high turbulence, the high accretion rate ($\sim10^{-8.3}M_{\odot}/yr$) observed in DM Tau indicates the presence of strong turbulence may within the system. Considering the recent theoretical advancements in magnetized disk winds is challenging the traditional gap-opening theories and viscosity-driven accretion models, our study presents a pioneering simulation incorporating a simplified magnetized disk wind model to explain the observed features in DM Tau. Employing multi-fluid simulations with an embedded medium mass planet, we successfully replicate the gap formation and asymmetric structures evident in ALMA Band 6 and the recently JVLA 7 mm observations. Our results suggest that when magnetized disk wind dominate the accretion mode of the system, it's entirely possible for a planet with a medium mass to exist within the gap inside 20 au of DM Tau. This means that DM Tau may not be as turbulence as imagined. However, viscosity within the disk should also contribute a few turbulence to maintain disk stability.</description>

      <title>CHEOPS in-flight performance: A comprehensive look at the first 3.5 years of operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CHEOPS is a space telescope specifically designed to monitor transiting exoplanets orbiting bright stars. In September 2023, CHEOPS completed its nominal mission and remains in excellent operational conditions. The mission has been extended until the end of 2026. Scientific and instrumental data have been collected throughout in-orbit commissioning and nominal operations, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the mission's performance. In this article, we present the results of this analysis with a twofold goal. First, we aim to inform the scientific community about the present status of the mission and what can be expected as the instrument ages. Secondly, we intend for this publication to serve as a legacy document for future missions, providing insights and lessons learned from the successful operation of CHEOPS. To evaluate the instrument performance in flight, we developed a comprehensive monitoring and characterisation programme. It consists of dedicated observations that allow us to characterise the instrument's response. In addition to the standard collection of nominal science and housekeeping data, these observations provide input for detecting, modelling, and correcting instrument systematics, discovering and addressing anomalies, and comparing the instrument's actual performance with expectations. The precision of the CHEOPS measurements has enabled the mission objectives to be met and exceeded. Careful modelling of the instrumental systematics allows the data quality to be significantly improved during the light curve analysis phase, resulting in more precise scientific measurements. CHEOPS is compliant with the driving scientific requirements of the mission. Although visible, the ageing of the instrument has not affected the mission's performance.</description>

      <title>Lichen-Mediated Self-Growing Construc8on Materials for Habitat Outfitting on Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As its next step in space exploration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) revealed plans to establish a permanent human presence on Mars. To build the centrally located, monolithic habitat, NASA has a history of experimenting with lightweight inflatable habitats to reduce mass and volume. However, the physical structures used to outfit the inflatable must generally be launched by a second spacecraft. This study proposes that, rather than shipping prefabricated outfitting elements to Mars, habitat outfitting can be realized by in-situ construction using cyanobacteria and fungi as building agents. A synthetic lichen system, composed of diazotrophic cyanobacteria and filamentous fungi, can be created to produce abundant biominerals (CaCO3) and biopolymers, which will glue Martian regolith into consolidated building blocks. These self-growing building blocks can be assembled into various structures, such as floors, walls, partitions, and furniture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of exoplanets detected using gravitational microlensing technique is currently larger than 200, which enables population studies. Microlensing is uniquely sensitive to low-mass planets orbiting at separations of several astronomical units, a parameter space that is not accessible to other planet-detection techniques, as well as free-floating planets, not orbiting around any star. In this review, we present the state-of-the-art knowledge on the demographics of exoplanets detected with microlensing, with a particular emphasis on their occurrence rates. We also summarize the current knowledge about free-floating planets, an elusive population of objects that seem to be more common than ordinary, gravitationally bound exoplanets.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Method to Compute the Tides of Laterally-Heterogeneous Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Body tides reveal information about planetary interiors and affect their evolution. Most models to compute body tides rely on the assumption of a spherically-symmetric interior. However, several processes can lead to lateral variations of interior properties. We present a new spectral method to compute the tidal response of laterally-heterogeneous bodies. Compared to previous spectral methods, our approach is not limited to small-amplitude lateral variations; compared to finite element codes, the approach is more computationally-efficient. While the tidal response of a spherically-symmetric body has the same wave-length as the tidal force; lateral heterogeneities produce an additional tidal response with an spectra that depends on the spatial pattern of such variations. For Mercury, the Moon and Io the amplitude of this signal is as high as $1\%-10\%$ the main tidal response for long-wavelength shear modulus variations higher than $\sim 10\%$ the mean shear modulus. For Europa, Ganymede and Enceladus, shell-thickness variations of $50\%$ the mean shell thickness can cause an additional signal of $\sim 1\%$ and $\sim 10\%$ for the Jovian moons and Encelaudus, respectively. Future missions, such as $ \textit{BepiColombo}$ and $\textit{JUICE}$, might measure these signals. Lateral variations of viscosity affect the distribution of tidal heating. This can drive the thermal evolution of tidally-active bodies and affect the distribution of active regions.</description>

      <title>BD-14 3065b (TOI-4987b): from giant planet to brown dwarf: evidence for deuterium burning in old age?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study reports the confirmation of BD-14 3065b, a transiting planet/brown dwarf in a triple-star system, with a mass near the deuterium burning boundary. BD-14 3065b has the largest radius observed within the sample of giant planets and brown dwarfs around post-main-sequence stars. Its orbital period is 4.3 days, and it transits a subgiant F-type star with a mass of $M_\star=1.41 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$, a radius of $R_\star=2.35 \pm 0.08 R_{\odot}$, an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}=6935\pm90$ K, and a metallicity of $-0.34\pm0.05$ dex. By combining TESS photometry with high-resolution spectra acquired with the TRES and Pucheros+ spectrographs, we measured a mass of $M_p=12.37\pm0.92 M_J$ and a radius of $R_p=1.926\pm0.094 R_J$. Our discussion of potential processes that could be responsible for the inflated radius led us to conclude that deuterium burning is a plausible explanation resulting from the heating of BD-14 3065b's interior. Detection of the secondary eclipse with TESS photometry enables a precise determination of the eccentricity $e_p=0.066\pm0.011$ and reveals BD-14 3065b has a brightness temperature of $3520 \pm 130$ K. With its unique characteristics, BD-14 3065b presents an excellent opportunity to study its atmosphere through thermal emission spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: JWST has created a new era of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheric characterization, and with it the possibility to detect potential biosignature gases like CH$_{4}$. Our interpretation of exoplanet atmospheric spectra, and the veracity of these interpretations, will be limited by our understanding of atmospheric processes and the accuracy of input modeling data. Molecular cross-sections are essential inputs to these models. The photochemistry of temperate planets depends on photolysis reactions whose rates are governed by the dissociation cross-sections of key molecules. H$_{2}$O is one such molecule; the photolysis of H$_{2}$O produces OH, a highly reactive and efficient sink for atmospheric trace gases. We investigate the photochemical effects of improved H$_{2}$O cross-sections on anoxic terrestrial planets as a function of host star spectral type (FGKM) and CH$_{4}$ surface flux. Our results show that updated H$_{2}$O cross-sections, extended to wavelengths $&gt;$200 nm, substantially impact the predicted abundances of trace gases destroyed by OH. The differences for anoxic terrestrial planets orbiting Sun-like host stars are greatest, showing changes of up to three orders of magnitude in surface CO levels, and over an order of magnitude in surface CH$_{4}$ levels. These differences lead to observable changes in simulated planetary spectra, especially important in the context of future direct-imaging missions. In contrast, the atmospheres of planets orbiting M-dwarf stars are substantially less affected. Our results demonstrate a pressing need for refined dissociation cross-section data for H$_{2}$O, where uncertainties remain, and other key molecules, especially at mid-UV wavelengths $&gt;$200 nm.</description>

      <title>The metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratio of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b from Gemini-S/IGRINS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09769</link>

Abstract: Measurements of the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios of exoplanet atmospheres can reveal details about their formation and evolution. Recently, high-resolution cross-correlation analysis has emerged as a method of precisely constraining the C/O ratios of hot Jupiter atmospheres. We present two transits of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b observed between 1.4-2.4 $\mu$m with Gemini-S/IGRINS. We detected the presence of H$_{2}$O, CO, and OH at signal-to-noise ratios of 6.93, 6.47, and 3.90, respectively. We performed two retrievals on this data set. A free retrieval for abundances of these three species retrieved a volatile metallicity of $\left[\frac{\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{O}} {\mathrm{H}}\right]=-0.70^{+1.27}_{-0.93}$, consistent with the stellar value, and a super-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio of C/O$=0.80^{+0.07}_{-0.11}$. We also ran a chemically self-consistent grid retrieval, which agreed with the free retrieval within $1\sigma$ but favored a slightly more sub-stellar metallicity and solar C/O ratio ($\left[\frac{\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{O}} {\mathrm{H}}\right]=-0.74^{+0.23}_{-0.17}$ and C/O$=0.59^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$). A variety of formation pathways may explain the composition of WASP-76b. Additionally, we found systemic ($V_{sys}$) and Keplerian ($K_{p}$) velocity offsets which were broadly consistent with expectations from 3D general circulation models of WASP-76b, with the exception of a redshifted $V_{sys}$ for H$_{2}$O. Future observations to measure the phase-dependent velocity offsets and limb differences at high resolution on WASP-76b will be necessary to understand the H$_{2}$O velocity shift. Finally, we find that the population of exoplanets with precisely constrained C/O ratios generally trends toward super-solar C/O ratios. More results from high-resolution observations or JWST will serve to further elucidate any population-level trends.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Exoplanet Ephemerides by Leveraging Professional and Citizen Science Data: A Test Case with WASP-77A b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an updated ephemeris and physical parameters for the exoplanet WASP-77 A b. In this effort, we combine 64 ground- and space-based transit observations, 6 space-based eclipse observations, and 32 radial velocity observations to produce the most precise orbital solution to date for this target, aiding in the planning of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Ariel observations and atmospheric studies. We report a new orbital period of 1.360029395 +- 5.7e-8 days, a new mid-transit time of 2459957.337860 +- 4.3e-5 BJDTDB (Barycentric Julian Date in the Barycentric Dynamical Time scale; arXiv:1005.4415) and a new mid-eclipse time of 2459956.658192 +- 6.7e-5 BJDTDB. Furthermore, the methods presented in this study reduce the uncertainties in the planet mass to 1.6654 +- 4.5e-3 Mjup and orbital period to 1.360029395 +- 5.7e-8 days by factors of 15.1 and 10.9, respectively. Through a joint fit analysis comparison of transit data taken by space-based and citizen science-led initiatives, our study demonstrates the power of including data collected by citizen scientists compared to a fit of the space-based data alone. Additionally, by including a vast array of citizen science data from ExoClock, Exoplanet Transit Database (ETD), and Exoplanet Watch, we can increase our observational baseline and thus acquire better constraints on the forward propagation of our ephemeris than what is achievable with TESS data alone.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS): Linked accretion and ejection in a Class I protobinary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accretion and ejection sets the outcome of the star and planet formation process. The mid-infrared wavelength range offers key tracers of those processes that were difficult to detect and spatially resolve in protostars until now. We aim to characterize the interplay between accretion and ejection in the low-mass Class I protobinary system TMC1, comprising two young stellar objects: TMC1-W and TMC1-E with 85 au separation. With the {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) - Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) observations in 5 - 28 $\mu$m range, we measure intensities of emission lines of H$_2$, atoms and ions, e.g., [Fe II] and [Ne II], and HI recombination lines. We detect H$_2$ outflow coming from TMC1-E, with no significant H$_2$ emission from TMC1-W. The H$_2$ emission from TMC1-E outflow appears narrow and extends to wider opening angles with decreasing E$_{up}$ from S(8) to S(1) rotational transitions, indicating a disk wind origin. The outflow from TMC1-E protostar shows spatially extended emission lines of [Ne II], [Ne III], [Ar II], and [Ar III], with their line ratios consistent with UV radiation as a source of ionization. With ALMA, we detect accretion streamer infalling from $&gt;$ 1000 au scales onto the TMC1-E component. TMC1-W protostar powers a collimated jet, detected with [Fe II] and [Ni II] consistent with energetic flow. A much weaker ionized jet is observed from TMC1-E. TMC1-W is associated with strong emission from hydrogen recombination lines, tracing the accretion onto the young star. Observations of a binary Class I protostellar system show that the two processes are clearly intertwined, with accretion from the envelope onto the disk influencing a wide-angle wind ejected on disk scales, while accretion from the protostellar disk onto the protostar is associated with the source launching a collimated high-velocity jet within the innermost regions of the disk.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Timing Noise from Brownian Motion of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05410v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) reported a signal at nanohertz frequencies consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background. Here, I show that the Brownian motion of the Sun as a result of its random gravitational interactions with the cluster of thousands of unmodeled Main-belt asteroids of diameters &lt;80km, combined with small inaccuracies in the estimated masses of larger asteroids, introduces timing noise for pulsars which is up to 20% of the reported signal at frequencies of ~1/(few-years). The asteroid contribution needs to be modeled better in order to obtain accurate inferences from the PTA signal.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tunneling Could Enable Proton Transfer Reactions on Titan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surface of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is rich in organics and is often suggested to model early Earth environments. Titan's surface is cold, at a temperature of approximately 90 K, which prohibits most thermally activated chemical reactions. However, quantum effects become more important at low temperatures and reactions that are classically prohibited can often proceed through quantum mechanical pathways. Using path integral molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate nuclear quantum effects on the thermodynamics of model proton transfer reactions in liquid ethane. We find that proton transfer can occur at Titan surface conditions through quantum tunneling. Consequently, we estimate that nuclear quantum effects can enhance reaction rates by many orders of magnitude. Our results suggest that nuclear quantum effects could facilitate prebiotic chemistry on Titan, and quantum effects should be considered in future investigations.</description>
