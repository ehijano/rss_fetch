      <title>Equivalence Relations on Vertex Operator Algebras, II: Witt Equivalence and Orbifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When can two strongly rational vertex operator algebras or 1+1d rational conformal field theories (RCFTs) be related by topological manipulations? For vertex operator algebras, the term "topological manipulations" refers to operations like passing to a conformal extension or restricting to a conformal subalgebra; for RCFTs, topological manipulations include operations like gauging (or orbifolding) a finite subpart of a generalized global symmetry or interpolating to a new theory via a topological line interface of finite quantum dimension.
  Inspired by results in the theory of even lattices, and also the theory of tensor categories, we say that two strongly rational vertex operator algebras are Witt equivalent if their central charges agree and if their representation categories are Witt equivalent as modular tensor categories. Two RCFTs are said to be Witt equivalent if their central charges agree and if their associated 2+1d topological field theories can be separated by a topological surface. We argue that Witt equivalence is necessary for two theories to be related by topological manipulations. We conjecture that it is also sufficient, and give proofs in various special cases.
  We relate this circle of ideas to the problem of classifying RCFTs, and to lore concerning deformation classes of quantum field theories. We use the notion of Witt equivalence to argue, assuming the conjectural classification of unitary, $c=1$ RCFTs, that all of the finite global symmetries of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model are invertible. Finally, we sketch a "quantum Galois theory" for chiral CFTs, which generalizes prior mathematical literature by incorporating non-invertible symmetries; we illustrate this non-invertible Galois theory in the context of the monster CFT, for which we produce a Fibonacci symmetry.</description>

      <title>Holographic Generalised Gukov-Witten Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spindle and disc solutions have received significant attention in recent literature. However, it is not entirely clear what these supergravity solutions represent in the dual SCFT. In this work we elucidate this issue by considering a different global completion of the spindle solution, focusing on a single conical defect. We argue that these solutions can be interpreted as the insertion of a single (generalised) Gukov-Witten defect in the bulk SCFT. We give compelling evidence for this claim by uplifting the solutions to type IIB supergravity and showing that the five-dimensional $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS solutions uplifts to the bubbling surface operators solutions. Their less supersymmetric cousins give rise to a large class of holographic generalised Gukov-Witten surface operators for which we perform a detailed geometric analysis. To corroborate these claims we compute a variety of holographic observables such as the renormalised action, stress tensor one-point function and defect entanglement entropy. In addition, we extend the holographic inflow mechanism to account for bulk-to-defect inflow to study the symmetries and anomalies of the bulk and defect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct backreacted geometries dual to the supersymmetric mass deformation of the IKKT matrix model. They are Euclidean type IIB supergravity solutions given in terms of an electrostatic potential, having $SO(7)\times SO(3)$ isometry and 16 supersymmetries. Quantizing the fluxes, we find that the supergravity solutions are in one-to-one correspondence with fuzzy sphere vacua of the matrix model.</description>

      <title>A universal inequality on the unitary 2D CFT partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the conjecture proposed by Hartman, Keller and Stoica [HKS14]: the grand-canonical free energy of a unitary 2D CFT with a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12}+\epsilon$ and below the twist $\frac{c}{12}$ is universal in the large $c$ limit for all $\beta_L\beta_R \neq 4\pi^2$.
  The technique of the proof allows us to derive a one-parameter (with parameter $\alpha\in(0,1]$) family of universal inequalities on the unitary 2D CFT partition function with general central charge $c\geqslant 0$, using analytical modular bootstrap. We derive an iterative equation for the domain of validity of the inequality on the $(\beta_L,\beta_R)$ plane. The infinite iteration of this equation gives the boundary of maximal-validity domain, which depends on the parameter $\alpha$ in the inequality.
  In the $c \to \infty$ limit, with the additional assumption of a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12} + \epsilon$ and the twist $\frac{\alpha c}{12}$ (with $\alpha \in (0,1]$ fixed), our inequality shows that the grand-canonical free energy exhibits a universal large $c$ behavior in the maximal-validity domain. This domain, however, does not cover the entire $(\beta_L, \beta_R)$ plane, except in the case of $\alpha = 1$. For $\alpha = 1$, this proves the conjecture proposed by [HKS14], and for $\alpha &lt; 1$, it quantifies how sparseness in twist affects the regime of universality. Furthermore, this implies a precise lower bound on the temperature of near-extremal BTZ black holes, above which we can trust the black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>The three-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$ superfishnet theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a double-scaling limit of $\beta$-deformed ABJM theory in three-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$ superspace, and a non-local deformation thereof. Due to the regular appearance of the theory's Feynman supergraphs, we refer to this superconformal and integrable theory as the superfishnet theory. We use techniques inspired by the integrability of bi-scalar fishnet theory and adapted to superspace to calculate the zero-mode-fixed thermodynamic free energy, the corresponding critical coupling, and the exact all-loop scaling dimensions of various operators. Furthermore, we confirm the results of the supersymmetric dynamical fishnet theory by applying our methods to four-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 1$ superspace.</description>

      <title>Real Time Correlations and Complexified Horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct black hole saddles dual to real-time/Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) path integrals with arbitrary splits of the thermal density matrix generalizing the holographic SK prescription in \cite{Glorioso:2018mmw}. Using a scalar probe on the AdS Schwarzschild black brane as an example, we demonstrate how KMS properties of the boundary correlators naturally derive from these geometries. As deforming the boundary time contour is equivalent to the action of half sided modular transformation, these saddles can be used to compute higher point modular transformed correlators using a well controlled bulk perturbation theory. An interesting relation between these saddles and the more familiar eternal geometries, and the respective generators of time translation on them is described. Inspired from recent discussions on algebras of observables in gravity, we motivate that classical ensembles of such geometries with different amount of modular transformations should be promoted to genuine configurations of the bulk geometry. In particular, this is argued to imply the existence of additional classical moduli in the boundary open EFT dual to the exterior dynamics, and via fluid gravity correspondence, in the fluctuating hydrodynamics of the boundary. Finally, a Lorentzian version of the Kontsevich-Segal conditions is verified for all these geometries.</description>

      <title>Discrete Max-Focusing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Focusing Conjecture (QFC) lies at the foundation of holo\-graphy and semiclassical gravity. The QFC implies the Bousso bound and the Quantum Null Energy Condition (QNEC). The QFC also ensures the consistency of the quantum extremal surface prescription and bulk reconstruction in AdS/CFT.
  However, the central object in the QFC -- the expansion of lightrays -- is not defined at points where geodesics enter or leave a null congruence. Moreover, the expansion admits three inequivalent quantum extensions in terms of the conditional max, min, and von Neumann entropies.
  Here we formulate a discrete notion of nonexpansion that can be evaluated even at non-smooth points. Moreover, we show that a single conjecture, the discrete \emph{max}-QFC, suffices for deriving the QNEC, the Bousso bound, and key properties of both max and min entanglement wedges. Continuous numerical values need not be assigned, nor are the von Neumann or min-versions of the quantum expansion needed. Both our new notion of nonexpansion, and also the properties of conditional max entropies, are inherently asymmetric and outward directed from the input wedge. Thus the framework we develop here reduces and clarifies the axiomatic structure of semiclassical gravity, eliminating redundancies and fixing ambiguities.
  We also derive a new result: the strong subadditivity of the generalized smooth conditional max and min entropies of entanglement wedges.</description>

      <title>Mode-sum prescription for renormalized expectation values for a charged quantum scalar field on a charged black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new mode-sum prescription for the efficient computation of renormalized expectation values for a massive, charged, quantum scalar field propagating on a curved space-time background. Our method is applicable to any static, spherically-symmetric, four-dimensional space-time with a time-independent, background electrostatic potential and can be used to find the renormalized scalar condensate, current and stress-energy tensor. As an explicit example, we present a calculation of these quantities for a charged scalar field in the Hartle-Hawking state on a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole background.</description>

      <title>$\text{T}\overline{\text{T}}$ deformations from AdS$_2$ to dS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the formalism of $\text{T}\overline{\text{T}}$ deformations for quantum theories that are holographically dual to two-dimensional dilaton-gravity theories with Dirichlet boundary conditions. To better understand the microscopics of de Sitter space, we focus on deformations for which the dual bulk geometry flows from Anti-de Sitter to de Sitter space. We explore two distinct ways to achieve this: either through so-called centaur geometries that interpolate between AdS$_2$ and dS$_2$, or by a spherical dimensional reduction of $\text{T}\overline{\text{T}} + \Lambda_2$ theories that were proposed to give a microscopic interpretation of three-dimensional de Sitter entropy. We derive the microscopic energy spectrum, heat capacities, and deformed Cardy expressions for the thermodynamic entropy in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles for these two setups. In both setups a signature of the change from AdS to dS is that the heat capacity at a fixed deformation parameter of the boundary system changes sign, indicating the existence of a thermodynamically unstable de Sitter patch. Our findings provide important consistency conditions for holographic models of the dS$_2$ static patch.</description>

Abstract: The BV formalism is a well-established method for analyzing symmetries and quantization of field theories. In this paper we use the BV formalism to derive partition functions of gauge invariant operators up to equations of motions and their redundancies of selected theories.

      <title>$T^2$ deformations in the double-scaled SYK model: Stretched horizon thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently realized that the bulk dual of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model has both positive and negative Ricci curvature and is described by a dilaton-gravity theory with a $\sin(\Phi)$ potential arXiv:2404.03535. We study T$^2$-deformations in the DSSYK model after performing the ensemble averaging to probe regions of positive and approximately constant curvature. The dual finite cutoff interpretation of the deformation allows us to place the DSSYK model in the stretched horizon of the bulk geometry, partially realizing a conjecture of Susskind arXix:2109.14104. We show that the energy spectrum and thermodynamic entropy are well-defined for a contour reaching these regions. Importantly, the system displays a phase transition from a thermodynamically stable to an unstable configuration by varying its microcanonical temperature; unless it is located on any of the stretched horizons, which is always unstable. The thermodynamic properties in this model display an enhanced growth as the system approaches the stretched horizon, and it scrambles information at a (hyper)-fast rate.</description>

      <title>Holographic Entanglement Entropy for Brane-World Higher Derivative Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the splitting problem, it is difficult to derive the holographic entanglement entropy for general higher derivative gravity. Inspired by double holography and renormalized entanglement entropy, we develop a method to derive the generalized gravitational entropy for the brane-world higher derivative (BWHD) gravity. Remarkably, this approach is independent of the splitting problem. The so-called BWHD gravity is an effective theory on the brane, given by the counter terms of holographic renormalization. Interestingly, all solutions to Einstein gravity are also solutions to BWHD gravity. We first verify our approach can derive the correct results for curvature-squared gravity and then derive the holographic entanglement entropy for cubic BWHD gravity, which is the main result of this paper. We also derive the entropy of quartic BWHD gravity in flat space with constant extrinsic curvatures and perform several tests on our results. Finally, we briefly comment on our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Futaki invariants of the classical moduli space of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories determine whether they have a conformal fixed point in the IR. We systematically compute the Futaki invariants for a large family of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories coming from D3-branes probing Calabi-Yau 3-fold singularities whose bases are Gorenstein Fano surfaces. In particular, we focus on the toric case where the Fano surfaces are given by the 16 reflexive convex polygons and the moduli spaces are given by the corresponding toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds. We study the distribution of and conjecture new bounds on the Futaki invariants with respect to various topological and geometric quantities. These include the minimum volume of the Sasaki-Einstein base manifolds as well as the Chern and Euler numbers of the toric Fano surfaces. Even though the moduli spaces for the family of theories studied are known to be K-stable, our work sheds new light on how the topological and geometric quantities restrict the Futaki invariants for a plethora of moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>T-Duality Constraints on Genus Corrections in Effective Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-established that the dimensional reduction of the classical effective action of string theory on a circle of arbitrary radius remains invariant under Buscher transformations. In this work, we extend this symmetry to higher-genus levels to constrain the loop corrections to the effective action. By leveraging the validity of Buscher rules for any genus of the world-sheet, we propose that this symmetry persists at the loop level, but only when the effective action is reduced on a self-dual circle.</description>

      <title>Planar decomposition of bipartite HOMFLY polynomials in symmetric representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the recently discovered planar decomposition (Kauffman bracket) for the HOMFLY polynomials of bipartite knot/link diagrams to (anti)symmetrically colored HOMFLY polynomials. Cabling destroys planarity, but it is restored after projection to (anti)symmetric representations. This allows to go beyond arborescent calculus, which so far produced the majority of results for colored polynomials. Technicalities include combinations of projectors, and these can be handled rigorously, without any guess-work -- what can be also useful for other considerations, where reliable quantization was so far unavailable. We explicitly provide simple examples of calculation of the HOMFLY polynomials in symmetric representations with the use of our planar technique. These examples reveal what we call the bipartite evolution and the bipartite decomposition of squares of $\mathcal{R}$-matrices eigenvalues in the antiparallel channel.</description>

      <title>Topological 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, and $A_\infty$-categories of Six, Five, and Four-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is a continuation of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic (holomorphic) Floer homologies of seven, six, and five-manifolds, from the physics of a topologically-twisted 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory on a Spin$(7)$-manifold via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with $G_2$ instanton, Donaldson-Thomas, and Haydys-Witten configurations on the seven, six, and five-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define hyperk\"ahler Floer homologies specified by hypercontact three-manifolds, and symplectic Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. In turn, this will allow us to derive Atiyah-Floer type dualities between the various gauge-theoretic Floer homologies and symplectic intersection Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 8d theory, one can derive novel Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories that categorify Donaldson-Thomas, Haydys-Witten, and Vafa-Witten configurations on six, five, and four-manifolds, respectively, where an Atiyah-Floer type correspondence for the Donaldson-Thomas case can be established. Last but not least, topological invariance of the theory suggests a relation amongst these Floer homologies and Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories for certain Spin$(7)$-manifolds. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the conjectures by Donaldson-Thomas [2], Donaldson-Segal [3], Cherkis [4], Hohloch-Noetzel-Salamon [5], Salamon [6], Haydys [7], and Bousseau [8], and more.</description>

      <title>Thin-wall vacuum decay in the presence of a compact dimension meets the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposal of a rapid sign-switching cosmological constant in the late universe, mirroring a transition from anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) space, has significantly improved the fit to observational data and provides a compelling framework for ameliorating major cosmological tensions, such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. An attractive theoretical realisation that accommodates the AdS $\to$ dS transition relies on the Casimir forces of fields inhabiting the bulk of a 5-dimensional (5-dim) set up. Among the fields characterising the dark sector, there is a real scalar field $\phi$ endowed with a potential holding two local minima with very small difference in vacuum energy and bigger curvature (mass) of the lower one. Shortly after the false vacuum tunnels to its true vacuum state, $\phi$ becomes more massive and its contribution to the Casimir energy becomes exponentially suppressed. The tunneling process then changes the difference between the total number of fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom contributing to the quantum corrections of the vacuum energy, yielding the AdS $\to$ dS transition. We investigate the properties of this theoretical realisation to validate its main hypothesis and characterise free parameters of the model. We adopt the Coleman-de Luccia formalism for calculating the transition probability within the thin-wall approximation. We show that the Euclidean bounce configuration that drives the transition between $\phi$ vacua has associated at least a sixth order potential. We also show that distinctive features of the required vacuum decay to accommodate the AdS $\to$ dS transition are inconsistent with a 5-dim non-compact description of the instanton, for which the bounce is $O(5)$ symmetric, and instead call for a 5-dim instanton with a compact dimension, for which the bounce is $O(4)\times U(1)$ symmetric.</description>

      <title>A gauge-invariant measure for gauge fields on $\mathbb{CP}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theory living on a complex projective space $\mathbb{CP}^2$ as a way of gaining insights into (3+1)-dimensional QCD. In particular, we use a complex parametrization of gauge fields on which gauge transformations act homogeneously. This allows us to factor out the gauge degrees of freedom from the volume element leading to a manifestly gauge-invariant measure for the gauge-orbit space (the space of all gauge potentials modulo gauge transformations). The terms appearing in the measure that are of particular interest are mass-like terms for the gauge-invariant modes of the gauge fields. Since these mass terms come with dimensional parameters they are significant in the context of dimensional transmutation. Moreover, the existence of local gauge-invariant mass terms on $\mathbb{CP}^2$ could be related to Schwinger-Dyson calculations of the soft gluon mass. Finally, we argue that there is a kinematic regime in which the theory can be approximated by a 4d Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) theory. This result can be used to draw similarities between the mechanism of confinement in four and (2+1) dimensions.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Bananas with EOW Branes and Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study and generalize the spacetime banana proposal for computing correlation functions of huge operators. First, we introduce time-like and space-like EOW branes into the proposal and demonstrate that: 1) a holographic dual of the one-point function in a BCFT can be obtained and its modified on-shell action reproduces the expected BCFT result; and 2) the GHY term on the stretched horizon can be replaced by the action of an EOW brane which wraps the horizon. Next, we discuss the two (one)-point function of huge spinning operators described by a rotating black hole in the bulk. We show that simply adding a GHY term on the stretched horizon is insufficient to reproduce the CFT results; instead, the appropriate modified action should be the micro-canonical action. Finally. we revisit the existing approaches for computing correlation functions using the gravity on-shell action of conical geometry or Ba$\tilde{\text{n}}$ados geometries. Surprisingly, we find that the on-shells actions of the Ba$\tilde{\text{n}}$ados geometries or the gravity solutions in the Fefferman-Graham gauge yield unexpected incorrect results.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking quantum chaos from geometric complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that there is a strong interplay between quantum complexity and quantum chaos. In this work, we consider a new method to study geometric complexity for interacting non-Gaussian quantum mechanical systems to benchmark the quantum chaos in a well-known oscillator model. In particular, we study the circuit complexity for the unitary time-evolution operator of a non-Gaussian bosonic quantum mechanical system. Our results indicate that, within some limitations, geometric complexity can indeed be a good indicator of quantum chaos.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores how magnetic fields affect the Casimir effect within the context of a simple quasi-1D interacting fermionic system. A novel phenomenon emerges, resulting from the interaction between external magnetic fields and boundary conditions, which alters the ground state in complex ways and leads to first-order phase transitions among various ground states, specifically inhomogeneous solutions with differing node counts. We calculate the Casimir force, which exhibits discontinuities (jumps) at the transition points between the different ground states.</description>

      <title>Holographic Boundary Conformal Field Theory within Horndeski Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate entanglement islands and the Page curve in the framework of Horndeski gravity on a Karch-Randall braneworld background. In particular, treating the holographic boundary conformal field theory analytically we find that the Horndeski parameters significantly alter the behavior of the Page curve compared to standard general relativity, a feature caused by the nontrivial geometry induced by the Horndeski scalar field. Interestingly enough, the geometry far from the AdS limit plays a more significant role compared to previous studies. This suggests that Horndeski gravity introduces important modifications to the distribution of quantum information in the holographic model. Finally, we claim that holographic consistency can be used reversely to impose constraints on Horndeski gravity itself, providing a new tool for probing the validity of modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>From $SU(2)$ holonomies to holographic duality via tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor networks provide a powerful tool for studying many-body quantum systems, particularly making quantum simulations more efficient. In this article, we construct a tensor network representation of the spin network states, which correspond to $SU(2)$ gauge-invariant discrete field theories. Importantly, the spin network states play a central role in the Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) approach to the Planck scale physics. Our focus is on the Ising-type spin networks, which provide a basic model of quantum space in LQG. It is shown that the tensor network approach improves the previously introduced methods of constructing quantum circuits for the Ising spin networks by reducing the number of qubits involved. It is also shown that the tensor network approach is convenient for implementing holographic states involving the bulk-boundary conjecture, which contributes to establishing a link between LQG and holographic duality.</description>

      <title>Holographic Weyl semimetals with dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals (WSMs) represent three-dimensional gapless topological states of matter characterized by the monopole-antimonopole pairs of the Abelian Berry curvature at the band-touching points in the momentum space. As a consequence, they display chiral anomalies that can be realized through a crystalline dislocation defect associated with the discrete lattice translational symmetry. Using the last two features of WSMs as our guiding principles, we construct a holographic WSM with dislocations by utilizing the ($4+1$)-dimensional Chern-Simons gravitational theory in anti-de Sitter spacetime. This theory encodes the chiral anomaly and incorporates torsion, thereby holographically capturing lattice dislocation defects. By explicitly solving the equations of motion employing the asymptotic expansion near the boundary, we show that such a theory at the ($3+1$)-dimensional spacetime boundary possesses axially-symmetric solutions that can be interpreted as holographic WSMs with dislocation defects at finite temperature, encoded through a black hole in the bulk gravity. Such solutions, at the same time, feature the chiral anomaly proportional to the Nieh-Yan invariant. Our results should therefore motivate future studies of the holographic topological phases by employing bulk gravitational Chern-Simons theories and establishing torsion as a holographic counterpart of crystalline dislocation defects.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Kerr Effective Black Hole Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover the thermodynamical properties of a class of non-asymptotically flat geometries, referred here as the Kerr effective geometries, that realize the hidden symmetries of Kerr black hole spacetimes via Teukolsky's equation in the theory of linear gravitational perturbations. While the thermodynamic properties, such as entropy, remain the same as those of Kerr black holes, the asymptotic charges, as we will demonstrate, are different. In this new framework with the ambient flat asymptotic boundary removed, we derive the mass and angular momentum of the Kerr effective geometries using the regulated Komar integral and the Brown-York prescription. We also obtain explicit expressions for the corresponding gauge potentials and electric charges. By deriving the asymptotic charges, we demonstrate that both the first law of black hole mechanics and the Smarr law hold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A limiting case is considered in which the causal action principle for causal fermion systems describing Minkowski space gives rise to the linear Fock space dynamics of quantum electrodynamics. The quantum nature of the bosonic field is a consequence of the stochastic description of a multitude of fluctuating fields coupled to non-commuting operators, taking into account dephasing effects. The scaling of all error terms is specified. Our analysis leads to the concept of holographic mixing, which is introduced and explained in detail.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Networks for Functional Differential Equations: Cylindrical Approximation and Its Convergence Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the first learning scheme for functional differential equations (FDEs). FDEs play a fundamental role in physics, mathematics, and optimal control. However, the numerical analysis of FDEs has faced challenges due to its unrealistic computational costs and has been a long standing problem over decades. Thus, numerical approximations of FDEs have been developed, but they often oversimplify the solutions. To tackle these two issues, we propose a hybrid approach combining physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with the \textit{cylindrical approximation}. The cylindrical approximation expands functions and functional derivatives with an orthonormal basis and transforms FDEs into high-dimensional PDEs. To validate the reliability of the cylindrical approximation for FDE applications, we prove the convergence theorems of approximated functional derivatives and solutions. Then, the derived high-dimensional PDEs are numerically solved with PINNs. Through the capabilities of PINNs, our approach can handle a broader class of functional derivatives more efficiently than conventional discretization-based methods, improving the scalability of the cylindrical approximation. As a proof of concept, we conduct experiments on two FDEs and demonstrate that our model can successfully achieve typical $L^1$ relative error orders of PINNs $\sim 10^{-3}$. Overall, our work provides a strong backbone for physicists, mathematicians, and machine learning experts to analyze previously challenging FDEs, thereby democratizing their numerical analysis, which has received limited attention.

      <title>Regulating Sommerfeld resonances for multi-state systems and higher partial waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range attractive interactions between dark matter particles can significantly enhance their annihilation, particularly at low velocities. This ``Sommerfeld enhancement'' is typically computed by evaluating the deformation of the two-particle wavefunction due to the long-range potential, while ignoring the physics associated with the annihilation, and then scaling the appropriate annihilation matrix elements by factors that depend on the wavefunction in the limit where the particles approach zero relative separation. It has long been recognized that this approach is a valid approximation only in the limit where the annihilation rate is small, and breaks down in the regime where the enhanced annihilation rate approaches the unitarity bound, in which case ignoring the impact of the annihilation physics on the two-particle wavefunction cannot be justified and leads to apparent violations of unitarity. In the case where the physics relevant to annihilation occurs at a parametrically shorter distance scale (higher energy scale) compared with the long-range potential, we provide a simple prescription for correcting the Sommerfeld enhancement for the effects of the short-range physics, valid for all partial waves and for systems where multiple states are coupled by the long-range potential.</description>

      <title>Angular integrals with three denominators via IBP, mass reduction, dimensional shift, and differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angular integrals arise in a wide range of perturbative quantum field theory calculations. In this work we investigate angular integrals with three denominators in $d=4-2\varepsilon$ dimensions. We derive integration-by-parts relations for this class of integrals, leading to explicit recursion relations and a reduction to a small set of master integrals. Using a differential equation approach we establish results up to order $\varepsilon$ for general integer exponents and masses. Here, reduction identities for the number of masses, known results for two-denominator integrals, and a general dimensional-shift identity for angular integrals considerably reduce the required amount of work. For the first time we find for angular integrals a term contributing proportional to a Euclidean Gram determinant in the $\varepsilon$-expansion. This coefficient is expressed as a sum of Clausen functions with intriguing connections to Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic geometry. The results of this manuscript are applicable to phase-space calculations with multiple observed final-state particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two formulations of superfluidity are reviewed: Landau's phenomenological two-fluid model and a relativistic effective field theory description. We demonstrate how the two-fluid formalism can be recovered from the nonrelativistic limit of the relativistic effective theory at finite temperatures. We show how self-gravitating, nonrelativistic superfluids are obtained from the Newtonian limit of the relativistic approach on curved spaces. The concepts are presented in an accessible manner for readers who may not be deeply familiar with superfluidity from a condensed matter perspective.</description>

Abstract: A connection has recently been proposed between periodically driven systems known as Floquet insulators in continuous time and static fermion theories in discrete time. This connection has been established in a $(1+1)$-dimensional free theory, where an explicit mapping between the spectra of a Floquet insulator and a discrete-time Dirac fermion theory has been formulated. Here we investigate the potential of static discrete-time theories to capture Floquet physics in higher dimensions, where so-called anomalous Floquet topological insulators can emerge that feature chiral edge states despite having bulk bands with zero Chern number. Starting from a particular model of an anomalous Floquet system, we provide an example of a static discrete-time theory whose bulk spectrum is an exact analytic match for the Floquet spectrum. The spectra with open boundary conditions in a particular strip geometry also match up to finite-size corrections. However, the models differ in several important respects. The discrete-time theory is spatially anisotropic, so that the spectra do not agree for all lattice terminations, e.g. other strip geometries or on half spaces. This difference can be attributed to the fact that the static discrete-time model is quasi-one-dimensional in nature and therefore has a different bulk-boundary correspondence than the Floquet model.</description>

      <title>The $D$-dimensional charged AdS black holes solutions in polytropic dark energy from Barrow entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper mainly aims to solve the Anti deSitter Black Holes (AdS BH) under the Barrow entropy under polytropic gas fluid, especially the Chaplygin Gas. First, we develop this last polytropic model in detail to then obtain the possible solutions and thermodynamic conditions on the Energy-Momentum and the Barrow Entropy for spacetimes of spatial dimension $D&gt;3$. Then, we focus on thermidynamic solutions and the different impacts on the Barrow entropy of the black hole, the temperature profile, the mass and the various physical quantities involved. Afterwards, we focus on the specific cases of the solutions of dimensions $D=4$ and $5$ in order to concretely test the models, especially from the point of view of the thermodynamic topology. Finally, we generalize everything by elaborating and testing the stability of the models to arrive at the thermal geometry of the AdS BH.</description>

      <title>The two-body problem in Yukawa gravity (a revisited version) and in Buckingham gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Keplerian-like parametrization of the two-body problem in Yukawa gravity studied in the literature. Some inconsistencies which spoil the Bertrand's theorem, observed, in particular, in the formulae for the pericenter's advance are resolved. Moreover, inspired in this kind of study, we couple the Buckingham potential, a variation of the Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential, with the gravitational Newtonian potential and find a Keplerian-like parametrization for the solution of the two-body problem in this sort of gravity. The outcomes for the advance of the pericenter in both types of gravity are corroborated by using the Landau and Lifshitz's method.</description>

      <title>Unified Lagrangians for gravity and gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new Lagrangian formulation of General Relativity with cosmological constant, coupled to Yang-Mills gauge theory. The formulation has a manifest color/kinematics-dual structure, both in the choice of fundamental fields and in the way they appear in the Lagrangian. The color/kinematics duality is between gauge and Lorentz generators. The fundamental fields consists of 1-form connections and 0-form curvatures -- a structure inspired by higher-spin gravity. The new formulation can be arrived at by combining appropriate versions of the Plebanski and Chalmers-Siegel Lagrangians, and integrating out the Plebanski 2-form. The construction comes in chiral and non-chiral versions. The chiral version is slightly simpler, and highlights the self-dual sector. The non-chiral one makes parity manifest, and doesn't force us to complexify the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the time-dependent Dunkl-Pauli oscillator in two dimensions. We constructed the Dunkl-Pauli Hamiltonian, which incorporates a time-varying magnetic field and a harmonic oscillator characterized by time-dependent mass and frequency, initially in Cartesian coordinates. Subsequently, we reformulated the Hamiltonian in polar coordinates and analyzed the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Dunkl angular operator, deriving exact solutions using the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method. Our findings regarding the total quantum phase factor and wave functions reveal the significant impact of Dunkl operators on quantum systems, providing precise expressions for wave functions and energy eigenvalues. This work enhances the understanding of quantum systems with deformed symmetries and suggests avenues for future research in quantum mechanics and mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>Measuring the boson mass of fuzzy dark matter with stellar proper motions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) is among the most suitable candidates to replace WIMPs and to resolve the puzzling mystery of dark matter. A galactic dark matter halo made of these ultralight bosonic particles leads to the formation of a solitonic core surrounded by quantum interference patterns that, on average, reproduce a Navarro-Frenk-White-like mass density profile in the outskirts of the halo. The structure of such a core is determined once the boson mass and the total mass of the halo are set. We investigated the capability of future astrometric Theia-like missions to detect the properties of such a halo within the FDM model, namely the boson mass and the core radius. To this aim, we built mock catalogs containing three-dimensional positions and velocities of stars within a target dwarf galaxy. We exploited these catalogs using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm and found that measuring the proper motion of at least 2000 stars within the target galaxy, with uncertainty $\sigma_v \leq 3$ km/s on the velocity components, will constrain the boson mass and the core radius with 3\% accuracy. Furthermore, the transition between the solitonic core and the outermost NFW-like density profile could be detected with an uncertainty of 7\%. Such results would not only help to confirm the existence of FDM, but they would also be useful for alleviating the current tension between galactic and cosmological estimations of the boson mass, or demonstrating the need for multiple particles with a broad mass spectrum as naturally arise String Axiverse.</description>

      <title>A Field Theory Framework of Incompressible Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study develops an effective theoretical framework that couples two vector fields: the velocity field $\mathbf{u}$ and an auxiliary vorticity field $\boldsymbol{\xi}$. Together, these fields form a larger conserved dynamical system. Within this framework, the incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equation and a complementary vorticity equation with negative viscosity are derived. By introducing the concept of light-cone vorticity $\boldsymbol{\eta}_\pm = \mathbf{w} \pm \boldsymbol{\xi}$, the paper constructs a unified framework for coupled dynamics. Furthermore, it explores the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking from $SU(2)$ gauge theory to $U(1) \times U(1)$, which leads to the emergence of the coupled vector field theory in the non-relativistic limit. This approach uncovers a connection between fluid dynamics and fundamental gauge theories, suggesting that the NS equations describe a subsystem where dissipation results from energy transfer between the velocity and auxiliary fields. The study concludes by linking the complete dynamical framework to the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen-Zumino (ANOZ) theory, a non-Abelian generalization of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, offering new insights into fluid dynamics and quantum fluid theory.</description>

Abstract: We present the renormalization constant of the pseudoscalar operator defined with a non-anticommuting $\gamma_5$ in dimensional regularization up to four-loop order in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Furthermore, by virtue of renormalization-group invariance of the relation between the scalar and the pseudoscalar operator, we predict the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ factor of the renormalization constant for the latter at five-loop order in QCD.</description>

Abstract: This letter introduces a novel analytical approach to calculating phase-space integrals, crucial for precision in particle physics. We develop a method to compute angular components using multifold Mellin-Barnes integrals, yielding results in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms for integrals involving three denominators. Our results include expressions for massless momenta up to $\cal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ and for one massive momentum up to $\cal{O}(\epsilon)$. Additionally, we derive recursion relations that reduce integrals with higher powers of denominators to simpler ones. We detail how to combine the angular part with the radial one which requires a careful handling of singularities.</description>

      <title>More on the Operator Space Entanglement (OSE): R\'enyi OSE, revivals, and integrability breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the R\'enyi Operator Space Entanglement ($OSE$) entropies $S_n$ across several one-dimensional integrable and chaotic models. As a paradigmatic integrable system, we first consider the so-called rule $54$ chain. Our numerical results reveal that the R\'enyi $OSE$ entropies of diagonal operators with nonzero trace saturate at long times, in contrast with the behavior of von Neumann entropy. Oppositely, the R\'enyi entropies of traceless operators exhibit logarithmic growth with time, with the prefactor of this growth depending in a nontrivial manner on $n$. Notably, at long times, the complete operator entanglement spectrum ($ES$) of an operator can be reconstructed from the spectrum of its traceless part. We observe a similar pattern in the $XXZ$ chain, suggesting universal behavior. Additionally, we consider dynamics in nonintegrable deformations of the $XXZ$ chain. Finite-time corrections do not allow to access the long-time behavior of the von Neumann entropy. On the other hand, for $n&gt;1$ the growth of the entropies is milder, and it is compatible with a sublinear growth, at least for operators associated with global conserved quantities. Finally, we show that in finite-size integrable systems, $S_n$ exhibit strong revivals, which are washed out when integrability is broken.</description>

      <title>Manifestly Covariant Worldline Actions from Coadjoint Orbits. Part I: Generalities and Vectorial Descriptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive manifestly covariant actions of spinning particles starting from coadjoint orbits of isometry groups, by using Hamiltonian reductions. We show that the defining conditions of a classical Lie group can be treated as Hamiltonian constraints which generate the coadjoint orbits of another, dual, Lie group. In case of (inhomogeneous) orthogonal groups, the dual groups are (centrally-extended inhomogeneous) symplectic groups. This defines a symplectic dual pair correspondence between the coadjoint orbits of the isometry group and those of the dual Lie group, whose quantum version is the reductive dual pair correspondence \`a la Howe. We show explicitly how various particle species arise from the classification of coadjoint orbits of Poincar\'e and (A)dS symmetry. In the Poincar\'e case, we recover the data of the Wigner classification, which includes continuous spin particles, (spinning) tachyons and null particles with vanishing momenta, besides the usual massive and massless spinning particles. In (A)dS case, our classification results are not only consistent with the pattern of the corresponding unitary irreducible representations observed in the literature, but also contain novel information. In dS, we find the presence of partially massless spinning particles, but continuous spin particles, spinning tachyons and null particles are absent. The AdS case shows the largest diversity of particle species. It has all particles species of Poincar\'e symmetry except for the null particle, but allows in addition various exotic entities such as one parameter extension of continuous particles and conformal particles living on the boundary of AdS. Notably, we also find a large class of particles living in "bitemporal" AdS space, including ones where mass and spin play an interchanged role. We also discuss the relative inclusion structure of the corresponding orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the study in \href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP11(2022)013}{JHEP11(2022)013} incorporating the AdS/CFT duality to establish a relationship between the local temperatures (Tolman temperatures) of a large (AdS) spherical and a (AdS) planar Schwarzschild black hole near the AdS boundary considering Gauss-Bonnet curvature correction in the gravitational action. We have shown that the higher curvature corrections appear in the local temperature relationship due to the inclusion of Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk. By transforming the metric into Fefferman-Graham form, we have calculated the energy density of the conformal fluid at the boundary. The obtained result contains finite coupling corrections which are holographically induced by the Gauss-Bonnet curvature correction in the bulk theory. Following the well known approach of fluid/gravity duality, the energy density of the conformal fluid at the boundary is then compared with the black body radiation energy density. This comparison shows that the energy density is proportional to the temperature of the conformal fluid. The temperature of the conformal fluid is then shown to be related to the Tolman temperature of the black hole which then eventually helps us to establish both the Hawking temperature and Tolman temperature relationship between large spherically symmetric and planar Schwarzschild black holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity near the AdS boundary.</description>

      <title>Inflationary non-Gaussianities in alpha vacua and consistency with conformal symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the conformal invariance of inflationary non-Gaussianities associated with scalar fluctuations in a non-Bunch-Davies initial state, known as the $\alpha$-vacuum, in single-field slow-roll inflation. The $\alpha$-vacuum is a one-parameter family of states, including the Bunch-Davies one, that preserves the conformal symmetry of inflationary dynamics in a nearly de-Sitter space-time. Working within the leading slow-roll approximation, we compute the four-point scalar correlator (the trispectrum) in $\alpha$-vacuum using the in-in formalism. We check that the conformal Ward identities are met between the three and four-point scalar $\alpha$-vacua correlators. Surprisingly, this contrasts the previously reported negative result of the Ward identities being violated between the two and the three-point correlators. We have also extended the wave-functional method, previously used for correlators with Bunch-Davies initial condition, to compute the three and four-point scalar correlators in $\alpha$-vacua. The results obtained from the wave-function method match the corresponding in-in results, adding further justification to our check of Ward identities with $\alpha$-vacua correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the application of BRST and BRST-BV approaches to construct the generic off-shell local Lorentz covariant cubic interaction vertices for irreducible massless and massive higher integer spin fields (as the candidates for massive particles in the Dark Matter problem) on $d$-dimensional Minkowski spaces. It is shown that equivalence among two Lagrangian dynamics for the same cubically interacting fields with given masses and spins obtained by means of the approach with complete BRST, $Q$, operator and of one with incomplete BRST, $Q_c$, operator in presence of consistent off-shell holonomic (traceless) constraints can be uplifted from the equivalence of the Lagrangians for free higher spin fields. We found that to get non-contradictory Lagrangians for irreducible interacting higher-spin fields within approach with $Q_c$ operator, together with off-shell algebraic constraints in addition to necessary condition of superconmmuting of $Q_c$ with appropriate holonomic constraints on the field and gauge parameter vectors, these constraints should form Abelian superalgebra both with BRST operator above and with operators of cubic vertices.</description>

      <title>Higher Gauge Theory and Integrability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of integrable systems from a gauge theoretic perspective. This development originated with the introduction of $4$d Chern-Simons theory with defects, which provided a systematic framework for constructing two-dimensional integrable systems. In this article, we propose a novel approach to studying higher-dimensional integrable models employing techniques from higher category theory. Starting with higher Chern-Simons theory on the $4$-manifold $\mathbb{R}\times Y$, we complexify and compactify the real line to $\mathbb{C}P^1$ and introduce the disorder defect $\omega=z^{-1}\mathrm{d} z $. This procedure defines a holomorphic five-dimensional variant of higher Chern-Simons theory, which, when endowed with suitable boundary conditions, allows for the localisation to a three-dimensional theory on $Y$. The equations of motion of the resulting model are equivalent to the flatness of a $2$-connection $(L,H)$, that we then use to construct the corresponding higher holonomies. We prove that these are invariants of homotopies relative boundary, which enables the construction of conserved quantities. The latter are labelled by both the categorical characters of a Lie crossed-module and the infinite number of homotopy classes of surfaces relative boundary in $Y$. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the $3$d theory has left and right acting symmetries whose current algebra is given by an infinite dimensional centrally extended affine Lie 2-algebra. Both of these conditions are direct higher homotopy analogues of the properties satisfied by the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten CFT, which we therefore interpret as facets of integrable structures.</description>

      <title>Black holes with electroweak hair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct static and axially symmetric magnetically charged hairy black holes in the gravity-coupled Weinberg-Salam theory. Large black holes merge with the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) family, while the small ones are extremal and support a hair in the form of a ring-shaped electroweak condensate carrying superconducting W-currents and up to $22\%$ of the total magnetic charge. The extremal solutions are asymptotically RN with a mass {\it below} the total charge, $M&lt;|Q|$, due to the negative Zeeman energy of the condensate interacting with the black hole magnetic field. Therefore, they cannot decay into RN black holes. As their charge increases, they show a phase transition when the horizon symmetry changes from spherical to oblate. At this point they have the mass typical for planetary size black holes of which $\approx 11\%$ is stored in the hair. Being obtained within a well-tested theory, our solutions are expected to be physically relevant.</description>

      <title>Classicality of Stochastic Noise Away From Quasi-de Sitter Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that a coarse-grained scalar field living on a de~Sitter (dS) background exhibits classical stochastic behavior, driven by a noise whose amplitude is set by the Hubble constant $H$. The coarse-graining is achieved by discarding wave numbers larger than a cutoff $\sigma a H$ and demanding that $\sigma \ll 1$. Similar results hold for quasi-dS space, where the equation of state parameter $w$ is close to $-1$. Here we present exact expressions for the noise amplitude of a free massless field on an inflationary background with constant $w &lt; -1/3$. We find that a classical stochastic behavior can emerge for $-5/3 &lt; w &lt; -1/3$. Furthermore, as we move away from $w = -1$ and approach $w = -1/3$, the constraint $\sigma \ll 1$ is relaxed and larger cutoffs ($\sigma \sim 1$) become feasible, too. However, in general the amplitude of the noise depends on $\sigma$, except in the quasi-dS regime $w \approx -1$.</description>

      <title>Mellin amplitudes for $AdS_3 \times S^3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are holographic superconformal theories in all dimensions between two and six which allow arbitrary tree-level four-point functions to be fixed by basic consistency conditions. Although Mellin space is usually the most efficient setting for imposing these contraints, four-point functions in two dimensions have thus far been an exception due to their more intricate dependence on the conformal cross-ratios. In this paper, we introduce a simple fix which exploits the relation between a parity-odd conformal block in two dimensions and a parity-even conformal block in four dimensions. We then apply the resulting toolkit to a study of the paradigmatic holographic theory in two dimensions which is the D1-D5 CFT. For correlators involving Kaluza-Klein modes of the tensor multiplet, this analysis reproduces results which were previously obtained using hidden conformal symmetry. With four Kaluza-Klein modes of the graviton multiplet, it yields new results including a compact formula for the correlators of all pairwise identical operators,</description>

      <title>Cosmology with non-conformal holographic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect on cosmological evolution of a strongly coupled quantum field that undergoes renormalization group flow from a UV CFT to an IR CFT. The field theory is defined by perturbation of a holographic CFT by a relevant operator associated with a bulk scalar field that evolves from a local maximum of its potential near the boundary to a local minimum of its potential deep in the bulk. By studying the gravity solutions dual to this theory on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$, we find that the equation of state parameter $w$ for the field theory has the conformal behavior $w=1/3$ for high and low temperatures, but dips to lower values for intermediate temperatures. Thus, at scales where the field theory has significant scale-dependence, its effect on cosmological evolution is intermediate between matter and radiation. Compared to the unperturbed UV CFT (which acts as radiation), the energy density experiences less dilution during the expansion as a result of the RG flow, and the rate of expansion is greater.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study six-dimensional $F(4)$ gauged supergravity coupled to four vector multiplets with a non-semisimple $ISO(3)\times U(1)$ gauge group. This gauged supergravity arises from a consistent truncation of type IIB string theory on $S^2\times \Sigma$ with $\Sigma$ being a Riemann surface. We find that the gauged supergravity admits three $SO(3)$ symmetric vacua given by $N=(1,1)$ supersymmetric $AdS_6$, non-supersymmetric $AdS_6$ and $dS_6$ geometries. We compute all scalar masses at all of these critical points and find that only the supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacuum is stable. By truncating to $SO(3)\times U(1)$ and $SO(2)\times U(1)$ invariant sectors, we study holographic RG flow solutions from this critical point to a number of non-conformal phases of the dual $N=2$ SCFT in five dimensions. Finally, we give some examples of supersymmetric Janus solutions describing conformal interfaces within the five-dimensional SCFT. All of these solutions provide first holographic results from matter-coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity with non-semisimple gauge groups.</description>

Abstract: We study holographic solutions describing RG flows across dimensions from five-dimensional $N=2$ SCFT to SCFTs in three and two dimensions using matter-coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity with $ISO(3)\times U(1)$ gauge group. By performing topological twists implemented by $SO(2)$, $SO(2)\times SO(2)$ and $SO(3)$ gauge fields, we find a number of $AdS_4\times H^2$ and $AdS_3\times H^3$ preserving eight and four supercharges. These geometries are identified with conformal fixed points in three and two dimensions, respectively. The corresponding flow solutions are obtained numerically and can be interpreted as black membranes and black strings in asymptotically $AdS_6$ space. In addition, we have constructed charged domain wall solutions with $AdS_2\times S^3$ and $AdS_3\times S^2$ slicing. These solutions are supported by a non-vanishing two-form field and describe conformal line and surface defects within the $N=2$ SCFT in five dimensions, respectively. All of these solutions can be uplifted to type IIB theory via consistent truncations on $S^2\times \Sigma$ with $\Sigma$ being a Riemann surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that a consistent coupling of a quantum theory to gravity requires an extension of ordinary `first order' Riemannian geometry to second order Riemannian geometry, which incorporates both a line element and an area element. This extension results in a misalignment between the dimension of the manifold and the dimension of the tangent spaces. In particular, we find that for a 4-dimensional spacetime, tangent spaces become 18-dimensional. We then discuss the construction of physical theories within this framework, which involves the introduction of terms that are quadratic in derivatives in the action. On a flat spacetime, the quadratic sector is perpendicular to the first order sector and only affects the normalization of the path integral, whereas in a curved spacetime the quadratic sector couples to the first order sector. Moreover, we show that, despite the introduction of higher order derivatives, the Ostragradski instability can be avoided, due to an order mixing of the two sectors. Finally, we comment on extensions to higher order geometry and on relations with non-commutative and generalized geometry.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric AdS$_6$ black holes from ISO(3)xU(1) F(4) gauged supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric $AdS_6$ black holes from matter-coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity coupled to four vector multiplets with $ISO(3)\times U(1)$ gauge group. This gauged supergravity admits a maximally supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacuum with $SO(3)\subset ISO(3)$ symmetry. We find a number of new supersymmetric $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_4$ solutions by performing topological twists along $\mathcal{M}_4$. For $\mathcal{M}_4$ being a product of two Riemann surfaces $\Sigma\times \widetilde{\Sigma}$, we perform a twist by $SO(2)\times U(1)$ gauge fields and find $AdS_2\times \Sigma\times \widetilde{\Sigma}$ solutions for at least one of the Riemann surface being negatively curved. For $\mathcal{M}_4$ being a Kahler four-cycle $\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{K}4}$, a twist by $SO(2)\times U(1)$ gauge fields leads to $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_{\textrm{K}4}^-$ solutions for negatively curved $\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{K}4}$. Finally, performing a twist by turning on $SO(3)$ gauge fields in the case of $\mathcal{M}_4$ being a Cayley four-cycle $\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{C}4}$ also leads to $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_{\textrm{C}4}^-$ solutions for negatively curved $\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{C}4}$. We give numerical black hole solutions interpolating between all of these $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_4$ near horizon geometries and the asymptotically locally $AdS_6$ vacuum. All of the solutions can be uplifted to type IIB theory via consistent truncations on $S^2\times \Sigma$ leading to a new class of supersymmetric $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_4\times S^2\times \Sigma$ solutions.</description>

Abstract: Truncating the Dyson-Schwinger (DS) equations in quantum field theory presents a practical challenge. In this paper, we consider the zero-dimensional prototype of the path integrals in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Using the Lefschetz thimble decomposition and the saddle point expansion, we derive multiple asymptotic formal series of the correlation function, which are associated with the (non-)perturbative saddle points. Furthermore, we reconstruct the exact correlation function employing the Borel resummation. Based on these exact correlation functions, we propose a truncation method of the DS equations using the large $n$ asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the construction of the renormalized trace $\Theta$ of the Energy-Momentum tensor in the four-dimensional $\lambda\phi^4$ theory,using dimensional regularization in $d=4-\ve$ dimensions. We first construct several basic correlators such as $\braket{\phi^2 \phi\phi}$, $\braket{\phi^4 \phi \phi}$ to order $\lambda^2$ and from these the correlators $\braket{K_I \phi \phi}$ and $\braket{K_I K_J}$ with $K_I$ the basis of dimension $d$ operators. We then match the limit of their expressions on the Wilson-Fisher fixed point to the corresponding expressions obtained in Conformal Field Theory. Then, using the 3-point function $\braket{\Theta\phi\phi}$, we construct the operator $\Theta$ as a certain linear combination of the basis operators, using the requirements that $\Theta$ should vanish on the fixed point and that it should have zero anomalous dimension. Finally, we compute the 2-point function $\braket{\Theta\Theta}$ and we show that it obeys an eigenvalue equation that gives additional information about the internal structure of the Energy-Momentum tensor operator to what is already contained in its Callan-Symanzik equation.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable models for 2+1D topological phases derived from crossed modules of semisimple Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an exactly solvable model for 2+1D topological phases of matter on a triangulated surface derived from a crossed module of semisimple finite-dimensional Hopf algebras, the `Hopf-algebraic higher Kitaev model'. This model generalizes both the Kitaev quantum double model for a semisimple Hopf algebra and the full higher Kitaev model derived from a 2-group, and can hence be interpreted as a Hopf-algebraic discrete higher gauge theory.
  We construct a family of crossed modules of semisimple Hopf algebras, $(\mathscr{F}_{\mathbb{C}}(X) \otimes \mathbb{C}E \xrightarrow{\partial} \mathscr{F}_{\mathbb{C}}(Y) \rtimes \mathbb{C} G, \triangleright)$, that depends on four finite groups, $E,G,X$ and $Y$. We calculate the ground-state spaces of the resulting model on a triangulated surface when $G=E=\{1\}$ and when $Y=\{1\}$, prove that those ground-state spaces are canonically independent of the triangulations, and so depend only on the underlying surface; and moreover we find a 2+1D TQFT whose state spaces on surfaces give the ground-state spaces. These TQFTs are particular cases of Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT and hence the state spaces assigned to surfaces are free vector spaces on sets of homotopy classes of maps from a surface to homotopy finite spaces, in this case obtained as classifying spaces of finite groupoids and finite crossed modules of groupoids.
  We leave it as an open problem whether the ground-state space of the Hopf-algebraic higher Kitaev model on a triangulated surface is independent of the triangulation for general crossed modules of semisimple Hopf algebras, whether a TQFT always exists whose state space on a surface gives the ground-state space of the model, and whether the ground-state space of the model obtained from $E,G,X,Y$ can always be given a homotopical explanation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the package {\sc NeatIBP}, which automatically generates small-size integration-by-parts (IBP) identities for Feynman integrals. Based on the syzygy and module intersection techniques, the generated IBP identities' propagator degree is controlled and thus the size of the system of IBP identities is shorter than that generated by the standard Laporta algorithm. This package is powered by the computer algebra systems {\sc Mathematica} and {\sc Singular}, and the library {\sc SpaSM}. It is parallelized on the level of Feynman integral sectors. The generated small-size IBP identities can subsequently be used for either finite field reduction or analytic reduction. We demonstrate the capabilities of this package on several multi-loop IBP examples.</description>

Abstract: The Sommerfeld-Page equation describes the non-relativistic dynamics of a classical electron modeled by a sphere of finite size with a uniform surface charge density. The Sommerfeld-Page equation is a delay differential equation, and almost no exact results on solutions of this equation was known. However, the progress has been made, especially in the last few years, and recently an analytical solution was found for an almost identical delay differential equation, which arose in the context of mathematical modeling of COVID-19 epidemics.

      <title>Underdetermination of dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07482v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is compelling evidence that the Universe is undergoing a late phase of accelerated expansion. One of the simplest explanations for this behaviour is the presence of dark energy. A plethora of microphysical models for dark energy have been proposed. The hope is that, with the ever increasing precision of cosmological surveys, it will be possible to precisely pin down the model. We show that this is unlikely and that, at best, we will have a phenomenological description for the microphysics of dark energy. Furthermore, we argue that the current phenomenological prescriptions are ill-equipped for shedding light on the fundamental theory of dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of the acceleration of magnetic monopoles in intergalactic magnetic fields. We demonstrate that monopoles with intermediate to low masses can be accelerated to relativistic velocities. This can significantly affect direct and indirect searches for magnetic monopoles. As an example, we show that the Parker bound is relaxed in the presence of intergalactic fields. We also find that a cosmic population of monopoles can produce significant backreaction on the intergalactic fields.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity and gluon cascades in the high energy limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out an interesting connection between the mathematical framework of the Krylov basis, which is used to quantify quantum complexity, and the entanglement entropy in high-energy QCD. In particular, we observe that the cascade equation of the dipole model is equivalent to the $SL(2,R)$ Schrodinger equation in the Krylov basis. Consequently, the Krylov complexity corresponds to the average distribution of partons and the Krylov entropy is the counterpart the entanglement entropy computations of \cite{Kharzeev:2017qzs}. Our work not only brings new tools for exploring quantum information and complexity in QCD, but also gives hope for experimental tests of some of the recent, physical probes of quantum complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that modular symmetry may solve the strong CP problem without axions, by producing a vanishing QCD angle while generating a large quark CP violation phase. We extend this framework to finite modular groups, systematically identifying the allowed mass textures. We find quark fields must furnish 1D representations and scan the minimal model landscape.</description>

      <title>Dirac spin liquid as an "unnecessary" quantum critical point on square lattice antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of quantum matter especially pertinent to many modern condensed matter systems. Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of gapless quantum spin liquids that do not have a quasi-particle description and are potentially realized in a wide variety of spin $1/2$ magnetic systems on $2d$ lattices. In particular, the DSL in square lattice spin-$1/2$ magnets is described at low energies by $(2+1)d$ quantum electrodynamics with $N_f=4$ flavors of massless Dirac fermions minimally coupled to an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field. The existence of a relevant, symmetry-allowed monopole perturbation renders the DSL on the square lattice intrinsically unstable. We argue that the DSL describes a stable continuous phase transition within the familiar Neel phase (or within the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase). In other words, the DSL is an "unnecessary" quantum critical point within a single phase of matter. Our result offers a novel view of the square lattice DSL in that the critical spin liquid can exist within either the Neel or VBS state itself, and does not require leaving these conventional states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11696v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past three decades, it has been shown that discrete and continuous media can support topologically nontrivial waves. Recently, it was shown that the same is true of the vacuum, in particular, right (R) and left (L) circularly polarized photons are topologically nontrivial. Here, we study the topology of another class of massless particles, namely gravitons. We show that the collection of all gravitons forms a topologically trivial vector bundle over the lightcone, allowing us to construct a globally smooth basis for gravitons. The graviton bundle also has a natural geometric splitting into two topologically nontrivial subbundles, consisting of the R and L gravitons. The R and L gravitons are unitary irreducible bundle representations of the Poincar\'{e} group, and are thus elementary particles; their topology is characterized by the Chern numbers $\mp 4$. This nontrivial topology obstructs the splitting of graviton angular momentum into spin and orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>The gauge coupling evolutions of an ${\rm SU}(8)$ theory with the maximally symmetry breaking pattern</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the renormalizable group equations (RGEs) of the extended strong and weak gauge couplings in an ${\rm SU}(8)$ theory, where three-generational SM fermions are non-trivially embedded. This framework was previously found to generate the observed SM quark/lepton mass hierarchies and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing pattern through its maximally breaking pattern. The field theoretical two-loop RGEs can not achieve the gauge coupling unification with the minimal setup, unless additional adjoint Higgs fields as well as the gravity-induced $d=5$ term to the ${\rm SU}(8)$ field strength term are included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a direct combinatorial proof of a Feynman graph identity which implies a wide generalization of a formality theorem by Kontsevich. For a Feynman graph $\Gamma$, we associate to each vertex a position $x_v \in \mathbb R$ and to each edge $e$ the combination $s_e = a_e^{-\frac 12} \left( x^+_e - x^-_e \right)$, where $x^\pm_e$ are the positions of the two end vertices of $e$, and $a_e$ is a Schwinger parameter. The "topological propagator" $P_e = e^{-s_e^2}\text d s_e$ includes a part proportional to $\text d x_v$ and a part proportional to $\text d a_e$. Integrating the product of all $P_e$ over positions produces a differential form $\alpha_\Gamma$ in the variables $a_e$. We derive an explicit combinatorial formula for $\alpha_\Gamma$, and we prove that $\alpha_\Gamma \wedge \alpha_\Gamma=0$.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Mixing, Proton Decay and Gravitational Waves in SO(10)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an $SO(10)$ model in which a dimension five operator induces kinetic mixing at the GUT scale between the abelian subgroups $U(1)_{B-L}$ and $U(1)_R$. We discuss in this framework gauge coupling unification and proton decay, as well as the appearance of superheavy quasistable strings with $G\mu \sim 10^{-8} - 10^{-5}$, where $\mu$ denotes the dimensionless string tension parameter. We use Bayesian analysis to show that for $G\mu$ values $\sim 4 \times 10^{-7} - 10^{-5}$, the gravitational wave spectrum emitted from the quasistable strings is in good agreement with the recent pulsar timing array data. Corresponding to $G \mu$ values $\sim 10^{-8} - 2 \times 10^{-7}$, proton decay is expected to occur at a rate accessible in the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment. Finally, we present the gravitational wave spectrum emitted by effectively stable strings with $G\mu\approx 10^{-8}$ that have experienced a certain amount of inflation. This can be tested with future detectors in the $\mu$Hz frequency range.</description>

      <title>Non-spherical effects on the mass function of Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the impact of non-spherical effects on the Primordial Black Hole mass function, based on the ellipticity-dependent threshold calculated by performing $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations. We consider an equation of state of radiation $w:=P/\rho=1/3$ and a softer one $w=1/10$ with $P$ and $\rho$ being the pressure and energy density, respectively. We suppose that the curvature perturbations obey Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum and examine the most probable ellipsoidal configurations utilizing peak theory. We also suppose the critical scaling law of the PBH mass near the threshold following the known results. The simulations arXiv:2410.03452 show that the non-sphericity can easily prevent the system from black hole formation when the initial fluctuation amplitude is near the threshold (critical scaling regime). Nevertheless, we show that the non-spherical effects make the mass function just a few times smaller and are insignificant on the mass function distribution, including the power-law scaling in the small mass region.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Ellipsoidal Primordial Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations to study primordial black hole (PBH) formation from the collapse of adiabatic super-horizon non-spherical perturbations generated from curvature fluctuations obeying random Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum. The matter field is assumed to be a perfect fluid of an equation of state $w:=P/\rho={\rm const.}$ with $P$ and $\rho$ being the pressure and the energy density, respectively. The initial spatial profile of the curvature perturbation is modeled with the amplitude $\mu$ and non-spherical parameters $e$ (ellipticity) and $p$ (prolateness) according to peak theory. We focus on the dynamics and the threshold for PBH formation in terms of the non-spherical parameters $e$ and $p$. We find that the critical values ($e_c, p_c$) with a fixed value of $\mu$ closely follow a superellipse curve. With $p=0$, for the range of amplitudes considered, we find that the critical ellipticity for non-spherical collapse follows a decaying power law as a function of $(\mu-\mu_{\rm c,sp})$ with $\mu_{\rm c,sp}$ being the threshold for the spherical case. Our results also indicate that, for both cases of $w = 1/3$ and $w = 1/10$, small deviations from sphericity can avoid collapsing to a black hole when the amplitude is near its critical threshold. Finally we discuss the significance of the ellipticity on the rate of the PBH production.</description>

      <title>A New-Old Approach to Composite Scalars with Chiral Fermion Constituents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a dynamical, Lorentz invariant theory of composite scalars in configuration space consisting of chiral fermions, interacting by the perturbative exchange of a massive "gluon" of coupling $g_0$ and mass $M_0^2$ (the coloron model). The formalism is inspired by, but goes beyond, old ideas of Yukawa and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. It yields a non-pointlike internal wave-function of the bound state, $\phi(r)$, which satisfies a Schr\"odinger-Klein-Gordon (SKG) equation with eigenvalue $\mu^2$. For super-critical coupling, $g_0 &gt;g_{0c}$, we have $\mu^2&lt; 0$ leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking. The binding of chiral fermions is semiclassical, and not loop-level as in NJL. The mass scale is determined by the interaction as in NJL. We mainly focus on the short-distance, large $M_0^2$ limit, yielding an NJL pointlike interaction, but the bound state internal wave-function, $\phi(r)$, remains spatially extended and dilutes $\phi(0)$. This leads to power-law suppression of the induced Yukawa and quartic couplings and requires radically less fine-tuning of a hierarchy than does the NJL model. We include a discussion of loop corrections of the theory. A realistic top--condensation model appears possible.</description>

      <title>Exploring a novel Einstein--Rosen BTZ wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel Einstein-Rosen BTZ wormhole metric as a solution to the Einstein field equations with a negative cosmological constant and explore in detail its various phenomenological aspects. We show that the wormhole metric is characterized by a horizon at the throat, resembling a black hole horizon. This implies that our wormhole metric describes a one-way traversable wormhole at the throat, with Hawking radiation observed by an observer located at some distance from the wormhole. It is also found the same Hawking temperature using the BTZ-like coordinates and Kruskal-like coordinates. This temperature is invariant not only on the type of coordinates but also the nature of the spin of quantum fields. Importantly, we find that at the wormhole throat, the spacetime is not a pure vacuum solution, but rather contains an exotic string matter source with negative tension, which may stabilize the wormhole geometry. To this end, we found that the size of the wormhole throat is proportional to the number of quantum bits suggesting a possible implications on ER=EPR. Further we studied the particle dynamics and, finally, we tested the ANEC with a test scalar and vector fields. For the double null-component computed in BTZ coordinates, we found an apparent divergence at the wormhole throat, which is then shown to be regularized by means of Kruskal-like coordinates. The ANEC for such a scalar/vector field is violated at the wormhole throat.</description>
