      <title>Fast pre-merger detection of massive black-hole binaries in LISA based on time-frequency excess power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna is expected to observe gravitational waves from massive black hole binaries across cosmic time. Many are anticipated to be detectable hours to weeks before coalescence. We present a fast algorithm for the pre-merger detection and preliminary characterization of such binaries. The method performs a search for excess power with a chirping time-frequency morphology in short-time Fourier transform spectrograms. By tiling the time-frequency plane with slices defined by the quadrupole frequency evolution, we define a signal significance relative to a fitted background distribution of instrumental noise and Galactic foreground. Individual search triggers are followed by a coherence tracker, which groups over time triggers consistent with the same physical signal . Doing so, our analysis provides progressively refined estimates of the chirp mass and coalescence time. We validate our algorithm on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset, successfully detecting all 15 injected MBHBs: 14 of them hours-to-weeks before merger, while one is only detected after the binary coalescence. The algorithm yields chirp mass relative errors below $3\%$ for high-SNR sources and coalescence time uncertainties of up to a few hours. With a computational cost of less than a second to process a 10-day data segment on single core, our approach is suitable for generating real-time alerts, trigger protected observational periods, and provide informative priors for Bayesian parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Status of the STIS Auto-wavecal Exposures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the behavior of the default ``wavecal'' spectra obtained together with most STIS spectroscopic exposures, which are needed for proper wavelength calibration of the science data. Because the Pt/Cr-Ne lamps used for the wavecals have been fading (especially at the shortest wavelengths), some changes in the default lamp and/or exposure time have been implemented in recent years to maintain accurate calibrations. To assess whether additional changes might be appropriate, we examine the distribution of the SHIFTA1, SHIFTA2 values derived from the wavecals (the x and y offsets of the spectral image on the detector), we re-visit the wavelength-dependent fading of the lamps, and we perform simulations to estimate the exposure times that would be needed to obtain accurate SHIFTA values. While the current wavecals do appear to yield reasonable SHIFTA, increases in the default exposure times for some of the shortest-wavelength settings would help to ensure reliable wavelength zero points as the lamps continue to fade.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov analysis of pulsar TOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov stochasticity parameter (KSP) as a sensitive descriptor of degree of randomness of signals is used to analyze the properties of the NANOGrav pulsar timing data associated to a stochastic gravitational wave background. The time of arrival (TOA) data of white noise for 68 pulsars are analyzed regarding their KSP properties. The analysis enables to obtain the degree of randomness of the white noise for various pulsars and to reveal its inhomogeneity, i.e. pulsars with low and high randomness of the white noise. The time-dependence of the randomness in the white noise is also studied, indicating the existence of non-stationary physical processes influencing the pulsar timing. The KSP thus is acting as an indicator for the degree of the agreement between the observations and the timing models and as a test in revealing the contribution of various physical processes in the stochastic background signal.</description>

      <title>Deeper detection limits in astronomical imaging using self-supervised spatiotemporal denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection limit of astronomical imaging observations is limited by several noise sources. Some of that noise is correlated between neighbouring image pixels and exposures, so in principle could be learned and corrected. We present an astronomical self-supervised transformer-based denoising algorithm (ASTERIS), that integrates spatiotemporal information across multiple exposures. Benchmarking on mock data indicates that ASTERIS improves detection limits by 1.0 magnitude at 90% completeness and purity, while preserving the point spread function and photometric accuracy. Observational validation using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Subaru telescope identifies previously undetectable features, including low-surface-brightness galaxy structures and gravitationally-lensed arcs. Applied to deep JWST images, ASTERIS identifies three times more redshift &gt; 9 galaxy candidates, with rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity 1.0 magnitude fainter, than previous methods.</description>

      <title>Low-Thrust Trajectory Optimization for Cubesat Lunar Mission: HORYU-VI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a low-thrust trajectory optimization strategy to achieve a near-circular lunar orbit for a CubeSat injected into a lunar flyby trajectory. The 12U CubeSat HORYU-VI is equipped with four Hall-effect thrusters and designed as a secondary payload on NASA's Space Launch System under the Artemis program. Upon release, the spacecraft gains sufficient energy to escape the Earth-Moon system after a lunar flyby. The proposed trajectory is decomposed into three phases: (1) pre-flyby deceleration to avoid heliocentric escape, (2) lunar gravitational capture, and (3) orbit circularization to the science orbit. For each phase, an impulsive-burn solution is first computed as an initial guess, which is then refined through finite-burn optimization using Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). The dynamical model incorporates Earth-Moon-Sun-Jupiter gravitational interactions and a high-fidelity lunar gravity field. All trajectories are independently verified with NASA's General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT). Results demonstrate that HORYU-VI achieves lunar capture within 200 days, establishes a stable science orbit at 280 days, and can spiral down to a near-circular 100 km orbit by 450 days, using a total Delta-V of 710 m/s, well within the capability of the electric propulsion system.</description>

      <title>ComptonUNet: A Deep Learning Model for GRB Localization with Compton Cameras under Noisy and Low-Statistic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic transient phenomena in the universe and serve as powerful probes for high-energy astrophysical processes. In particular, faint GRBs originating from a distant universe may provide unique insights into the early stages of star formation. However, detecting and localizing such weak sources remains challenging owing to low photon statistics and substantial background noise. Although recent machine learning models address individual aspects of these challenges, they often struggle to balance the trade-off between statistical robustness and noise suppression. Consequently, we propose ComptonUNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that jointly processes raw data and reconstructs images for robust GRB localization. ComptonUNet was designed to operate effectively under conditions of limited photon statistics and strong background contamination by combining the statistical efficiency of direct reconstruction models with the denoising capabilities of image-based architectures. We perform realistic simulations of GRB-like events embedded in background environments representative of low-Earth orbit missions to evaluate the performance of ComptonUNet. Our results demonstrate that ComptonUNet significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving improved localization accuracy across a wide range of low-statistic and high-background scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Epoch of Reionization 21 cm Bispectrum at $z=8.2$ from MWA data II: Smooth Component Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21 cm bispectrum (BS) offers a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), but its observational access is severely hindered by dominant astrophysical foregrounds. Considering Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations at $154.2~\mathrm{MHz}$ ($z=8.2$), we mitigate the foregrounds with Smooth Component Filtering (SCF) and estimate the 21 cm BS. We validate the pipeline using a simulated 21 cm signal and show that the input BS is recovered for modes $k_{\parallel} \ge [k_\parallel]_f=0.135~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Applied to actual data, the SCF produces substantial foreground suppression, reducing the amplitude of the cylindrical BS $B(k_{1\perp},k_{2\perp},k_{3\perp},k_{1\parallel},k_{2\parallel})$ by $3-4$ orders of magnitude. The artifacts due to the missing frequency channels in the data are also suppressed. The resulting EoR window is significantly cleaner at small $k_{\perp}$. We adopt the region $(k_{1 \perp},k_{2 \perp},k_{3 \perp})\leq 0.026~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $(k_{1\parallel},k_{2\parallel},k_{3\parallel})&gt;0.135~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ to evaluate the 3D spherical BS and constrain the EoR signal. By combining estimates over all triangle shapes, we place the lower and upper limits on the mean cube brightness temperature fluctuations $\Delta^3$. The estimates are consistent with statistical fluctuations from system noise. The most stringent lower limit $\Delta^3_{\rm LL}=-(1.25\times 10^4)^3~{\rm mK}^3$ and upper limit $\Delta^3_{\rm UL}=(1.22\times 10^4)^3~{\rm mK}^3$ are obtained at $k_1=0.281~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Additional observing time will reduce the noise level and enable substantially tighter constraints on the EoR signal.</description>

      <title>Nested Sampling with Slice-within-Gibbs: Efficient Evidence Calculation for Hierarchical Bayesian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Nested Sampling with Slice-within-Gibbs (NS-SwiG), an algorithm for Bayesian inference and evidence estimation in high-dimensional models whose likelihood admits a factorization, such as hierarchical Bayesian models. We construct a procedure to sample from the likelihood-constrained prior using a Slice-within-Gibbs kernel: an outer update of hyperparameters followed by inner block updates over local parameters. A likelihood-budget decomposition caches per-block contributions so that each local update checks feasibility in constant time rather than recomputing the global constraint at linearly growing cost. This reduces the per-replacement cost from quadratic to linear in the number of groups, and the overall algorithmic complexity from cubic to quadratic under standard assumptions. The decomposition extends naturally beyond independent observations, and we demonstrate this on Markov-structured latent variables. We evaluate NS-SwiG on challenging benchmarks, demonstrating scalability to thousands of dimensions and accurate evidence estimates even on posterior geometries where state-of-the-art gradient-based samplers can struggle.</description>

      <title>Design of low-energy transfers in cislunar space using sequences of lobe dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical structures in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) are fundamental for designing low-energy transfers, as they aid in analyzing phase space transport and designing desirable trajectories. This study focuses on lobe dynamics to exploit local chaotic transport around celestial bodies, and proposes a new method for systematically designing low-energy transfers by combining multiple lobe dynamics. A graph-based framework is constructed to explore possible transfer paths between departure and arrival orbits, reducing the complexity of the combinatorial optimization problem for designing fuel-efficient transfers. Based on this graph, low-energy transfer trajectories are constructed by connecting chaotic orbits within lobes. The resulting optimal trajectory in the Earth--Moon CR3BP is then converted into an optimal transfer in the bicircular restricted four-body problem using multiple shooting. The obtained transfer is compared with existing optimal solutions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Impact of Geant4's Electromagnetic Physics Constructors on Accuracy and Performance of Simulations for Rare Event Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A primary objective in contemporary low background physics is the search for rare and novel phenomena beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, e.g. the scattering off of a potential Dark Matter particle or the neutrinoless double beta decay. The success of such searches depends on a reliable background prediction via Monte Carlo simulations. A widely used toolkit to construct these simulations is Geant4, which offers the user a wide choice of how to implement the physics of particle interactions. For example, for electromagnetic interactions, Geant4 provides pre-defined sets of implementations: physics constructors. As decay products of radioactive contaminants contribute to the background mainly via electromagnetic interactions, the physics constructor used in a Geant4 simulation may have an impact on the total energy deposition inside the detector target. To facilitate the selection of physics constructors for simulations of experiments that are using CaWO$_4$ and Ge targets, we quantify their impact on the total energy deposition for several test cases. These cases consist of radioactive contaminants commonly encountered, covering energy depositions via $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ particles, as well as two examples for the target thickness: thin and bulky. We also consider the computing performance of the studied physics constructors.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{HostSub_GP}$: Precise Galaxy Background Subtraction in Transient Long-slit Spectroscopy with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel host galaxy subtraction technique in long-slit spectroscopy for extragalactic transients. Unlike classic methods which generally estimate the background using a simple linear interpolation of local galaxy flux in the 2D spectrum, our approach leverages multi-band archival images of the host galaxies to model the background emission from the galaxy in the 2D spectrum. Such imaging encodes the wavelength-dependent galaxy profile along the slit, and is readily accessible through wide-field imaging surveys. We construct a smooth prior for the 2D galaxy profile with a Gaussian process (GP) based on these reference images, and use another GP to model the correlated deviations from the prior in the observed spectrum. This enables accurate inference of the galaxy flux blended with the transient. On synthetic long-slit data of a spiral galaxy extracted from a Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer hyper-spectral cube, the GP method remains robust as long as the host galaxy is spatially resolved and consistently outperforms classic methods. We apply the method to archival Keck spectra of two real transients, SN 2019eix and AT 2019qiz, to further demonstrate how the method uniquely recovers weak spectral features amid strong galaxy contamination, enabling refined constraints on the properties of both transients. We have released the software implementation, $\texttt{HostSub_GP}$, a scalable toolkit that leverages $\texttt{JAX}$, with an MIT license.</description>

      <title>Search for Lorentz Invariance Violation with spectral lags of GRB 190114C using profile likelihood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05737v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) by re-analyzing the spectral lag data for GRB 190114C from Fermi-GBM using frequentist analysis, where we deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters using profile likelihood. For this use case, we find a global minima for the $\chi^2$ as a function of energy scale of LIV ($E_{QG}$), well below the Planck scale. The best-fit $1\sigma$ central intervals for $E_{QG}$ are given by $2.81^{+0.50}_{-0.37}\times 10^{14}$ GeV and $9.85^{+0.84}_{-0.60}\times 10^{5}$ GeV for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively, and agree with the Bayesian estimates obtained so far in a previous work. Therefore, the results from the frequentist analysis of GRB 190114C agree with Bayesian analysis.</description>
