      <title>Spatial Phonons: A Phenomenological Viscous Dark Energy Model for DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a phenomenological model of dark energy in which space is treated as an elastic brane with uniform tension $T_s$ supporting a longitudinal phonon fluid. The brane tension gives a residual geometric contribution to the vacuum energy, while the phonon sector is described by three scalar fields $\phi^I$ and an invariant $b = \sqrt{\det B_{IJ}}$ entering an effective action $F(b)$. At the background level this reproduces a perfect fluid with energy density, pressure and bulk modulus set by two dimensionless parameters $\varepsilon$ and $\kappa$. These parameters fix the enthalpy and bulk modulus in units of the space tension and determine the phonon sound speed through $c_s^2 = \kappa/\varepsilon$. Dissipative effects are modeled by a bulk viscous pressure obeying a Maxwell type relaxation law with a characteristic time scale $\tau(H)$ that depends on the Hubble rate. Motivated by a Boltzmann suppressed scattering rate at a mass-gap scale $H_\star$, we adopt a simple ansatz for $H\tau(H)$ and obtain a compact expression for the effective dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm eff}(H)$. The viscous correction is transient, is most active around $H \sim H_\star$ and drives a temporary phantom deviation. At the same time, we also show that $w_{\rm eff}$ approaches $-1 + \varepsilon$ at very early and very late times. Using a flat $\Lambda$CDM background for $H(z)$, we scan the parameter space and identify a region with $\kappa \ \simeq \ \varepsilon \ \simeq \ 1/3$ and $H_\star/H_0 \ \simeq \ 2.1$. This choice gives an ultralight phonon with sound speed close to the causal limit and a viscous dark energy history $w_{\rm eff}(z)$ that closely tracks a DESI motivated Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization over the redshift range most relevant for the DESI BAO measurements.</description>

      <title>General-Relativistic Path Effects and the Local Hubble Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an effective mapping for low-redshift photon propagation that captures the leading path-dependent deviations from the standard FLRW redshift. Instead of relying on exact integrations of the Sachs optical equations, we introduce a minimal deformation of the redshift relation z_eff(z) = z minus alpha times f(z), where alpha is a small amplitude and f(z) suppresses the correction at z greater than approximately 0.1. This mapping does not modify the background expansion but encapsulates the leading contribution of inhomogeneous tidal fields to the accumulated Sachs redshift. We derive the implications for the luminosity distance, the low-redshift Hubble relation, and the directional dependence associated with local structure. The framework provides a clean general-relativistic description of path-dependent redshift drift and yields concrete predictions for forthcoming low-redshift surveys.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Heating from Dark Compact Objects and Axion Minihalos: Implications for the 21-cm Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature of baryons at the end of the cosmic dark ages can be inferred from observations of the 21-cm hyperfine transition in neutral hydrogen. Any energy injection from the dark sector can therefore be detected through these measurements. Dark compact objects and dark-matter substructures can modify the baryon temperature by transferring heat via dynamical friction. In this work, we evaluate the prospects for detecting dynamical friction-induced heating from dark compact objects with a mass in the range $10^2 M_{\odot}$ to $10^5 M_{\odot}$, as well as from axion minihalos, using upcoming 21-cm experiments. We find that both the 21-cm global signal and power-spectrum measurements will be sensitive to dark compact objects that constitute about 10% of the dark matter, and will substantially improve our sensitivity to axion-like particles with masses in the range $10^{-18}$ eV to $10^{-9}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Probing Fuzzy Dark Matter in the 21 cm Signal via Wavelet Scattering Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the imprints of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) on the redshifted 21~cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization by employing the wavelet scattering transform (WST). FDM, composed of ultralight scalar particles with masses $m_{\mathrm{FDM}} \sim 10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}$, exhibits quantum pressure that suppresses the formation of small-scale structures below the de~Broglie wavelength, thereby delaying star formation and modifying the thermal history of the intergalactic medium. Using modified \texttt{21cmFAST} simulations that incorporate both linear and nonlinear effects of FDM on structure formation, we analyze the two-dimensional 21~cm brightness temperature fields through the first- and second-order WST coefficients. The first-order coefficients, $S_1(j)$, quantify scale-dependent variance analogous to the power spectrum, while the normalized second-order ratio $R(j_1,j_2)=S_2/S_1$ captures non-Gaussian cross-scale couplings. We find that low-order couplings, particularly between large and intermediate scales, are highly sensitive to the FDM particle mass and remain robust under SKA1-Low-like thermal noise. Quantitatively, the WST coefficients yield pairwise distances of $\Delta \simeq 225$ between CDM and FDM with $m_{\mathrm{FDM}}=10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}$, demonstrating that this framework can effectively discriminate between wave-like and cold dark matter scenarios even under realistic observational conditions. Our results establish the WST as a powerful, noise-tolerant statistical tool for probing the wave nature of dark matter through forthcoming 21~cm observations.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey: A comprehensive X-ray analysis of the Hydra I galaxy cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hydra I galaxy cluster (Abell 1060) is a nearby example of a low-temperature cluster that exhibits intermediate cool core and non-cool core properties. We aim to extend the characterization of the intracluster medium (ICM) properties at least until $R_{200}$ and study the correlation between the X-ray emission and non-thermal emission within $R=0.15$$R_{500}$, and optical/IR galaxy distribution beyond $R_{200}$. We used data from the first four SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Surveys and an archival Chandra observation to image the X-ray emission from Abell 1060. We also used multiwavelength data from TGSS (radio), 2MASS (IR), and NED (optical) to investigate the non-thermal emission, 2D galaxy distribution, and its redshift evolution, respectively. The surface brightness and spectral analyses are also extended until 3$R_{200}$ and $R_{200}$, respectively, following a detailed cosmic X-ray background (CXB) analysis. Our fully corrected eROSITA image showcases a relaxed ICM morphology within $R_{500}$. We detect two weak ICM shocks with Mach number $M\approx 1.5$ near the central galaxy NGC 3311 that coincide with diffuse radio emission along the line of sight. Furthermore, we detect multiple soft X-ray excesses with high spatial correlation with the 2D optical galaxy distribution beyond $R_{200}$. In particular, the excess in the north has a significance of $5.8\sigma$ above the local CXB level. This suggests that Abell 1060's outskirts are actively accreting baryons. We also estimate the average ICM temperature and metallicity of $\langle k_\mathrm{B}T \rangle=2.27\substack{+0.15\\-0.11}\thinspace$ keV and $\langle Z\rangle=0.19\substack{+0.05\\-0.03}\thinspace Z_\odot$, respectively, from the 0.2-0.5$R_{500}$ annulus. Overall, the temperature profile is broadly consistent with the average temperature profiles from hydrodynamical simulation and Suzaku between 0.28$R_{200}$ and $R_{200}$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Chiral-Quintom dark energy after DESI DR2 and impact on unifying dark energy with inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent data release DR2 from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has reinforced compelling evidence supporting the dynamical nature of dark energy. In this respect, we here explore a two-scalar field cosmological model, dubbed Chiral-Quintom paradigm, that allows for a unified description of early- and late-time cosmic accelerations, namely inflation and dark energy, respectively. Moreover, we show that it provides a mechanism to cross the phantom divide without instabilities. To do so, we first focus on scenarios where the scalar fields evolve under an exponential potential, leading to distinct cosmological behaviors, including tracking solutions and slow-roll or hyperbolic inflation. Afterwards, by considering a nonlinear potential and a mixing in the kinetic sector, we show that the model can also describe the matter-dominated era, offering a potential unification of the dark sector. Accordingly, we place bounds on this double-field paradigm by employing recent low-redshift observational data, including supernovae from the Pantheon+ and Union3.0 compilations, observational Hubble parameter measurements, and baryon acoustic oscillation data from the latest DESI release. By means of the Akaike information criterion, the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario and the $w_0w_a$CDM model are thus compared with the Chiral-Quintom approach, showing that, in principle, multiple-field dynamics does not seem to be ruled out, ultimately providing a flexible framework for describing late-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Controlling weak-lensing shear biases from undetected galaxies in the era of Stage IV Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of background galaxies by intervening matter is a powerful probe of the cosmological model. In the era of Stage IV surveys, contamination from galaxies below the detection threshold has emerged as a significant source of bias. Adopting a noise-bias-free machine-learning method to estimate shear, we quantify the impact of faint galaxies for a Euclid-like survey. In our baseline simulations, faint blends induce a multiplicative shear bias of -0.008, well above Euclid's requirement. Similar to previous studies, we find that calibration simulations must include neighbouring galaxies to AB apparent magnitudes as faint as 27.0 (+2.1, -0.9) and within approximately 1.0 (+0.2, -0.2) arcsec of each bright sample galaxy (BSG; the galaxy for which shear is measured). By varying faint galaxy properties, we identify which ones significantly affect shear biases and quantify how well they must be constrained. Crucially, we find that biases not only depend on the mean projected faint-galaxy density and apparent-magnitude distribution across the sample, but also on how these quantities vary with the observed brightness of the BSG. Furthermore, biases are sensitive to radial and tangential alignments and positional anisotropy of faint galaxies relative to BSGs. By contrast, shear coherence between BSGs and faint galaxies, parallel orientation alignments, and variations in the faint galaxy size-magnitude relation have negligible impact within the parameter ranges explored. Our results guide calibration simulations and highlight the critical role of deep observations in measuring the properties of faint galaxies.</description>

      <title>Joint Constraints on Fuzzy and Warm Dark Matter from Satellite Populations of the Milky Way and Andromeda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a joint analysis of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) satellite populations to constrain the properties of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) and thermal-relic warm dark matter (WDM). We combine MW satellite observations from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) with M31 satellite data from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS), and model the corresponding observable satellite populations using the galaxy--halo connection model together with the appropriate selection functions. Uncertainties in the virial masses of the MW and M31 are incorporated through host-mass priors that linearly scale the relevant model parameters, allowing us to infer the full posterior distributions of all parameters. For the FDM case, we obtain $m_{\mathrm{FDM}} &gt; 1.75 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ (95% CL) and $m_{\mathrm{FDM}} &gt; 1.41 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ (20:1 posterior ratio). For thermal-relic WDM, we find $m_{\mathrm{WDM}} &gt; 6.22~\mathrm{keV}$ (95% CL) and $m_{\mathrm{WDM}} &gt; 5.75~\mathrm{keV}$ (20:1 posterior ratio). These results represent a moderate improvement over MW-only constraints, and provide the strongest constraints to date on the FDM and WDM derived from satellite galaxy populations in the Local Group.</description>

      <title>Accurate cosmological emulator for the probability distribution function of gravitational lensing of point sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an accurate and computationally efficient emulator to model the gravitational lensing magnification probability distribution function (PDF), enabling robust cosmological inference of point sources such as supernovae and gravitational-wave observations. We construct a pipeline utilizing cosmological $N$-body simulations, creating past light cones to compute convergence and shear maps. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed for dimensionality reduction, followed by an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning model to interpolate magnification PDFs across a broad cosmological parameter space ($\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, $w$, $h$) and redshift range ($0.2 \le z \le 6$). We identify the optimal number of PCA components to balance accuracy and stability. Our emulator, publicly released as ace_lensing, accurately reproduces lensing PDFs with a median Kullback-Leibler divergence of $0.007$. Validation on the test set confirmed that the model reliably reproduces the detailed shapes and statistical properties of the PDFs across the explored parameter range, showing no significant degradation for specific parameter combinations or redshifts. Future work will focus on incorporating baryonic physics through hydrodynamical simulations and expanding the training set to further enhance model accuracy and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Analytical Emulator for the Baryon EoM inside the Fuzzy Dark Matter Soliton from Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An empirical baryon density profile can be included in the Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) equations to influence the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) soliton formation. However, to probe the effects of baryon on the other dynamical evolutions of the FDM soliton, its equation of motion (EoM) inside the corresponding FDM soliton is needed. In this paper, given an empirical baryon density profile, we first provide the cylinderical symmetric FDM soliton solution about the FDM density and the total potential of FDM and baryon. Then, we build an analytical baryon EoM from the obtained FDM density and total potential by machine learning. Finally, we check that this baryon EoM works as well as an empirical baryon density profile for the FDM soliton formation, with the fractional errors $\lesssim0.04$. It should also work well for some other simple FDM soliton evolutions.</description>

      <title>Constraining Dark Acoustic Oscillations with the High-Redshift UV Luminosity Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark acoustic oscillations (DAOs) in the matter power spectrum can arise in many different dark sector models, and can imprint on a variety of cosmological observables. In this work we use measurements of the galactic UV luminosity function (UVLF) at high redshifts to constrain the dark acoustic oscillation feature at small scales in a model-agnostic way. We introduce a phenomenological transfer function model for a dark sector with a species undergoing DAOs which can accommodate sub-dominant dark matter abundances, and obtain constraints on its parameters. In order to predict the UVLF, we employ an Extended Press-Schechter formalism which we calibrate using N-body simulations with initial conditions featuring DAOs. Using measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, Subaru Telescope, and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we constrain the wave number of the first DAO peak to be at $k \gtrsim 50\ h/\mathrm{Mpc}$, unless the fraction of dark matter undergoing DAOs is less than $0.07$.</description>

      <title>Probing ALP-photon couplings in Neutron Stars: Scalar versus pseudoscalar cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09141v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of an interacting axion-like massive field within a magnetized Neutron Star. For this we consider the effect of an intense density-dependent axially symmetric stellar magnetic field ${\bf B}(r,\theta)$ adding another much weaker, but non-vanishing, electric field. We particularize the latter for the case when a finite chiral charge density is present. The axion field is thus coupled to a generic function $Q(F_0,G_0)$ depending on Lorentz invariants $F_0, G_0$ which can be constructed from these electromagnetic fields. From this, the static axion field equations are solved as function of stellar radial coordinate and angular direction, $a(r,\theta)$, using a prescribed linear form for $Q$. In addition, we use a semi-analytical approach to calculate the stellar structure in this hybrid system where pressure components are treated under a perturbative scheme, provided induced deformations with respect to spherical symmetry are tiny. Our results show that the axion couplings to magnetic and electric fields along with its mass, critically determine the axion spatial distribution. Furthermore, we focus on the possibility that the axion field might accumulate in specific outer regions of the star, particularly within the crust, where it could form a condensate. We explore the possible presence of magnetic flux tubes from superconductor phases in this outer layers and qualitatively show they may enhance local conversion into photons. We explore prospects of detectability through indirect methods.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference on Calabi--Yau moduli spaces and the axiverse: experimental data meets string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop tools of Bayesian inference on the moduli space of Calabi--Yau (CY) manifolds. We sample from the invariant Weil--Petersson (WP) measure using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and normalising flows on \Kahler moduli space with dimension up to $h^{1,1}=30$, and present results on the spectrum of the CY volume and properties of divisors when the measure is restricted in physically meaningful ways. We furthermore present a theory-informed prior on axion masses and decay constants $(m_a,f_a)$ marginalised over the WP measure for all inequivalent CYs constructable from the Kreuzer--Skarke database with $h^{1,1}\leq 5$. We then impose likelihoods based on axion physics. We demonstrate how detection of a relatively heavy QCD axion at small $h^{1,1}$, e.g. by ADMX, provides detailed information about CY geometry and topology. Finally, we compute a full forward model incorporating likelihoods from the cosmic microwave background and Lyman-alpha forest and find the maximum posterior probability region on the moduli space of a given CY favoured by a resolution of the tension in these data by an ultralight axion composing $\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ of the dark matter. This demonstration serves as a blueprint for future statistical analyses within string phenomenology.</description>

      <title>The role of prompt cusps in driving the core collapse of SIDM halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt cusps (PCs) form from the direct collapse of overdensities in the early Universe, reside at the center of every dark matter halo, and have density profiles steeper than $r^{-1}$ NFW cusps. Using a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations, we study the evolution of isolated halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with massive PCs embedded at their centers, a scenario that could be realized in certain SIDM models with light mediators that predict a small-scale suppression of the linear matter power spectrum. We track the evolution of three equally concentrated $10^7\,{\rm{M}}_\odot$ halos, hosting PCs of various total masses, and quantify how the presence of a PC affects the processes of core formation and collapse. Early in the core-formation phase, halos with more prominent PCs exhibit a delayed evolution by a factor of $\sim 2$ due to smaller velocity dispersion gradients in the inner region. During most of the core-collapse phase, the halo evolution becomes closely aligned in physical time, with appropriate rescaling of densities, radii, and velocity dispersions. The scale densities and radii preserve the virial mass of the original halos, but with increased concentration. Deviations occur at the late phase of core-collapse at the level of $\sim 5\%$ relative to the reference collapse track of an NFW halo. These deviations depend non-trivially on both the increased concentration incurred by the PCs, as well as the velocity dispersion (temperature) of the outer halo regions, which can inhibit or enhance the heat transfer process. Our simulations illustrate the complex interplay between the inner and outer halo profiles in determining the onset of core collapse and motivate future studies in the full cosmological context.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of Gravi-Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how a mass term for gravitational axions (''gravi-axions'') with a Chern-Simons coupling to gravity can naturally arise due to non-perturbative contributions from Euclidean wormholes, breaking the continuous shift symmetry of the standard theory. The induced mass can be generated in a cosmologically relevant range to be the dark matter or dark energy of the universe for a reasonable and well-motivated range of the symmetry breaking scale. Upon generating the gravi-axion mass term, we discuss the cosmology of the theory. We find that the gravi-axion can be produced to be the dominant dark matter component via misalignment or gravitational particle production, and that in a different regime, the gravi-axion can act as dynamical dark energy. We discuss gravi-axion decay into gravitons as a potential observational window for this theory. Finally, we find that, for late-time, astrophysical compact objects, cosmologically relevant gravi-axions behave as minimally-coupled, massive scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Widen the Resonance at Ultra-High Energies: Novel Probes of Neutrino Self-interactions in the High-Mass Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino self-interaction beyond the Standard Model is well motivated by the nonzero masses of neutrinos, which are the only known particles guaranteed to have new physics. Cosmic messengers, especially neutrinos, play a central role in probing new physics, as they provide experimental conditions far beyond the reach of laboratories and serve as the link between laboratory fundamental-physics discoveries and their roles in the Universe, where many new physics motivations originate. In this work, we propose a novel probe of neutrino self-interactions through ultra-high-energy neutrinos scattering off the cosmic neutrino background when the lightest neutrino species remains relativistic today. This allows us to ``Widen the Resonance'' of such scattering. Meanwhile, we also provide a semi-analytic framework for cosmogenic UHE neutrino production, avoiding computationally intensive simulations and yielding results precise enough for BSM studies. The widened resonance enables future ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes, in particular GRAND, to probe mediator masses from MeV to GeV, reaching couplings down to $g \sim 10^{-3}$ -- up to two orders of magnitude beyond current bounds. Our results enhance the discovery potential of $\nu$SI in the high-mass regime, potentially offering crucial insights into the connections between the neutrino sector and dark sector.</description>

      <title>Normal or transitional? The evolution and properties of two type Ia supernovae in the Virgo cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are among the most precise cosmological distance indicators used to study the expansion history of the Universe. The vast increase of SN Ia data due to large-scale astrophysical surveys has led to the discovery of a wide variety of SN Ia sub-classes, such as transitional and fast-declining SNe Ia. However, their distinct photometric and spectroscopic properties differentiate them from the population of normal SNe Ia such that their use as cosmological tools remains challenged. Here, we present a high-cadenced photometric and spectroscopic dataset of two SNe Ia, SNe 2020ue and 2020nlb, which were discovered in the nearby Virgo cluster of galaxies. Our study shows that SN 2020nlb is a normal SN Ia whose unusually red color is intrinsic, arising from a lower photospheric temperature rather than interstellar reddening, providing clear evidence that color diversity among normal SNe Ia can have a physical origin. In contrast, SN 2020ue has photometric properties, such as color evolution and light-curve decay rate, similar to those of transitional SNe, spectroscopically it is more aligned with normal SNe Ia. This is evident from spectroscopic indicators such as the pseudo-equivalent width of \ion{Si}{II} lines. Thus, such SNe Ia that are photometrically at the edge of the standard normal SNe Ia range may be missed in cosmological SNe Ia samples. Our results highlight that spectroscopic analysis of SNe Ia around peak brightness is crucial for identifying intrinsic color variations and constructing a more complete and physically homogeneous SN Ia sample for precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Probing a minimal dark gauge sector via microlensing of compact dark objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal Dark Standard Model (DSM) consisting of a single spin-0 particle with dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, and completely decoupled from the visible sector. Characterized only by the scalar mass $\mu$ and the dark charge $q$, this framework naturally gives rise to a rich phenomenology, including stable solitonic configurations that behave as dark "mini-MACHOs". We numerically build and evolve these gauged scalar-field solitons, derive their mass-radius relations, and identify a critical charge beyond which no gravitationally bound configurations exist. By combining these results with microlensing surveys that exclude compact objects heavier than the asteroid-mass scale ($M\lesssim 10^{-11}M_\odot$), we obtain the constraint $\mu\gtrsim 10\,\rm eV$ for viable configurations, depending on $q$. Our results represent a step forward in showing that purely gravitational observations can constrain the internal parameters of a dark gauge sector, and provide a framework for exploring broader DSM scenarios through future probes such as gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Green Bean galaxies and the fading echoes of AGN activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Green Bean is a rare type of galaxy which represents a short-lived phase in the life cycle of active galactic nuclei (AGN), characterised by large-scale, powerful ionised clouds in the circumgalactic medium. Recent studies demonstrate that these extended ionised structures may reflect fading signatures of past AGN activity, often manifested in the form of large-scale ionisation cones. The analysis of their observational properties provides unique constraints on AGN lifetimes, feedback mechanisms, and transitions between radiative and kinetic modes of activity. In this paper we announce the first results of the project dedicated to the long-slit spectroscopic and scanning Fabry-Perot interferometric observations of Green Bean galaxies at the Russian 6-m telescope with SCORPIO-2 multi-mode instrument. We describe the data reduction and spectral fitting procedures that allow one to characterise ionisation conditions in extended gaseous regions of the galaxy SDSSJ095100.54+051026.7.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Correlation between Dark Matter Content, Ages and Mass-to-Light Ratios in Spiral Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an empirical investigation into the relationship between galactic age and dark matter content across a sample of 16 nearby, well-resolved spiral galaxies. Using raw rotation curve data from IOA Tokyo's publicly available repository, we model each galaxy's mass distribution via a three-component decomposition (Hernquist bulge, exponential disk, and a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark matter halo) fit using Monte Carlo simulations. The onset of dark matter dominance was identified using the NFW scale radius, beyond which we computed the total enclosed mass via Keplerian dynamics. I-band luminosities for these regions were estimated using a calibrated Tully-Fisher relation, yielding precise mass-to-light (M/L) ratios. We further calculated dark matter mass and density using NFW profile equations, and galaxy ages were retrieved through an extensive literature survey of stellar population studies.
  Our analysis reveals strong positive correlations between galactic age and both dark matter mass (Pearson $r \approx 0.91$; Spearman $\rho \approx 0.93$) and density (Pearson $r \approx 0.91$; Spearman $\rho \approx 0.91$), as well as M/L ratios, suggesting a robust link between evolutionary history and dark matter build-up. These findings are in quantitative agreement with predictions from large-scale cosmological simulations that incorporate assembly bias and smooth accretion-dominated growth, reinforcing the view that older galaxies, having formed earlier in high-density peaks, have accumulated significantly more dark matter over cosmic time. Our results offer observational evidence for time-dependent dark matter assembly and establish galactic age as a meaningful tracer of halo evolution.</description>

      <title>OzDES Reverberation Mapping of Active Galactic Nuclei: Final Data Release, Black-Hole Mass Results, &amp; Scaling Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, the Australian Dark Energy (OzDES) collaboration has used Reverberation Mapping to measure the masses of high redshift supermassive black holes. Here we present the final review and analysis of this OzDES reverberation mapping campaign. These observations use 6-7 years of photometric and spectroscopic observations of 735 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the redshift range $z\in [0.13, 3.85]$ and bolometric luminosity range $\log_{10}(L_{\mathrm{bol}})\in [44.3, 47.5] \mathrm{erg/s}$. Both photometry and spectra are observed in visible wavelengths, allowing for the physical scale of the AGN broad line region to be estimated from reverberations of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emission lines. We successfully use reverberation mapping to constrain the masses of 62 super-massive black holes, and combine with existing data to fit a power law to the lag-luminosity relation for the Hbeta and MgII lines with a scatter of $\sim0.25$ dex, the tightest and most robust fit yet identified. We fit a similarly constrained relation for CIV, resolving a tension with the low luminosity literature AGN by accounting for selection effects. We also examine the impact of emission line width and luminosity (related to accretion rate) in reducing the scatter of these scaling relationships and find no significant improvement over the lag-only approach for any of the three lines. Using these relations, we further estimate the masses and accretion rates of 246 AGN. We also use these relations to estimate the relative sizes of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emitting regions, and find evidence that the MgII emission may occur further out than Hbeta. In short, we provide a comprehensive benchmark of high redshift AGN reverberation mapping at the close of this most recent generation of surveys, including light curves, time-delays, and the most reliable radius-luminosity relations to date.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dedicated search for gravitational-wave backgrounds with nontrivial peak structures using data from the first three and the initial part of the fourth observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network. The analysis is motivated by a variety of early-Universe models characterized by signals with multiple peaks. We introduce a model independent parameterization of double-peaked spectra based on the superposition of two normalized broken power laws and perform a Bayesian inference study using the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA isotropic cross-correlation data. While no statistically significant evidence for a multi-peak background is found, the analysis provides constraints on the inter-peak slopes in correlation with the signal amplitude. These results exhibit LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's ability to probe signals beyond a single peak structure and establish a foundation for future targeted searches for nontrivial gravitational waves background spectral shapes in future observing runs and the advanced detector era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We take a fresh look at the viability of physically realistic extremal black holes within our (non-supersymmetric) low energy physics. By incorporating prefactors and volume effects, we show that Schwinger discharge in charge neutral environments is far more efficient than commonly assumed. Using ionization estimates for neutral hydrogen, we obtain a new and robust lower bound on the mass of an extremal electrically charged black hole, exceeding $10^{14} M_\odot$. For magnetic black holes, we compute the Lee-Nair-Weinberg instability and revisit early universe pair creation rates, including singular instantons that substantially enhance production, to demonstrate that the extreme charges required for stability are cosmologically implausible. Finally, we suggest that an extremal Kerr black hole could shed angular momentum via superradiant scattering from the stochastic gravitational wave background. Taken together, our results provide a unified picture that extremal black holes of any type are unlikely to persist in our universe.</description>

      <title>Quantum Recoherence in Presence of Excited States in the Early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum-to-classical transition of primordial perturbations within a two-field inflationary framework where an adiabatic mode interacts with an entropic environment. In the case of a massive entropic environment, the attractor Bunch--Davies vacuum plays a special role: it is the only state that can undergo full recoherence, whereas all excited initial states exhibit persistent loss of purity. To characterize this behavior, we parameterize excited Gaussian initial states by their Bogoliubov coefficients and compute the purity and R\'enyi-2 entropy of the reduced adiabatic state as information-theoretic indicators of decoherence dynamics. We find that excited states display \emph{purity-freezing} at a non-zero plateau, where residual quantum correlations persist indefinitely, a qualitative departure from the complete recoherence observed for the Bunch--Davies vacuum. This sensitivity to initial conditions highlights the non-generic nature of full recoherence in the quantum-to-classical transition of inflationary perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.09985v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Between the linear and nonlinear regimes, we identify a universal transition range centered on a characteristic halo mass $m_h^*\propto t$, within which gravitational dynamics self-organize the matter field toward an effective spectral index n=-1. In a bottom-up hierarchy, early collapse of low-mass halos preserves imprints of the primordial spectrum, whereas prolonged assembly of halos near $m_h^*$ erases that memory and establishes universality. We formulate a scale-to-scale cascade, the redistribution of mass and energy across scales, that yields universal scaling laws for the halo mass function and internal structure. Globally, the cascade drives a random walk of halos with mass-dependent waiting time $\tau_g\propto m_h^{-\lambda}$; A Fokker-Planck equation gives mass function $f_M\propto m_h^{-\lambda}$ and $\lambda=2/3$ for the gravity-dominant transition range. Locally, a radially directed cascade governs particle migration with waiting time $\tau_{gr}\propto r^{-\gamma}$, yielding density $\rho_r\propto r^{-2\gamma}$ and $\gamma=2/3$ on scales near $m_h^*$. The cascade drives the system toward a statistically steady state that continuously releases energy and maximizes entropy, characterized by scale-independent rates, preventing mass or energy buildup at intermediate scales. Scale-dependent dominance of the primordial spectrum versus gravity implies two effective exponents, producing double-$\lambda$ mass functions and double-$\gamma$ density in excellent agreement with simulations. Using Illustris and Virgo, we measure an inverse kinetic-energy cascade from small to large scales at $\varepsilon_u \approx -10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$, a direct potential-energy cascade of $-1.4\varepsilon_u$, and a net dissipation of -0.4$\varepsilon_u$ via halo mergers and particle migration. The dependence of waiting time and step length on the particle mass suggests new constraints near $10^{12}$GeV.</description>

      <title>What can we learn about Reionization astrophysical parameters using Gaussian Process Regression?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reionization is one of the least understood processes in the evolution history of the Universe, mostly because of the numerous astrophysical processes occurring simultaneously about which we do not have a very clear idea so far. In this article, we use the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method to learn the reionization history and infer the astrophysical parameters. We reconstruct the UV luminosity density function using the HFF and early JWST data. From the reconstructed history of reionization, the global differential brightness temperature fluctuation during this epoch has been computed. We perform MCMC analysis of the global 21-cm signal using the instrumental specifications of SARAS, in combination with Lyman-$\alpha$ ionization fraction data, Planck optical depth measurements and UV luminosity data. Our analysis reveals that GPR can help infer the astrophysical parameters in a model-agnostic way than conventional methods. Additionally, we analyze the 21-cm power spectrum using the reconstructed history of reionization and demonstrate how the future 21-cm mission SKA, in combination with Planck and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, improves the bounds on the reionization astrophysical parameters by doing a joint MCMC analysis for the astrophysical parameters plus 6 cosmological parameters for $\Lambda$CDM model. The results make the GPR-based reconstruction technique a robust learning process and the inferences on the astrophysical parameters obtained therefrom are quite reliable that can be used for future analysis.</description>

      <title>Changing Redshifts caused by a Changing Expansion Velocity of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the next generation of big telescopes such as the ELT and SKA it might become possible to measure changes in the expansion rate of the Universe in real time by measuring the change of the redshifts of a large number of galaxies over a period of the order of 10 years. This phenomenon, known as 'redshift drift,' will provide a crucial direct test of cosmological models. The change in redshift is readily explained using the concept of conformal time which is the comoving distance of a galaxy in lightyears. We emphasize that the redshift drift is directly proportional to the average change in the cosmic expansion rate between the time of a galaxy's light emission and its absorption. This phenomenon is illustrated within the framework of the concordance model, the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.</description>

      <title>Model-independent calibration of Gamma-Ray Bursts with neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model has been highly successful in predicting cosmic structure and evolution, yet recent precision measurements have highlighted discrepancies, especially in the Hubble constant inferred from local and early-Universe data. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) present a promising alternative for cosmological measurements, capable of reaching higher redshifts than traditional distance indicators. This work leverages GRBs to refine cosmological parameters independently of the $\Lambda$CDM framework. Using the Platinum compilation of long GRBs, we calibrate the Dainotti relations-empirical correlations among GRB luminosity properties-as standard candles through artificial neural networks (ANNs). We analyze both the 2D and 3D Dainotti calibration relations, leveraging an ANN-driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to minimize scatter in the calibration parameters, thereby achieving a stable Hubble diagram. This ANN-based calibration approach offers advantages over Gaussian processes, avoiding issues such as kernel function dependence and overfitting. Our results emphasize the need for model-independent calibration approaches to address systematic challenges in GRB luminosity variability, ultimately extending the cosmic distance ladder in a robust way. By addressing redshift evolution and reducing systematic uncertainties, GRBs can serve as reliable high-redshift distance indicators, offering critical insights into current cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Echoes of Self-Interacting Dark Matter from Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) environments around black holes (BHs) can influence their mergers through dynamical friction, causing gravitational wave (GW) dephasing during the inspiral phase. While this effect is well studied for collisionless dark matter (CDM), it remains unexplored for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) due to the typically low DM density in SIDM halo cores. In this work, by considering BH mergers within SIDM spikes, which can arise from models with a massive force mediator, we show that the GWs emitted are dephased in a distinct manner. To incorporate the feedback of the BH orbital motion that can significantly modify the DM profiles, we use $N$-body simulations to analyze GW dephasing in binary BH inspirals within CDM and SIDM spikes. By tracking the binary's motion in different SIDM environments, we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can distinguish DM profiles shaped by varying DM interaction strengths, revealing detailed properties of SIDM.</description>

      <title>IAEmu: Learning Galaxy Intrinsic Alignment Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05235v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, a key contaminant in weak lensing analyses, arise from correlations in galaxy shapes driven by tidal interactions and galaxy formation processes. Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework. Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\xi$ and ~5% for $\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\eta$ without overfitting. The emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu enables $\sim$10,000$\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Testing Quasi-Linear Coasting Cosmologies with Late-Time Large-Scale Structure Growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11826v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive analytical expressions for the growth factor, $D(z)$, and density-weighted growth rate, $f\sigma_8(z)$, for cosmologies in which $a\propto t$ at late times. We fit $f\sigma_8(z)$ to data from redshift-space distortion measurements in the redshift range $z&lt;2$ using the `dynesty` implementation of nested sampling. Three coasting models, with curvature parameters $k=\{-1, 0, +1\}$ in $H^2_0c^{-2}$ units, and a flat $\Lambda$CDM model are tested. We evaluate each model's consistency with the data by applying the Anderson--Darling test for normality on the normalized residuals. We obtained $\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}=\{ 0.206^{+0.073}_{-0.061},\, 0.297^{+0.085}_{-0.073},\, 0.412^{+0.097}_{-0.086}\}$} and $\sigma_{8}(z=0)=\{1.071^{+0.213}_{-0.151},\,0.867^{+0.128}_{-0.097},\,0.725^{+0.080}_{-0.065}\}$ for the coasting models, while for $\Lambda$CDM $\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}=0.286_{-0.047}^{+0.053}$ and $\sigma_{8}(z=0) = 0.764_{-0.035}^{+0.039}$. All models are consistent with the data, though the $\Lambda$CDM model is strongly favored over the coasting models, with $\log$ Bayes factors of $\log_{10}{\mathcal{B}} = \{1.79,\, 1.55,\,1.42\}$. A predictive performance metric and posterior predictive check confirmed that while $\Lambda$CDM achieves the highest predictive accuracy, it also shows the strongest indication of overfitting. We also examined whether the $S_8$ tension can be resolved by linear expansion for $z&lt;2$. Curve fitting yielded $S_8 = \{0.890^{+0.024}_{-0.024},\,0.865^{+0.024}_{-0.024},\,0.850^{+0.026}_{-0.026}\}$ for the coasting models, resulting in $\Delta S^\mathrm{Coasting}_8=\{2.12\sigma,\,1.21\sigma,\,0.62\sigma\}$ discrepancies with the standard \textit{Planck} 2018 value. A value of $S_8=0.746^{+0.041}_{-0.039}$ was obtained for the $\Lambda$CDM model, indicating a tension level of ${\Delta S_8^{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}=2.00\sigma}$.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass tension or suppressed growth rate of matter perturbations?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming a minimal $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with three massive neutrinos, the joint analysis of Planck cosmic microwave background data, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and distance moduli measurements of Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ sample sets an upper bound on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06$-$0.07$ eV, that lies barely above the lower limit from oscillation experiments. These constraints are mainly driven by mild differences in the inferred values of the matter density parameter across different probes that can be alleviated by introducing additional background-level degrees of freedom (e.g., by dynamical dark energy models). However, in this work we explore an alternative possibility. Since both $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and massive neutrinos critically influence the growth of cosmic structures, we test whether the neutrino mass tension may originate from the way matter clusters, rather than from a breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM expansion history. To this end, we introduce the growth index $\gamma$, which characterizes the rate at which matter perturbations grow. Deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM value ($\gamma \simeq 0.55$) can capture a broad class of models, including non-minimal dark sector physics and modified gravity. We show that allowing $\gamma$ to vary significantly relaxes the neutrino mass bounds to $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.13$-$0.2$ eV, removing any tension with terrestrial constraints without altering the inferred value of $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$. However, this comes at the cost of departing from standard growth predictions: to have $\sum m_\nu \gtrsim 0.06$ eV one needs $\gamma &gt; 0.55$, and we find a consistent preference for $\gamma &gt; 0.55$ at the level of $\sim 2\sigma$. This preference increases to $\sim 2.5$-$3\sigma$ when a physically motivated prior $\sum m_\nu \ge 0.06$ eV from oscillation experiments is imposed.</description>

      <title>New Radio Data on Sources of the Big Trio Program for Searching for Distant Radio Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio sources with steep and ultra-steep spectra, identified through a series of surveys of the Cold experiment using the RATAN-600 radio telescope, formed the basis of the Big Trio program aimed at discovering distant radio galaxies. With the advent of new radio, optical, and infrared sky surveys, it became possible to carry out additional studies of the 113 radio sources observed within this program using the 6-meter BTA telescope.
  Morphological features indicative of the evolutionary state of radio sources revealed that 9 objects exhibit signs of restarted activity, 12 can be classified as young, and 2 as dying. Based on their WAT/NAT and WRS morphologies, 24 sources are likely located within galaxy groups or clusters, or show evidence of jet reorientation. Additionally, four objects in the sample represent pairs of radio sources whose host galaxies are separated by only a few tens of kiloparsecs.
  Continuum spectra were constructed, and variability indices were calculated. A high proportion of sources with a variability index ($V&gt;3$) is attributed to significant differences in angular resolution between the TXS and VCSS surveys, as well as to underestimated flux densities for certain double-lobed sources.
  A comparison of spectral indices derived from older and newer data indicates a decrease in the number of steep-spectrum sources in the sample. This reduction is most likely due to improved characterization of the low-frequency portion of the continuum spectra following the incorporation of GLEAM data. However, for some radio sources, the observed spectral changes may reflect internal evolution, that observed in a shift of the spectral peak or a roll-off in the radio spectrum towards lower frequencies, as evidenced by flux density measurements from various catalogues covering a period of up to forty years.</description>

Abstract: We study an overpopulated gas of gravitationally interacting bosons surrounding a droplet of Bose-Einstein condensate - Bose star. We argue that kinetic evolution of this gas approaches with time a self-similar attractor solution to the kinetic equation. If the scale symmetry of the equation is broken by external conditions, the attractor solution exists, remains approximately self-similar, but has slowly drifting scaling dimension. The latter new regime of adiabatic self-similarity can determine growth of dark matter Bose stars in cosmological models.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Model with Quadratic Equation of State: Background Evolution and Structure Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that dark matter (DM) possesses a quadratic equation of state, which becomes significant at high densities, altering the Universe's evolution during its early stages. We derive the modified background evolution equations for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the DM density parameter $\Omega_{\text{dm}}(z)$. We then perturb the governing equations to study the linear growth of matter fluctuations, computing the observable growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$. Finally, we compare the model with the latest cosmological data, including Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, and growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$ data, up to $z=3$. Our results indicate that the quadratic model, while remaining consistent with background observations, offers a distinct imprint on the growth of structure, providing not only a new phenomenological avenue to address cosmological tensions but also shedding light on the nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmological Euler equation: viscosity, equivalence principle, and gravity beyond general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the cosmological Euler equation can be tested in the presence of viscous dark matter, violations of the equivalence principle (EP), and modifications of gravity, while relying on minimal theoretical assumptions. Extending the previous analysis, we generalize the observable $E_P$, which quantifies EP violation, to $\tilde{E}_P$, discuss the degeneracy between bulk and shear viscosities and EP-violating effects, and explicitly show that the EP can still be tested in the small-viscosity limit. In addition, we identify a model-independent observable, $C_{\rm vis,0}$, which characterizes the present-day dark matter viscosity and can be measured from relativistic galaxy number counts by cross-correlating two galaxy populations. We perform forecasts for three forthcoming Stage-IV surveys: DESI, Euclid, and SKA Phase 2 (SKA2), and find that $C_{\rm vis,0}$ can be tightly constrained, at the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ or better in all cases. Among these surveys, SKA2 provides the tightest constraint, with a $1\sigma$ uncertainty of $1.08 \times 10^{-7}$ on $C_{\rm vis,0}$.</description>

      <title>Clustering in dynamical dark energy: observational constraints from DESI, CMB, and supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the clustering properties of dynamical dark energy using the latest cosmological observations. We describe the dark energy perturbation within two complementary frameworks, namely the Parameterized Post-Friedmann (PPF) approach and the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of dark energy. Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations together with Planck 2018 CMB data and the Union3 supernova sample, we constrain the effective sound speed of dark energy in both the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM backgrounds. Within the PPF description, the sound speed remains unconstrained for $w$CDM, while for the $w_0w_a$CDM case we obtain $\log_{10} c_s^2 = -3.00^{+2.9}_{-0.99}$. Additionally, in the EFT framework, both models favor a small sound speed, with a mean value $c_s^2 \simeq 0.3$--$0.4$ but with significant uncertainties. For dynamical dark energy, the reconstructed equation of state clearly exhibits a quintom-B behavior, and its deviation from $\Lambda$CDM reaches $3.42\sigma$, rising to $3.63\sigma$ when PPF perturbations are included and reducing to $3.19\sigma$ in the EFT case. Finally, model comparison using information criteria shows that the $w_0w_a$CDM model with a smooth, non-clustering dark energy component ($c_s^2 = 1$) is preferred by AIC, whereas BIC favors $\Lambda$CDM. In summary, current data indicate a mild preference for dynamical dark energy but no evidence for significant clustering, which implies the need for future high-precision observations to probe the perturbative behavior more definitively.</description>

Abstract: General Relativity (GR) is not the only way gravity can be geometrised. Instead of curvature, the Teleparallel Theory attributes gravity to torsion $T$, which is related to the antysimmetric part of connection, and the Symmetric Teleparallel theory no longer preserves metricity, describing gravity through the non-metricity tensor $Q_{\alpha\mu\nu}\equiv \nabla_\alpha g_{\mu\nu}.$ These descriptions give form to what is known as geometrical trinity of gravity. Recently, the extensions of GR have been intensively investigated in order to solve the theoretical impasses which have arisen. In this sense, it is also useful to investigate the extensions of alternative descriptions of gravity, which leads us to the so-called $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ gravities. In this paper, we consider a family of $f(Q)$ models and obtain their corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-{Volkoff} equations applied to {polytropic} stars. Using numerical integration, it is possible to solve a system of differential equations and calculate, among other things, the maximum mass and mass-radius relation allowed. In addition, we explicitly show the non-metricity behavior inside and outside the star.</description>

Abstract: We propose a precise test of two fundamental gravitational constants using a detector concept that exploits the dynamics of quantum phononic excitations in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), operable at the scale of tabletop experiments. In this setup, the sensitivity is enhanced by approximately 2 orders of magnitude through the use of a tritter operation, which mixes phononic excitations with the BEC's ground state. The BEC exhibits unique sensitivity to the two key components of the gravitational potential in $\Lambda$-gravity: the Newtonian $GM/r$ term and the cosmological constant $\Lambda r^2$, both entering the most general function following from a Gurzadyan's theorem. Using state-of-the-art experimental design, we predict that the gravitational constant $G$ could be measured with an accuracy up to $10^{-17}$ N m$^2$/kg$^2$, representing an improvement by 2 orders of magnitude over current measurements. Moreover, this experiment aims to establish the best Earth-based upper limit on $\Lambda$ at $&lt;10^{-31}$ m$^{-2}$, marking the first laboratory-based probe of the cosmological constant. Additionally, the setup allows for the measurement of the distance-dependent behavior of each term in the gravitational potential, providing a means to test modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>VEGA: Voids idEntification using Genetic Algorithm</title>

Abstract: Cosmic voids are large, nearly empty regions that lie between the web of galaxies, filaments and walls, and are recognized for their extensive applications in the field of cosmology and astrophysics. Despite their significance, a universal definition of voids remains unsettled as various void-finding methods identify different types of voids, each differing in shape and density, based on the method that were used. In this paper, we present VEGA, a novel algorithm for void identification. VEGA utilizes Voronoi tessellation to divide the dataset space into spatial cells and applies the Convex Hull algorithm to estimate the volume of each cell. It then integrates Genetic Algorithm analysis with luminosity density contrast to filter out over-dense cells and retain the remaining ones, referred to as void block cells. These filtered cells form the basis for constructing the final void structures. VEGA operates on a grid of points, which increases the algorithm's spatial accessibility to the dataset and facilitates the identification of seed points around which the algorithm constructs the voids. To evaluate VEGA's performance, we applied both VEGA and the Aikio M\"ah\"onen method to the same test dataset. We compared the resulting void populations in terms of their luminosity and number density contrast, as well as their morphological features such as sphericity. This comparison demonstrated that the VEGA void finding method yields reliable results and can be effectively applied to various particle distributions.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapless Theories and Unparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute correlation functions of the primordial density perturbations when they couple to a gapless, strongly coupled sector of spectator fields -- ``unparticles" -- during inflation. We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle. Only the full shapes of bispectra and trispectra can break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Why $w \ne -1$? Anthropic Selection in a $\Lambda$ + Axion Dark Energy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a dark energy model composed of a bare negative cosmological constant and a single ultra-light axion, motivated by the string axiverse. Assuming that intelligent observers arise and observe, as in our universe, the onset of dark-energy-driven acceleration following matter domination, and that this acceleration persists to the present, we derive nontrivial constraints on both the axion mass and the bare cosmological constant. The axion mass is bounded from above to avoid fine-tuning of the initial misalignment angle near the hilltop, and from below because too light axions cannot achieve accelerated expansion due to their limited energy budget. As a result, the anthropically allowed axion mass range typically lies around $m = \mathcal{O}(10)\, H_0$ for a decay constant close to the Planck scale, where $H_0$ is the observed value of the Hubble constant. In this framework, the dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w_0$ generically deviates from $-1$ by $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$, providing a natural explanation for why $w \ne -1$ may be expected. We also find that, for a decay constant slightly smaller than the Planck scale, the peak value of dark energy density is significantly smaller than the anthropic bound on the cosmological constant and can be close to the observed value. These outcomes are intriguingly consistent with recent DESI hints of time-varying dark energy, and offer a compelling anthropic explanation within the $\Lambda$ + axion framework.</description>

      <title>Time as a test-field: the no-boundary universe in motion and a smooth radiation bounce</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proper time of an observer can be introduced as a degree of freedom in quantum cosmology, additional to the existing fields. We review two arguments for using the Schr\"odinger equation to evolve the corresponding wavefunction. We restrict to solutions in which time acts as a component with negligible backreaction on the metric -- that is, it plays the role of a test field. We apply this idea to various minisuperspace models. In the semiclassical regime we recover expected results: the wavefunction peaks on the classical solution and, in models with a scalar field, the variance of $\zeta$ (a mini-superspace analogue of the comoving curvature perturbation) is conserved. Applied to the no-boundary wavefunction, our model recovers the bouncing behavior of classical global de Sitter space, with small corrections associated to the evolving variance of the wavefunction. Other bouncing solutions do not have any classical analogue. This is the case of a radiation dominated universe, which classically leads to a big-bang singularity but corresponds quantum mechanically to an $s$-wave scattering off a central potential of the form $-r^{-2/3}$. As much as the hydrogen atom, this potential is famously made stable by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. We study the unitary evolution of the wavepacket numerically. During the bounce, the uncertainty and the expectation value of the scale factor become comparable. By selecting a large initial variance, the bounce can be made arbitrarily smooth, the mean value of the Hubble parameter correspondingly soft.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Posteriors with Stellar Population Synthesis on GPUs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models of Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS) provide a predictive framework for the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a galaxy. SPS predictions can be computationally intensive, creating a bottleneck for attempts to infer the physical properties of large populations of individual galaxies from their SEDs and photometry; these computational challenges are especially daunting for near-future cosmology surveys that will measure the photometry of billions of galaxies. In this paper, we explore a range of computational techniques aimed at accelerating SPS predictions of galaxy photometry using the JAX library to target GPUs. We study a particularly advantageous approximation to the calculation of galaxy photometry that speeds up the computation by a factor of 50 relative to the exact calculation. We introduce a novel technique for incorporating burstiness into models of galaxy star formation history that captures very short-timescale fluctuations with negligible increase in computation time. We study the performance of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms in which individual chains are parallelized across independent GPU threads, finding that our pipeline can carry out Bayesian inference at a rate of approximately $1000$ galaxy posteriors per minute on a single GPU. Our results provide an update to standard benchmarks in the literature on the computational demands of SPS inference; our publicly available code enables previously-impractical Bayesian analyses of large galaxy samples, and includes several standalone modules that could be adopted to speedup existing SPS pipelines.</description>

      <title>Binary Neutron Star Mergers: Multi-Messenger Systematics and Prospects with Next-Generation Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-messenger astronomy was galvanized by the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and electromagnetic (EM) emission from the subsequent kilonova and short gamma ray burst. Maximizing multi-messenger constraints on these systems requires combining models of the progenitors and products of BNS mergers within a single framework. Motivated by GW170817, we create a combined model that relate the progenitor astrophysics of a BNS population with their GW observability and localizability, kilonova light curves, gamma-ray burst afterglow flux, and kilonova remnant evolution. We compute the BNS merger rate by convolving metallicity-dependent star-formation history with population-synthesis predictions, and we sample realistic populations to evaluate their GW and EM observables and joint detection rates. We find that next-generation detectors will typically observe BNS mergers with GW network signal-to-noise ratios of $\sim$ 10 to 20, 90th-percentile sky areas of order $\sim$ 10 deg$^2$, and kilonova $i$-band magnitudes spanning $\sim$ 23 to 33. The variation of the merger rate with respect to the common-envelope efficiency is shown in the GW and EM observables and the resulting multi-messenger detection yield, demonstrating how uncertainties propagate into all stages of joint GW+EM forecasting. Across the models examined, no more than $\sim$ 4% of BNS mergers are detectable simultaneously by a two-Cosmic-Explorer plus one-Einstein-Telescope network and by both Roman (in a $K$-like band) and Rubin ($i$ and $g$ bands). These results show that assumptions underlying the combination of progenitor evolution and source observables will constitute key multi-messenger modeling systematics for inference of astrophysical, nuclear, and fundamental physics from future datasets.</description>

      <title>The $R^2$-Higgs inflation: $R^3$ contribution and preheating after ACT and SPT data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $R^2$-Higgs inflation is one of the simplest yet best-fit models consistent with Planck data. The higher spectral index $n_s$ recently reported by the combined cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), South Pole Telescope (SPT), and Planck, along with baryonic acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), disfavors the single-field-like regime of $R^2$-Higgs inflation at approximately $2\sigma$. Following a doubly covariant formalism, we show that the $R^2$-Higgs inflation, when modified by a dimension-six $R^3$ term, can account for the high $n_s$ reported by CMB+BAO. In this regard, we find that preheating may play a pivotal role. We also show that if the nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar $R$ and the Higgs field is $\mathcal{O}(10)$, then preheating via the production of Higgs quanta may help explain the reported observations.</description>

      <title>Heavy Field Effects on Inflationary Models in Light of ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), when combined with Planck and DESI datasets, indicate a scalar spectral index $n_s$ larger than that reported in the Planck 2018 baseline, thereby challenging conventional Starobinsky-type ($\alpha$-attractor) inflationary scenarios at the $2\sigma$ level. In addition, the positive running of the spectral index $\alpha_s$ implied by the data provides strong constraints on these models. In this paper, we explore the possibility that the presence of an additional heavy field during inflation, with a mass of order the Hubble scale and a sizable mixing coupling to the inflaton, can reconcile such inflationary models with the ACT results by increasing both $n_s$ and $\alpha_s$, particularly in the strong-mixing regime. Furthermore, we extend this framework to traditional inflation models such as chaotic inflation and natural inflation, which have already been excluded by Planck alone, and show that they can be revived in certain regions of parameter space. Inflationary observables, including the spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the running $\alpha_s$, are computed within the single-field EFT approach, which is applicable even in the presence of a heavy field with large mixing. We also discuss the non-Gaussianity signatures arising from the heavy field, noting that parts of the parameter space are already excluded or can be tested in future observations. Finally, we present concrete model realizations that allow for such a large mixing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stability and possible fates of Little Red Dots, under the stellar-only interpretation of their observational features. This is performed by a combination of analyzing the relevant timescales in their stellar dynamics and also, the application of recent numerical results on the evolution of the densest stellar systems. We find that these objects typically have tage ~ tcoll &lt; trelax, therefore, in an unexplored regime never observed before for a stellar system and potentially, highly unstable to runaway collisions. We study different scenarios for the evolution of Little Red Dots and conclude that in a fair fraction of those systems, the formation of a massive black hole by runaway collisions seems unavoidable, in all the possibilities studied within the stellar-only interpretation. This evolutionary path would naturally explain many of the problematic characteristics of Little Red Dots, including that these objects are probably transient in the history of the Universe, that most of them would not emit X-rays since they would not yet have become massive black holes, and once they do, they would constitute a significant portion of the mass of the Little Red Dots. We conclude that Little Red Dots are the most favourable known places to find a recently formed massive black hole seed, or in the process of formation, most probably formed directly in the supermassive range</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel class of bosonic dark matter candidates that we dub wallions, featuring boundaries in field space. The wallion mass is exponentially suppressed when the separation between boundaries far exceeds their intrinsic width and remains radiatively stable under self-interactions. We study the early-universe evolution of wallions and the associated cosmological signatures. Finally, we show that instanton effects can dynamically generate field-space boundaries and discuss possible experimental probes once the wallion couples to Standard Model fields.</description>

      <title>Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO): Options for robust Deep Spectral Line Imaging in the SKA-Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17307v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The data storage requirements for deep spectral line observations with next-generation radio interferometers like the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are extremely challenging. The default strategy is to reduce data after each daily observation and stack the resulting images. Although this approach is computationally efficient, it risks propagating systematic errors and significantly degrades the final data quality. However, storage and computation requirements for a traditional way to image the entire deep dataset together are prohibitively expensive. We present an alternative \textit{uv}-grid stacking method and compare its scientific outcomes with both the traditional approach, which processes all data jointly and serves as the best-possible result, and the default image-stacking method. Our technique involves halting the standard imaging pipeline after the daily residual visibility grids are formed. These grids are then stacked and jointly deconvolved to combine many epochs of data. Using the traditional approach as a benchmark, we show that image-stacking recovers only 92\% of the true {\HI} flux. In contrast, our \textit{uv}-grid stacking method recovers 99\%, which is in excellent agreement with the traditional method within the noise limits. Furthermore, image-stacking introduces significant non-physical artefacts, such as negative bowls around strong sources, indicating poor deconvolution and a loss of physical information. Based on these findings, we intend to apply the \textit{uv}-grid stacking to the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) survey on ASKAP and strongly recommend this or a similar approach for future radio astronomy facilities.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we have discovered a new avenue of fibre inflation in perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS) due to the redefinition of the base modulus. pLVS offers a novel regime where large volume of the internal space is guaranteed without the need of non-perturbative effects. In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\lesssim r\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $\alpha^{\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier.</description>
