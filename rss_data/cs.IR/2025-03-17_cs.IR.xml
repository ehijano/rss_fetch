      <title>Variational Bayesian Personalized Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation systems have found extensive applications across diverse domains. However, the training data available typically comprises implicit feedback, manifested as user clicks and purchase behaviors, rather than explicit declarations of user preferences. This type of training data presents three main challenges for accurate ranking prediction: First, the unobservable nature of user preferences makes likelihood function modeling inherently difficult. Second, the resulting false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) introduce noise into the learning process, disrupting parameter learning. Third, data bias arises as observed interactions tend to concentrate on a few popular items, exacerbating the feedback loop of popularity bias. To address these issues, we propose Variational BPR, a novel and easily implementable learning objective that integrates key components for enhancing collaborative filtering: likelihood optimization, noise reduction, and popularity debiasing. Our approach involves decomposing the pairwise loss under the ELBO-KL framework and deriving its variational lower bound to establish a manageable learning objective for approximate inference. Within this bound, we introduce an attention-based latent interest prototype contrastive mechanism, replacing instance-level contrastive learning, to effectively reduce noise from problematic samples. The process of deriving interest prototypes implicitly incorporates a flexible hard sample mining strategy, capable of simultaneously identifying hard positive and hard negative samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this hard sample mining strategy promotes feature distribution uniformity, thereby alleviating popularity bias. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Variational BPR on popular backbone recommendation models.

      <title>Addressing Information Loss and Interaction Collapse: A Dual Enhanced Attention Framework for Feature Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transformer has proven to be a significant approach in feature interaction for CTR prediction, achieving considerable success in previous works. However, it also presents potential challenges in handling feature interactions. Firstly, Transformers may encounter information loss when capturing feature interactions. By relying on inner products to represent pairwise relationships, they compress raw interaction information, which can result in a degradation of fidelity. Secondly, due to the long-tail features distribution, feature fields with low information-abundance embeddings constrain the information abundance of other fields, leading to collapsed embedding matrices. To tackle these issues, we propose a Dual Attention Framework for Enhanced Feature Interaction, known as Dual Enhanced Attention. This framework integrates two attention mechanisms: the Combo-ID attention mechanism and the collapse-avoiding attention mechanism. The Combo-ID attention mechanism directly retains feature interaction pairs to mitigate information loss, while the collapse-avoiding attention mechanism adaptively filters out low information-abundance interaction pairs to prevent interaction collapse. Extensive experiments conducted on industrial datasets have shown the effectiveness of Dual Enhanced Attention.</description>

      <title>Improving RAG Retrieval via Propositional Content Extraction: a Speech Act Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When users formulate queries, they often include not only the information they seek, but also pragmatic markers such as interrogative phrasing or polite requests. Although these speech act indicators communicate the user\textquotesingle s intent -- whether it is asking a question, making a request, or stating a fact -- they do not necessarily add to the core informational content of the query itself. This paper investigates whether extracting the underlying propositional content from user utterances -- essentially stripping away the linguistic markers of intent -- can improve retrieval quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Drawing upon foundational insights from speech act theory, we propose a practical method for automatically transforming queries into their propositional equivalents before embedding. To assess the efficacy of this approach, we conducted an experimental study involving 63 user queries related to a Brazilian telecommunications news corpus with precomputed semantic embeddings. Results demonstrate clear improvements in semantic similarity between query embeddings and document embeddings at top ranks, confirming that queries stripped of speech act indicators more effectively retrieve relevant content.</description>

      <title>Ordered Semantically Diverse Sampling for Textual Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of diversity sampling is to select a representative subset of data in a way that maximizes information contained in the subset while keeping its cardinality small. We introduce the ordered diverse sampling problem based on a new metric that measures the diversity in an ordered list of samples. We present a novel approach for generating ordered diverse samples for textual data that uses principal components on the embedding vectors. The proposed approach is simple and compared with existing approaches using the new metric. We transform standard text classification benchmarks into benchmarks for ordered diverse sampling. Our empirical evaluation shows that prevailing approaches perform 6% to 61% worse than our method while also being more time inefficient. Ablation studies show how the parts of the new approach contribute to the overall metrics.</description>

      <title>ClaimTrust: Propagation Trust Scoring for RAG Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems has revolutionized large-scale content generation but has also highlighted the challenge of ensuring trustworthiness in retrieved information. This paper introduces ClaimTrust, a propagation-based trust scoring framework that dynamically evaluates the reliability of documents in a RAG system. Using a modified PageRank-inspired algorithm, ClaimTrust propagates trust scores across documents based on relationships derived from extracted factual claims. We preprocess and analyze 814 political news articles from Kaggle's Fake News Detection Dataset to extract 2,173 unique claims and classify 965 meaningful relationships (supporting or contradicting). By representing the dataset as a document graph, ClaimTrust iteratively updates trust scores until convergence, effectively differentiating trustworthy articles from unreliable ones. Our methodology, which leverages embedding-based filtering for efficient claim comparison and relationship classification, achieves a 11.2% of significant connections while maintaining computational scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that ClaimTrust successfully assigns higher trust scores to verified documents while penalizing those containing false information. Future directions include fine-tuned claim extract and compare (Li et al., 2022), parameter optimization, enhanced language model utilization, and robust evaluation metrics to generalize the framework across diverse datasets and domains.</description>

      <title>Harmonizing Large Language Models with Collaborative Behavioral Signals for Conversational Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational recommendation frameworks have gained prominence as a dynamic paradigm for delivering personalized suggestions via interactive dialogues. The incorporation of advanced language understanding techniques has substantially improved the dialogue fluency of such systems. However, while modern language models demonstrate strong proficiency in interpreting user preferences articulated through natural conversation, they frequently encounter challenges in effectively utilizing collective behavioral patterns - a crucial element for generating relevant suggestions. To mitigate this limitation, this work presents a novel probabilistic framework that synergizes behavioral patterns with conversational interactions through latent preference modeling. The proposed method establishes a dual-channel alignment mechanism where implicit preference representations learned from collective user interactions serve as a connecting mechanism between behavioral data and linguistic expressions. Specifically, the framework first derives latent preference representations through established collaborative filtering techniques, then employs these representations to jointly refine both the linguistic preference expressions and behavioral patterns through an adaptive fusion process. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to various state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in aligning conversational interactions with collaborative behavioral signals.</description>

      <title>RankPO: Preference Optimization for Job-Talent Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matching job descriptions (JDs) with suitable talent requires models capable of understanding not only textual similarities between JDs and candidate resumes but also contextual factors such as geographical location and academic seniority. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage training framework for large language models (LLMs). In the first stage, a contrastive learning approach is used to train the model on a dataset constructed from real-world matching rules, such as geographical alignment and research area overlap. While effective, this model primarily learns patterns that defined by the matching rules. In the second stage, we introduce a novel preference-based fine-tuning method inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), termed Rank Preference Optimization (RankPO), to align the model with AI-curated pairwise preferences emphasizing textual understanding. Our experiments show that while the first-stage model achieves strong performance on rule-based data (nDCG@20 = 0.706), it lacks robust textual understanding (alignment with AI annotations = 0.46). By fine-tuning with RankPO, we achieve a balanced model that retains relatively good performance in the original tasks while significantly improving the alignment with AI preferences. The code and data are available at https://github.com/yflyzhang/RankPO.</description>

      <title>Taxonomic Reasoning for Rare Arthropods: Combining Dense Image Captioning and RAG for Interpretable Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of pressing climate change challenges and the significant biodiversity loss among arthropods, automated taxonomic classification from organismal images is a subject of intense research. However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.</description>

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), which struggle with spatial data retrieval and reasoning. We propose Spatial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Spatial-RAG), a framework that extends RAG to spatial tasks by integrating sparse spatial retrieval (spatial databases) and dense semantic retrieval (LLM-based similarity). A multi-objective ranking strategy balances spatial constraints and semantic relevance, while an LLM-guided generator ensures coherent responses. Experiments on a real-world tourism dataset show that Spatial-RAG significantly improves spatial question answering, bridging the gap between LLMs and spatial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Probability-turbulence divergence: A tunable allotaxonometric instrument for comparing heavy-tailed categorical distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.13078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world complex systems often comprise many distinct types of elements as well as many more types of networked interactions between elements. When the relative abundances of types can be measured well, we often observe heavy-tailed categorical distributions for type frequencies. For the comparison of type frequency distributions of two systems or a system with itself at different time points in time -- a facet of allotaxonometry -- a great range of probability divergences are available. Here, we introduce and explore `probability-turbulence divergence', a tunable, straightforward, and interpretable instrument for comparing normalizable categorical frequency distributions. We model probability-turbulence divergence (PTD) after rank-turbulence divergence (RTD). While probability-turbulence divergence is more limited in application than rank-turbulence divergence, it is more sensitive to changes in type frequency. We build allotaxonographs to display probability turbulence, incorporating a way to visually accommodate zero probabilities for `exclusive types' which are types that appear in only one system. We explore comparisons of example distributions taken from literature, social media, and ecology. We show how probability-turbulence divergence either explicitly or functionally generalizes many existing kinds of distances and measures, including, as special cases, $L^{(p)}$ norms, the S{\o}rensen-Dice coefficient (the $F_{1}$ statistic), and the Hellinger distance. We discuss similarities with the generalized entropies of R{\'e}nyi and Tsallis, and the diversity indices (or Hill numbers) from ecology. We close with thoughts on open problems concerning the optimization of the tuning of rank- and probability-turbulence divergence.</description>

      <title>CSA: Data-efficient Mapping of Unimodal Features to Multimodal Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07610v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal encoders like CLIP excel in tasks such as zero-shot image classification and cross-modal retrieval. However, they require excessive training data. We propose canonical similarity analysis (CSA), which uses two unimodal encoders to replicate multimodal encoders using limited data. CSA maps unimodal features into a multimodal space, using a new similarity score to retain only the multimodal information. CSA only involves the inference of unimodal encoders and a cubic-complexity matrix decomposition, eliminating the need for extensive GPU-based model training. Experiments show that CSA outperforms CLIP while requiring $50,000\times$ fewer multimodal data pairs to bridge the modalities given pre-trained unimodal encoders on ImageNet classification and misinformative news caption detection. CSA surpasses the state-of-the-art method to map unimodal features to multimodal features. We also demonstrate the ability of CSA with modalities beyond image and text, paving the way for future modality pairs with limited paired multimodal data but abundant unpaired unimodal data, such as lidar and text.</description>

      <title>OASIS: Order-Augmented Strategy for Improved Code Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code embeddings capture the semantic representations of code and are crucial for various code-related large language model (LLM) applications, such as code search. Previous training primarily relies on optimizing the InfoNCE loss by comparing positive natural language (NL)-code pairs with in-batch negatives. However, due to the sparse nature of code contexts, training solely by comparing the major differences between positive and negative pairs may fail to capture deeper semantic nuances. To address this issue, we propose a novel order-augmented strategy for improved code search (OASIS). It leverages order-based similarity labels to train models to capture subtle differences in similarity among negative pairs. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate that our OASIS model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models focusing solely on major positive-negative differences. It underscores the value of exploiting subtle differences among negative pairs with order labels for effective code embedding training.</description>

      <title>Quality Over Quantity? LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains challenging. We present Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA), which aligns audiovisual (AV) scene content beyond mere temporal synchronization via a Large Language Model (LLM)-based data curation pipeline. Specifically, AVVA scores and selects high-quality training clips using Whisper (speech-based audio foundation model) for audio and DINOv2 for video within a dual-encoder contrastive learning framework. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate that this approach can achieve significant accuracy gains with substantially less curated data. For instance, AVVA yields a 7.6% improvement in top-1 accuracy for audio-to-video retrieval on VGGSound compared to ImageBind, despite training on only 192 hours of carefully filtered data (vs. 5800+ hours). Moreover, an ablation study highlights that trading data quantity for data quality improves performance, yielding respective top-3 accuracy increases of 47.8, 48.4, and 58.0 percentage points on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound over uncurated baselines. While these results underscore AVVA's data efficiency, we also discuss the overhead of LLM-driven curation and how it may be scaled or approximated in larger domains. Overall, AVVA provides a viable path toward more robust, text-free audiovisual learning with improved retrieval accuracy.</description>
