      <title>Stable soap bubble clusters with multiple torus bubbles: getting a bit more exotic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, numerical examples of stable soap bubble clusters with multiple torus bubbles have been presented. The geometry of these clusters is based on the Platonic solids whose vertices have valence $3$ (in order to fulfill Plateau's laws): the tetrahedron, the cube, the dodecahedron. The clusters respectively contain a bubble of genus $3, 5, 11$. The construction is quite generic and can be used with any convex polyhedron. If stable, the cluster obtained using a polyhedron with $n$ faces has $3n+2$ bubbles and one of these bubbles has genus $n-1$. We propose here to show that is it possible to get stable soap bubble clusters with multiple torus bubbles using a geometry based on prisms and Archimedean solids as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quintessential source of heat, the Sun radiates toward the Earth a power ten thousand times greater than humanity's energy needs. Harnessing this energy bounty, however, requires capturing and converting sunlight. Today, this conversion can be achieved through several families of technologies at varying stages of maturity: photovoltaic solar, thermal, concentrated solar power, and more. While their applications differ, all these technologies must meet common fundamental constraints, and as Carnot proposed, one can 'consider in all its generality the principle of producing motion through heat' from the Sun. However, unlike traditional 'heat engines,' the coupling with the hot source here is radiative, introducing specific constraints that must be accounted for. In this presentation dedicated to radiative machines, you will encounter familiar terms as well as particular expressions that will provide the keys to understanding solar technologies</description>
