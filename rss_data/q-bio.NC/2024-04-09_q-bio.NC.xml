      <title>Mapping the Mind-Brain Duality to a Digital-Analog Perceptual Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Could the abstract ideas of our minds originate from neuronal interactions within our brains? To address this question, we examine interactions within 'brain-world' (BW) and 'brain-brain' (BB) domains, which represent the brain's physical interactions with its environment and the mental interactions between brains, respectively. BW interactions are characterized as analog - dynamic and continuous, whereas BB interactions are digital - non-dynamic and discrete. This distinction allows BB interactions to facilitate effective, albeit information-limited, communication through categorization. We review existing data showing that cascades of neural circuits can convert between analog and digital signals, thereby linking physical and mental processes. Importantly, we argue that these circuits cannot fully reduce one domain to the other, suggesting that the mind-brain duality can be mapped to the BB-BW duality. Such mapping suggests that the mind's foundation is inherently social, offering a novel explanation for the physical-mental gap while acknowledging the coexistence of the physical body and the non-physical mind.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tonality: A Mathemusical Playground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adopt some basic ideas on quantum-theoretical modeling of tonal attraction and develop them further in an alternative direction. Fitting Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to the Krumhansl-Kessler (KK) probe tone profiles for static attraction opens the possibility to investigate the underlying wave function as the stationary ground state of an anharmonic quantum oscillator with a schematic Hamiltonian involving a perturbation potential. We numerically verify the fulfilment of the associated stationary Schr\"odinger equation and also inspect its excited states as a solution basis for the corresponding time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. With their help we calculate the temporal evolution of any initial state. As an example, we study the dynamics of transpositions of the stationary KK wave function across Regener's line of fifths. This offers potential models for dynamic tonal attraction and also for the behavior of deflected key profiles within the Hamiltonian dynamics of a given tonality.</description>

      <title>Analysing heterogeneity in Alzheimer Disease using multimodal normative modelling on ATN biomarkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer Disease (AD) is a multi-faceted disorder, with each modality providing unique and complementary info about AD. In this study, we used a deep-learning based multimodal normative model to assess the heterogeneity in regional brain patterns for ATN (amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration) biomarkers. We selected discovery (n = 665) and replication (n = 430) cohorts with simultaneous availability of ATN biomarkers: Florbetapir amyloid, Flortaucipir tau and T1-weighted MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) imaging. A multimodal variational autoencoder (conditioned on age and sex) was used as a normative model to learn the multimodal regional brain patterns of a cognitively unimpaired (CU) control group. The trained model was applied on individuals on the ADS (AD Spectrum) to estimate their deviations (Z-scores) from the normative distribution, resulting in a Z-score regional deviation map per ADS individual per modality. ADS individuals with moderate or severe dementia showed higher proportion of regional outliers for each modality as well as more dissimilarity in modality-specific regional outlier patterns compared to ADS individuals with early or mild dementia. DSI was associated with the progressive stages of dementia, (ii) showed significant associations with neuropsychological composite scores and (iii) related to the longitudinal risk of CDR progression. Findings were reproducible in both discovery and replication cohorts. Our is the first study to examine the heterogeneity in AD through the lens of multiple neuroimaging modalities (ATN), based on distinct or overlapping patterns of regional outlier deviations. Regional MRI and tau outliers were more heterogenous than regional amyloid outliers. DSI has the potential to be an individual patient metric of neurodegeneration that can help in clinical decision making and monitoring patient response for anti-amyloid treatments.</description>

      <title>Group-specific discriminant analysis reveals statistically validated sex differences in lateralization of brain functional network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lateralization is a fundamental feature of the human brain, where sex differences have been observed. Conventional studies in neuroscience on sex-specific lateralization are typically conducted on univariate statistical comparisons between male and female groups. However, these analyses often lack effective validation of group specificity. Here, we formulate modeling sex differences in lateralization of functional networks as a dual-classification problem, consisting of first-order classification for left vs. right functional networks and second-order classification for male vs. female models. To capture sex-specific patterns, we develop the Group-Specific Discriminant Analysis (GSDA) for first-order classification. The evaluation on two public neuroimaging datasets demonstrates the efficacy of GSDA in learning sex-specific models from functional networks, achieving a significant improvement in group specificity over baseline methods. The major sex differences are in the strength of lateralization and the interactions within and between lobes. The GSDA-based method is generic in nature and can be adapted to other group-specific analyses such as handedness-specific or disease-specific analyses.</description>

      <title>Characterizing visual cortical magnification with topological smoothing and optimal transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human vision has different concentration on visual fields. Cortical magnification factor (CMF) is a popular measurement on visual acuity and cortex concentration. In order to achieve thorough measurement of CMF across the whole visual field, we propose a method to measure planar CMF upon retinotopic maps generated by pRF decoding, with help of our proposed methods: optimal transportation and topological smoothing. The optimal transportation re-calculates vertex location in retinotopic mapping, and topological smoothing guarantees topological conditions in retinotopic maps, which allow us to calculate planar CMF with the proposed 1-ring patch method. The pipeline was applied to the HCP 7T dataset, giving new planar results on CMF measurement across all 181 subjects, which illustrate novel concentration behavior on visual fields and their individual difference.</description>

      <title>Towards Explainable Automated Neuroanatomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for quantifying the microscopic structure of brain tissue. It is based on the automated recognition of interpretable features obtained by analyzing the shapes of cells. This contrasts with prevailing methods of brain anatomical analysis in two ways. First, contemporary methods use gray-scale values derived from smoothed version of the anatomical images, which dissipated valuable information from the texture of the images. Second, contemporary analysis uses the output of black-box Convolutional Neural Networks, while our system makes decisions based on interpretable features obtained by analyzing the shapes of individual cells. An important benefit of this open-box approach is that the anatomist can understand and correct the decisions made by the computer. Our proposed system can accurately localize and identify existing brain structures. This can be used to align and coregistar brains and will facilitate connectomic studies for reverse engineering of brain circuitry.</description>

      <title>Orientation selectivity properties for the affine Gaussian derivative and the affine Gabor models for visual receptive fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11920v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the orientation selectivity of simple and complex cells that can be well modelled by the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields, with the purely spatial component of the receptive fields determined by oriented affine Gaussian derivatives for different orders of spatial differentiation.
  A detailed mathematical analysis is presented for the three different cases of either: (i) purely spatial receptive fields, (ii) space-time separable spatio-temporal receptive fields and (iii) velocity-adapted spatio-temporal receptive fields. Closed-form theoretical expressions for the orientation selectivity curves for idealized models of simple and complex cells are derived for all these main cases, and it is shown that the orientation selectivity of the receptive fields becomes more narrow, as a scale parameter ratio $\kappa$, defined as the ratio between the scale parameters in the directions perpendicular to vs. parallel with the preferred orientation of the receptive field, increases. It is also shown that the orientation selectivity becomes more narrow with increasing order of spatial differentiation in the underlying affine Gaussian derivative operators over the spatial domain.
  For comparison, we also present a corresponding theoretical orientation selectivity analysis for purely spatial receptive fields according to an affine Gabor model. The results from that analysis are consistent with the results obtained from the affine Gaussian derivative model,in the respect that the orientation selectivity becomes more narrow when making the receptive fields wider in the direction perpendicular to the preferred orientation of the receptive field.</description>

      <title>Modulation of metastable ensemble dynamics explains optimal coding at moderate arousal in auditory cortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performance during perceptual decision-making exhibits an inverted-U relationship with arousal, but the underlying network mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we recorded from auditory cortex (A1) of behaving mice during passive tone presentation, while tracking arousal via pupillometry. We found that tone discriminability in A1 ensembles was optimal at intermediate arousal, revealing a population-level neural correlate of the inverted-U relationship. We explained this arousal-dependent coding using a spiking network model with a clustered architecture. Specifically, we show that optimal stimulus discriminability is achieved near a transition between a multi-attractor phase with metastable cluster dynamics (low arousal) and a single-attractor phase (high arousal). Additional signatures of this transition include arousal-induced reductions of overall neural variability and the extent of stimulus-induced variability quenching, which we observed in the empirical data. Our results elucidate computational principles underlying interactions between pupil-linked arousal, sensory processing, and neural variability, and suggest a role for phase transitions in explaining nonlinear modulations of cortical computations.</description>

      <title>Do the receptive fields in the primary visual cortex span a variability over the degree of elongation of the receptive fields?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents results of combining (i) theoretical analysis regarding connections between the orientation selectivity and the elongation of receptive fields for the affine Gaussian derivative model with (ii) biological measurements of orientation selectivity in the primary visual cortex, to investigate if (iii) the receptive fields can be regarded as spanning a variability in the degree of elongation.
  From an in-depth theoretical analysis of idealized models for the receptive fields of simple and complex cells in the primary visual cortex, we have established that the directional selectivity becomes more narrow with increasing elongation of the receptive fields. By comparison with previously established biological results, concerning broad vs. sharp orientation tuning of visual neurons in the primary visual cortex, we demonstrate that those underlying theoretical predictions, in combination with these biological results, are consistent with a previously formulated biological hypothesis, stating that the biological receptive field shapes should span the degrees of freedom in affine image transformations, to support affine covariance over the population of receptive fields in the primary visual cortex.
  Based on this possible indirect support for the working hypothesis concerning affine covariance, we formulate a set of testable predictions that could be used to, with neurophysiological experiments, judge if the receptive fields in the primary visual cortex of higher mammals could be regarded as spanning a variability over the eccentricity or the elongation of the receptive fields, and, if so, then also characterize if such a variability would, in a structured way, be related to the pinwheel structure in the visual cortex.</description>

      <title>Towards Developing Brain-Computer Interfaces for People with Multiple Sclerosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a severely disabling condition that leads to various neurological symptoms. A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) may substitute some lost function; however, there is a lack of BCI research in people with MS. To progress this research area effectively and efficiently, we aimed to evaluate user needs and assess the feasibility and user-centric requirements of a BCI for people with MS. We conducted an online survey of 34 people with MS to qualitatively assess user preferences and establish the initial steps of user-centred design. The survey aimed to understand their interest and preferences in BCI and bionic applications. We demonstrated widespread interest for BCI applications in all stages of MS, with a preference for a non-invasive (n = 12) or minimally invasive (n = 15) BCI over carer assistance (n = 6). Qualitative assessment indicated that this preference was not influenced by level of independence. Additionally, strong interest was noted in bionic technology for sensory and autonomic functions. Considering the potential to enhance independence and quality of life for people living with MS, the results emphasise the importance of user-centred design for future advancement of BCIs that account for the unique pathological changes associated with MS.</description>
