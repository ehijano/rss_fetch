      <title>Cosmological constraints from weak lensing scattering transform using HSC Y1 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As weak lensing surveys go deeper, there is an increasing need for reliable characterization of non-Gaussian structures at small angular scales. Here we present the first cosmological constraints with weak lensing scattering transform, a statistical estimator that combines efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. With the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey (HSC) year 1 data, we obtain $\Omega_\text{m}=0.29_{-0.03}^{+0.04}$, $S_8\equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_\text{m}/0.3)^{0.5}=0.83\pm0.02$, and intrinsic alignment strength $A_\text{IA}=1.0\pm0.4$ through simulation-based forward modeling. Our constraints are consistent with those derived from Planck. The error bar of $\Omega_\text{m}$ is 2 times tighter than that obtained from the power spectrum when the same scale range is used. This constraining power is on par with that of convolutional neural networks, suggesting that further investment in spatial information extraction may not yield substantial benefits.
  We also point out an internal tension of $S_8$ estimates linked to a redshift bin around z ~ 1 in the HSC data. We found that discarding that bin leads to a consistent decrease of $S_8$ from 0.83 to 0.79, for all statistical estimators. We argue that photometric redshift estimation is now the main limitation in the estimation of $S_8$ using HSC. This limitation is likely to affect other ground-based weak lensing surveys reaching redshifts greater than one. Alternative redshift estimation techniques, like clustering redshifts, may help alleviate this limitation.</description>

      <title>A dark standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant following LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA O4a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new constraint on the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from the standard dark siren method using a sample of $5$ well-covered gravitational wave (GW) alerts reported during the first part of the fourth LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing runs in combination with standard dark sirens from the first three runs. Our methodology relies on the galaxy catalog method alone. We use the full probability density estimation of photometric redshifts derived by a deep learning method using the DESI Legacy Survey and DELVE galaxy catalogs. We add the constraints from the binary black hole mergers candidates S231226av, S231206cc, S230919bj, S230627c, and S230922g to the sample of standard dark sirens analyzed in Alfradique et al. (2024). We combine the $H_0$ posterior for $5$ new standard sirens with other $10$ previous events (3 with updated posteriors), finding $H_0 = 69.9^{+13.3}_{-12.0}~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% Highest Density Interval) with the catalog method alone. This result represents an improvement of $\sim 23\%$ comparing the new $15$ dark siren constrain with the previous $10$ dark siren constraint, and a reduction in uncertainty of $\sim 40\%$ from the combination of $15$ dark and bright sirens compared with the GW170817 bright siren alone. The combination of dark and bright siren GW170817 with recent jet constraints yields $H_0$ of $68.0^{+4.3}_{-3.8}~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, a $\sim 6\%$ precision from Standard Sirens, reducing the previous constraint uncertainty by $\sim 10\%$ .</description>

      <title>A Cepheid systematics-free test of $H_0$ to $\lesssim2.5\%$ accuracy using SH0ES photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent SH0ES determination of the Hubble constant, $H_0=73.04\pm1.04$ km/s/Mpc, deviates significantly by $\approx5\sigma$ from the \textit{Planck} value, stimulating discussions on cosmological model extensions. To minimize statistical uncertainty and mitigate sensitivity to systematic errors in any single anchor distance determination, SH0ES combines Cepheids from various observations, including those from Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) host galaxies, NGC 4258, and closer galaxies (MW, LMC, SMC, and M31), although this mixed sample may introduce unknown or subtle systematic errors due to comparing distant and closer Cepheids. To address this, we propose a subset excluding Cepheids from the closer galaxies, retaining only the NGC 4258 water megamasers as a single anchor, circumventing potential systematic errors associated with observational methods and reduction techniques. Focusing solely on these Cepheids yields competitive statistical errors, approximately $2.5\%$, sufficient to identify a $\approx3\sigma$ tension with the \textit{Planck} $H_0$ value. Our approach offers an opportunity to utilize optical photometry with systematic uncertainty smaller than the statistical uncertainty, potentially achieving higher precision than NIR photometry, given the lower optical background. However, currently the optical photometry sample's fidelity does not match that of NIR photometry. The significant Hubble tension obtained is unrelated to Cepheids and we discuss other options.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Cosmic History: JWST-Extended Mapping of the Hubble Flow from z$ \sim $0 to z$ \sim$7.5 with HII Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over twenty years ago, Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) [arXiv:astro-ph/9805201, arXiv:astro-ph/9812133] observations revealed an accelerating Universe expansion, suggesting a significant dark energy presence, often modelled as a cosmological constant, $\Lambda$. Despite its pivotal role in cosmology, the standard $\Lambda$CDM model remains largely underexplored in the redshift range between distant SNIa and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This study harnesses the James Webb Space Telescope's advanced capabilities to extend the Hubble flow mapping across an unprecedented redshift range, from $z \approx 0$ to $z \approx 7.5$. Utilising a dataset of 231 HII galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, we employ the $\text{L}-\sigma$ relation, correlating the luminosity of Balmer lines with their velocity dispersion, to define a competitive technique for measuring cosmic distances. This approach maps the Universe's expansion over more than 12 billion years, covering 95\% of its age. Our analysis, using Bayesian inference, constrains the parameter space $\lbrace h, \Omega_m, w_0\rbrace = \lbrace 0.731\pm0.039, 0.302^{+0.12}_{-0.069}, -1.01^{+0.52}_{-0.29}\rbrace $ (statistical) for a flat Universe. These results provide new insights into cosmic evolution and suggest uniformity in the photo-kinematical properties of young massive ionizing clusters in giant HII regions and HII galaxies across most of the Universe's history.</description>

      <title>Spherical bispectrum expansion and quadratic estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a general expansion of spherical (full-sky) bispectra into a set of orthogonal modes. For squeezed shapes, the basis separates physically-distinct signals and is dominated by the lowest moments. In terms of reduced bispectra, we identify a set of discrete polynomials that are pairwise orthogonal with respect to the relevant Wigner 3j symbol, and reduce to Chebyshev polynomials in the flat-sky (high-momentum) limit for both parity-even and parity-odd cases. For squeezed shapes, the flat-sky limit is equivalent to previous moment expansions used for CMB bispectra and quadratic estimators, but in general reduces to a distinct expansion in the angular dependence of triangles at fixed total side length (momentum). We use the full-sky expansion to construct a tower of orthogonal CMB lensing quadratic estimators and construct estimators that are immune to foregrounds like point sources or noise inhomogeneities. In parity-even combinations (such as the lensing gradient mode from $TT$, or the lensing curl mode from $EB$) the leading two modes can be identified with information from the magnification and shear respectively, whereas the parity-odd combinations are shear-only. Although not directly separable, we show that these estimators can nonetheless be evaluated numerically sufficiently easily.</description>

      <title>Accelerated inference on accelerated cosmic expansion: New constraints on axion-like early dark energy with DESI BAO and ACT DR6 CMB lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early dark energy (EDE) extension to $\Lambda$CDM has been proposed as a candidate scenario to resolve the "Hubble tension". We present new constraints on the EDE model by incorporating new data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) survey and CMB lensing measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 and \textit{Planck} NPIPE data. We do not find evidence for EDE. The maximum fractional contribution of EDE to the total energy density is $f_\mathrm{EDE}&lt; 0.091 \; (95\% \; \mathrm{CL} )$ from our baseline combination of \textit{Planck} CMB, CMB lensing, and DESI BAO. Our strongest constraints on EDE come from the combination of \textit{Planck} CMB and CMB lensing alone, yielding $f_\mathrm{EDE}&lt; 0.070 \; (95\% \; \mathrm{CL} )$. We also explore extensions of $\Lambda$CDM beyond the EDE parameters by treating the total neutrino mass as a free parameter, finding $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.096 \,\, {\rm eV} \; (95\% \; \mathrm{CL} )$ and $f_\mathrm{EDE}&lt; 0.087 \; (95\% \; \mathrm{CL} )$. For the first time in EDE analyses, we perform Bayesian parameter estimation using neural network emulators of cosmological observables, which are on the order of a hundred times faster than full Boltzmann solutions.</description>

      <title>Cosmological probes of Dark Radiation from Neutrino Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of stepped dark radiation have recently been found to have an important impact on the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background, aiding in easing the Hubble tension. In this work, we study models with a sector of dark radiation with a step in its abundance, which thermalizes after big bang nucleosynthesis by mixing with the standard model neutrinos. For this, we extend an earlier work which has focused on the background evolution only until the dark sector thermalizes by deriving the full background and perturbation equations of the model and implementing them in an Einstein-Boltzmann solving code. We expound on the behavior of this model, discussing the wide range of parameters that result in interesting and viable cosmologies that dynamically generate dark radiation during a range of epochs. We find that for the strongly self-coupled regime, there is no large cosmological impact for a tight prior on the mass, whereas larger mass ranges allow a smooth interpolation between a behavior close to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological standard model and close to an additional component of strongly self-interacting dark radiation. In the weakly self-coupled regime we find that we can accommodate a parameter space relevant for the neutrino anomalies as well as one relevant to easing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Resonant Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel reheating scenario proceeding through $s$-channel inflaton annihilation, mediated by a massive scalar. If the inflaton $\phi$ oscillates around the minimum of a monomial potential $\propto \phi^{n}$, we reveal the emergence of resonance phenomena originating from the dynamic evolution of the inflaton mass for $n&gt;2$. Consequently, a resonance appears in both the radiation and the temperature evolution during the reheating process. By solving the coupled Boltzmann equations, we present solutions for radiation and temperature. We find non-trivial temperature characteristics during reheating, depending on the value of $n$ and the masses of the inflaton and mediator. Some phenomenological aspects of the model are explored. As a concrete example, we show that the same mediator participates in the genesis of dark matter, modifying the standard freeze-in dynamics. In addition, we demonstrate that the resonant reheating scenario could be tested by next-generation low- and high-frequency gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Millicharged Condensates on Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that long-ranged terrestrial electric fields can be used to exclude or discover ultralight bosonic particles with extremely small charge, beyond that probed by astrophysics. Bound condensates of scalar millicharged particles can be rapidly produced near electrostatic generators or in the atmosphere. If such particles directly couple to the photon, they quickly short out such electrical activity. Instead, for interactions mediated by a kinetically-mixed dark photon, the effects of this condensate are suppressed depending on the size of the kinetic mixing, but may still be directly detected with precision electromagnetic sensors. Analogous condensates can also develop in other theories involving new long-ranged forces, such as those coupled to baryon and lepton number.</description>

      <title>JWST MIRI detections of H$\alpha$ and [O III] and direct metallicity measurement of the $z=10.17$ lensed galaxy MACS0647$-$JD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST spectroscopy has revolutionized our understanding of galaxies in the early universe. Covering wavelengths up to $5.3\,{\rm \mu m}$, NIRSpec can detect rest-frame optical emission lines H$\alpha$ out to $z = 7$ and [O III] to $z = 9.5$. Observing these lines in more distant galaxies requires longer wavelength spectroscopy with MIRI. Here we present MIRI MRS IFU observations of the lensed galaxy merger MACS0647$-$JD at $z = 10.165$. With exposure times of 4.2 hours in each of two bands, we detect H$\alpha$ at $9\sigma$, [O III]$\,\lambda5008$ at $11\sigma$, and [O III]$\,\lambda4960$ at $3\sigma$. Combined with previously reported NIRSpec spectroscopy that yields seven emission lines including the auroral line [O III]$\,\lambda4363$, we present the first direct metallicity measurement of a $z &gt; 10$ galaxy: $12+{\rm log(O/H)}= 7.79\pm0.09$, or $0.13^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\,Z_{\odot}$. This is similar to galaxies at $z \sim 4 - 9$ with direct metallicity measurements, though higher than expected given the high specific star formation rate ${\rm log(sSFR / yr^{-1})} = -7.4 \pm 0.3$. We further constrain the ionization parameter ${\rm log}(U)$ = $-1.9 \pm 0.1$, ionizing photon production efficiency ${\rm log}(\xi_{\rm ion})$ = $25.3\pm0.1$, and star formation rate $5.0\pm0.6\,M_{\odot}/{\rm yr}$ within the past $10\,{\rm Myr}$. These observations demonstrate the combined power of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI for studying galaxies in the first $500$ million years.</description>

      <title>Confronting the Diversity Problem: The Limits of Galaxy Rotation Curves as a tool to Understand Dark Matter Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While galaxy rotation curves provide one of the most powerful methods for measuring dark matter profiles in the inner regions of rotation-supported galaxies, at the dwarf scale there are factors that can complicate this analysis. Given the expectation of a universal profile in dark matter-only simulations, the diversity of observed rotation curves has become an often-discussed issue in Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology on galactic scales. We analyze a suite of Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations of $10^{10}-10^{12}$ $M_\odot$ halos with standard cold dark matter, and compare the true circular velocity to rotation curve reconstructions. We find that, for galaxies with well-ordered gaseous disks, the measured rotation curve may deviate from true circular velocity by at most 10% within the radius of the disk. However, non-equilibrium behavior, non-circular motions, and non-thermal and non-kinetic stresses may cause much larger discrepancies of 50% or more. Most rotation curve reconstructions underestimate the true circular velocity, while some reconstructions transiently over-estimate it in the central few kiloparsecs due to dynamical phenomena. We further demonstrate that the features that contribute to these failures are not always visibly obvious in HI observations. If such dwarf galaxies are included in galaxy catalogs, they may give rise to the appearance of "artificial" rotation curve diversity that does not reflect the true variation in underlying dark matter profiles.</description>

      <title>Deci-Hz gravitational waves from the self-interacting axion cloud around the rotating stellar mass black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from condensates of ultra-light particles, such as axion, around rotating black holes are a promising probe to search for unknown physics. For this purpose, we need to characterize the signal to detect the gravitational waves, which requires tracking the evolution of the condensates, including various effects. The axion self-interaction causes the non-linear coupling between the superradiant modes, resulting in complicated branching of evolution. Most studies so far have considered evolution under the non-relativistic approximation or the two-mode approximation. In this paper, we numerically investigate the evolution of the axion condensate without these approximations, taking higher multipole modes into account. We also investigate the possible signature in gravitational waves from the condensate. We show that the higher multipole modes are excited, leading to the gravitational wave signal by the transition of the axion between different levels. The most prominent signal of gravitational waves arises from the transition between modes with their angular quantum numbers different by two. The gravitational wave signal is emitted in the deci-Hz band for stellar mass black holes, which might be observable with the future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Heavy Dark Matter in White Dwarfs: Multiple-Scattering Capture and Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an improved treatment for the scattering of heavy dark matter from the ion constituents of a white dwarf. In the heavy dark matter regime, multiple collisions are required for the dark matter to become gravitationally captured. Our treatment incorporates all relevant physical effects including the dark matter trajectories, nuclear form factors, and radial profiles for the white dwarf escape velocity and target number densities. Our capture rates differ by orders of magnitude from previous estimates, which have typically used approximations developed for dark matter scattering in the Earth. We also compute the time for the dark matter to thermalize in the center of the white dwarf, including in-medium effects such as phonon emission and absorption from the ionic lattice in the case where the star has a crystallized core. We find much shorter thermalization timescales than previously estimated, especially if the white dwarf core has crystallized. We illustrate the importance of our improved approach by determining the cross section required for accumulated asymmetric dark matter to self-gravitate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internal kinematics of galaxies, traced through the stellar rotation curve or two dimensional velocity map, carry important information on galactic structure and dark matter. With upcoming surveys, the velocity map may play a key role in the development of kinematic lensing as an astrophysical probe. We improve techniques for extracting velocity information from integral field spectroscopy at low signal-to-noise ($S/N$), without a template, and demonstrate substantial advantages over the standard Penalized PiXel-Fitting method (pPXF) approach. We note that Robust rotation curves can be derived down to $S/N\approx 2$ using our method.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Black Hole Shadow with Dark Matter Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has revolutionized our ability to study black holes by providing unprecedented spatial resolution and unveiling horizon-scale details. With advancements leading to the next-generation EHT, there is potential to probe even deeper into the black hole's dark region, especially the inner shadow characterized by low-intensity foreground emissions from the jet, thanks to a significant enhancement in dynamic range by two orders of magnitude. We demonstrate how such enhanced observations could transform supermassive black holes into powerful probes for detecting annihilating dark matter, which can form a dense profile in the vicinity of supermassive black holes, by examining the morphology of the black hole image.</description>

      <title>Bulk flows, general relativity and the fundamental role of the "peculiar" flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent surveys have been reporting bulk peculiar flows considerably faster than expected. Bulk flows are moving matter and matter in motion implies nonzero energy flux. In relativity, as opposed to Newtonian physics, matter fluxes gravitate as well, since they also contribute to the energy-momentum tensor. The gravitational input of the "peculiar" flux survives at the linear level and it can drastically change our understanding of the way bulk flows have evolved in time. By default, the Newtonian analysis of peculiar motions bypasses the relativistic flux-contribution to the gravitational field. The problem is that there are also studies, with an otherwise relativistic profile, which inadvertently do the same. As result, these treatments reduce to Newtonian and they misleadingly reproduce the slow Newtonian growth-rate of linear peculiar velocities. In contrast, by accounting for the flux effects, the proper relativistic analysis arrives at a considerably stronger growth. We show that it is the flux input of the moving matter to gravity that separates the relativistic studies of peculiar motions from the rest and, in so doing, it could provide an answer to the bulk-flow question.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects on the evaporation of PBHs: contributions to dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the relic abundance of dark matter in the presence of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) beyond the semiclassical approximation. We take into account the quantum corrections due to the memory burden effect, which is assumed to suppress the black hole evaporation rate by the inverse power of its own entropy. Such quantum effect significantly enhances the lifetime, rendering the possibility of PBH mass $\lesssim 10^{9}$ g being the sole dark matter (DM) candidate. However, Nature can not rule out the existence of fundamental particles such as DM. We, therefore, include the possibility of populating the dark sector by the decay of PBHs to those fundamental particles, adding the contribution to stable PBH whose lifetime is extended due to the quantum corrections. Depending on the strength of the burden effect, we show that a wide range of parameter space opens up in the initial PBH mass and fundamental dark matter mass plane that respects the correct relic abundance.</description>

      <title>FRB dark sirens: Measuring the Hubble constant with unlocalized fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be used to measure cosmological parameters by employing the Macquart relation. However, at present, only a small number of FRB events are localized to host galaxies with known redshifts. Inspired by the dark siren method in gravitational wave cosmology, we develop a Bayesian method to statistically measure the Hubble constant using unlocalized FRBs and galaxy catalog data, which makes it possible to constrain cosmological parameters from a large number of FRB data without known redshifts, meanwhile including the real galaxy information. We assume that the probability for a galaxy to host an FRB is proportional to the luminosity of this galaxy and use the results from the IllustrisTNG simulation as the priors of FRB host galaxy parameters. Ignoring some systematic errors, we obtain the first statistical $H_0$ measurement only using twelve unlocalized FRB events combined with the big bang nucleosynthesis result, i.e., $H_0=80.4^{+24.1}_{-19.4}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, ($68\%$ highest-density interval). This method can also be refined to constrain other cosmological and FRB parameters. It is applicable to well-localized FRBs that still have several potential hosts.</description>

      <title>Ricci Reheating Reloaded</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Hubble-induced phase transition is a natural spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism allowing for explosive particle production in non-oscillatory models of inflation involving non-minimally coupled spectator fields. In this work, we perform a comprehensive characterisation of this type of transitions as a tachyonic Ricci-heating mechanism, significantly extending previous results in the literature. By performing $\mathcal{O}(100)$ 3+1-dimensional classical lattice simulations, we explore the parameter space of two exemplary scenarios, numerically determining the main timescales in the process. Based on these results, we formulate a set of parametric equations that offer a practical approach for determining the efficiency of the heating process, the temperature at the onset of radiation domination, and the minimum number of e-folds of inflation needed to resolve the flatness and horizon problems in specific quintessential inflation scenarios. These parametric equations eliminate the need for additional lattice simulations, providing a convenient and efficient method for evaluating these key quantities.</description>

      <title>First constraints on Non-minimally coupled Natural and Coleman-Weinberg inflation in the light of massive neutrino self-interactions and Planck+BICEP/Keck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, for the first time in literature, we compare the predictions of non-minimally coupled Natural and Coleman-Weinberg potentials in the $n_s-r$ plane against the constraints from the latest cosmological data in an extended $\Lambda$CDM model where we include non-standard self-interactions among massive neutrinos, mediated by a heavy scalar or vector boson. For the inflationary potentials, we consider two different formulations in gravity that are non-minimally coupled to the scalar field of the inflaton: \textit{Metric and Palatini.} We only consider the self-interaction to be present among $\tau$-neutrinos and only at moderate strengths. This is because strong interactions among $\tau$-neutrinos, or any strength self-interaction among electron- and muon-neutrinos, as well as any strength flavor-universal interactions, are strongly disfavoured from particle physics experiments.
  In terms of cosmological data, we use the latest public CMB datasets from Planck and BICEP/Keck collaborations, along with other data from CMB lensing, BAO, RSD, and SNe Ia luminosity distance measurements. We find that there are some situations where predictions from the inflationary models are ruled out at more than 2$\sigma$ by the minimal $\Lambda$CDM$+r$ model, but they are allowed in the self-interacting neutrino scenario.</description>

      <title>Hubble tension may indicate time-dependent dark matter comoving energy density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The values of Hubble constant H0 by direct measurements with standard distance ladder are typically larger than those obtained from the observation of cosmic microwave background and the galaxy survey with inverse distance ladder. On the other hand, although the errors are still large, various determinations of the value of matter density parameter Omega_m are consistent with each other. Therefore, it is possible that the difference in Hubble constant is translated to the difference of physical matter energy density omega_m = Omega_m h^2, where h = H0 / (100 Km/s/Mpc). In this article it is examined the possibility of an increase of the physical dark matter energy density (comoving energy density without the effect of expansion of the universe) by a fast transition at a certain value of redshift as a possible resolution of the Hubble tension. A phenomenological fluid model of the dark sector, which is the modification of a so-called unified dark matter model, is introduced to concretely realize such a fast transition in the physical dark matter energy density.</description>

      <title>Dark matter distribution in Milky Way-analog galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: OOur current understanding of how dark matter (DM) is distributed within the Milky Way halo, particularly in the solar neighborhood, is based on either careful studies of the local stellar orbits, model assumptions on the global shape of the MW halo, or from direct acceleration measurements. In this work, we undertake a study of external galaxies, with the intent of providing insight to the DM distribution in MW-analog galaxies. For this, we carefully select a sample of galaxies similar to the MW, based on maximum atomic hydrogen (HI) rotational velocity (v=200-280 km s^{-1}) and morphological type (Sab-Sbc) criteria. With a need for deep, highly-resolved HI, our resulting sample is composed of 5 galaxies from the VIVA and THINGS surveys. To perform our baryonic analysis, we use deep Spitzer mid-IR images at 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}m from the S4G survey. Based on the dynamical three-dimensional modeling software 3D-Barolo, we construct RCs and derive the gas and stellar contributions from the galaxy\'s gaseous- and stellar-disks mass surface density profiles. Through a careful decomposition of their rotation curves into their baryonic (stars, gas) and DM components, we isolate the DM contribution by using an MCMC-based approach. Based on the Sun\'s location and the MW\'s R_{25}, we define the corresponding location of the solar neighborhood in these systems. We put forward a window for the DM density (\rho=0.21-0.46 GeV cm^{-3}) at these galactocentric distances in our MW analog sample, consistent with the values found for the MW\'s local DM density, based on more traditional approaches found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Time-varying double-peaked emission lines following the sudden ignition of the dormant galactic nucleus AT2017bcc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a pan-chromatic study of AT2017bcc, a nuclear transient that was discovered in 2017 within the skymap of a reported burst-like gravitational wave candidate, G274296. It was initially classified as a superluminous supernova, and then reclassified as a candidate tidal disruption event. Its optical light curve has since shown ongoing variability with a structure function consistent with that of an active galactic nucleus, however earlier data shows no variability for at least 10 years prior to the outburst in 2017. The spectrum shows complex profiles in the broad Balmer lines: a central component with a broad blue wing, and a boxy component with time-variable blue and red shoulders. The H$\alpha$ emission profile is well modelled using a circular accretion disc component, and a blue-shifted double Gaussian which may indicate a partially obscured outflow. Weak narrow lines, together with the previously flat light curve, suggest that this object represents a dormant galactic nucleus which has recently been re-activated. Our time-series modelling of the Balmer lines suggests that this is connected to a disturbance in the disc morphology, and we speculate this could involve a sudden violent event such as a tidal disruption event involving the central supermassive black hole, though this cannot be confirmed, and given an estimated black hole mass of $\gtrsim10^7-10^8$ M$_\odot$ instabilities in an existing disc may be more likely. Although we find that the redshifts of AT2017bcc ($z=0.13$) and G274296 ($z&gt;0.42$) are inconsistent, this event adds to the growing diversity of both nuclear transients and multi-messenger contaminants.</description>
