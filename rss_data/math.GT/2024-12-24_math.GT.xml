      <title>Thurston construction mapping classes with minimal dilatation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a pair of filling curves $\alpha, \beta$ on a surface of genus $g$ with $n$ punctures, we explicitly compute the mapping classes realizing the minimal dilatation over all the pseudo-Anosov maps given by the Thurston construction on $\alpha,\beta$. We do so by solving for the minimal spectral radius in a congruence subgroup of $\text{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We apply this result to realized lower bounds on intersection number between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to give the minimal dilatation over any Thurston construction pA map on $\Sigma_{g,n}$ given by a filling pair $\alpha \cup \beta$.</description>

      <title>The geometry of totally geodesic subvarieties of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a semi-simplicity result for the boundary, in the corresponding Deligne-Mumford compactification, of totally geodesic subvarieties of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. Phrased at the level of Teichm\"uller space, this semi-simplicity theorem gives that each component of the boundary is a product of simple factors, each of which behaves metrically like a diagonal embedding. We use this to show that the associated totally geodesic submanifolds of Teichm\"uller space and orbifold fundamental groups are hierarchically hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>The Theory of Doubly Periodic Pseudo Tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doubly periodic tangles (DP tangles) are configurations of curves embedded in the thickened plane, invariant under translations in two transversal directions. In this paper we extend the classical theory of DP tangles by introducing the theory of {\it doubly periodic pseudo tangles} (pseudo DP tangles), which incorporate undetermined crossings called {\it precrossings}, inspired by the theory of pseudo knots. Pseudo DP tangles are defined as liftings of spatial pseudo links in the thickened torus, called {\it pseudo motifs}, and are analyzed through diagrammatic methods that account for both local and global isotopies. We emphasize on {\it pseudo scale equivalence}, a concept defining equivalence between finite covers of pseudo motif diagrams. We investigate the notion of equivalence for these structures, leading to an analogue of the Reidemeister theorem for pseudo DP tangles. Furthermore, we address the complexities introduced by pseudo scale equivalence in defining minimal pseudo motif diagrams. This work contributes to the broader understanding of periodic entangled structures and can find applications in diverse fields such as textiles, materials science and crystallography due to their periodic nature.</description>

      <title>On Lagrangian Tori in $S^2\times S^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [FOOO12], K. Fukaya, Y. Oh, H. Ohta, and K. Ono (FOOO) obtained the monotone symplectic manifold $S^2\times S^2$ by resolving the singularity of a toric degeneration of a Hirzebruch surface. They identified a continuum of toric fibers in the resolved toric degeneration that are not Hamiltonian isotopic to the toric fibers of the standard toric structure on $S^2\times S^2$. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive classification: for any toric fiber in FOOO's construction of $S^2\times S^2$, we determine whether it is Hamiltonian isotopic to a toric fiber of the standard toric structure of $S^2\times S^2$.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Isoresidual curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a partition $\mu$ of $-2$, the stratum $\mathcal{H}(\mu)$ parametrizes meromorphic differential one-forms on $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ with~$n$ zeros and $p$ poles of orders prescribed by $\mu$. The isoresidual fibration is defined by assigning to each differential in $\mathcal{H}(\mu)$ its configuration of residues at the poles. In the case of differentials with $n=2$ zeros, generic isoresidual fibers are complex curves endowed with a canonical translation structure, which we describe extensively in this paper. Quantitative characteristics of the translation structure on isoresidual fiber curves, including the orders of the singularities and a period central charge encapsulating the linear dependence of periods on the underlying configuration of residues, provide rich discrete invariants for these fibers. We also determine the Euler characteristic of generic isoresidual fiber curves from intersection-theoretic computations, relying on the multi-scale compactification of strata of differentials. In particular, we describe a wall and chamber structure for the Euler characteristic of generic isoresidual fiber curves in terms of the partition $\mu$. Additionally, we classify the connected components of generic isoresidual fibers for strata in genus zero with an arbitrary number of zeros.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and geometric properties of homeomorphism groups of ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the homeomorphism groups of ordinals equipped with their order topology, focusing on successor ordinals whose limit capacity is also a successor. This is a rich family of groups that has connections to both permutation groups and homeomorphism groups of manifolds.
  For ordinals of Cantor--Bendixson degree one, we prove that the homeomorphism group is strongly distorted and uniformly perfect, and we classify its normal generators. As a corollary, we recover and provide a new proof of the classical result that the subgroup of finite permutations in the symmetric group on a countably infinite set is the maximal proper normal subgroup.
  For ordinals of higher Cantor--Bendixson degree, we establish a semi-direct product decomposition of the (pure) homeomorphism group. When the limit capacity is one, we further compute the abelianizations and determine normal generating sets of minimal cardinality for these groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1812.03777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a necessary and sufficient criterion for proper actions on $\mathbb{H}^{n,n-1}$ in terms of certain special Anosov representations in $\mathsf{SO}(n,n)$. Moreover, we show that affine Anosov representations of any word hyperbolic group in $\mathsf{SO}(n,n-1)\ltimes\mathbb{R}^{2n-1}$ are infinitesimal versions of such special Anosov representations. Finally, using the above two results we interpret Margulis spacetimes as infinitesimal versions of quotient manifolds of $\mathbb{H}^{n,n-1}$.
  In the appendix, we give a description of the appropriate cross-ratios in our setting and their infinitesimal versions.</description>

      <title>Quantum holonomic link invariants derived from stated skein algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.01732v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define invariants for a framed link equipped with a SL2 local system in its complement and additional combinatorial data based on the theory of representations of stated skein algebras at roots of unity of punctured bigons and the geometric interpretation of their centers. The gauge invariance of the link invariant is derived from De Concini-Kac quantum coadjoint action lifted at the level of stated skein algebras. A key feature is the fact that the Drinfeld double of the quantum Borel algebra admits a natural interpretation as the reduced stated skein algebra of a once-punctured bigon from which we deduce a relation between our link invariants and quantum group constructions of Blanchet-Geer-Patureau Mirand-Reshetikhin. Using Bonahon-Wong quantum trace, we also relate our construction to quantum hyperbolic geometry, hence to Kashaev and Baseilhac-Benedetti constructions. We deduce from this relation explicit formulas for the R-matrices, which permit to compute the link invariants explicitly. In particular, we derive an alternative conceptual proof of the Murakami-Murakami relation between the Kashaev invariant and the colored Jones polynomials.</description>

      <title>Continuous Convexity Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Methods for measuring convexity defects of compacts in R^n abound. However, none of the those measures seems to take into account continuity. Continuity in convexity measure is essential for optimization, stability analysis, global optimality, convergence analysis, and accurate modelling as it ensures robustness and facilitates the development of efficient algorithms for solving convex optimization problems. This paper revisits the axioms underlying convexity measures by enriching them with a continuity hypothesis in Hausdorff's sense. Having provided the concept's theoretical grounds we state a theorem underlining the necessity of restricting ourselves to non-point compacts. We then construct a continuous convexity measure and compare it to existing measures. Importante note : This work is not a research article. It is an undergraduate project undertaken as part of a computer science course at \'Ecole normale sup\'erieure. It should therefore not be considered as a peer reviewed research paper.</description>

Abstract: We show the $n$ colored Jones polynomials of a highly twisted link approach the Kauffman bracket of an $n$ colored skein element. This is in the sense that the corresponding categorifications of the colored Jones polynomials approach the categorification of the Kauffman bracket of the skein element in a direct limit, as the number of full twists of each twist region tends toward infinity, proving a quantum version of Thurston's hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem implicit in Rozansky's work, and giving a categorical version of a result by Champanerkar-Kofman. In view of the volume conjecture, we compute the asymptotic growth rate of the Kauffman bracket of the limiting skein element at a root of unity and relate it to the volumes of regular ideal octahedra that arise naturally from the evaluation of the colored Jones polynomials of the link.</description>

The totally geodesic spanning surfaces of knots embedded in thickened orientable surfaces are also examples of totally geodesic spanning surfaces of virtual knots.</description>

From this representation we define four new polynomial (or ``polynomial'' depending on $A$) invariants. We generalize to the case of biquandles and compute some examples.</description>

Abstract: We consider tight contact structures on plumbed 3-manifolds with no bad vertices. We discuss how one can count the number of tight contact structures with zero Giroux torsion on such 3-manifolds and explore conditions under which Giroux torsion can be added to these tight contact structures without making them overtwisted. We give an explicit algorithm to construct stein diagrams corresponding to tight structures without Giroux torsion. We focus mainly on plumbed 3-manifolds whose vertices have valence at most 3 and then briefly consider the situation for plumbed 3-manifolds with vertices of higher valence.</description>

Abstract: We characterize $3$-dimensional manifolds represented as connected sums of Lens spaces, copies of $S^2 \times S^1$, and torus bundles over the circle by certain Morse-Bott functions. This adds to our previous result around 2024, classifying Morse functions whose preimages containing no singular points are disjoint unions of spheres and tori on $3$-dimensional manifolds represented as connected sums of connected sums of Lens spaces and copies of $S^2 \times S^1$: we have strengthened and explicitized Saeki's result, characterizing the manifolds via such functions, in 2006. We apply similar arguments. However we discuss in a self-contained way essentially.</description>

      <title>Orbits by the up-down action of braid diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The set of all virtual or classical braid diagrams forms a monoid and gives a natural monoid action on a direct product of ${\mathbb Z}$ called the up-down action. In this paper, we determine the orbit of every tuple of ${\mathbb Z}$ under the up-down action of virtual or classical braid diagrams. Moreover, we determine the orbit for irreducible braid diagrams. We also consider the isotropy submonoid and give a condition for a braid diagram to admit an up-down coloring to its closure.</description>

      <title>A new proof of Milnor-Wood inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Milnor-Wood inequality states that if a (topological) oriented circle bundle over an orientable surface of genus $g$ has a smooth transverse foliation, then the Euler class of the bundle satisfies $$|\mathcal{E}|\leq 2g-2.$$ We give a new proof of the inequality based on a (previously proven by the authors) local formula which computes $\mathcal{E}$ from the singularities of a quasisection.</description>

      <title>First Passage Percolation on Hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.03427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study first passage percolation (FPP) on a Gromov-hyperbolic group $G$ with boundary $\partial G$ equipped with the Patterson-Sullivan measure $\nu$. We associate an i.i.d.\ collection of random passage times to each edge of a Cayley graph of $G$, and investigate classical questions about the asymptotics of first passage time as well as the geometry of geodesics in the FPP metric. Under suitable conditions on the passage time distribution, we show that the `velocity' exists in $\nu$-almost every direction $\xi\in \partial G$, and is almost surely constant by ergodicity of the $G-$action on $\partial G$. For every $\xi\in \partial G$, we also show almost sure coalescence of any two geodesic rays directed towards $\xi$. Finally, we show that the variance of the first passage time grows linearly with word distance along word geodesic rays in every fixed boundary direction. This provides an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Benjamini, Tessera, and Zeitouni.</description>

      <title>Solutions of Tetrahedron Equation from Quantum Cluster Algebra Associated with Symmetric Butterfly Quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky (1994) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev (2010) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama (2023) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima (2023) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new geometric characterization for the spine of untwisted outer space of a right-angled Artin group, constructed by Charney, Stambaugh, and Vogtmann. We realize the spine as the natural simplicial complex associated with the category of spatial cube complexes, a new class of locally CAT(0) cube complexes with a simple definition in terms of hyperplane collapses.</description>
