      <title>Large area curved silicon modules for future trackers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many years there has been an aspiration within the community to develop curved silicon detectors for particle physics applications. We present the results from 10 x 10cm low mass support modules as a part of the "ZeroMass" project that aims to minimise the material budget for tracking and vertexing systems for future colliders. We use 50 {\mu}m thick DC coupled strip sensors from Micron Semiconductor Ltd., with a carbon composite support frame. Our current module demonstrators use a radius of curvature of 15cm, typical of that used for the outer parts of large pixel systems, or the inner part of strip trackers and the outer part of large radii vertex detectors. The material budget obtained varies from an $X_0$ of 0.05\% in the active area to 0.62\% in the support structure, with an average of 0.28\%. There is further scope for material budget reduction in applying the concept and methods to large instruments for future detector systems, which we also discuss.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov detector with wavelength-shifting fiber readout for muon tomography applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cherenkov detectors have been extensively developed and utilized in various scientific fields, including particle physics, astrophysics, and nuclear engineering. These detectors operate based on Cherenkov radiation, which is emitted when a charged particle traverses a dielectric medium at a velocity greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium. In this work, we present the development of a Cherenkov radiation detector designed for a muon tomography system with high spatial resolution, employing wavelength-shifting (WLS) fiber readout. The detector consists of two large-area Cherenkov radiators, each measuring 1 m x 1 m, with each read out by WLS fibers arranged orthogonally to determine the x and y coordinates of muon hit positions. The system is modeled using the GEANT4 simulation package, and the achieved position resolution is 1.8 mm+-0.1 (FWHM). This design enables precise tracking of muon trajectories, making it suitable for high-resolution imaging applications in muon tomography.</description>

      <title>New developments in 3D-trench electrode sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future high-luminosity hadron collider experiments feature unprecedented levels of event pile-up and extreme radiation environments, calling for sensors capable of 4D tracking, even after significant radiation damage. To this purpose, 3D sensors represent a viable solution, since they provide excellent radiation tolerance and very good temporal resolution. In particular, owing to the uniform electric field and weighting field distributions, 3D-trench electrode sensors from the INFN TIMESPOT project have shown a temporal resolution of $\sim$10 ps after irradiation fluences up to 1$\times$10$^{17}$ 1-Mev n$_{eq}$/cm$^2$. In spite of the excellent performance of these sensors, 3D-trench pixel technology is not yet fully established and the fabrication yield is not yet adequate for the production of large size pixel sensors. To improve the potential of the 3D-trench concept for large-area sensors, a new batch of sensors was designed at the University of Trento and fabricated at FBK, as part of the AIDA Innova project. Besides introducing some process improvements, this batch includes two different sensor variants: the standard one with continuous ohmic trenches, and a modified one with dashed ohmic trenches. On-wafer electrical test results show that most of the sensors have low leakage current and high breakdown voltage. Moreover, the fabrication yield for the new design variant is higher than that of the standard design.</description>

      <title>Enhancing DUNE Physics Sensitivity with Light and Charge Calorimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of light calorimetry in liquid argon time projection chambers and its intrinsic self compensation properties, emphasizing its advantages alongside conventional charge calorimetry. Previous studies have demonstrated that light calorimetry can achieve energy resolution comparable to advanced charge based techniques, particularly for GeV scale neutrinos. In this work, we explore the complementarity of light calorimetry with charge calorimetry for precision measurements of key physics parameters in the DUNE, including CP violation (CPV) and mass hierarchy determination. While charge calorimetry provides superior resolution in CP phase measurements, light calorimetry independently offers significant insights into CPV and mass hierarchy sensitivities. Furthermore, our exposure versus CPV sensitivity studies indicate that the $5\sigma$ discovery potential is reached faster using light and charge calorimetry than with the traditional TDR based reconstruction methods. These findings highlight the promising role of light calorimetry as a simple yet effective reconstruction method, serving as a complementary approach to enhance the physics capabilities of DUNE.</description>

      <title>Single-photon counting pixel detector for soft X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft X-ray experiments at synchrotron light sources are essential for a wide range of research fields. However, commercially available detectors for this energy range often cannot deliver the necessary combination of quantum efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range, speed, and radiation hardness within a single system. While hybrid detectors have addressed these challenges effectively in the hard X-ray regime, specifically with single photon counting pixel detectors extensively used in high-performance synchrotron applications, similar solutions are desired for energies below 2 keV.
  In this work, we introduce the first single-photon-counting hybrid pixel detector capable of detecting X-ray energies as low as 550 eV, utilizing the internal amplification of Low-Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) sensors. This detector is thoroughly characterized in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Detective Quantum Efficiency. We demonstrate its capabilities through ptychographic imaging at MAX IV 4th generation synchrotron light source at the Fe L$_3$-edge (707 eV), showcasing the enhanced detection performance of the system. This development sets a new benchmark for soft X-ray applications at synchrotrons, paving the way for significant advancements in imaging and analysis at lower photon energies.</description>

      <title>Innovating Bolometers' Mounting: A Gravity-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryogenic calorimeters, also known as bolometers, are among the leading technologies for searching for rare events. The CUPID experiment is exploiting this technology to deploy a tonne-scale detector to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay of $^{100}$Mo. The CUPID collaboration proposed an innovative approach to assembling bolometers in a stacked configuration, held in position solely by gravity. This gravity-based assembly method is unprecedented in the field of bolometers and offers several advantages, including relaxed mechanical tolerances and simplified construction. To assess and optimize its performance, we constructed a medium-scale prototype hosting 28 Li$_2$MoO$_4$ crystals and 30 Ge light detectors, both operated as cryogenic calorimeters at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (Italy). Despite an unexpected excess of noise in the light detectors, the results of this test proved (i) a thermal stability better than $\pm$0.5 mK at 10 mK, (ii) a good energy resolution of Li$_2$MoO$_4$ bolometers, (6.6 $\pm$ 2.2) keV FWHM at 2615 keV, and (iii) a Li$_2$MoO$_4$ light yield measured by the closest light detector of 0.36 keV/MeV, sufficient to guarantee the particle identification requested by CUPID.</description>

      <title>Compact and fully functional high-frequency sine wave gating InGaAs/InP single-photon detector module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-frequency sine wave gating (SWG) InGaAs/InP single-photon detectors (SPDs) are widely used for synchronous near-infrared single-photon detection. For practical use, the size of SPD is one of the most concerning features for system integration. Here we present, to the best of our knowledge, the most compact and fully functional high-frequency SWG InGaAs/InP SPD. We develop a sine wave gating integrated circuit (SWGIC) using system-in-package technology that supports functions including large amplitude sine wave gate generation, coincidence gate generation, phase regulation, amplitude monitoring, and amplitude modulation. Moreover, we design and fabricate a high-performance multi-mode fiber coupled InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) with a compact butterfly package. Furthermore, we implement a monolithically integrated readout circuit (MIRC) to extract the weak avalanche signal from large capacitance response of SWG. Finally, the SWGIC, SPAD, MIRC, and the affiliated circuits are integrated into a single module with a size of 6 cm x 5.7 cm x 1.7 cm. After characterization, the SPD module exhibits a photon detection efficiency of 40%, a dark count rate of 9 kcps, and an afterpulse probability of 4.6% at an operation temperature of 238 K and a hold-off time of 160 ns. Our work provides a practical solution for applications necessitating highly integrated near-infrared single-photon detection.</description>

      <title>On the Influence of Parallax Effects in Thick Silicon Sensors in Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structure determination is a key application of XFELs and 4th generation synchrotron sources, particularly using the coherent and pulsed X-ray radiation from X-ray free-electron lasers (XFEL). Scientific interest focuses on understanding the physical, biological, and chemical properties of samples at the nanometer scale. The X-rays from XFELs enable Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (CXDI), where coherent X-rays irradiate a sample, and a far-field diffraction pattern is captured by an imaging detector. By the nature of the underlying physics, the resolution, at which the sample can be probed with the CXDI technique, is limited by the wavelength of the X-ray radiation and the exposure time if a detector can record the diffraction pattern to very large scattering angles. The resolution that can be achieved under real experimental conditions, depends strongly on additional parameters. The Shannon pixel size, linked to the detector resolution, the coherent dose that can be deposited in the sample without changing its structure, the image contrast, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected scattered radiation at high $q$, i.e. at high scattering angles $2\Theta$, have a strong influence on the resolution. The signal-to-noise ratio at high $q$ defines the "effective" maximum solid angle in a specific experiment setup up to which a detector can efficiently detect a signal and in consequence determines the achievable resolution. The image contrast defines how well bright image features can be distinguished from dark ones. We present the preliminary results of our study on the influence of the PSF on SNR, image contrast, position resolution, and achievable sample resolution for different pixel sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first detailed study of an 8-channel $2\times2$ mm$^{2}$ WSi superconducting microwire single photon detector (SMSPD) array exposed to 120 GeV proton beam and 8 GeV electron and pion beam at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. The SMSPD detection efficiency was measured for the first time for protons, electrons, and pions, enabled by the use of a silicon tracking telescope that provided precise spatial resolution of 30 $\mu$m for 120 GeV protons and 130 $\mu$m for 8 GeV electrons and pions. The result demonstrated consistent detection efficiency across pixels and at different bias currents. Time resolution of 1.15 ns was measured for the first time for SMSPD with proton, electron, and pions, enabled by the use of an MCP-PMT which provided a ps-level reference time stamp. The results presented is the first step towards developing SMSPD array systems optimized for high energy particle detection and identification for future accelerator-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Differential absorption ozone Lidar with 4H-SiC single-photon detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential absorption Lidar (DIAL) in the ultraviolet (UV) region is an effective approach for monitoring tropospheric ozone. 4H-SiC single-photon detectors (SPDs) are emergent devices for UV single-photon detection. Here, we demonstrate a 4H-SiC SPD-based ozone DIAL. We design and fabricate the 4H-SiC single-photon avalanche diode with a beveled mesa structure and optimized layer thickness. An active quenching circuit with a quenching time of 1.03 ns is developed to significantly mitigate the afterpulsing effect while enhancing the maximum count rate. After characterization, the SPD exhibits excellent performance with a photon detection efficiency of 16.6% at 266 nm, a dark count rate of 138 kcps, a maximum count rate of 13 Mcps, and an afterpulse probability of 2.7% at room temperature. Then, we apply two 4H-SiC SPDs in an ozone DIAL. The measured ozone concentrations at altitudes of 1-3.5 km agree well with the results of a commercial ozone DIAL. Our work provides an alternative solution for general UV Lidar applications.</description>

      <title>Realization of discretized response in rare-earth vanadates accessed by AC susceptibility and magnetocaloric methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report presents a new technique to probe the quantitative dynamical response of the magnetic field induced heating/cooling process in rare-earth vanadium materials. The approach combines AC susceptibility and AC caloric measurements to reveal the intrinsic timescale associated with the magnetic relaxation process of rare-earth ions at low temperatures. Utilizing the well-known crystal field effect in YbVO4, we prove and demonstrate a discretized thermal analysis through a common spin-lattice relaxation phenomenon. The demonstration experiment presented in this study provides a general approach to quantitatively address multiple measured quantities in one unified discretized thermal circuit analysis. It can be extended to study other magnetic, dielectric, and elastic materials exhibiting a complex response to an external driving field in the presence of intrinsic interactions and fluctuations, particularly when an energy dissipation process is within an accessible frequency regime.</description>
