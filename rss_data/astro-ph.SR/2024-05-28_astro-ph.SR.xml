      <title>Near subsonic solar wind outflow from an active region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During Parker Solar Probe (Parker) Encounter 15 (E15), we observe an 18-hour period of near subsonic ($\mathrm{M_S \sim}$ 1) and sub-Alfv\'enic (SA), $\mathrm{M_A}$ &lt;&lt;&lt; 1, slow speed solar wind from 22 to 15.6 R$_\odot$. As the most extreme SA interval measured to date and skirting the solar wind sonic point, it is the deepest Parker has probed into the formation and acceleration region of the solar wind in the corona. The stream is also measured by Wind and MMS near 1AU at times consistent with ballistic propagation of this slow stream. We investigate the stream source, properties and potential coronal heating consequences via combining these observations with coronal modeling and turbulence analysis. Through source mapping, in situ evidence and multi-point arrival time considerations of a candidate CME, we determine the stream is a steady (non-transient), long-lived and approximately Parker spiral aligned and arises from overexpanded field lines mapping back to an active region. Turbulence analysis of the Els\"{a}sser variables shows the inertial range scaling of the $\mathrm{\mathbf{z}^{+}}$ mode ($\mathrm{f \sim ^{-3/2}}$) to be dominated by the slab component. We discuss the spectral flattening and difficulties associated with measuring the $\mathrm{\mathbf{z}^{-}}$ spectra, cautioning against making definitive conclusions from the $\mathrm{\mathbf{z}^{-}}$ mode. Despite being more extreme than prior sub-Alfv\'enic intervals, its turbulent nature does not appear to be qualitatively different from previously observed streams. We conclude that this extreme low dynamic pressure solar wind interval (which has the potential for extreme space weather conditions) is a large, steady structure spanning at least to 1AU.</description>

      <title>The K2 Asteroseismic KEYSTONE sample of Dwarf and Subgiant Solar-Like Oscillators. I: Data and Asteroseismic parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KEYSTONE project aims to enhance our understanding of solar-like oscillators by delivering a catalogue of global asteroseismic parameters (${\Delta\nu}$ and ${\nu_{\rm max}}$) for 173 stars, comprising mainly dwarfs and subgiants, observed by the K2 mission in its short-cadence mode during campaigns 6-19. We derive atmospheric parameters and luminosities using spectroscopic data from TRES, astrometric data from $\textit{Gaia}$, and the infrared flux method (IRFM) for a comprehensive stellar characterisation. Asteroseismic parameters are robustly extracted using three independent methods, complemented by an iterative refinement of the spectroscopic analyses using seismic ${\log g}$ values to enhance parameter accuracy. Our analysis identifies new detections of solar-like oscillations in 159 stars, providing an important complement to already published results from previous campaigns. The catalogue provides homogeneously derived atmospheric parameters and luminosities for the majority of the sample. Comparison between spectroscopic ${T_{\rm eff}}$ and those obtained from the IRFM demonstrates excellent agreement. The iterative approach to spectroscopic analysis significantly enhances the accuracy of the stellar properties derived.</description>

      <title>Exploring the physical properties of the $\gamma$ Dor binary star RX Dra with photometry and asteroseismology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the TESS light curve of the binary system RX Dra, and also first calculate a lot of theoretical models to fit the g-mode frequencies previously detected from the TESS series of this system. The mass ratio is determined to be $q$=0.9026$^{+0.0032}_{-0.0032}$. We newly found that there are 16 frequencies (F1-F7, F11-F20) identified as dipole g-modes, two frequencies (F21, F22) identified as quadrupole g-modes, and another two frequencies (F23, F24) identified as g-sextupole modes, based on these model fits. The primary star is newly determined to be a $\gamma$ Dor pulsator in the main-sequence stage with a rotation period of about 5.7$^{+0.7}_{-0.2}$ days, rotating slower than the orbital motion. The fundamental parameters of two components are firstly estimated as follows: $M_1$=1.53$^{+0.00}_{-0.17}$ M $_{\odot}$, $M_2$= 1.38$^{+0.18}_{-0.00}$ M $_{\odot}$, $T_1$=7240$^{+490}_{-44}$ K, $T_2$=6747$^{+201}_{-221}$ K, $R_1$=1.8288$^{+0.0260}_{-0.0959}$ R $_{\odot}$, $R_2$= 1.3075$^{+0.0450}_{-0.2543}$ R $_{\odot}$, $L_1$=8.2830$^{+1.8015}_{-0.6036}$ L $_{\odot}$ and $L_2$= 3.4145$^{+0.1320}_{-0.1843}$ L $_{\odot}$. Our results show that the secondary star is in the solar-like pulsator region of the H-R diagram, indicating that it could be a pulsating star of this type. Finally, the radius of the convective core of the primary star is estimated to be about 0.1403$^{+0.0206}_{-0.0000}$ R$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>3-Minute Oscillations in the Upper Corona: Evidence from Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of Parker Solar Probe (PSP) from around the Alfv\'en surface have shown that the trace magnetic power spectrum density (PSD) is often characterized by a shallow-inertial double power law, where in the low frequency energy injection range, the power spectrum is shallow (flatter than $1/f$), and in the inertial range the spectrum is steep, with a scaling index of [1.5, 1.67]. Consequently, close to the sun, the majority of the fluctuation energy concentrates in a small frequency range around the low frequency power spectral break. In this work, we conduct a systematic survey of PSP observations for the first 17 encounters to statistically study the energy behaviors of the magnetic fluctuations. Our results show that the center frequency of fluctuation energy systematically drifts to around 3-minute for the most pristine solar wind (smallest solar wind advection time). Moreover, the center frequency rapidly drifts to lower frequency as solar wind advection time increases, as expected for active turbulence. The concentration of fluctuation energy around 3-minutes suggests that Alfv\'enic fluctuations in solar wind might mostly be coming from resonant p-mode oscillations in the photosphere, though other potential sources are discussed.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach to Operational Flare Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares are explosions on the Sun. They happen when energy stored in magnetic fields around solar active regions (ARs) is suddenly released. In this paper, we present a transformer-based framework, named SolarFlareNet, for predicting whether an AR would produce a gamma-class flare within the next 24 to 72 hours. We consider three gamma classes, namely the &gt;=M5.0 class, the &gt;=M class and the &gt;=C class, and build three transformers separately, each corresponding to a gamma class. Each transformer is used to make predictions of its corresponding gamma-class flares. The crux of our approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and to use transformers to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. Each data sample consists of magnetic parameters taken from Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) and related data products. We survey flare events that occurred from May 2010 to December 2022 using the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite X-ray flare catalogs provided by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), and build a database of flares with identified ARs in the NCEI flare catalogs. This flare database is used to construct labels of the data samples suitable for machine learning. We further extend the deterministic approach to a calibration-based probabilistic forecasting method. The SolarFlareNet system is fully operational and is capable of making near real-time predictions of solar flares on the Web.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a close-in tertiary orbiting around the Algol-type system HZ Dra with tidal splitting and spots activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reported a cyclic variation of $O-C$ diagram with a semi-amplitude of 0.0033 days and a period of 1.05 years for the pulsating eclipsing binary HZ Dra. The cyclic variation can be explained by the light travel-time effect via the presence of a close-in third body orbiting around HZ Dra in an elliptical orbit with a maximum semi-major axis of 0.92 au. Based on the W-D code, the contribution of the third light to the total system is determined to be 29 $\%$, which is in agreement with the estimated value. Our light curve modelling indicates an evolving hot and cool spot on the surface of the primary and secondary components, respectively. Their positions are roughly symmetrical to the inner Lagrangian point L1, which could be used to explain the variation in the O$^{'}$Connell effect. Our frequency analysis detects 1 radial p-mode, 7 non-radial p-modes and 1 non-radial g-mode. In addition, a total of 6 multiplets are identified, spaced by the orbital frequency, which can be explained as a tidally split mode caused by the equilibrium tides of the close binary system with a circular orbit. These pulsating features suggest that the primary of HZ Dra is a $\delta$ Scuti star, pulsating in both p- and g-mode and influenced by tidal forces.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Unexpected: Disharmonized Harmonic Pulsation Modes in High-Amplitude $\delta$ Scuti Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmonics are a ubiquitous feature across various pulsating stars, traditionally viewed as mere replicas of the independent primary pulsation modes, and have thus been excluded from asteroseismological models. Recent research, however, has uncovered a significant discrepancy: in high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti stars (HADS), harmonics exhibit uncorrelated variations in amplitude and frequency relative to their parent modes. The serendipitous nature of these disharmonized harmonics is a question of critical importance. In our study, we analyzed five triple-mode HADS stars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and discovered some pervasive patterns of disharmonized harmonics in both the fundamental ($f_0$) and first overtone ($f_1$) pulsation modes. Intriguingly, through an in-depth frequency interaction analysis of V1393 Cen, we identified $2f_1$ as an independent pulsation mode, distinct from $f_1$, and pinpointed it as the progenitor of the frequency variations observed in $3f_1$, $4f_1$, $5f_1$, and $6f_1$. Notably, we found an interesting pattern in decomposing of the harmonics, which uncovers the generation process of harmonics for the first time. These findings serve as a new window on the research of harmonics, which remains a hidden corner of contemporary astroseismology.</description>

      <title>He-enriched STAREVOL models for globular cluster multiple populations. Self-consistent isochrones from ZAMS to the TP-AGB phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common property of globular clusters (GC) is to host multiple populations characterized by peculiar chemical abundances. Recent photometric studies suggest that the He content could vary between the populations of a GC by up to $\Delta$He $\sim$ 0.13, in mass fraction. The initial He content impacts the evolution of low-mass stars by ultimately modifying their lifetimes, luminosity, temperatures, and, more generally, the morphology of post-RGB evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We present new physically accurate isochrones with different initial He-enrichments and metallicities, with a focus on the methods implemented to deal with the post-RGB phases. The isochrones are based on tracks computed with the stellar evolution code STAREVOL for different metallicities (Z = 0.0002, 0.0009, 0.002, and 0.008) and with different He-enrichment (from 0.25 to 0.6 in mass fraction). We describe the effect of He-enrichment on the morphology of the isochrones and test these by comparing the predicted number counts of HB and AGB stars with those of selected GCs. Comparing the number ratios, we find that our new theoretical ones agree with the observed values within $1\sigma$ in most cases. The work presented here sets the ground for future studies on stellar populations in globular clusters, in which the abundances of light elements in He-enhanced models will rely on different assumptions for the causes of this enrichment. The developed methodology permits the computation of isochrones from new stellar tracks with non-canonical stellar processes. The checked number counts ensure that, at least in this reference set, the contribution of the luminous late stages of stellar evolution to the integrated light of a GC is represented adequately.</description>

      <title>Parker Solar Probe Observations of Energetic Particles in the Flank of a Coronal Mass Ejection Close to the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an event observed by Parker Solar Probe at $\sim$0.2 au on March 2, 2022 in which imaging and \emph{in situ} measurements coincide. During this event, PSP passed through structures on the flank of a streamer blowout CME including an isolated flux tube in front of the CME, a turbulent sheath, and the CME itself. Imaging observations and \emph{in situ} helicity and principal variance signatures consistently show the presence of flux ropes internal to the CME. In both the sheath, and the CME interval, the distributions are more isotropic, the spectra are softer, and the abundance ratios of Fe/O and He/H are lower than those in the isolated flux tube, and yet elevated relative to typical plasma and SEP abundances. These signatures in the sheath and the CME indicate that both flare populations and those from the plasma are accelerated to form the observed energetic particle enhancements. In contrast, the isolated flux tube shows large streaming, hard spectra and large Fe/O and He/H ratios, indicating flare sources. Energetic particle fluxes are most enhanced within the CME interval from suprathermal through energetic particle energies ($\sim$ keV to $&gt;10$ MeV), indicating particle acceleration, and confinement local to the closed magnetic structure. The flux-rope morphology of the CME helps to enable local modulation and trapping of energetic particles, particularly along helicity channels and other plasma boundaries. Thus, the CME acts to build-up energetic particle populations, allowing them to be fed into subsequent higher energy particle acceleration throughout the inner heliosphere where a compression or shock forms on the CME front.</description>

      <title>A Study on Magnetic-sensitivity Wavelength Position of the Working Line Used by the Full-Disk Magnetograph onboard the Advanced Space based Solar Observatory (ASO-S/FMG)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing data from the $Solar$ $Magnetism$ and $Activity$ $Telescope$ (SMAT), analytical solutions of polarized radiative transfer equations, and in-orbit test data from the Full-disk Magnetograph (FMG) onboard the Advanced Space based Solar Observatory (ASO-S), this study reveals the magnetic-sensitivity spectral positions for the Fe {\sc i} $\lambda$5234.19 A, working line used by FMG. From the experimental data of SMAT, it is found that the most sensitivity position is located at the line center for linear polarization (Stokes-Q/U), while it is about -0.07 A away from the line center for circular polarization (Stokes-V). Moreover, both the theoretical analysis and the in-orbit test data analysis of FMG prove again the above results. Additionally, the theoretical analysis suggests the presence of distinct spectral pockets (centered at 0.08-0.15 A) from the line, harboring intense magnetic sensitivity across all three Stokes parameters. Striking a balance between high sensitivity for both linear and circular polarization while capturing additional valuable information, a spectral position of -0.08 A emerges as the champion for routine FMG magnetic-field observations.</description>

      <title>Radiative transfer modeling of outbursts of massive young stellar objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young stellar objects (YSOs) accrete up to half of their material in short periods of enhanced mass accretion. For massive YSOs (MYSOs with more than 8 solar masses), accretion outbursts are of special importance, as they serve as diagnostics in highly obscured regions. Within this work, two outbursting MYSOs within different evolutionary stages, the young source G358.93-0.03 MM1 (G358) and the more evolved one G323.46-0.08 (G323), are investigated, and the major burst parameters are derived. For both sources, follow-up observations with the airborne SOFIA observatory were performed to detect the FIR afterglows. All together, we took three burst-/post-observations in the far infrared. The burst parameters are needed to understand the accretion physics and to conclude on the possible triggering mechanisms behind it. Up to today, G323s burst is the most energetic one ever observed for a MYSO. G358s burst was about two orders of magnitude weaker and shorter (2 months instead of 8 years). We suggest that G358s burst was caused by the accretion of a spiral fragment (or a small planet), where G323 accreted a heavy object (a planet or even a potential companion). To model those sources, we use radiative transfer (RT) simulations (static and time-dependent). G323s accretion burst is the first astrophysical science case, that is modeled with time-dependent RT (TDRT). We incorporate a small TDRT parameter-study and develop a time-depending fitting tool (the TFitter) for future modeling.</description>

      <title>The Ca II K index-Mg II index relation: A Hilbert-Huang Transform approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar activity, which is driven by a variable magnetic field, exhibits changes along several time scales, the 11-year being the most known. In addition to the SunSpot Number, the Ca II K index and the Mg II index are indices widely employed among those proposed to quantify the solar activity, also because of their ability to trace the solar UV emission. In this work, we compare the Ca II K 0.1nm emission index to the Mg II index over the time interval 1978-2017, which covers almost four solar cycles. We show that they are strongly correlated across each solar cycle (r$\geq$0.94), providing the corresponding linear regression fit parameters. The Hilbert-Huang Transform is then used to decompose such indices into their intrinsic mode of oscillation. By studying how their components are correlated over the different time scales, it is found that the maximum correlation is observed at the 11-year scale, while the correlation is less strong going to smaller time scales.</description>

      <title>Large-amplitude transverse MHD waves prevailing in the H$\alpha$ chromosphere of a solar quiet region revealed by MiHI integrated field spectral observations</title>

Abstract: The investigation of plasma motions in the solar chromosphere is crucial for understanding the transport of mechanical energy from the interior of the Sun to the outer atmosphere and into interplanetary space. We report the finding of large-amplitude oscillatory transverse motions prevailing in the non-spicular Halpha chromosphere of a small quiet region near the solar disk center. The observation was carried out on 2018 August 25 with the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager (MiHI) installed as an extension to the spectrograph at the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST). MiHi produced high-resolution Stokes spectra of the Halpha line over a two-dimensional array of points (sampled every 0.066 arcsec on the image plane) every 1.33 s for about 17 min. We extracted the Dopple-shift-insensitive intensity data of the line core by applying a bisector fit to Stoke I line profiles. From our time-distance analysis of the intensity data, we find a variety of transverse motions with velocity amplitudes of up to 40 km/s in fan fibrils and tiny filaments. In particular, in the fan fibrils, large-amplitude transverse MHD waves were seen to occur with a mean velocity amplitude of 25 km/s and a mean period of 5.8 min, propagating at a speed of 40 km/s. These waves are nonlinear and display group behavior. We estimate the wave energy flux in the upper chromosphere at 3 x 10^6 erg cm^-2 s^-1. Our results contribute to the advancement of our understanding of the properties of transverse MHD waves in the solar chromosphere.</description>

      <title>The mean solar butterfly diagram and poloidal field generation rate at the surface of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difference between individual solar cycles in the magnetic butterfly diagram can mostly be ascribed to the stochasticity of the emergence process. We aim to obtain the expectation value of the butterfly diagram from observations of four cycles. This allows us to further determine the generation rate of the surface radial magnetic field. We use data from Wilcox Solar Observatory to generate time-latitude diagrams spanning cycles 21 to 24 of the surface radial and toroidal magnetic fields, symmetrize them across the equator and cycle-average them. From the mean butterfly diagram and surface toroidal field we then infer the mean poloidal field generation rate at the surface of the Sun. The averaging procedure removes realization noise from individual cycles. The amount of emerging flux required to account for the evolution of the surface radial field is found to match that provided by the observed surface toroidal field and Joy's law. Cycle-averaging butterfly diagrams removes realization noise and artefacts due to imperfect scale separation, and corresponds to an ensemble average that can be interpreted in the mean-field framework. The result can then be directly compared to $\alpha\Omega$-type dynamo models. The Babcock-Leighton $\alpha$-effect is consistent with observations, a result that can be appreciated only if the observational data is averaged in some way.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Observation and Magnetic Modeling of a Solar Minifilament: the Formation, Eruption and Failing Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minifilaments are widespread small-scale structures in the solar atmosphere. To better understand their formation and eruption mechanisms, we investigate the entire life of a sigmoidal minifilament located below a large quiescent filament observed by BBSO/GST on 2015 August 3. The H{\alpha} structure initially appears as a group of arched threads, then transforms into two J-shaped arcades, and finally forms a sigmoidal shape. SDO/AIA observations in 171{\AA} show that two coronal jets occur around the southern footpoint of the minifilament before the minifilament eruption. The minifilament eruption starts from the southern footpoint, then interacts with the overlying filament and fails. The aforementioned observational changes correspond to three episodes of flux cancellations observed by SDO/HMI. Unlike previous studies, the flux cancellation occurs between the polarity where southern footpoint of the minifilament is rooted in and an external polarity. We construct two magnetic field models before the eruption using the flux rope insertion method, and find an hyperbolic flux tube (HFT) above the flux cancellation site. The observation and modeling results suggest that the eruption is triggered by the external magnetic reconnection between the core field of the minifilament and the external fields due to flux cancellations. This study reveals a new triggering mechanism for minifilament eruptions and a new relationship between minifilament eruptions and coronal jets.</description>

      <title>The effect of external magnetic field on electron scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use particle-in-cell, fully electromagnetic, plasma kinetic simulation to study the effect of external magnetic field on electron scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (ESKHI). The results are applicable to collisionless plasmas when e.g. solar wind interacts with planetary magnetospheres or magnetic field is generated in AGN jets. We find that as in the case of magnetohydrodynamic KHI, in the kinetic regime, presence of external magnetic field reduces growth rate of the instability. In MHD case there is known threshold magnetic field for KHI stabilization, while in for ESKHI this is to be analytically determined. Without a kinetic analytical expression, we use several numerical simulation runs to establish an empirical dependence of ESKHI growth rate, $\Gamma(B_0)\omega_{\rm pe}$, on the strength of applied external magnetic field. We find the best fit is hyperbolic, $\Gamma(B_0)\omega_{\rm pe}=\Gamma_0\omega_{\rm pe}/(A+B\bar B_0)$, where $\Gamma_0$ is the ESKHI growth rate without external magnetic field and $\bar B_0=B_0/B_{\rm MHD}$ is the ratio of external and two-fluid MHD stability threshold magnetic field, derived here. An analytical theory to back up this growth rate dependence on external magnetic field is needed. The results suggest that in astrophysical settings where strong magnetic field pre-exists, the generation of an additional magnetic field by the ESKHI is suppressed, which implies that the Nature provides a "safety valve" -- natural protection not to "over-generate" magnetic field by ESKHI mechanism. Remarkably, we find that our two-fluid MHD threshold magnetic field is the same (up to a factor $\sqrt{\gamma_0}$) as the DC saturation magnetic field, previously predicted by fully kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Kinematical and Ellipsoidal Properties of the Inner-Halo Hot Subdwarfs Observed in Gaia DR3 and LAMOST DR7</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we report the kinematical parameters of inner-halo hot subdwarfs located within (d lower than or equal 15 kpc) at high Galactic latitudes (b^o greater than or equal 20). The study included three program stars for one of the extreme He-rich groups (eHe-1) with eccentricity (e=0.65) and the z-component of the angular momentum (J_z=4288.66 kpc km s-1), the inner halo program I with 121 points (T_eff greater than or equal 24,000) and their subsections, i.e. inner halo program II (sdB; 79 points) with (40,000 greater than or equal T_eff greater than or equal 24,000) and inner halo program III (sdO; 42 points) with (80,000 greater than or equal T_eff greater than or equal 40,000). First, we calculated the spatial velocities (U_avg, V_avg, W_avg; km s-1) along the Galactic coordinates and subsequently their subsections sdB and sdO. Second, we calculated the vertex longitudes (l_2) and the Solar motion (S_sun=41.24 +/- 6.42 km s-1) as well as their subsections. Finally, based on the kinematic relation of the ratio (s_2/s_1) and our previously computed numerical value of the angular rotation rate (|A-B|=26.07 +/- 5.10; km s-1 kpc-1), we obtained the average Oort's constant.</description>

      <title>Cross-Matching of OGLE, GAIA, and Hubble Catalogs: Evaluating the Probability of Resolving Lens Stars in Microlensing Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study commenced by cross-matching data from the GAIA and OGLE telescopes with the aim of resolving the source star, long after microlensing is finished. The aim is breaking degeneracy between parameters of the microlensing equation, and ultimately calculating the mass of lens. We have examined different catalogs and found no evidence. Subsequently, employing the Monte Carlo method and guided by sensible assumptions, we embarked a simulation to discern the distribution of angular separation and to probe the feasibility of detecting this phenomenon. The results revealed that a mere 0.029% of gravitational microlensing events exhibited separations exceeding 50 milliarcseconds. Consequently, the likelihood of observing this phenomenon utilizing the OGLE and GAIA telescopes appears exceedingly far available. However, it is worth noting that instruments with very high angular resolution in the range of several tens of milliarcseconds present a viable avenue for such observations. Finally, we proposed 60 microlensing events for which the observation of separation is more probable based on the measured proper velocity.</description>

      <title>Magnetized compressible turbulence with a fluctuation dynamo and Reynolds numbers over a million</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersonic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is a ubiquitous state for many astrophysical plasmas. However, even the basic statistics for this type of turbulence remains uncertain. We present results from supersonic MHD turbulence simulations at unparalleled resolutions, with plasma Reynolds numbers of over a million. In the kinetic energy spectrum we find a break between the scales that are dominated by kinetic energy, with spectral index $-2$, and those that become strongly magnetized, with spectral index $-3/2$. By analyzing the Helmholtz decomposed kinetic energy spectrum, we find that the compressible modes are not passively mixed through the cascade of the incompressible modes. At high magnetic Reynolds number, above $10^5$, we find a power law in the magnetic energy spectrum with spectral index $-9/5$. On the strongly magnetized, subsonic scales the plasma tends to self-organize into locally relaxed regions, where there is strong alignment between the current density, magnetic field, velocity field and vorticity field, depleting both the nonlinearities and magnetic terms in the MHD equations, which we attribute to plasma relaxation on scales where the magnetic fluctuations evolve on shorter timescales than the velocity fluctuations. This process constrains the cascade to inhomogenous, volume-poor, fractal surfaces between relaxed regions, which has significant repercussions for understanding the nature of magnetized turbulence in astrophysical plasmas and the saturation of the fluctuation dynamo.</description>

      <title>CH_3OH and Its Deuterated Species in the Disk/Envelope System of the Low-Mass Protostellar Source B335</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deuterium fractionation in the closest vicinity of a protostar is important in understanding its potential heritage to a planetary system. Here, we have detected the spectral line emission of CH3OH and its three deuterated species, CH2DOH, CHD2OH, and CH3OD, toward the low-mass protostellar source B335 at a resolution of 0.''03 (5 au) with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. They have a ring distribution within the radius of 24 au with the intensity depression at the continuum peak. We derive the column densities and abundance ratios of the above species at 6 positions in the disk/envelope system as well as the continuum peak. The D/H ratio of CH3OH is ~[0.03-0.13], which is derived by correcting the statistical weight of 3 for CH2DOH. The [CHD2OH]/[CH2DOH] ratio is derived to be higher ([0.14-0.29]). On the other hand, the [CH2DOH]/[CH3OD] ratio ([4.9-15]) is higher than the statistical ratio of 3, and is comparable to those reported for other low-mass sources. We study the physical structure on a few au scale in B335 by analyzing the CH3OH (183,15-182,16, A) and HCOOH (120,12-110,11) line emission. Velocity structures of these lines are reasonably explained as the infalling-rotating motion. The protostellar mass and the upper limit to centrifugal barrier are thus derived to be 0.03-0.07 M_{\odot} and &lt;7 au, respectively, showing that B335 harbors a young protostar with a tiny disk structure. Such youth of the protostar may be related to the relatively high [CH2DOH]/[CH3OH] ratio.</description>

      <title>On the origin of infrared bands attributed to tryptophan in Spitzer observations of IC 348</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared emission features toward interstellar gas of the IC 348 star cluster in Perseus have been recently proposed to originate from the amino acid tryptophan. The assignment was based on laboratory infrared spectra of tryptophan pressed into pellets, a method which is known to cause large frequency shifts compared to the gas phase. We assess the validity of the assignment based on the original Spitzer data as well as new data from JWST. In addition, we report new spectra of tryptophan condensed in para-hydrogen matrices to compare with the observed spectra. The JWST MIRI data do not show evidence for tryptophan, despite deeper integration toward IC 348. In addition, we show that several of the lines attributed to tryptophan are likely due to instrumental artifacts. This, combined with the new laboratory data, allows us to conclude that there is no compelling evidence for the tryptophan assignment.</description>

      <title>Gas-phase formation of fullerene/9-hydroxyfluorene cluster cations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In interstellar environment, fullerene species readily react with large molecules (e.g., PAHs and their derivatives) in the gas phase, which may be the formation route of carbon dust grains in space. In this work, the gas-phase ion-molecule collision reaction between fullerene cations (Cn+, n=32, 34, ..., 60) and functionalized PAH molecules (9-hydroxyfluorene, C13H10O) are investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The experimental results show that fullerene/9-hydroxyfluorene cluster cations are efficiently formed, leading to a series of large fullerene/9-hydroxyfluorene cluster cations (e.g., [(C13H10O)C60]+, [(C13H10O)3C58+, and [(C26H18O)(C13H10O)2C48]+). The binding energies and optimized structures of typical fullerene/9-hydroxyfluorene cluster cations were calculated. The bonding ability plays a decisive role in the cluster formation processes. The reaction surfaces, modes and combination reaction sites can result in different binding energies, which represent the relative chemical reactivity. Therefore, the geometry and composition of fullerene/9-hydroxyfluorene cluster cations are complicated. In addition, there is an enhanced chemical reactivity for smaller fullerene cations, which is mainly attributed to the newly formed deformed carbon rings (e.g., 7 C-ring). As part of the coevolution network of interstellar fullerene chemistry, our results suggest that ion-molecule collision reactions contribute to the formation of various fullerene/9-hydroxyfluorene cluster cations in the ISM, providing insights into different chemical reactivity caused by oxygenated functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, OH, or ether, C-O-C) on the cluster formations.</description>

      <title>Gas-phase hydrogenation of large, astronomically relevant PAH cations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To investigate the gas-phase hydrogenation processes of large, astronomically relevant cationic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules under the interstellar environments, the ion-molecule collision reaction between six PAH cations and H-atoms is studied. The experimental results show that the hydrogenated PAH cations are efficiently formed, and no even-odd hydrogenated mass patterns are observed in the hydrogenation processes. The structure of newly formed hydrogenated PAH cations and the bonding energy for the hydrogenation reaction pathways are investigated with quantum theoretical calculations. The exothermic energy for each reaction pathway is relatively high, and the competition between hydrogenation and dehydrogenation is confirmed. From the theoretical calculation, the bonding ability plays an important role in the gas-phase hydrogenation processes. The factors that affect the hydrogenation chemical reactivity are discussed, including the effect of carbon skeleton structure, the side-edged structure, the molecular size, the five- and six-membered C-ring structure, the bay region structure, and the neighboring hydrogenation. The IR spectra of hydrogenated PAH cations are also calculated. These results we obtain once again validate the complexity of hydrogenated PAH molecules, and provide the direction for the simulations and observations under the coevolution interstellar chemistry network. We infer that if we do not consider other chemical evolution processes (e.g., photo-evolution), then the hydrogenation states and forms of PAH compounds are intricate and complex in the interstellar medium (ISM).</description>

      <title>A low-mass sub-Neptune planet transiting the bright active star HD 73344</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Planets with radii of between 2-4 RE closely orbiting solar-type stars are of significant importance for studying the transition from rocky to giant planets.
  Aims. Our goal is to determine the mass of a transiting planet around the very bright F6 star HD 73344 . This star exhibits high activity and has a rotation period that is close to the orbital period of the planet.
  Methods. The transiting planet, initially a K2 candidate, is confirmed through TESS observations . We refined its parameters and rule out a false positive with Spitzer observations. We analyzed high-precision RV data from the SOPHIE and HIRES spectrographs. We conducted separate and joint analyses using the PASTIS software. We used a novel observing strategy, targeting the star at high cadence for two consecutive nights with SOPHIE to understand the short-term stellar variability. We modeled stellar noise with two Gaussian processes.
  Results. High-cadence RV observations provide better constraints on stellar variability and precise orbital parameters for the transiting planet. The derived mean density suggests a sub-Neptune-type composition, but uncertainties in the planet's mass prevent a detailed characterization. In addition, we find a periodic signal in the RV data that we attribute to the signature of a nontransiting exoplanet, without totally excluding the possibility of a nonplanetary origin. Dynamical analyses confirm the stability of the two-planet system and provide constraints on the inclination of the candidate planet; these findings favor a near-coplanar system.
  Conclusions. While the transiting planet orbits the bright star at a short period, stellar activity prevented us from precise mass measurements. Long-term RV tracking of this planet could improve this measurement, as well as our understanding of the activity of the host star.</description>

      <title>The Scaling Law in Stellar Light Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing time series of fluxes from stars, known as stellar light curves, can reveal valuable information about stellar properties. However, most current methods rely on extracting summary statistics, and studies using deep learning have been limited to supervised approaches. In this research, we investigate the scaling law properties that emerge when learning from astronomical time series data using self-supervised techniques. By employing the GPT-2 architecture, we show the learned representation improves as the number of parameters increases from $10^4$ to $10^9$, with no signs of performance plateauing. We demonstrate that a self-supervised Transformer model achieves 3-10 times the sample efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art supervised learning model when inferring the surface gravity of stars as a downstream task. Our research lays the groundwork for analyzing stellar light curves by examining them through large-scale auto-regressive generative models.</description>

      <title>A dynamical model for IRAS 00500+6713: the remnant of a type Iax supernova SN 1181 hosting a double degenerate merger product WD J005311</title>

Abstract: IRAS 00500+6713 is a hypothesized remnant of a type Iax supernova SN 1181. Multi-wavelength observations have revealed its complicated morphology; a dusty infrared ring is sandwiched by the inner and outer X-ray nebulae. We analyze the archival X-ray data taken by XMM-Newton and Chandra to constrain the {angular radius}, mass, and metal abundance of the X-ray nebulae, and construct a theoretical model describing the dynamical evolution of IRAS 00500+6713, including the effects of the interaction between the SN ejecta and the intense wind enriched with carbon burning ashes from the central white dwarf (WD) J005311. We show that the inner X-ray nebula corresponds to the wind termination shock while the outer X-ray nebula to the shocked interface between the SN ejecta and the interstellar matter. The observed X-ray properties can be explained by our model with an {ejecta kinetic} energy of $E_\mathrm{ej} = (0.77 \mbox{--} 1.1)\times 10^{48}$~erg, an ejecta mass of $M_\mathrm{ej} = 0.18\mbox{--}0.53~M_\odot$, if the currently observed wind from WD J005311 started to blow $t_\mathrm{w} \gtrsim 810$ yr after the explosion, i.e., approximately after A.D. 1990. The inferred SN properties are compatible with those of Type Iax SNe and the timing of the wind launch may correspond to the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of the oxygen-neon core of WD J005311 that triggered a surface carbon burning. Our analysis supports that IRAS 00500+6713 is the remnant of SN Iax 1181 produced by a double degenerate merger of oxygen-neon and carbon-oxygen WDs, and WD J005311 is the surviving merger product.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry of the spectral lines of the coronal hole and quiet Sun in the transition region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymmetry of line profiles, i.e., the secondary component, is crucial to understanding the energy release of coronal holes (CH), quiet sun (QS), and bright points (BPs). We investigate the asymmetry of Si IV 1393.75 {\AA} of the transition-region (TR) line recorded by Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS) and co-spatial-temporal Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) for three time series on 26 April 2015, 24 July 2014, 26 July 2014. Most asymmetric profiles are in the complex magnetic field regions of the networks. The asymmetric profiles are fitted with both single and double Gaussian models. The mean value of Doppler velocity of the second component is almost zero (with a significant standard deviation) in QS/CH, which may indicate that the physical process to trigger the secondary Gaussian originates at the formation height of Si IV. While the mean Doppler velocity from secondary Gaussian in BPs is around +4.0 km/s (redshifted). The non-thermal velocities of the secondary Gaussian in all three regions are slightly higher than the single Gaussian. The statistical investigation leads to the prevalence of blueshifted secondary components in QS/CH. However, secondary Gaussian in the BPs redshifted, i.e., the BPs redshift behavior could be interpreted due to the site of reconnection located above the formation height of the Si IV line. The peak intensity of the second component for all three regions is likely to follow a power law that is a signature of the small-scale flaring-like trigger mechanism.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Progenitor Stars of Observed IIP Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) are thought to originate from the explosion of massive stars &gt; 10 Msun. Their luminosity is primarily powered by the explosion energy and the radioactive decay energy of 56Co, with the photosphere location regulated by hydrogen recombination. However, the physical connections between SNe IIP and their progenitor stars remain unclear. This paper presents a comprehensive study of SNe IIP and their progenitor stars by using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code, MESA. Our model grids consider the effects of stellar metallicity, mass, and rotation in the evolution of massive stars, as well as explosion energy and 56Ni production in modeling supernovae. To elucidate the observed SNe IIP and their origins, we compare their light curves (LCs) with our models. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of stellar parameters on LCs by considering stellar mass metallicity, rotation, explosion energy, and 56Ni production. We find that more massive stars exhibit longer plateaus due to increased photon diffusion time caused by massive ejecta. Higher metallicity leads to increased opacity and mass loss of progenitor stars. Rapid rotation affects internal stellar structures, enhancing convective mixing and mass loss, potentially affecting the plateau's brightness and duration. Higher explosion energy results in brighter but shorter plateaus due to faster-moving ejecta. 56Ni mass affects late-time luminosity and plateau duration, with larger masses leading to slower declines.</description>

      <title>KIC 7914906: An Eclipsing Heartbeat Star with Tidally Excited Oscillations and Gamma Doradus/Delta Scuti Hybrid Pulsations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the eclipsing Heartbeat Star KIC 9704906 with tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) and gamma Doradus/delta Scuti hybrid pulsations. The derived parameters show that it has an orbital period of $P$=8.7529108(1) days, a high eccentricity of $e$=0.467(3), and a high inclination of $i$=78$^{\circ}$.81(6). The mass ratio $q$=0.981(5), the relative radii (radius divided by semi-major axis) $r_1$=0.0639(2), and $r_2$=0.0715(4) indicate that the secondary component has a less mass and a larger radius, and may have evolved off the main sequence. The eight derived TEO candidates, $n$ = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 40, and 44 harmonics, are consistent with or close to the dominant spherical harmonic $l=2$, $m=0$, or $\pm2$, assuming that the spin and orbital axes are aligned, and the pulsations are adiabatic and standing waves. We also identify ten independent frequency candidates, but one of them, $\mathit{f_{7}}$, is more like a modulation of a quasi-periodic signal and the orbits. According to the g-mode frequencies, we find that the rotation period of one component is 11.52(29) days. Although the masses and radii cannot be further constrained due to the lack of sufficient high-precision spectra, the fascinating phenomena in the Fourier spectra are evident and valuable in this system.</description>

      <title>Probing the Soft X-ray Properties and Multi-Wavelength Variability of SN2023ixf and its Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of nearly two decades of optical/UV and X-ray data to study the multi-wavelength pre-explosion properties and post-explosion X-ray properties of nearby SN2023ixf located in M101. We find no evidence of precursor activity in the optical to UV down to a luminosity of $\lesssim 7\times10^{4}\, \rm L_{\odot}$, while X-ray observations covering nearly 18 years prior to explosion show no evidence of luminous precursor X-ray emission down to an absorbed 0.3 - 10.0 keV X-ray luminosity of $\sim6\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Extensive Swift observations taken post-explosion did not detect soft X-ray emission from SN2023ixf within the first $\sim$3.3 days after first light, which suggests a mass-loss rate for the progenitor of $\lesssim5\times10^{-4}\,\rm M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ or a radius of $\lesssim4\times10^{15}$ cm for the circumstellar material. Our analysis also suggests that if the progenitor underwent a mass-loss episode, this had to occur $&gt;$ 0.5 - 1.5 years prior to explosion, consistent with previous estimates. Swift detected soft X-rays from SN2023ixf $\sim4.25$ days after first light, and it rose to a peak luminosity of $\sim10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ after 10 days and has maintained this luminosity for nearly 50 days post first light. This peak luminosity is lower than expected, given the evidence that SN2023ixf is interacting with dense material. However, this might be a natural consequence of an asymmetric circumstellar medium. X-ray spectra derived from merging all Swift observations over the first 50 days are best described by a two-component bremsstrahlung model consisting of a heavily absorbed and hotter component similar to that found using NuSTAR, and a less-absorbed, cooler component. We suggest that this soft component arises from cooling of the forward shock similar to that found in Type IIn SN2010jl.</description>

      <title>Electrical conductivity of warm neutron star crust in magnetic fields: Neutron-drip regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the anisotropic electrical conductivity tensor of the inner crust of a compact star at non-zero temperature by extending a previous work on the conductivity of the outer crust. The physical scenarios, where such crust is formed, involve proto-neutron stars born in supernova explosions, binary neutron star mergers and accreting neutron stars. The temperature-density range studied covers the transition from a non-degenerate to a highly degenerate electron gas and assumes that the nuclei form a liquid, i.e., the temperature is above the melting temperature of the lattice of nuclei. The electronic transition probabilities include (a) the dynamical screening of electron-ion interaction in the hard-thermal-loop approximation for the QED plasma, (b) the correlations of the ionic component in a one-component plasma, and (c) finite nuclear size effects. The conductivity tensor is obtained from the Boltzmann kinetic equation in relaxation time approximation accounting for the anisotropies introduced by a magnetic field. The sensitivity of the results towards the matter composition of the inner crust is explored by using several compositions of the inner crust which were obtained using different nuclear interactions and methods of solving the many-body problem. The standard deviation of relaxation time and components of the conductivity tensor from the average are below $\le 10\%$ except close to crust-core transition, where non-spherical nuclear structures are expected. Our results can be used in dissipative magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of warm compact stars.</description>

      <title>The Population of Massive Stars in Active Galactic Nuclei Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational instability in the outskirts of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks lead to disk fragmentation and formation of super-massive (several 10^2Msun) stars with potentially long lifetimes. Alternatively, stars can be captured ex-situ and grow from gas accretion in the AGN disk. However, the number density distribution throughout the disk is limited by thermal feedback as their luminosities provide the dominant heating source. We derive equilibrium stellar surface density profiles under two limiting contexts: in the case where the stellar lifetimes are prolonged due to recycling of hydrogen rich disk gas, only the fraction of gas converted into heat is removed from the disk accretion flow. Alternatively, if stellar composition recycling is inefficient and stars can evolve off the main sequence, the disk accretion rate is quenched towards smaller radii resembling a classical star-burst disk, albeit the effective removal rate depends not only on the stellar lifetime, but also the mass of stellar remnants. For AGNs with central Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) masses of \sim 10^6 to 10^8Msun accreting at \sim 0.1 Eddington efficiency, we estimate a total number of 10^3 to 10^5 coexisting massive stars and the rate of stellar mergers to be 10^-3 to 1 per year. We motivate the detailed study of interaction between a swarm of massive stars through hydro and N body simulations to provide better prescriptions of dynamical processes in AGN disks, and to constrain more accurate estimates of the stellar population.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the barometric equation and the extent of a planetary atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The barometric equation predicts the molecular concentration $n(z)$ exponentially decaying with altitude $z$. Because the mean free path $l=1/n\sigma$ increases exponentially, at high altitudes $z$, the equation is no longer within the domain of applicability of the standard kinetic theory. \cite{grimsditch} Here, we predict the dependence $n(z)\propto z^{-2}$ for the case $l\gg L$ in uniform gravity and $n(z)\propto [\ln(1+z/R_0)]^{-2}$ when $z\gg R_0$ for a planet of radius $R_0$. It corresponds to a non-stationary planetary atmosphere with hydrogen accretion. The accretion is accompanied by a release of gravitational potential energy that could be the elusive source driving the formation of stellar coronas. Other consequences include slowly decaying tails of planetary atmospheres and periodical hydrogen explosions of white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Timing Noise from Brownian Motion of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05410v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) reported a signal at nanohertz frequencies consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background. Here, I show that the Brownian motion of the Sun as a result of its random gravitational interactions with the cluster of thousands of unmodeled Main-belt asteroids of diameters &lt;80km, combined with small inaccuracies in the estimated masses of larger asteroids, introduces timing noise for pulsars equivalent to a strain amplitude of ~10^{-15}, which cannot be neglected relative to the reported signal. The asteroid contribution needs to be modeled better in order to obtain accurate inferences from the PTA signal.</description>
