      <title>Deep Reputation Scoring in DeFi: zScore-Based Wallet Ranking from Liquidity and Trading Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As decentralized finance (DeFi) evolves, distinguishing between user behaviors - liquidity provision versus active trading - has become vital for risk modeling and on-chain reputation. We propose a behavioral scoring framework for Uniswap that assigns two complementary scores: a Liquidity Provision Score that assesses strategic liquidity contributions, and a Swap Behavior Score that reflects trading intent, volatility exposure, and discipline. The scores are constructed using rule-based blueprints that decompose behavior into volume, frequency, holding time, and withdrawal patterns. To handle edge cases and learn feature interactions, we introduce a deep residual neural network with densely connected skip blocks inspired by the U-Net architecture. We also incorporate pool-level context such as total value locked (TVL), fee tiers, and pool size, allowing the system to differentiate similar user behaviors across pools with varying characteristics. Our framework enables context-aware and scalable DeFi user scoring, supporting improved risk assessment and incentive design. Experiments on Uniswap v3 data show its usefulness for user segmentation and protocol-aligned reputation systems. Although we refer to our metric as zScore, it is independently developed and methodologically different from the cross-protocol system proposed by Udupi et al. Our focus is on role-specific behavioral modeling within Uniswap using blueprint logic and supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Finance (Literacy) today and in 2034: Initial Insights from Singapore and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14173v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How will Decentralized Finance transform financial services? Using New Institutional Economics and Dynamic Capabilities Theory, I analyse survey data from 109 experts using non-parametric methods. Experts span traditional finance, DeFi industry, and academia. Four insights emerge: adoption expectations rise from negligible to 43% expecting at least high adoption by 2034; experts expect convergence scenarios over disruption, with traditional finance embracing DeFi most likely; back-office transforms before customer-facing functions; strategic competencies eclipse DeFi-sector specific- and technical skills. This challenges technology-centric adoption models. DeFi represents emerging market entry requiring organizational transformation, not just technological implementation. SEC developments validate predictions. Financial institutions should prioritize developing strategic capabilities over mere technical training.</description>
