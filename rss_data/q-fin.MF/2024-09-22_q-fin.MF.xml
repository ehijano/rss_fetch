      <title>Heat modulated affine stochastic volatility models for forward curve dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a function-valued stochastic volatility model designed to capture the continuous-time evolution of forward curves in fixed-income or commodity markets. The dynamics of the (logarithmic) forward curves are defined by a Heath-Jarrow-Morton-Musiela stochastic partial differential equation modulated by an instantaneous volatility process that describes the second-order moment structure of forwards with different time-to-maturity. We propose to model the operator-valued instantaneous covariance by an affine process on the cone of positive trace-class operators with drift given by the Lyapunov operator of the Laplacian. The so defined infinite-rank stochastic volatility model is analytically tractable due to its affine structure and allows to model maturity specific risk and volatility clustering in forward markets. Furthermore, we introduce a numerically feasible spectral Galerkin approximation of the associated operator-valued generalized Riccati equations and study the robustness of the model with respect to finite-rank approximations by providing explicit error bounds on the approximation error.</description>

      <title>A Two-layer Stochastic Game Approach to Reinsurance Contracting and Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a two-layer stochastic game model to study reinsurance contracting and competition in a market with one insurer and two competing reinsurers. The insurer negotiates with both reinsurers simultaneously for proportional reinsurance contracts that are priced using the variance premium principle. The reinsurance contracting between the insurer and each reinsurer is modeled as a Stackelberg game. The two reinsurers compete for business from the insurer and optimize the so-called relative performance, instead of their own surplus, and their competition is settled by a noncooperative Nash game. We obtain a sufficient and necessary condition, related to the competition degrees of the two reinsurers, for the existence of an equilibrium. We show that the equilibrium, if exists, is unique, and the equilibrium strategy of each player is constant, fully characterized in semiclosed form. Furthermore, we obtain interesting sensitivity results for the equilibrium strategies through both analytical and numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Optimal reinsurance in a dynamic contagion model: comparing self-exciting and externally-exciting risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the optimal reinsurance problem in a risk model with jump clustering features. This modeling framework is inspired by the concept initially proposed in Dassios and Zhao (2011), combining Hawkes and Cox processes with shot noise intensity models. Specifically, these processes describe self-exciting and externally excited jumps in the claim arrival intensity, respectively. The insurer aims to maximize the expected exponential utility of terminal wealth for general reinsurance contracts and reinsurance premiums. We discuss two different methodologies: the classical stochastic control approach based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation and a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) approach. In a Markovian setting, differently from the classical HJB-approach, the BSDE method enables us to solve the problem without imposing any requirements for regularity on the associated value function. We provide a Verification Theorem in terms of a suitable BSDE driven by a two-dimensional marked point process and we prove an existence result relaying on the theory developed in Papapantoleon et al. (2018) for stochastic Lipschitz generators. After discussing the optimal strategy for general reinsurance contracts and reinsurance premiums, we provide more explicit results in some relevant cases. Finally, we provide comparison results that highlight the heightened risk stemming from the self-exciting component in contrast to the externally-excited counterpart and discuss the the monotonicity property of the value function.</description>
