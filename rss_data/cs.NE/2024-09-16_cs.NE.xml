      <title>Reconsidering the energy efficiency of spiking neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are generally regarded as more energy-efficient because they do not use multiplications. However, most SNN works only consider the counting of additions to evaluate energy consumption, neglecting other overheads such as memory accesses and data movement operations. This oversight can lead to a misleading perception of efficiency, especially when state-of-the-art SNN accelerators operate with very small time window sizes. In this paper, we present a detailed comparison of the energy consumption of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and SNNs from a hardware perspective. We provide accurate formulas for energy consumption based on classical multi-level memory hierarchy architectures, commonly used neuromorphic dataflow architectures, and our proposed improved spatial-dataflow architecture. Our research demonstrates that to achieve comparable accuracy and greater energy efficiency than ANNs, SNNs require strict limitations on both time window size T and sparsity s. For instance, with the VGG16 model and a fixed T of 6, the neuron sparsity rate must exceed 93% to ensure energy efficiency across most architectures. Inspired by our findings, we explore strategies to enhance energy efficiency by increasing sparsity. We introduce two regularization terms during training that constrain weights and activations, effectively boosting the sparsity rate. Our experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, using T of 6, show that our SNNs consume 69% of the energy used by optimized ANNs on spatial-dataflow architectures, while maintaining an SNN accuracy of 94.18%. This framework, developed using PyTorch, is publicly available for use and further research.</description>

      <title>Cross-Country Comparative Analysis of Climate Resilience and Localized Mapping in Data-Sparse Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate resilience across sectors varies significantly in low-income countries (LICs), with agriculture being the most vulnerable to climate change. Existing studies typically focus on individual countries, offering limited insights into broader cross-country patterns of adaptation and vulnerability. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing a framework for cross-country comparative analysis of sectoral climate resilience using meta-analysis and cross-country panel data techniques. The study identifies shared vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies across LICs, enabling more effective policy design. Additionally, a novel localized climate-agriculture mapping technique is developed, integrating sparse agricultural data with high-resolution satellite imagery to generate fine-grained maps of agricultural productivity under climate stress. Spatial interpolation methods, such as kriging, are used to address data gaps, providing detailed insights into regional agricultural productivity and resilience. The findings offer policymakers tools to prioritize climate adaptation efforts and optimize resource allocation both regionally and nationally.</description>

      <title>Biomimetic Frontend for Differentiable Audio Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While models in audio and speech processing are becoming deeper and more end-to-end, they as a consequence need expensive training on large data, and are often brittle. We build on a classical model of human hearing and make it differentiable, so that we can combine traditional explainable biomimetic signal processing approaches with deep-learning frameworks. This allows us to arrive at an expressive and explainable model that is easily trained on modest amounts of data. We apply this model to audio processing tasks, including classification and enhancement. Results show that our differentiable model surpasses black-box approaches in terms of computational efficiency and robustness, even with little training data. We also discuss other potential applications.</description>

      <title>Emergent mechanisms for long timescales depend on training curriculum and affect performance in memory tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in the brain and in silico excel at solving tasks with intricate temporal dependencies. Long timescales required for solving such tasks can arise from properties of individual neurons (single-neuron timescale, $\tau$, e.g., membrane time constant in biological neurons) or recurrent interactions among them (network-mediated timescale). However, the contribution of each mechanism for optimally solving memory-dependent tasks remains poorly understood. Here, we train RNNs to solve $N$-parity and $N$-delayed match-to-sample tasks with increasing memory requirements controlled by $N$ by simultaneously optimizing recurrent weights and $\tau$s. We find that for both tasks RNNs develop longer timescales with increasing $N$, but depending on the learning objective, they use different mechanisms. Two distinct curricula define learning objectives: sequential learning of a single-$N$ (single-head) or simultaneous learning of multiple $N$s (multi-head). Single-head networks increase their $\tau$ with $N$ and are able to solve tasks for large $N$, but they suffer from catastrophic forgetting. However, multi-head networks, which are explicitly required to hold multiple concurrent memories, keep $\tau$ constant and develop longer timescales through recurrent connectivity. Moreover, we show that the multi-head curriculum increases training speed and network stability to ablations and perturbations, and allows RNNs to generalize better to tasks beyond their training regime. This curriculum also significantly improves training GRUs and LSTMs for large-$N$ tasks. Our results suggest that adapting timescales to task requirements via recurrent interactions allows learning more complex objectives and improves the RNN's performance.</description>

      <title>A Methodology to Study the Impact of Spiking Neural Network Parameters considering Event-Based Automotive Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems are considered as the future of human mobility and transportation. Solving computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection/segmentation, with high accuracy and low power/energy consumption, is highly needed to realize AD systems in real life. These requirements can potentially be satisfied by Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). However, the state-of-the-art works in SNN-based AD systems still focus on proposing network models that can achieve high accuracy, and they have not systematically studied the roles of SNN parameters when used for learning event-based automotive data. Therefore, we still lack understanding of how to effectively develop SNN models for AD systems. Toward this, we propose a novel methodology to systematically study and analyze the impact of SNN parameters considering event-based automotive data, then leverage this analysis for enhancing SNN developments. To do this, we first explore different settings of SNN parameters that directly affect the learning mechanism (i.e., batch size, learning rate, neuron threshold potential, and weight decay), then analyze the accuracy results. Afterward, we propose techniques that jointly improve SNN accuracy and reduce training time. Experimental results show that our methodology can improve the SNN models for AD systems than the state-of-the-art, as it achieves higher accuracy (i.e., 86%) for the NCARS dataset, and it can also achieve iso-accuracy (i.e., ~85% with standard deviation less than 0.5%) while speeding up the training time by 1.9x. In this manner, our research work provides a set of guidelines for SNN parameter enhancements, thereby enabling the practical developments of SNN-based AD systems.</description>

      <title>Dendrites endow artificial neural networks with accurate, robust and parameter-efficient learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are at the core of most Deep learning (DL) algorithms that successfully tackle complex problems like image recognition, autonomous driving, and natural language processing. However, unlike biological brains who tackle similar problems in a very efficient manner, DL algorithms require a large number of trainable parameters, making them energy-intensive and prone to overfitting. Here, we show that a new ANN architecture that incorporates the structured connectivity and restricted sampling properties of biological dendrites counteracts these limitations. We find that dendritic ANNs are more robust to overfitting and outperform traditional ANNs on several image classification tasks while using significantly fewer trainable parameters. These advantages are likely the result of a different learning strategy, whereby most of the nodes in dendritic ANNs respond to multiple classes, unlike classical ANNs that strive for class-specificity. Our findings suggest that the incorporation of dendritic properties can make learning in ANNs more precise, resilient, and parameter-efficient and shed new light on how biological features can impact the learning strategies of ANNs.</description>

      <title>FastSpiker: Enabling Fast Training for Spiking Neural Networks on Event-based Data through Learning Rate Enhancements for Autonomous Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous embedded systems (e.g., robots) typically necessitate intelligent computation with low power/energy processing for completing their tasks. Such requirements can be fulfilled by embodied neuromorphic intelligence with spiking neural networks (SNNs) because of their high learning quality (e.g., accuracy) and sparse computation. Here, the employment of event-based data is preferred to ensure seamless connectivity between input and processing parts. However, state-of-the-art SNNs still face a long training time to achieve high accuracy, thereby incurring high energy consumption and producing a high rate of carbon emission. Toward this, we propose FastSpiker, a novel methodology that enables fast SNN training on event-based data through learning rate enhancements targeting autonomous embedded systems. In FastSpiker, we first investigate the impact of different learning rate policies and their values, then select the ones that quickly offer high accuracy. Afterward, we explore different settings for the selected learning rate policies to find the appropriate policies through a statistical-based decision. Experimental results show that our FastSpiker offers up to 10.5x faster training time and up to 88.39% lower carbon emission to achieve higher or comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art on the event-based automotive dataset (i.e., NCARS). In this manner, our FastSpiker methodology paves the way for green and sustainable computing in realizing embodied neuromorphic intelligence for autonomous embedded systems.</description>

      <title>Fa\c{c}AID: A Transformer Model for Neuro-Symbolic Facade Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a neuro-symbolic transformer-based model that converts flat, segmented facade structures into procedural definitions using a custom-designed split grammar. To facilitate this, we first develop a semi-complex split grammar tailored for architectural facades and then generate a dataset comprising of facades alongside their corresponding procedural representations. This dataset is used to train our transformer model to convert segmented, flat facades into the procedural language of our grammar. During inference, the model applies this learned transformation to new facade segmentations, providing a procedural representation that users can adjust to generate varied facade designs. This method not only automates the conversion of static facade images into dynamic, editable procedural formats but also enhances the design flexibility, allowing for easy modifications.</description>
