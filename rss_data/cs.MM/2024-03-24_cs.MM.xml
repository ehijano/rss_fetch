      <title>Not All Attention is Needed: Parameter and Computation Efficient Transfer Learning for Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter and computation efficient tuning method for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), termed Efficient Attention Skipping (EAS). Concretely, we first reveal that multi-head attentions (MHAs), the main computational overhead of MLLMs, are often redundant to downstream tasks. Based on this observation, EAS evaluates the attention redundancy and skips the less important MHAs to speed up inference. Besides, we also propose a novel propagation-of-information adapter (PIA) to serve the attention skipping of EAS and keep parameter efficiency, which can be further re-parameterized into feed-forward networks (FFNs) for zero-extra latency. To validate EAS, we apply it to a recently proposed MLLM called LaVIN and a classic VL pre-trained model called METER, and conduct extensive experiments on a set of benchmarks. The experiments show that EAS not only retains high performance and parameter efficiency, but also greatly speeds up inference speed. For instance, LaVIN-EAS can obtain 89.98\% accuracy on ScineceQA while speeding up inference by 2.2 times to LaVIN</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaverse aims to construct a large, unified, immersive, and shared digital realm by combining various technologies, namely XR (extended reality), blockchain, and digital twin, among others. This article explores the Metaverse from the perspective of multimedia communication by conducting and analyzing real-world experiments on four different Metaverse platforms: VR (virtual reality) Vircadia, VR Mozilla Hubs, VRChat, and MR (mixed reality) Virtual City. We first investigate the traffic patterns and network performance in the three VR platforms. After raising the challenges of the Metaverse streaming and investigating the potential methods to enhance Metaverse performance, we propose a remote rendering architecture and verify its advantages through a prototype involving the campus network and MR multimodal interaction by comparison with local rendering.</description>

      <title>MemeCraft: Contextual and Stance-Driven Multimodal Meme Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online memes have emerged as powerful digital cultural artifacts in the age of social media, offering not only humor but also platforms for political discourse, social critique, and information dissemination. Their extensive reach and influence in shaping online communities' sentiments make them invaluable tools for campaigning and promoting ideologies. Despite the development of several meme-generation tools, there remains a gap in their systematic evaluation and their ability to effectively communicate ideologies. Addressing this, we introduce MemeCraft, an innovative meme generator that leverages large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) to produce memes advocating specific social movements. MemeCraft presents an end-to-end pipeline, transforming user prompts into compelling multimodal memes without manual intervention. Conscious of the misuse potential in creating divisive content, an intrinsic safety mechanism is embedded to curb hateful meme production.</description>

      <title>StreamingT2V: Consistent, Dynamic, and Extendable Long Video Generation from Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models enable the generation of high-quality videos that follow text instructions, making it easy to create diverse and individual content. However, existing approaches mostly focus on high-quality short video generation (typically 16 or 24 frames), ending up with hard-cuts when naively extended to the case of long video synthesis. To overcome these limitations, we introduce StreamingT2V, an autoregressive approach for long video generation of 80, 240, 600, 1200 or more frames with smooth transitions. The key components are:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM), which conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the previous chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk transitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation module, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first video chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a randomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer autoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between chunks. Experiments show that StreamingT2V generates high motion amount. In contrast, all competing image-to-video methods are prone to video stagnation when applied naively in an autoregressive manner. Thus, we propose with StreamingT2V a high-quality seamless text-to-long video generator that outperforms competitors with consistency and motion.

      <title>A Picture Is Worth a Graph: Blueprint Debate on Graph for Multimodal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a pilot study aimed at introducing multi-agent debate into multimodal reasoning. The study addresses two key challenges: the trivialization of opinions resulting from excessive summarization and the diversion of focus caused by distractor concepts introduced from images. These challenges stem from the inductive (bottom-up) nature of existing debating schemes. To address the issue, we propose a deductive (top-down) debating approach called Blueprint Debate on Graphs (BDoG). In BDoG, debates are confined to a blueprint graph to prevent opinion trivialization through world-level summarization. Moreover, by storing evidence in branches within the graph, BDoG mitigates distractions caused by frequent but irrelevant concepts. Extensive experiments validate BDoG, achieving state-of-the-art results in Science QA and MMBench with significant improvements over previous methods.</description>

      <title>Cartoon Hallucinations Detection: Pose-aware In Context Visual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale Text-to-Image (TTI) models have become a common approach for generating training data in various generative fields. However, visual hallucinations, which contain perceptually critical defects, remain a concern, especially in non-photorealistic styles like cartoon characters. We propose a novel visual hallucination detection system for cartoon character images generated by TTI models. Our approach leverages pose-aware in-context visual learning (PA-ICVL) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs), utilizing both RGB images and pose information. By incorporating pose guidance from a fine-tuned pose estimator, we enable VLMs to make more accurate decisions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in identifying visual hallucinations compared to baseline methods relying solely on RGB images. This research advances TTI models by mitigating visual hallucinations, expanding their potential in non-photorealistic domains.</description>

      <title>Dialogue Understandability: Why are we streaming movies with subtitles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Watching movies and TV shows with subtitles enabled is not simply down to audibility or speech intelligibility. A variety of evolving factors related to technological advances, cinema production and social behaviour challenge our perception and understanding. This study seeks to formalise and give context to these influential factors under a wider and novel term referred to as Dialogue Understandability. We propose a working definition for Dialogue Understandability being a listener's capacity to follow the story without undue cognitive effort or concentration being required that impacts their Quality of Experience (QoE). The paper identifies, describes and categorises the factors that influence Dialogue Understandability mapping them over the QoE framework, a media streaming lifecycle, and the stakeholders involved. We then explore available measurement tools in the literature and link them to the factors they could potentially be used for. The maturity and suitability of these tools is evaluated over a set of pilot experiments. Finally, we reflect on the gaps that still need to be filled, what we can measure and what not, future subjective experiments, and new research trends that could help us to fully characterise Dialogue Understandability.</description>

      <title>Virbo: Multimodal Multilingual Avatar Video Generation in Digital Marketing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the widespread popularity of internet celebrity marketing all over the world, short video production has gradually become a popular way of presenting products information. However, the traditional video production industry usually includes series of procedures as script writing, video filming in a professional studio, video clipping, special effects rendering, customized post-processing, and so forth. Not to mention that multilingual videos is not accessible for those who could not speak multilingual languages. These complicated procedures usually needs a professional team to complete, and this made short video production costly in both time and money. This paper presents an intelligent system that supports the automatic generation of talking avatar videos, namely Virbo. With simply a user-specified script, Virbo could use a deep generative model to generate a target talking videos. Meanwhile, the system also supports multimodal inputs to customize the video with specified face, specified voice and special effects. This system also integrated a multilingual customization module that supports generate multilingual talking avatar videos in a batch with hundreds of delicate templates and creative special effects. Through a series of user studies and demo tests, we found that Virbo can generate talking avatar videos that maintained a high quality of videos as those from a professional team while reducing the entire production costs significantly. This intelligent system will effectively promote the video production industry and facilitate the internet marketing neglecting of language barriers and cost challenges.</description>

      <title>FunQA: Towards Surprising Video Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surprising videos, such as funny clips, creative performances, or visual illusions, attract significant attention. Enjoyment of these videos is not simply a response to visual stimuli; rather, it hinges on the human capacity to understand (and appreciate) commonsense violations depicted in these videos. We introduce FunQA, a challenging video question-answering (QA) dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance the depth of video reasoning based on counter-intuitive and fun videos. Unlike most video QA benchmarks which focus on less surprising contexts, e.g., cooking or instructional videos, FunQA covers three previously unexplored types of surprising videos: 1) HumorQA, 2) CreativeQA, and 3) MagicQA. For each subset, we establish rigorous QA tasks designed to assess the model's capability in counter-intuitive timestamp localization, detailed video description, and reasoning around counter-intuitiveness. We also pose higher-level tasks, such as attributing a fitting and vivid title to the video and scoring the video creativity. In total, the FunQA benchmark consists of 312K free-text QA pairs derived from 4.3K video clips, spanning a total of 24 video hours. Moreover, we propose FunMentor, an agent designed for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that uses multi-turn dialogues to enhance models' understanding of counter-intuitiveness. Extensive experiments with existing VLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of FunMentor and reveal significant performance gaps for the FunQA videos across spatial-temporal reasoning, visual-centered reasoning, and free-text generation.</description>

      <title>MSAC: Multiple Speech Attribute Control Method for Reliable Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite notable progress, speech emotion recognition (SER) remains challenging due to the intricate and ambiguous nature of speech emotion, particularly in wild world. While current studies primarily focus on recognition and generalization abilities, our research pioneers an investigation into the reliability of SER methods in the presence of semantic data shifts and explores how to exert fine-grained control over various attributes inherent in speech signals to enhance speech emotion modeling. In this paper, we first introduce MSAC-SERNet, a novel unified SER framework capable of simultaneously handling both single-corpus and cross-corpus SER. Specifically, concentrating exclusively on the speech emotion attribute, a novel CNN-based SER model is presented to extract discriminative emotional representations, guided by additive margin softmax loss. Considering information overlap between various speech attributes, we propose a novel learning paradigm based on correlations of different speech attributes, termed Multiple Speech Attribute Control (MSAC), which empowers the proposed SER model to simultaneously capture fine-grained emotion-related features while mitigating the negative impact of emotion-agnostic representations. Furthermore, we make a first attempt to examine the reliability of the MSAC-SERNet framework using out-of-distribution detection methods. Experiments on both single-corpus and cross-corpus SER scenarios indicate that MSAC-SERNet not only consistently outperforms the baseline in all aspects, but achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art SER approaches.</description>

      <title>ToonAging: Face Re-Aging upon Artistic Portrait Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Face re-aging is a prominent field in computer vision and graphics, with significant applications in photorealistic domains such as movies, advertising, and live streaming. Recently, the need to apply face re-aging to non-photorealistic images, like comics, illustrations, and animations, has emerged as an extension in various entertainment sectors. However, the lack of a network that can seamlessly edit the apparent age in NPR images has limited these tasks to a naive, sequential approach. This often results in unpleasant artifacts and a loss of facial attributes due to domain discrepancies. In this paper, we introduce a novel one-stage method for face re-aging combined with portrait style transfer, executed in a single generative step. We leverage existing face re-aging and style transfer networks, both trained within the same PR domain. Our method uniquely fuses distinct latent vectors, each responsible for managing aging-related attributes and NPR appearance. By adopting an exemplar-based approach, our method offers greater flexibility compared to domain-level fine-tuning approaches, which typically require separate training or fine-tuning for each domain. This effectively addresses the limitation of requiring paired datasets for re-aging and domain-level, data-driven approaches for stylization. Our experiments show that our model can effortlessly generate re-aged images while simultaneously transferring the style of examples, maintaining both natural appearance and controllability.</description>

      <title>AnyV2V: A Plug-and-Play Framework For Any Video-to-Video Editing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video-to-video editing involves editing a source video along with additional control (such as text prompts, subjects, or styles) to generate a new video that aligns with the source video and the provided control. Traditional methods have been constrained to certain editing types, limiting their ability to meet the wide range of user demands. In this paper, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel training-free framework designed to simplify video editing into two primary steps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model (e.g. InstructPix2Pix, InstantID, etc) to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an existing image-to-video generation model (e.g. I2VGen-XL) for DDIM inversion and feature injection. In the first stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing image editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks. Beyond the traditional prompt-based editing methods, AnyV2V also can support novel video editing tasks, including reference-based style transfer, subject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by previous methods. In the second stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing image-to-video models to perform DDIM inversion and intermediate feature injection to maintain the appearance and motion consistency with the source video. On the prompt-based editing, we show that AnyV2V can outperform the previous best approach by 35\% on prompt alignment, and 25\% on human preference. On the three novel tasks, we show that AnyV2V also achieves a high success rate. We believe AnyV2V will continue to thrive due to its ability to seamlessly integrate the fast-evolving image editing methods. Such compatibility can help AnyV2V to increase its versatility to cater to diverse user demands.</description>
