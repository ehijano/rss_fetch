      <title>A power spectrum approach to search for Axion-like Particles from resolved galaxy clusters using CMB as a backlight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions or ALPs are hypothetical particles predicted by BSM theories, which make one of the dark matter candidates. These particles can convert into photons and vice-versa in the presence of magnetic field, with a probability decided by its coupling strength $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$. One of the ways to detect these particles is using the CMB as a backlight. As the CMB photons pass through a galaxy cluster, they can get converted into ALPs in the mass range $10^{-15}$ eV to $10^{-11}$ eV through resonant conversion in the presence of cluster magnetic fields. This leads to a polarized spectral distortion ($\alpha$-distortion) in the CMB as the photon polarization parallel to the magnetic field in the galaxy cluster is involved in the conversion. The fluctuations in the magnetic field and electron density in a galaxy cluster lead to spatially varying $\alpha$-distortion around the cluster, with a power spectrum that is different from the lensed CMB polarization power spectrum for the standard model of cosmology. By measuring the difference in the polarization power spectrum around a galaxy cluster from the all-sky signal, one can find new $\alpha$-distortion in the sky. For galaxy clusters resolvable in multiple EM bands, one can measure the coupling strength $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$ from the ALP power spectrum. Using multi-frequency techniques like ILC to clean the foregrounds, we show that the new power spectrum-based approach of the resolved galaxy clusters from upcoming CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 can detect (or put constraints) on the ALP-photon coupling strength of $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma} &lt; 5.24 \times 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ and $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma} &lt; 3.61 \times 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ at 95\% C.I. respectively for ALPs of masses $10^{-13}$ eV or for smaller $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$ for lighter ALP masses (Abridged).</description>

      <title>A Diffused Background from Axion-like Particles in the Microwave Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is an unsolved cosmological problem and axions are one of the weakly interacting cold dark matter candidates. Axions or ALPs (Axion-like particles) are pseudo-scalar bosons predicted by beyond-standard model theories. The weak coupling of ALPs with photons leads to the conversion of CMB photons to ALPs in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. If they have the same mass as the effective mass of a photon in a plasma, the resonant conversion would cause a polarized spectral distortion leading to temperature fluctuations with the distortion spectrum. The probability of resonant conversion depends on the properties of the cluster such as the magnetic field, electron density, and its redshift. We show that this kind of conversion can happen in numerous unresolved galaxy clusters up to high redshifts, which will lead to a diffused polarised anisotropy signal in the microwave sky. The spectrum of the signal and its shape in the angular scale will be different from the lensed CMB polarization signal. This new polarised distortion spectrum will be correlated with the distribution of clusters in the universe and hence, with the large-scale structure. The spectrum can then be probed using its spectral and spatial variation with respect to the CMB and various foregrounds. An SNR of $\sim$ 4.36 and $\sim$ 93.87 are possible in the CMB-S4 145 GHz band and CMB-HD 150 GHz band respectively for a photon-ALPs coupling strength of $\mathrm{g_{a \gamma} = 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ using galaxy clusters beyond redshift z $= 1$. The same signal would lead to additional RMS fluctuations of $\sim \mathrm{7.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \mu K}$ at 145 GHz. In the absence of any signal, future CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory (SO), CMB-S4, and CMB-HD can put constraints on coupling strength better than current bounds from particle physics experiment CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST).</description>

      <title>Damping wing absorption associated with a giant Ly$\alpha$ trough at $z &lt; 6$: direct evidence for late-ending reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple observations now suggest that the hydrogen reionization may have ended well below redshift six. While there has previously been no conclusive proof of extended neutral islands in the $z &lt; 6$ intergalactic medium, it is possible that such islands give rise to the giant Ly$\alpha$ absorption troughs seen in the spectra of high-redshift quasars. Here we present evidence that the deepest and longest-known Ly$\alpha$ trough at $z &lt; 6$, towards ULAS J0148+0600 (J0148), is associated with damping wing absorption. The evidence comes from a window of strong Ly$\alpha$ transmission at the edge of the J0148 proximity zone. We show that the relatively smooth profile of this transmission window is highly unlikely to arise from resonant absorption alone, but is consistent with the presence of a damping wing. We further argue that the damping wing is unlikely to arise from a compact source due to the lack of associated metal lines, and is more likely to arise from an extended neutral island associated with the giant Ly$\alpha$ trough. We investigate the physical conditions that may give rise to the strong transmission window, and speculate that it may signal an usually deep void, nearby ionizing sources, and/or the recent passage of an ionization front.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Morphological Measurements of Cosmic Web with Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density fields constructed by traditional mass assignment methods are susceptible to irritating discreteness, which hinders morphological measurements of cosmic large-scale structure (LSS) through Minkowski functionals (MFs). For alleviating this issue, fixed-kernel smoothing methods are commonly used in literatures, at the expense of losing substantial structural information. In this work, we propose to measure MFs with Delaunay tessellation field estimation (DTFE) technique, with the goal to maximize extractions of morphological information from sparse tracers. We perform our analyses starting from matter fields and progressively extending to halo fields. At matter field level, we elucidate how discreteness affects the morphological measurements of LSS. Then, by comparing with traditional Gaussian smoothing scheme, we preliminarily showcase the advantages of DTFE for enhancing measurements of MFs from sparse tracers. At halo field level, we first numerically investigate various systematic effects on MFs of DTFE fields, which are induced by finite voxel sizes, halo number densities, halo weightings, and redshift space distortions (RSDs), respectively. Then, we explore the statistical power of MFs measured with DTFE for extracting cosmological information encoded in RSDs. We find that MFs measured with DTFE exhibit improvements by $\sim$ $2$ orders of magnitude in discriminative power for RSD effects and by a factor of $\sim$ $3$-$5$ in constraining power on structure growth rate over the MFs measured with Gaussian smoothing. These findings demonstrate the remarkable enhancements in statistical power of MFs achieved by DTFE, showing enormous application potentials of our method in extracting various key cosmological information from galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the variation of the fine-structure constant at 3&lt;z&lt;10 with JWST emission-line galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present constraints on the spacetime variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ at redshifts $3&lt;z&lt;10$ using JWST emission-line galaxies. The galaxy sample consists of 572 high-quality spectra with strong and narrow [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 doublet emission lines from 522 galaxies, including 267 spectra at $z&gt;5$. The [O III] doublet lines are arguably the best emission lines to probe the variation in $\alpha$. We divide our sample into 5 subsamples based on redshift and calculate the relative variation $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ for the individual subsamples. The calculated $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ values are consistent with zero within $1\sigma$ at all redshifts, suggesting no time variation in $\alpha$ above a level of $(1-2) \times10^{-4}$ ($1\sigma$) in the past 13.2 billion years. When the whole sample is combined, the constraint is improved to be $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = (0.4\pm0.7) \times10^{-4}$. We further test the spatial variation in $\alpha$ using four subsamples of galaxies in four different directions on the sky. The measured $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ values are consistent with zero at a $1\sigma$ level of $\sim10^{-4}$. While the constraints in this work are not as stringent as those from lower-redshift quasar absorption lines in previous studies, this work uses an independent tracer and provides the first constraints on $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ at the highest redshifts. Our analyses also indicate that the relative wavelength calibration of the JWST spectra is robust. With the growing number of emission-line galaxies from JWST, we expect to achieve stronger constraints in the future.</description>

      <title>The integrated perturbation theory for cosmological tensor fields IV: Full-sky formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Papers I-III, we use the flat-sky and distant-observer approximations to develop a formalism with which the correlation statistics of cosmological tensor fields are calculated by the nonlinear perturbation theory, generalizing the integrated perturbation theory for scalar fields. In this work, the formalism is extended to include the full-sky and wide-angle effects in evaluating the power spectra and correlation functions of cosmological tensor fields of any ranks. With the newly developed formalism, one can evaluate the nonlinear power spectra and correlation functions to arbitrary higher orders in principle. After describing the general formalism, we explicitly derive and give analytic results of the lowest-order linear theory for an illustrative purpose in this paper. The derived linear formulas with full-sky and wide-angle effects are numerically compared with the previous formulas with flat-sky and distant-observer limits in a simple model of tensor bias.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the correlation properties of the atmospheric emission in the 10-20 GHz range with QUIJOTE MFI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QUIJOTE MFI instrument (2012-2018) observed the sky at four frequency bands, namely 11, 13, 17 and 19GHz, at 1 degree angular resolution. Using around 10000 h of observations in the so-called nominal mode, QUIJOTE MFI produced sky maps covering approximately 29000 deg2. Here we use the full database of MFI wide survey observations to characterize the correlation properties of the atmospheric signal in those frequency bands. This information will be useful to improve the current sky models at these frequencies, and could be used in further MFI reanalyses, or for the preparation of future observations at these frequencies (e.g., MFI2 and the Tenerife Microwave Spectrometer).</description>

      <title>Digging into the ultraviolet luminosity functions of galaxies at high redshifts: galaxies evolution, reionization, and cosmological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to the successful performance of the James Webb Space Telescope, our understanding of the epoch of reionization of the Universe has been advanced. The ultraviolet luminosity functions (UV LFs) of galaxies span a wide range of redshift, not only revealing the connection between galaxies and dark matter (DM) halos but also providing the information during reionization. In this work, we develop a model connecting galaxy counts and apparent magnitude based on UV LFs, which incorporates redshift-dependent star formation efficiency (SFE) and corrections for dust attenuation. By synthesizing some observations across the redshift range $4\le z \le 10$ from various galaxy surveys, we discern the evolving SFE with increasing redshift and DM halo mass through model fitting. Subsequent analyses indicate that the Thomson scattering optical depth was $\tau_{\rm e} = 0.052^{+0.003}_{-0.002}$ and the epoch of reionization started (ended) at $z=20.58^{+6.25}_{-6.75}$ ($z=5.38^{+0.65}_{-0.70}$) which is insensitive to the choice of the truncated magnitude of the UV LFs. Incorporating additional dataset and some reasonable constraints, the amplitude of matter perturbation is found to be $\sigma_8=0.79\pm0.05$, which is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Future galaxy surveys and the dynamical simulations of galaxy evolution will break the degeneracy between SFE and cosmological parameters, improving the accuracy and the precision of the UV LF model further.</description>

      <title>Constraining UV freeze-in of light relics with current and next-generation CMB observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological observations allow to measure the abundance of light relics produced in the early Universe. Most studies focus on the thermal freeze-out scenario, yet light relics produced by freeze-in are generic for models in which new light degrees of freedom do not couple strongly enough to the Standard Model (SM) plasma to allow for full thermalization in the early Universe. In ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in scenarios, rates for light relic production associated with non-renormalizable interactions typical of beyond the SM (BSM) models grow with temperature more quickly than the Hubble rate. Thus, relatively small couplings to the SM can be probed by current and next-generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We investigate several representative benchmark BSM models, such as axion-like particles from Primakoff production, massless dark photons and light right-handed neutrinos. We calculate contributions to the effective number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, in corners of parameter space not previously considered and discuss the sensitivity of CMB experiments compared to other probes. In contrast to freeze-out scenarios, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ from UV freeze-in is more dependent on both the specific BSM physics model and the reheating temperature. Depending on the details of the BSM scenario, we find that the sensitivity of next-generation CMB experiments can complement or surpass the current astrophysical, laboratory or collider constraints on the couplings of the SM to the light relic.</description>

      <title>The asymmetry of dawn: evidence for asymmetric reionization histories from a joint analysis of cosmic microwave background and astrophysical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that by jointly fitting cosmic microwave background (CMB) and astrophysical data - a compilation of UV luminosity data from the Hubble Frontier Field and neutral hydrogen data from distant sources-, we can infer on the shape of the evolution of the ionized hydrogen fraction with redshift in addition to constraining the average optical depth $\tau$.For this purpose, we introduce here a novel extended model that includes hydrogen ionization histories which are monotonic with redshift, but allow for an asymmetry as indicated from our previous works on a free reconstruction of reionization. By using our baseline data combination, we obtain $\tau=0.0542^{+0.0017}_{-0.0028}$, consistent with our previous works and tighter than the one inferred by Planck 2018 data because of the combination of CMB with astrophysical data. We find that the symmetric hypothesis within our parametrization is disfavoured at 4 $\sigma$.We test our findings by using alternative likelihoods for CMB polarization at low multipoles, i.e. based on the 2020 reprocessing of Planck HFI data or on the joint analysis of WMAP and Planck LFI data, obtaining consistent results that disfavour the symmetric hypothesis of the reionization history at high statistical significant level.These results will be further tested by more precise astrophysical data such as from JWST and Euclid deep fields.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Dark Matter Less-complex Wormhole Structures in Extended Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter wormhole solutions coupled with anisotropic matter distribution are explored in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet and $f(R)$ gravity, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar. We derive the shape function for fuzzy wormholes and explore their possible stability. We study the embedding diagrams of the active gravitational mass associated with fuzzy dark matter wormholes by taking a certain shape function. Aiming to highlight the role of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet and $f(R)$ gravity in the modeling of less complex fuzzy wormhole structures, we evaluate the complexity factor, the conservation equation, and null energy conditions. Our study reinforces more importance of uniformly distributed pressure effects throughout the less complex region than to the emergence of energy density homogeneity in the stability of fuzzy wormholes. It is shown that the active gravitational mass of the fuzzy wormhole structures varies inversely with the radial distance thereby suggesting the breaching of energy conditions at some arena of Einasto index. Furthermore, it is revealed that stable fuzzy dark matter wormhole structures exist in nature in the surroundings of cold dark matter halos and galactic bulges. The important physics understood from our analysis is that in both four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet and $f(R)$ gravity, feasible geometries of fuzzy dark matter wormholes exist naturally in the environments of different galactic haloes.</description>

      <title>Multifield Stochastic Dynamics in GUT Hybrid Inflation and Gravitational Wave Signatures of GUT Higgs Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the hybrid inflation model within the framework of the Grand Unified Theory (GUT), focusing on cases where the waterfall phase transition extends over several e-foldings to dilute monopoles. Considering the stochastic effects of quantum fluctuations, we demonstrate that the waterfall fields (i.e., GUT Higgs) maintain a nonzero vacuum expectation value around the waterfall phase transition. By accurately accounting for the number of degrees of freedom of the GUT Higgs field, we establish that these fluctuations can produce observable gravitational waves without leading to an overproduction of primordial black holes. The amplitude of these gravitational waves is inversely proportional to the degrees of freedom of the waterfall fields, thereby providing a unique method to probe the representation of the GUT Higgs.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of Resonant Axion-Photon Mixing: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many present-day axion searches attempt to probe the mixing of axions and photons, which occurs in the presence of an external magnetic field. While this process is well-understood in a number of simple and idealized contexts, a strongly varying or highly inhomogeneous background can impact the efficiency and evolution of the mixing in a non-trivial manner. In an effort to develop a generalized framework for analyzing axion-photon mixing in arbitrary systems, we focus in this work on directly solving the axion-modified form of Maxwell's equations across a simulation domain with a spatially varying background. We concentrate specifically on understanding resonantly enhanced axion-photon mixing in a highly magnetized plasma, which is a key ingredient for developing precision predictions of radio signals emanating from the magnetospheres of neutron stars. After illustrating the success and accuracy of our approach for simplified limiting cases, we compare our results with a number of analytic solutions recently derived to describe mixing in these systems. We find that our numerical method demonstrates a high level of agreement with one, but only one, of the published results. Interestingly, our method also recovers the mixing between the axion and magnetosonic-t and Alfv\'{e}n modes; these modes cannot escape from the regions of dense plasma, but could non-trivially alter the dynamics in certain environments. Future work will focus on extending our calculations to study resonant mixing in strongly variable backgrounds, mixing in generalized media (beyond the strong magnetic field limit), and the mixing of photons with other light bosonic fields, such as dark photons.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Fermionic Quantum Fluid from Standard Model Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model of dark matter as a superconducting fluid of Cooper pairs of right handed neutrinos or of vector-like quarks. The superconducting dark matter is induced by attractive channels in the Standard Model Higgs and color sectors of the Standard Model, respectively. We show that, for each case, the solution to the gap equation provides viable dark matter candidates for suitable chemical potential values. The mechanism yields an ultra-light neutrino condensate with a mass of $m_{\rm DM} \sim 10^{-19} \text{eV}$ or a vector-like quark condensate with wide range of possible masses. Both cosmological and particle physics constraints on the model lead to a connection between the number of effective relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, and the chemical potential and CMB temperature at the time of fermion creation. We also find a relation between the superconducting fermion and baryon densities, with implications for the coincidence between the dark matter and baryon densities in standard cosmology. Given the natural $\text{eV}$ scale of neutrinos, this mechanism may have implications for the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Preheating with deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply deep learning techniques to the late-time turbulent regime in a post-inflationary model where a real scalar inflaton field and the standard model Higgs doublet interact with renormalizable couplings between them. After inflation, the inflaton decays into the Higgs through a trilinear coupling and the Higgs field subsequently thermalizes with gauge bosons via its $SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauge interaction. Depending on the strength of the trilinear interaction and the Higgs self-coupling, the effective mass squared of Higgs can become negative, leading to the tachyonic production of Higgs particles. These produced Higgs particles would then share their energy with gauge bosons, potentially indicating thermalization. Since the model entails different non-perturbative effects, it is necessary to resort to numerical and semi-classical techniques. However, simulations require significant costs in terms of time and computational resources depending on the model used. Particularly, when $SU(2)$ gauge interactions are introduced, this becomes evident as the gauge field redistributes particle energies through rescattering processes, leading to an abundance of UV modes that disrupt simulation stability. This necessitates very small lattice spacings, resulting in exceedingly long simulation runtimes. Furthermore, the late-time behavior of preheating dynamics exhibits a universal form by wave kinetic theory. Therefore, we analyze patterns in the flow of particle numbers and predict future behavior using CNN-LSTM (Convolutional Neural Network combined with Long Short-Term Memory) time series analysis. In this way, we can reduce our dependence on simulations by orders of magnitude in terms of time and computational resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider inflation with a constant rate of rolling in which a complex scalar field plays the role of inflaton during the inflationary epoch. We implement the inflationary analysis for an accredited angular speed $\dot{\theta}$ which satisfies our dynamical equations. Scalar and tensorial perturbations generated in the framework of constant roll inflation with a complex field are studied. In this respect, we find analytically solutions to the gauge invariant fluctuations, with which an expression for the scalar power spectrum together with its scalar index spectral in this scenario were found. By comparing the obtained results with the observations coming from the cosmic microwave background anisotropies, the constraints on the parameters space of the model and also its predictions are analyzed and discussed.</description>

Abstract: Macroscopic dark matter like nontopological solitons can form either via the fusion and accumulation of free particles or during cosmological phase transitions. Both mechanisms can create dark matter with large masses ranging from TeV to solar mass. This can lead to interesting targets in direct detection, astrophysical, and cosmological searches.</description>

      <title>Exponential Quintessence: curved, steep and stringy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that our universe's current accelerated expansion is explained by a quintessence model with an exponential scalar potential, $V =V_0\, e^{-\lambda\, \phi}$, keeping an eye towards $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$ and an open universe, favorable to a string theory realisation and with no cosmological horizon. We work out the full cosmology of the model, including matter, radiation, and optionally negative spatial curvature, for all $\lambda&gt;0$, performing an extensive analysis of the dynamical system and its phase space. The minimal physical requirements of a past epoch of radiation domination and an accelerated expansion today lead to an upper bound $\lambda \lesssim \sqrt{3}$, which is driven slightly up in the presence of observationally allowed spatial curvature. Cosmological solutions start universally in a kination epoch, go through radiation and matter dominated phases and enter an epoch of acceleration, which is only transient for $\lambda&gt;\sqrt{2}$. Field distances traversed between BBN and today are sub-Planckian. We discuss possible string theory origins and phenomenological challenges, such as time variation of fundamental constants. We provide theoretical predictions for the model parameters to be fitted to data, most notably the varying dark energy equation of state parameter, in light of recent results from DES-Y5 and DESI.</description>

      <title>Probing particle acceleration in Abell 2256: from to 16 MHz to gamma rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Merging galaxy clusters often host spectacular diffuse radio synchrotron sources. These sources can be explained by a non-thermal pool of relativistic electrons accelerated by shocks and turbulence in the intracluster medium. The origin of the pool and details of the cosmic ray transport and acceleration mechanisms in clusters are still open questions. Due to the often extremely steep spectral indices of diffuse radio emission, it is best studied at low frequencies. However, the lowest frequency window available to ground-based telescopes (10-30 MHz) has remained largely unexplored, as radio frequency interference and calibration problems related to the ionosphere become severe. Here, we present LOFAR observations from 16 to 168 MHz targeting the famous cluster Abell 2256. In the deepest-ever images at decametre wavelengths, we detect and resolve the radio halo, radio shock and various steep spectrum sources. We measure standard single power-law behaviour for the radio halo and radio shock spectra and find significant spectral index and curvature fluctuations across the radio halo, indicating an inhomogeneous emitting volume. In contrast to the straight power-law spectra of the large-scale diffuse sources, the various AGN-related sources often show extreme steepening towards higher frequencies and flattening towards low frequencies. We also discover a new fossil plasma source with a steep spectrum between 23 and 144 MHz, with $\alpha=-1.9\pm 0.1$. Finally, by comparing radio and gamma-ray observations, we rule out purely hadronic models for the radio halo origin in Abell 2256, unless the magnetic field strength in the cluster is exceptionally high, which is unsupportable by energetic arguments and inconsistent with the knowledge of other cluster magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin Interactions in General Relativity versus Linearized Massive Gravity: $N$-body Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulated spin-spin interactions of $N$-bodies in linearized General Relativity (GR) and linearized Massive Gravity of the Fierz-Pauli type (mGR). It was noted earlier that there is a discrete difference between the spin-spin interaction potential in GR and mGR for a $2$-body system, akin to the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity in the static Newton's potential. Specifically, at large distances, GR favors anti-parallel spin orientation with total spin pointing along the interaction axis, while mGR favors parallel spin orientation with total spin perpendicular to the axis between the sources. For an $N$-body system, a simulation in mGR hitherto has not been done and one would like to know the total spin of the system in both theories. Here we remedy this. In the simulations of GR, we observed that the total spin tends to decrease from a random initial configuration, while for mGR with a large distance, the total spin increases.</description>

      <title>Robust inference of gravitational wave source parameters in the presence of noise transients using normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) detection is of paramount importance in fundamental physics and GW astronomy, yet it presents formidable challenges. One significant challenge is the removal of noise transient artifacts known as ``glitches," which greatly impact the search and identification of GWs. Recent research has achieved remarkable results in data denoising, often using effective modeling methods to remove glitches. However, for glitches from uncertain or unknown sources, current methods cannot completely eliminate them from the GW signal. In this work, we leverage the inherent robustness of machine learning to obtain reliable posterior parameter distributions directly from GW data contaminated by glitches. Our network model provides reasonable and rapid parameter inference even in the presence of glitches, without needing to remove them. We also investigate various factors affecting the rationality of parameter inference in our normalizing flow network, including glitch and GW parameters. The results demonstrate that the normalizing flow can reasonably infer the source parameters of GWs even with unknown contamination. We find that the nature of the glitch itself is the only factor that can affect the rationality of the inferred results. With improvements to our model, we anticipate accelerating the localization of electromagnetic counterparts and providing priors for more accurate deglitching, thereby speeding up subsequent data processing procedures.</description>

Abstract: We explore an idea put forward many years ago by Zeldovich and Novikov concerning the existence of compact objects endowed with arbitrarily small mass. The energy-density of such objects, which we call ``Ghost stars'', is negative in some regions of the fluid distribution, producing a vanishing total mass. Thus, the interior is matched on the boundary surface to Minkowski space-time. Some exact analytical solutions are exhibited and their properties are analyzed. Observational data that could confirm or dismiss the existence of this kind of stellar object is commented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reconstruct the extra-galactic gamma-ray source-count distribution, or $dN/dS$, of resolved and unresolved sources by adopting machine learning techniques. Specifically, we train a convolutional neural network on synthetic 2-dimensional sky-maps, which are built by varying parameters of underlying source-counts models and incorporate the Fermi-LAT instrumental response functions. The trained neural network is then applied to the Fermi-LAT data, from which we estimate the source count distribution down to flux levels a factor of 50 below the Fermi-LAT threshold. We perform our analysis using 14 years of data collected in the $(1,10)$ GeV energy range. The results we obtain show a source count distribution which, in the resolved regime, is in excellent agreement with the one derived from catalogued sources, and then extends as $dN/dS \sim S^{-2}$ in the unresolved regime, down to fluxes of $5 \cdot 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The neural network architecture and the devised methodology have the flexibility to enable future analyses to study the energy dependence of the source-count distribution.</description>

Abstract: The Roman Space Telescope's Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey will constitute the most sensitive microlensing survey of the Galactic Bulge to date, opening up new opportunities to search for dark matter (DM). Many extensions of the Standard Model predict the formation of extended DM substructures, such as DM subhalos, boson/axion stars, and halo-dressed primordial black holes. We demonstrate that for such targets, Roman will be sensitive to a broad parameter space up to four orders of magnitude below existing constraints. Our analysis can be readily applied to other extended DM configurations as well.</description>

      <title>Constraining general multi-field inflation using the SPHEREx all-sky survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how well the SPHEREx all-sky survey can constrain local primordial non-Gaussianity beyond the parameter $f_{\text{NL}}$ using galaxy power spectra. We forecast joint constraints on the parameters $f_{\text{NL}}$, $g_{\text{NL}}$ and $\tau_{\text{NL}}$ obtained assuming a simple two-field curvaton model of inflation. The parameters $f_{\text{NL}}$ and $g_{\text{NL}}$ characterise the squeezed limits of the primordial bispectrum and trispectrum respectively, and lead to a characteristic scale-dependence of the galaxy bias that increases out to arbitrarily large scales. Values of the parameter $\tau_{\text{NL}}&gt; (\frac{6}{5}f_{\text{NL}})^{2}$ cause the galaxy power spectrum to have a stochastic component which also increases out to arbitrarily large scales. Our MCMC forecasts indicate that SPHEREx can provide joint constraints on any two of the three parameters $f_{\text{NL}}, \ g_{\text{NL}}$ and $\tau_{\text{NL}}$. Due to strong degeneracies among these parameters, measurements of the galaxy power spectra alone may not be sufficient to jointly constrain all three. Constraints on $f_{\text{NL}}, \ g_{\text{NL}}$ and $\tau_{\text{NL}}$ obtained from galaxy power spectrum observations depend on the modelling of underlying nuisance parameters. We study the robustness of our forecast constraints to modelling choices and note that even with relatively conservative modelling assumptions, SPHEREx galaxy power spectra can provide strong evidence of local non-Gaussianity, even if the particular values of $f_{\text{NL}}$ and $g_{\text{NL}}$ cannot be measured precisely.</description>

Abstract: Renormalization of quantum loop effects generated from large fluctuations is a hugely debatable topic of research these days which rules out the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation within the framework of single-field inflation. In this article, we briefly discuss that the correct implementation of regularization, renormalization, and resummation techniques in a setup described by an ultra-slow-roll phase sandwiched between two slow-roll phases in the presence of smooth or sharp transitions can lead to a stringent constraint on the PBH mass (i.e. ${\cal O}(10^{2}{\rm gm}$)), which we advertise as a new No-go theorem. Finally, we will give some of the possible way-outs using which one can evade this proposed No-go theorem and produce solar/sub-solar mass PBHs.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate new constraints on $f(T)$ gravity using the recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) catalog from the full 5-years of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN5YR). The $f(T)$ cosmological models considered are characterised by power law late-time accelerated expansion. Our results show that the combination DESI BAO +$r_d$ CMB Planck suggests a Bayesian preference for late-time $f(T)$ cosmological models over $\Lambda$CDM, obtaining a value of $H_0= 68.3^{+3.0}_{-3.5}$[km/s/Mpc] in agreement with SH0ES collaboration, however, due to a bigger uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09768v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze inhomogeneous cosmological models in the local Universe, described by the Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) metric and developed using linear perturbation theory on a homogeneous and isotropic Universe background. Focusing on the different evolution of spherical symmetric inhomogeneities, we compare the $\Lambda$LTB model, in which the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is included in the LTB formalism, with inhomogeneous cosmological models based on $f\left(R\right)$ modified gravity theories viewed in the Jordan frame. We solve the system of field equations for both inhomogeneous cosmological models adopting the method of separation of variables: we integrate analytically the radial profiles of local perturbations, while their time evolution requires a numerical approach. The main result of the analysis concerns the different radial profiles of local inhomogeneities due to the presence of a non-minimally coupled scalar field in the Jordan frame of $f\left(R\right)$ gravity. While radial perturbations follow a power-law in the $\Lambda$LTB model, Yukawa-like contributions appear in the $f\left(R\right)$ theory. Interestingly, this latter peculiar behavior of radial profile is not affected by the choice of the $f\left(R\right)$ functional form. The numerical solution of time-dependent perturbations exhibits a non-diverging profile. This work suggests that investigations about local inhomogeneities in the late Universe may allow us to discriminate if the present cosmic acceleration is caused by a cosmological constant term or a modified gravity effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an inflation model with a flat scalar potential supported by observations and find that slow-roll inflation can emerge after a quasi-cyclic phase of the Universe, where it undergoes repeated expansions and contractions for a finite time period. The initial conditions and the positive spatial curvature required for such nontrivial dynamics align with the quantum creation of the Universe. The key ingredients that trigger inflation are dissipative interactions of the inflaton, which are necessary to reheat the Universe after inflation and thus give us an observational handle on pre-inflationary physics. Our discovery implies that inflation occurs more robustly after the creation.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Emergence of Inflation from Quasi-Cyclic Universe</title>

Abstract: Inflationary models, especially those with plateau-type potentials, are consistent with the cosmological data, but inflation itself does not resolve the initial singularity. This singularity is resolved, for example, by the idea of the quantum creation of the Universe from nothing such as the tunneling and no-boundary proposals. The simplest one predicts a closed Universe. Motivated by these facts, we investigate the classical dynamics of a closed universe with a plateau-type potential. Depending on the initial inflaton field value, the universe can undergo a variety of events: an immediate big crunch, a bounce or cyclic phase, and inflation. Although the non-inflationary solutions may appear irrelevant to our Universe, they can be turned into single or multiple bounces followed by inflation, taking into account the interactions necessary for the reheating of the Universe after inflation. Thus, the dissipative mechanism in our setup explains both the graceful entry to and exit from inflation and gives us an indirect observational handle on the Universe just after creation. We also comment on the implications of these solutions for probabilistic interpretations of the wave function of the Universe.</description>

      <title>ComPACT: ACT+Planck galaxy cluster catalogue</title>

Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound systems consisting of dark matter, hot baryonic gas and stars. They play an important role in observational cosmology and galaxy evolution studies. We develop a deep learning model for segmentation of Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal on ACT+Planck intensity maps and construct a pipeline for microwave cluster detection in the ACT footprint. The proposed model allows us to identify previously unknown galaxy clusters, i.e. it is capable of detecting SZ sources below the detection threshold adopted in the published galaxy clusters catalogues (such as ACT DR5 and PSZ2). In this paper, we use the derived SZ signal map to considerably improve a cluster purity in the extended catalogue of Sunyaev-Zeldovich objects from Planck data (SZcat) in the ACT footprint. From SZcat, we create a new microwave galaxy cluster catalogue (ComPACT), which includes 2,962 SZ objects with cluster purity conservatively estimated as $\gtrsim74-84$\%. We categorise objects in the catalogue into 3 categories, based on their cluster reliability. Within the ComPACT catalogue, there are $\gtrsim{}977$ new clusters with respect to the ACT DR5 and PSZ2 catalogues.</description>

      <title>Violation of the equivalence principle induced by oscillating rest mass and transition frequency, and its detection in atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the expected experimental signals produced by freely falling atoms with time oscillating mass and transition frequency. These oscillations could be produced in a variety of models, in particular, models of scalar dark matter (DM) non universally coupled to the standard matter (SM) such as axion-like particles (ALP) and dilatons. Performing complete and rigorous calculations, we show that, on one hand, two different atomic species would accelerate at a different rate, and on the other hand, they would produce a non-zero differential phase shift in atom interferometers (AI). The former would produce observable signals in equivalence principle tests like the recent MICROSCOPE mission, and we provide a corresponding sensitivity estimate, showing that MICROSCOPE can reach beyond the best existing searches in the ALP case. We also compare the expected sensitivity of two future AI experiments, namely the AION-10 gradiometer and an isotope differential AI considered for MAGIS-100, that we will refer to as SPID. We show that the SPID setup would be more sensitive to these dark matter fields compared to the gradiometer one, assuming equivalent experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>TDiff invariant gauge fields in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of Abelian gauge fields invariant under transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff) in cosmological contexts. We show that in the geometric optics approximation, very much as for Diff invariant theories, the corresponding massless gauge bosons propagate along null geodesics and particle number is conserved. In addition, the polarization vectors are orthogonal to the propagation direction and the physical (transverse projection) polarization is parallel transported along the geodesics. We also consider TDiff invariant Dirac spinors, study the coupling to the gauge fields and analyze the conditions in order to avoid violations of Einstein's Equivalence Principle. The contributions to the energy-momentum tensor of the gauge field are also analyzed. We find that, in general, the breaking of Diff invariance makes the electric and magnetic parts of the vector field to gravitate in a different way. In the sub-Hubble regime we recover the standard radiation-like behaviour of the energy density, however in the super-Hubble regime the behaviour is totally different to the Diff case, thus opening up a wide range of possibilities for cosmological model building. In particular, possible effects on the evolution of large-scale primordial magnetic fields are discussed.</description>

      <title>Search for Axion dark matter with the QUAX-LNF tunable haloscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first experimental results obtained with the new haloscope of the QUAX experiment located at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati of INFN (LNF). The haloscope is composed of a OFHC Cu resonant cavity cooled down to about 30 mK and immersed in a magnetic field of 8 T. The cavity frequency was varied in a 6 MHz range between 8.831496 and 8.83803 GHz. This corresponds to a previously unprobed mass range between 36.52413 and 36.5511 $\mu$eV. We don't observe any excess in the power spectrum and set limits on the axion-photon coupling in this mass range down to $g_{a\gamma\gamma} &lt; 0.861 \times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ with the confidence level set at $90\%$.</description>

      <title>Analysis of anomalous contribution to galactic rotation curves due to stochastic spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the model put forth by Ref. [1], in which it is claimed that "post-quantum classical gravity" (PQCG), a stochastic theory of gravity, leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) behavior on galactic scales that reproduces galactic rotation curves. We show that this analysis has three basic problems: (i) the equations of PQCG do not lead to a new large scale force of the form claimed in the paper, (ii) the form claimed is not of the MONDian form anyhow and so does not correspond to observed galactic dynamics, and (iii) the spectrum of fluctuations is very different from observations.</description>
