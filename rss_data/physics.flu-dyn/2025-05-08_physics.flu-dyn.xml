      <title>Drops can Perpetually Bounce over a Vibrating Wettable Solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the surface of a vibrating liquid bath, instead of coalescing, a drop will continually bounce on a thin film of air between the drop and the free surface, giving rise to rich chaotic dynamics and quantum analog behavior. However, perpetual bouncing is yet to be demonstrated on a vibrating rigid solid, where the control of the drop's motion is not limited by the bath dynamics. Here we show that vibration of an atomically smooth mica surface prolongs a drop's hovering state by several orders of magnitude, increasing the time to wet from less than a second to several minutes. The excitation of the second spherical harmonic mode determines a transition between a bouncing state with high-amplitude rebounds, and a bound state, where the drop's motion is locked onto the vibrating solid above a thin air layer. We further develop a coupled linear spring model, accounting for the drop's deformation, that predicts bouncing trajectories without fitting parameters. Our results extend the scope of bouncing drop studies beyond the liquid bath and highlight the potential for precision manipulation of small liquid quantities in air.</description>

      <title>Drainage and lifetime of thin liquid films: the role of salinity and convective evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the effect of salinity and atmospheric humidity on the drainage and lifetime of thin liquid films motivated by conditions relevant to air-sea exchanges. We show that the drainage is independent of humidity and that the effect of a change in salinity is only reflected through the associated change in viscosity. On the other hand, film lifetime displays a strong dependence on humidity, with more than a tenfold increase between low and high humidities: from a few seconds to tens of minutes. Mixing the air surrounding the film also has a very important effect on lifetime, modifying its distribution and reducing the mean lifetime of the film. From estimations of the evaporation rate, we are able to derive scaling laws that describe well the evolution of lifetime with a change of humidity. Observations of the black film, close to the top where the film ruptures, reveal that this region is very sensitive to local humidity conditions.</description>

      <title>Influence of the particle distribution on dust explosions in the 20 L sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is essential to standardize the safety characteristics of dust explosions to mitigate their impact on the process industries. The 20 L sphere primarily investigates the safety characteristics, namely explosion pressure (P_ex) and the rate of pressure rise ((dP/dt)_ex), of dust explosions at the laboratory level. Ensuring uniform dust distribution inside the sphere is essential for accurate data acquisition and standardization. However, whirls created by the incoming flow through the nozzle yield particles to concentrate near the wall before ignition. This study simulated the explosion inside a 20 L sphere to investigate the impact of near-wall particle concentration on the safety characteristics. The OpenFOAM model based on the Euler-Lagrangian approach was benchmarked against experimental data of lycopodium dust explosions. A novel radial homogeneity parameter Phi (0 &lt;= Phi &lt;= 1) quantifies the near-wall particle concentration. The parameter Phi is calculated using a power law based on the radial component of particle coordinates, where Phi = 1 indicates a uniform distribution, and Phi = 0 represents all particles concentrating on the wall. Different particle distributions (Phi = 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1) are initiated before ignition. As Phi decreases from 1, P_ex and (dP/dt)_ex first decrease, but beyond a certain point, both parameters increase. At Phi = 0.1, both P_ex and (dP/dt)_ex reach their highest values, which are 1.75% and 10.1% higher than the uniform distribution, respectively. The lowest values arise at Phi = 0.7, with reductions of 0.25% and 5.6% compared to the uniform distribution. Thus, high near-wall concentrations enhance explosion intensity, while moderate concentrations result in lower intensity than the uniform distribution.</description>

      <title>Effects of Geometric Modelling and Blood Rheology in Patient-Specific Arterial Blood Flow Simulations with Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates speed-accuracy trade-off aspects for geometry simplification of blood flow in realistic arteries obtained from Computed Tomography (CT) scan data. The study uses realistic inflow (with mean Re = 313.6 and peak Re = 1687 based on Newtonian viscosity) and outlet boundary conditions with Newtonian and non-Newtonian blood viscosity models, including the one developed by Apostolidis and Beris et al. Similar studies exist to predict the progression of atherosclerosis, clots, and thrombus formation in arteries. However, these assume smooth flow geometries. In contrast, realistic arteries possess significant amounts of roughness, perturbations, and undulations. To understand their impact, studies are performed with two levels of geometry simplifications. Our results indicate that flow field predictions on these simplified geometries are visibly affected. The first level of simplification loses the local asymmetry but is able to reasonably approximate various parameters, capturing patterns with the correct magnitude. However, further simplification to a smooth one does not show vortex structures in the flow field. The flow recirculation zones near wall perturbations progressively weaken as the geometry is smoothed. On the other hand, no significant differences are observed between Newtonian and non-Newtonian models in this study. Our analysis also enables a speed-accuracy trade-off for future applications. The number of iterations to convergence becomes progressively lower as geometry is simplified, with nearly four times the difference obtained even with the first level of simplification. Further, the computational time for the Newtonian model is nearly 10 times smaller than the non-Newtonian counterpart.</description>

      <title>Impact of Particle Injection Velocity on the Stability of the Particulate Rayleigh-B\'enard System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear stability of a thermally stratified fluid layer between horizontal walls, where thermal particles are continuously injected at one boundary and extracted at the other - a system known as particulate Rayleigh-B\'enard (pRB) - is studied. For a fixed volumetric particle flux, reducing the injection velocity stabilizes the system when heavy particles are introduced from above, but destabilizes it when light particles are injected from below. For very light particles (bubbles), low injection velocities can shift the onset of convection to negative Rayleigh numbers, i.e. heating from above. Particles accumulate non-uniformly near the extraction wall and in regions of strong vertical flow, aligning with either wall-impinging or wall-detaching zones depending on whether injection is at sub- or super-terminal velocity.</description>

      <title>Mori-Zwanzig latent space Koopman closure for nonlinear autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator presents an attractive approach to achieve global linearization of nonlinear systems, making it a valuable method for simplifying the understanding of complex dynamics. While data-driven methodologies have exhibited promise in approximating finite Koopman operators, they grapple with various challenges, such as the judicious selection of observables, dimensionality reduction, and the ability to predict complex system behaviours accurately. This study presents a novel approach termed Mori-Zwanzig autoencoder (MZ-AE) to robustly approximate the Koopman operator in low-dimensional spaces. The proposed method leverages a nonlinear autoencoder to extract key observables for approximating a finite invariant Koopman subspace and integrates a non-Markovian correction mechanism using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. Consequently, this approach yields an approximate closure of the dynamics within the latent manifold of the nonlinear autoencoder, thereby enhancing the accuracy and stability of the Koopman operator approximation. Demonstrations showcase the technique's improved predictive capability for flow around a cylinder. It also provides a low dimensional approximation for Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) with promising short-term predictability and robust long-term statistical performance. By bridging the gap between data-driven techniques and the mathematical foundations of Koopman theory, MZ-AE offers a promising avenue for improved understanding and prediction of complex nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Refiner: Accurate Fine-Tuning of Spatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator for Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in operator-type neural networks have shown promising results in approximating the solutions of spatiotemporal Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new learning framework to address these issues. A new spatiotemporal adaptation is proposed to generalize any Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) variant to learn maps between Bochner spaces, which can perform an arbitrary-length temporal super-resolution for the first time. To better exploit this capacity, a new paradigm is proposed to refine the commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and evaluations with the help from the wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques. Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow modeled by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed paradigm trains an FNO only for a few epochs. Then, only the newly proposed spatiotemporal spectral convolution layer is fine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The spectral fine-tuning loss function uses a negative Sobolev norm for the first time in operator learning, defined through a reliable functional-type a posteriori error estimator whose evaluation is exact thanks to the Parseval identity. Moreover, unlike the difficult nonconvex optimization problems in the end-to-end training, this fine-tuning loss is convex. Numerical experiments on commonly used NSE benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy, compared to end-to-end evaluation and traditional numerical PDE solvers under certain conditions.

      <title>Fast relaxation of a viscous vortex in an external flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a concentrated vortex advected by a smooth, divergence-free velocity field in two space dimensions. In the idealized situation where the initial vorticity is a Dirac mass, we compute an approximation of the solution which accurately describes, in the regime of high Reynolds numbers, the motion of the vortex center and the deformation of the streamlines under the shear stress of the external flow. For ill-prepared initial data, corresponding to a sharply peaked Gaussian vortex, we prove relaxation to the previous solution on a time scale that is much shorter than the diffusive time, due to enhanced dissipation inside the vortex core.</description>
