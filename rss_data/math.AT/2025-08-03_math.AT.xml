      <title>Baues-Wirsching Cohomology and Svarc Genus in Small Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for a bifibration P between small categories, the lenght of the cup product in the kernel of the induced morphism in the Baues-Wirsching cohomology with coefficients in any natural system is a lower bound for the homotopic sectional category (also called Svarc genus). Our results extend classical Svarc type inequalties to the categorical setting and introduce a computationally efficient method via a reduced cochain complex for Baues-Wirching cohomology.</description>

      <title>Equivariant infinite loop space theory, the space level story</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:1704.03413v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rework and generalize equivariant infinite loop space theory, which shows how to construct $G$-spectra from $G$-spaces with suitable structure. There is a classical version which gives classical $\Omega$-$G$-spectra for any topological group $G$, but our focus is on the construction of genuine $\Omega$-$G$-spectra when $G$ is finite. We also show what is and is not true when $G$ is a compact Lie group.
  We give new information about the Segal and operadic equivariant infinite loop space machines, supplying many details that are missing from the literature, and we prove by direct comparison that the two machines give equivalent output when fed equivalent input. The proof of the corresponding nonequivariant uniqueness theorem, due to May and Thomason, works for classical $G$-spectra for general $G$ but fails for genuine $G$-spectra. Even in the nonequivariant case, our comparison theorem is considerably more precise, giving an illuminating direct point-set level comparison.
  We have taken the opportunity to update this general area, equivariant and nonequivariant, giving many new proofs, filling in some gaps, and giving a number of corrections to results and proofs in the literature.</description>

      <title>Two remarks on spaces of maps between operads of little cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We record two facts on spaces of derived maps between the operads $E_d$ of little $d$-cubes. Firstly, these mapping spaces are equivalent to the mapping spaces between the non-unitary versions of $E_d$. Secondly, all endomorphisms of $E_d$ are automorphisms. We also discuss variants for localisations of $E_d$ and for versions with tangential structures.</description>

      <title>Geometric invariants of locally compact groups: the homological perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the homological version of $\Sigma$-theory for locally compact Hausdorff groups, leaving the homotopical version for another paper. Both versions are connected by a Hurewicz-like theorem. They can be thought of as directional versions of type $\mathrm{CP}_m$ and type $\mathrm{C}_m$, respectively. And classical $\Sigma$-theory is recovered if we equip an abstract group with the discrete topology. This paper provides criteria for type $\mathrm{CP}_m$ and homological locally compact $\Sigma^m$. Given a short exact sequence with kernel of type $\mathrm{CP}_m$, we can derive $\Sigma^m$ of the extension on the sphere that vanishes on the kernel from the quotient and likewise. Given a short exact sequence with abelian quotient, $\Sigma$-theory on the extension can tell if the kernel is of type $\mathrm{CP}_m$.</description>

      <title>Brown functors of directed graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any digraph Brown functor -- i.e. a contravariant functor from the homotopy category of finite directed graphs to the category of abelian groups, satisfying the triviality axiom, the additivity axiom, and the Mayer-Vietoris axiom -- is representable. Furthermore, we show that the first path cohomology functor is a digraph Brown functor.</description>

      <title>Cobordism Utopia: U-Dualities, Bordisms, and the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The U-dualities of maximally supersymmetric supergravity theories lead to celebrated non-perturbative constraints on the structure of quantum gravity. They can also lead to the presence of global symmetries since manifolds equipped with non-trivial duality bundles can carry topological charges captured by non-trivial elements of bordism groups. The recently proposed Swampland Cobordism Conjecture thus predicts the existence of new singular objects absent in the low-energy supergravity theory, which break these global symmetries.
  We investigate this expectation in two directions, involving the different choices of U-duality groups $G_U$, as well as $k$, the dimension of the closed manifold carrying the topological charge. First, we compute for all supergravity theories in dimension $3 \leq D \leq 11$ the bordism groups $\Omega_1^{\text{Spin}}(BG_U)$. Second, we treat in detail the case of $D = 8$, computing all relevant bordism groups $\Omega_k^{\text{Spin}}(BG_U)$ for $1 \leq k \leq 7$. In all cases, we identify corresponding string, M-, or F-theory backgrounds which implement the required U-duality defects. In particular, we find that in some cases there is no purely geometric background available which implements the required symmetry-breaking defect. This includes non-geometric twists as well as non-geometric strings and instantons.
  This computation involves several novel computations of the bordism groups for $G_U = \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z}) \times \mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$, which localizes at primes $p=2,3$. Whereas an amalgamated product structure greatly simplifies the calculation of purely $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ bundles, this does not extend to $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{Z})$. Rather, we leverage the appearance of product / ring structures induced from cyclic subgroups of $G_U$ which naturally act on the relevant bordism groups.</description>
