      <title>Deterministic and probabilistic neural surrogates of global hybrid-Vlasov simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12614v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid-Vlasov simulations resolve ion-kinetic effects for modeling the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, but even 5D (2D + 3V) simulations are computationally expensive. We show that graph-based machine learning emulators can learn the spatiotemporal evolution of electromagnetic fields and lower order moments of ion velocity distribution in the near-Earth space environment from four 5D Vlasiator runs performed with identical steady solar wind conditions. The initial ion number density is systematically varied, while the grid spacing is held constant, to scan the ratio of the characteristic ion skin depth to the numerical grid size. Using a graph neural network architecture operating on the 2D spatial simulation grid comprising 670k cells, we demonstrate that both a deterministic forecasting model (Graph-FM) and a probabilistic ensemble forecasting model (Graph-EFM) based on a latent variable formulation are capable of producing accurate predictions of future plasma states. A divergence penalty is incorporated during training to encourage divergence-freeness in the magnetic fields and improve physical consistency. For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs. These results demonstrate that machine learning offers a way to make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for real-time use while providing forecast uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Stability of equilibrium points in modified elliptic restricted three-body problem with various perturbation sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the dynamics of the third body in an elliptic restricted three-body problem (ERTBP) framework, taking into account perturbations from radiation pressure, oblateness, and elongation of the primary bodies, as well as disk-like structures. The objectives are to determine the positions and stability of the equilibrium points, asses how these points shift under the influence of perturbations, and evaluate the dependence of their stability on the orbital eccentricity and perturbation parameters. The ERTBP model is modified to include a radiating, oblate primary body and an elongated secondary body modeled as a finite straight segment, alongside perturbations from a surrounding disk. The system's equations of motion are numerically solved using parameters from perturbed and classical cases. Equilibrium positions are computed over a range of eccentricities and perturbation values, and stability is analyzed using linearized equations and eigenvalue methods. In all cases, we have found three collinear ($L_1$, $L_2$, $L_3$) and two non-collinear ($L_4$, $L_5$) equilibrium points solutions. The inclusion of radiations, oblateness, elongation using a finite straight segment, and disk perturbation systematically displaces each equilibrium point from its classical location, with the magnitude and direction of the displacement varying with the perturbation parameter. Stability analysis confirms that the collinear points remain linearly stable under all tested conditions. Meanwhile, non-collinear points are stable under a specific condition. We investigate the stability boundary of these points as a function of orbital eccentricity and we found there is a critical range of eccentricity values within which stability is preserved.</description>

      <title>The Feasibility of Potentially Hazardous Asteroids Flybys Using Multiple Venus Gravity Assists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops low-energy spacecraft (SC) trajectories using Venus gravity assists to study asteroids during heliocentric transfer segments between planetary encounters. The study focuses on potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) as primary exploration targets. This paper proposes a method for calculating SC trajectories that enable asteroid flybys after a Venus gravity assist. The method involves formulating and solving an optimization problem to design trajectories incorporating flybys of selected asteroids and Venus. Trajectories are calculated using two-body dynamics by solving the Lambert problem. A preliminary search for candidate asteroids uses an algorithm to narrow the search space of the optimization problem. This algorithm uses the V-infinity globe technique to connect planetary gravity assists with resonant orbits. The resonant orbit in this case serves as an initial approximation for the SC's trajectory between two successive planetary flybys. Four flight schemes were analyzed, including multiple flybys of Venus and asteroids, with the possibility of an SC returning to Earth. The proposed solutions reduce flight time between asteroid approaches, increase gravity assist frequency, and enhance mission design flexibility. The use of Venus gravity assists and resonant orbits ensures a close encounter with at least one asteroid during the SC's trajectory between two consecutive flybys of Venus, and demonstrates the feasibility of periodic Venus gravity assists and encounters with PHAs. The developed method was applied to construct trajectories that allow an SC to approach both Venus-resonant asteroids and PHAs via multiple Venus gravity assists. An additional study was carried out to identify asteroids accessible during the Earth-Venus segment in launch windows between 2029 and 2050.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Origin of (469219) Kamo`oalewa of Tianwen-2 Mission from the Main-Belt: $\nu_6$ Secular Resonance, Flora Family or 3:1 Resonance with Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: China's Tianwen-2 mission, launched on 29 May 2025, targets the near-Earth object (469219) Kamo`oalewa, an Earth quasi-satellite trapped in a 1:1 mean-motion resonance with our planet. Determining the origin of Kamo`oalewa is central to understanding the formation pathways and dynamical evolution of Earth's quasi-satellite population. Here we show a strong possibility of main-belt origin for Kamo`oalewa using long-term dynamical simulations. We examine three candidate source regions: the $\nu_6$ secular resonance ($\nu_6$), the 3:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter (3:1J MMR), and the Flora family. A total of 42,825 test particles were integrated over 100 Myr. We find that asteroids from all three regions can be transported onto Kamo`oalewa-like orbits, albeit with markedly different efficiencies. Particles originating near the $\nu_6$ show the highest transfer probability (3.31%), followed by the Flora family (2.54%) and the 3:1J MMR (0.39%). We further identify representative dynamical pathways linking these source regions to Earth quasi-satellite orbits. The Tianwen-2 spacecraft is expected to rendezvous with Kamo`oalewa in 2026, performing close-proximity operations and returning samples. The mission will provide decisive observational constraints on the asteroid's composition and physical properties, offering a critical test of its proposed origin.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Turbulence at Sub-Electron Scales in the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of turbulence at sub-electron scales has remained an open question, central to understanding how electrons are heated in the solar wind. This is primarily because spacecraft measurements have been limited to magnetic field fluctuations alone. We resolve this by deriving new high-resolution density fluctuations from spacecraft potential measurements of Parker Solar Probe resolving scales smaller than the electron gyro-radius ($\rho_e$). A systematic comparison of the density and magnetic spectra shows that both steepen near the electron scales. Notably, the density spectrum exhibits slopes close to $-10/3$, while the magnetic spectrum becomes consistently steeper than the density spectrum at scales smaller than $\rho_e$, indicating that the turbulence becomes electrostatic. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions of an electron entropy cascade, which may explain the irreversible dissipation of turbulent energy at sub-$\rho_e$ scales. The magnetic spectrum, however, is not as steep as expected for the electron entropy cascade, which may be due to limited signal-to-noise ratio and the presence of weakly damped electromagnetic fluctuations near $\rho_e$.</description>
