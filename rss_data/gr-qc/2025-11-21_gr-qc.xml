      <title>Extended Entropic Dark Energy with Four Free Parameters: Theory, Dynamics, and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a four-parameter entropic dark energy model in a spatially curved FLRW universe, based on a generalized entropy-area relation at the apparent horizon. While the proposed entropy function captures a broad class of gravitational entropy corrections, including Bekenstein-Hawking, Tsallis, and power-law forms, it does not encompass information-theoretic entropies such as Sharma-Mittal or Renyi. Within this framework, we derive exact analytical expressions for key cosmological observables, including the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, the dark energy density parameter $\Omega_D(z)$, and the equation of state $w_D(z)$. A comprehensive parameter-space analysis reveals viable regions, particularly for $\beta &gt; 1$ and small positive curvature, that accommodate elevated $H_0$ values consistent with recent SH0ES measurements. Our results offer a simple and analytically tractable alternative to conventional dynamical dark energy models, with potential relevance to the ongoing Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Comment to Comment to Black Hole in Dehnen $\left(1,4,\frac{1}{2}\right)$ Dark Matter Halo: Exact Solution, Lensing, Light Ring, and Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The claim in \cite{Al-Badawi:2025ipr} that *"the errors in the foundational components (3) and (5) of Ref. [1] invalidate all subsequent analyses, numerical results, and physical interpretations that depend on them"* is **entirely unfounded**. This statement reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the typographical nature of the error and appears to be a misplaced critique originating from a competing author, rather than a substantive assessment of the results, which remain fully valid.</description>

      <title>Thermal Vacuum Model for Cosmology without Inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The previously proposed modification of the standard (flat) inflationary $\Lambda CDM$ model in which the inflaton field(s) and ``dark energy" are replaced by the vacum in expanding Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker Universe is studied. The expanding joint vacuum of the all ingrediences of matter, including Standard Model particles and a dark matter sector, is treated as a thermal equilibrium state at temporal Gibbons-Hawking temperature, proportional to the Hubble parameter, and chemical potentials equal to particle masses. This theory provides not only the new mechanism of inflation and its graceful exit, but also explains acceleration of expansion for the late Universe. The formalism can be combined with the anomalous quantum gravity effects leading to a viable baryogenesis mechanism and certain bounds on dark matter particle masses and lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Embedding Einstein-Cartan theory to Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate torsion-driven cosmological dynamics within the framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity using the De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian formalism, where the tetrad and Lorentz connection act as independent variables and the Hamiltonian includes quadratic Riemann Cartan corrections. Embedding this theory in an FLRW background, we derive the corresponding torsion-modified Friedmann equations and analyze their solutions across radiation and matter-dominated epochs. The commonly assumed power law form $a(t)=\beta t^{\alpha}$ is shown to generate multiple solution branches, many of which can be considered to be 'unphysical', atleast to hold true globally, for all times. A hybrid solution, $a(t)=Ct^{\alpha}e^{Dt^{\beta}}$ emerges in the special case $g_1=0$, where the quadratic Riemann-Cartan term vanishes. For $g_1\not=0$, the equations become nonlinear, precluding closed-form analytic solutions. These findings highlight the limitations of the power-law approximation and identify the restricted conditions under which torsion can coherently drive cosmic expansion.</description>

      <title>Teukolsky by Design: A Hybrid Spectral-PINN solver for Kerr Quasinormal Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SpectralPINN, a hybrid pseudo-spectral/physics-informed neural network (PINN) solver for Kerr quasinormal modes that targets the Teukolsky equation in both the separated (radial/angular) and joint two-dimensional formulations. The solver replaces standard neural activation functions with Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind and supports both soft -- via loss penalties -- and hard -- enforced by analytic masks -- implementations of Leaver's normalization. Benchmarking against Leaver's continued-fraction method shows cumulative (real+imaginary part) relative frequency errors of $\sim 0.001\%$ for the separated formulation with hard normalization, $\sim 0.1\%$ for both the soft separated and soft joint formulations, and $\sim 0.01\%$ for the hard joint case. Exploiting our ability to solve the joint equation, we add a small quadrupolar perturbation to the Teukolsky operator, effectively rendering the problem non-separable. The resulting perturbed quasinormal modes are compared against the expected precision of the Einstein Telescope, allowing us to constrain the magnitude of the perturbation. These proof-of-concept results demonstrate that hybrid spectral-PINN solvers can provide a flexible pathway to quasinormal spectra in settings where separability, asymptotics, or field content become more intricate and high accuracy is required.</description>

      <title>Dimensional Phenomenology in Polymeric Quantization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the statistical mechanics within the polymer quantization framework in the semiclassical regime. We apply a non-canonical transformation to the phase space variables. Then, we use this non-canonical transformation to calculate the deformed density of states of the $2n$-dimensional phase space, which encompasses all polymer effects. In the next step, some thermodynamic features of a system of $n$-dimensional harmonic oscillators are studied by computing the deformed partition function. The results show that the number of microstates decreases because there is an upper bound on the momentum within the polymer framework. We found that in the high-temperature regime, when the thermal de Broglie wavelength is close to the Planck length, $n$ degrees of freedom of the system are frozen in this setup. In other words, there is an effective reduction in space dimensions from $n$ to $\frac{n}{2}$ in the polymeric framework, which also signals the fractional dimension for odd-dimensional oscillators.</description>

      <title>Friedmann equations from GUP-modified equipartition law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, combining the thermodynamical arguments of the horizon with the quadratic generalised uncertainty principle (GUP), we heuristically obtain the modified equipartition law of energy. Employing this modified equipartition law of energy, we derive the Friedmann equations in Verlinde's entropic gravity. We find a maximum energy density at the beginning of the Universe. Remarkably, this feature emerges not only for positive GUP parameter but also for negative GUP parameter. From the initial acceleration, we deduce that the negative GUP parameter is more preferable. We also obtain maximum Hubble parameter from the first Friedmann equation, indicating a universe without initial singularity. Moreover, we compute the Kretschmann curvature scalar, again indicating a non-singular universe. Interestingly, we find that GUP-modified Friedmann equations share some similarities with braneworld cosmolgy where the quadratic term in energy density appears. We also compute the deceleration parameter. Finally, we revisit the gravitational baryogenesis and show that the GUP-modified equipartition law of energy provides a mechanism for generating baryon asymmetry. Moreover, we constrain the GUP parameter from observations.</description>

      <title>Ten years of extreme gravity tests of general theory of relativity with gravitational-wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ten years ago, the first direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the merger of two black holes, GW150914, provided the very first opportunity to test Einstein's general theory of relativity (GR) in the extreme gravity regime, where the gravitational field is strong, characteristic speeds are highly relativistic, and spacetime is dynamical. Such a regime is currently accessible only through coalescing compact binaries. In this review, we summarize the status of testing GR with GW observations and discuss the lessons learned. We also touch upon the challenges we currently have in testing GR and the potential path forward to detect a credible violation of GR, should one exist in the data.</description>

      <title>Finite-Dimensional ZX-Calculus for Loop Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop quantum gravity (LQG) attempts to unify general relativity with quantum physics to offer a complete description of the universe by quantising spacetime geometry, but the numerical calculations we encounter are extraordinarily difficult. Progress has been made in the covariant formulation of LQG, but the tools do not carry over to the canonical formulation. These tools are graphical by nature, describing space with spin networks to make calculations in LQG more intuitive to the human hand.
  Recently, a new notation for working with spin networks has been used by arXiv:2412.20272 to offer the first accurate numerical results in canonical LQG by allowing the underlying graphs to change throughout the calculation, though they are forced to concede visual intuitiveness. In this thesis, we offer a more radical rephrasing of spin network calculations by translating them into the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus, extending previous attempts to translate into the standard (qubit) ZX-calculus (arXiv:2111.03114). Specifically, we derive the mixed-dimensional ZX-diagrams representing the generating objects of spin networks and the rules for the Penrose Spin Calculus (arXiv:2511.06012), and use these to present the ZX-form and correctness of "loop removal". We also derive the forms for several fundamental LQG objects in the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus for the first time. This gives us a high-level, intuitive graphical language that retains a flexibility to handle changing graph structures, and thus we argue positions the PSC as the new definitive language for canonical LQG.
  Furthermore, we investigate the possibility for a matrix-like normal form for spin networks deriving from a novel perspective of the PSC in terms of W-nodes.</description>

      <title>Grey-body Factors and Absorption Cross Sections of Non-Commutative Black Holes under Einstein-Coupled Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates scalar field perturbations coupled to the Einstein tensor of non-commutative black holes . We compute the grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections for different choices of the parameters using the partial wave method , and verify the latest correspondence between grey-body factors and quasinormal modes. The results show that larger values of the non-commutativity parameter $\theta$ and the coupling constant $\eta$ introduced in this model lead to smaller absorption cross-sections. Furthermore, we find that this correspondence is accurate for non-commutative black holes in the limit of large angular momentum quantum number $l$.</description>

      <title>Neutrino oscillations induced by a new bumblebee black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates neutrino propagation in the spacetime of a newly introduced black hole arising from spontaneous Lorentz-symmetry breaking in bumblebee gravity. The analysis focuses on three independent components: the rate at which neutrino-antineutrino annihilation deposits energy in the surrounding region, the geometric contribution to the phase accumulated by neutrino mass eigenstates, and the modifications to flavor conversion produced by weak gravitational lensing. Working with a two-flavor system, both mass orderings are examined, and the calculation incorporates the interference between distinct trajectories reaching the detector. The numerical results show that the Lorentz-violating deformation substantially increases the efficiency of the annihilation channel, produces characteristic shifts in the oscillation phase not present in earlier bumblebee configurations, and reshapes the angular dependence of the lensing-induced flavor transition pattern.</description>

      <title>Temperature definitions and phase transitions within non-minimal large and small inflationary potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore and compare two distinct temperature definitions for scalar field inflation in the context of small- and large-field potentials. The first is based on a real gas, fluid-like temperature, $T_{RG}$, while the second corresponds to a relativistic species-like temperature, $T_{RS}$. We derive the fundamental thermodynamic relations for both and analyze their implications for the most viable inflationary potentials, consistent with Planck constraints. We also investigate non-minimally coupled scenarios, finding that $T_{RS}$ is the most self-consistent choice, as it decreases during inflation, satisfies standard thermodynamic laws, and exhibits frame-independent behavior in both the Jordan and Einstein frames. Remarkably, the $T_{RS}$ approach shows that the inflaton's dynamics is well-described by Van der Waals-like isotherms, linking inflationary evolution to thermodynamic phase transitions. We find that the onset of inflation is associated with a phase transition acting as the ``trigger'' of the inflationary epoch. Our analysis highlights inconsistencies in the hilltop potential and, more generally, in small-field potentials unless a non-minimal coupling is introduced. Conversely, the Starobinsky and $\alpha$-attractor models emerge as the most suitable paradigms. We further show that \emph{frame independence} is achieved only for coupling values $\zeta \leq 1/6$, supporting very small values. Finally, our study of natural inflation with non-minimal coupling reveals a strong dependence on the coupling parameter, where bounds associated with thermodynamic phase transitions coincide with observationally viable ranges, suggesting that thermodynamic considerations may provide an additional criterion to discriminate among inflationary scenarios.</description>

      <title>Herglotz-type $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor in $f(R,T)$ gravity can be interpreted as an effective manifestation of dissipation. Motivated by this, we propose a new formulation of $f(R,T)$ gravity based on the Herglotz variational principle, which extends the usual {Hamilton} variational principle to dissipative systems by allowing the Lagrangian to depend explicitly on the action. The resulting gravitational field equations extend those of $f(R,T)$ gravity by including Herglotz contributions. In the Newtonian limit, these contributions modify the gravitational potential, allowing us to constrain the Herglotz vector through Mercury's perihelion precession and the relativistic light deflection. Remarkably, the Herglotz corrections lead to a scaling law consistent with observations from the Cassini spacecraft. Examining two representative cosmological models, the Herglotz vector effectively reduces to a single function that, under suitable conditions, can play the role of a cosmological constant, providing an alternative mechanism for the Universe's accelerated expansion. Within the Herglotz variational approach, the linear $f(R,T)=R+\alpha T$ model, previously ruled out in the standard formulation due to its fixed deceleration parameter, becomes consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Primordial non-Gaussianity in noncanonical warm inflation with nonminimal derivative coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents and investigates non-Gaussian perturbations for the warm k-inflation model that is driven by pure kinetic energy. The two complementary components of the overall non-Gaussianity are the three-point and four-point correlations. The intrinsic non-Gaussian component, denoted as the nonlinear parameter f_{NL}^{int}, is rooted in the three-point correlation for the inflaton field. Meanwhile, the \delta N part non-Gaussianity, denoted as f_{NL}^{\delta N}, is the contribution attributed to the four-point correlation function of the inflaton field. In this paper, the above two components in warm k-inflation are individually computed and analyzed. Then, comparisons and discussions between them are conducted, and the non-Gaussian theoretical results are compared with experimental observations to determine the range of model parameters within the allowable range of observation.</description>

      <title>Quantum corrections in general relativity explored through a GUP-inspired maximal acceleration analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A maximun acceleration analysis by Pati dating back to 1992 is here improved by replacing the traditional Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) with the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), which predicts the existence of a minimum length in Nature. This new approach allows one to find a numerical value for the maximum acceleration existing in Nature for a physical particle that turns out to be a_{max}\simeq4\frac{c^{2}}{l_{P}}, that is, a function of two fundamental physical quantities such as the speed of light c and the Planck length l_{p}. An application of this result to black hole (BH) physics allows one to estimate a new quantum limit to general relativity. It is indeed shown that, for every real Schwarzschild BH, the maximum gravitational acceleration occurs, without becoming infinite, when the Schwarzschild radial coordinate reaches the gravitational radius. This means that quantum corrections to general relativity become necessary not at the Planck scale, as the majority of researchers in the field think, but at the Schwarzschild scale, in agreement with recent interesting results in the literature. In other words, the quantum nature of physics, which in this case manifests itself through the GUP, appears to prohibit the existence of real singularities, in this current case forbiddiing the gravitational acceleration of a Schwarzschild BH from becoming infinite.</description>

      <title>k-inflation: Non-separable case meets ACT measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a non-separable subset of $k$-essence in which the kinetic and potential sectors interact through an $X^{\rho}V(\phi)$ coupling, implemented via a potential-dependent prefactor $f(\phi)=1+2\mathcal{K}V$. In slow roll, this structure preserves a constant sound speed $c_s^2=1/(2\rho-1)$ while modifying the Hubble flow in a controlled way, thereby shifting the inflationary observables relative to the separable template. For monomial potentials $V=A\phi^n$ (with $n=2$ and $n=2/3$ as representative cases) we derive closed analytic expressions for $n_s(N_\ast)$ and $r(N_\ast)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_{\rm mix}^2)$, where $\epsilon_{\rm mix}\propto\mathcal{K}$ encodes the non-separable $X^\rho V$ mixing, and we validate them against exact background integrations. The analytic and numerical predictions agree at the sub-per-mille level for $n_s$ and at the percent level for $r$, confirming the accuracy of the small-mixing expansion. For $\mathcal{K}&lt;0$ the mixing systematically lowers both $n_s$ and $r$ at fixed $N_\ast$, allowing otherwise marginal monomials to fall within the region favored by recent ACT+{\it Planck}+BAO constraints (P--ACT--LB). All solutions shown satisfy the health conditions $f(\phi)&gt;0$, $\rho&gt;\tfrac12$, and the positivity bound $V&lt;1/(2|\mathcal K|)$ (from $f&gt;0$). We also discuss parameter dependence and the expected equilateral-type non-Gaussianity, which remains comfortably within current bounds for the benchmarks considered.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Hysteresis of the Kerr black hole spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover a cascade of exceptional points (EPs) in the quasinormal mode spectrum of massive scalar perturbations of Kerr black holes, revealing an intricate non-Hermitian structure underlying their linear response. The cascade originates from a single damped mode that enters the extremal spectrum for sufficiently large field masses. We obtain evidence for an infinite sequence of EPs in the $(\ell,m)=(1,1)$ and $(2,2)$ sectors near the extremal limit, mediating the transition between damped and zero-damping modes. Each EP carries a geometric phase that enables adiabatic mode mixing across the entire overtone spectrum, a phenomenon we refer to as adiabatic ergodicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the higher spin wave functions in the embedding space of anti-de Sitter Lorentzian spacetime. These wave functions are built from a primary wave functions that has a simple structure expressed in terms of the special conformal generator vector fields in AdS. We compute the eigenvalue of the quadratic Casimir for the symmetric traceless states, and show explicitly that these satisfy the higher spin wave equation. We also demonstrate that these wave functions have the right structure in the flat space limit for massive higher spin fields, and can be used to construct $in$ and $out$ states for scattering processes. Spinning states that become massless in the flat limit are extremely subtle. The problem can be isolated to longitudinal polarizations.</description>

      <title>Holographic Constraints on the String Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that holography imposes strong and general constraints on scalar field potentials in the string landscape, determined by the asymptotic structure of the underlying spacetime. Applying these holographic consistency conditions, we identify broad classes of scalar potentials that are incompatible with a well-defined dual description. These include potentials with extended plateaus, excessively steep or shallow asymptotics, certain zero crossings, and specific alignments of stable AdS minima in moduli space. In particular, making the standard assumption that the CFT dual to a stable AdS vacuum must be realized as a worldvolume theory of a brane in string theory, we show that the brane selects an infinite-distance limit in moduli space where parametric scale separation is forbidden. Furthermore, the steepness and positivity of the potential are restricted in that infinite distance direction. We also find that requiring the validity of the effective theory in the future vacuum, a natural holographic criterion, automatically enforces the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) for classical cosmological solutions with positive potentials. Taken together, these constraints exclude the leading proposals to realize scale-separated AdS vacua and metastable de Sitter vacua in the string theory landscape such as DGKT and KKLT.</description>

      <title>How Bright in Gravitational Waves are Millisecond Pulsars for the Galactic Center GeV Gamma-Ray Excess? A Systematic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of dark matter (DM) is supported by various macroscopic observations, but its microscopic nature remains elusive. The Galactic Center GeV gamma-ray excess (GCE) has been a leading candidate signal for particle dark matter annihilation. However, an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the bulge provides the alternative explanation for the excess. Identifying these MSPs in electromagnetic bands is difficult due to source confusion, pulse broadening, and extinction. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a complementary probe: a steadily rotating, non-axisymmetric MSP emits a nearly monochromatic GW signal in the sensitive band of ground-based detectors, with amplitude set by its ellipticity. In this work, we systematically investigate the GW emission from the MSP population proposed to explain the GCE and its detectability with current and future detectors. We consider three major scenarios for the origin of ellipticity and model the population properties of these MSPs. We also consider both isolated MSPs and MSPs in binary systems, as well as Doppler effects in the detection. We find that while the signal is below the reach of current interferometers, next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) can detect a fraction of those MSPs, offering a novel test of the MSP interpretation of the GCE. Future directed searches toward the Galactic Center with continued improvements in sensitivities will either uncover this long-sought MSP population or place stringent limits on their ellipticities and abundance, with important implications for both the astrophysical and dark-matter interpretations of the GCE.</description>

      <title>A scattering perspective on gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves propagating across gravitational potentials undergo lensing effects that, in the wave-optics regime, manifest as frequency-dependent amplitude and phase modulations. In this work, we revisit the diffraction integral formalism of gravitational lensing and demonstrate that it admits a natural and transparent interpretation within the framework of scattering theory. We establish a direct correspondence between the lensing amplification factor and the scattering amplitude of waves propagating in curved spacetime, clarifying how familiar lensing limits map onto distinct scattering regimes. In particular, we show that the diffraction integral matches exactly the eikonal limit of the scattering amplitude at lowest post-Minkowskian order, after a change in coordinates and the inclusion of finite-distance effects. We further extend the standard formalism by including subleading corrections to the post-Minkowskian and eikonal approximations. Our results provide a unified theoretical framework for the interpretation of lensed gravitational-wave signals and open the way to more accurate waveform modeling for future lensed observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present observational constraints on large-scale white noise (LSWN) in the cosmic density field, a phenomenon predicted to arise from non-linear mode coupling during cosmological evolution. Building on the theoretical framework of Paper I, where we demonstrated that non-linearities inevitably redistribute power from small to large scales through mode mixing, we confront these predictions with current cosmological data. We modify the CLASS Boltzmann code to incorporate a white noise component $k_\mathrm{BH}/k$ in the primordial power spectrum and perform parameter estimation using current cosmological data. The non-detection of excess power on the largest observable scales places stringent upper bounds: $k_\mathrm{BH} \leq 1.80 \times 10^{-13}~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at 99\% confidence. These constraints imply the primordial power spectrum must deviate from perfect scale invariance on small scales, either through a cutoff at $k_{\mathrm{cut}} \lesssim 3~\mathrm{pc}^{-1}$ or through running of the spectral index with $\alpha_s \lesssim -0.015$. Our results demonstrate that LSWN provides a powerful probe of the primordial spectrum at scales orders of magnitude smaller than directly observable, offering unique constraints on early-universe physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The textbook N=1 supergravity has an F-term potential depending on a superpotential $W(z_i)$ and a Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$, with the scalar potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})=e^K (|DW|^2 - 3 |W|^2)$. In this approach, it is not always easy to find the potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ with the required properties. We show that in supergravity with a nilpotent superfield and with any Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i} )$ one can obtain any desired potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ by a proper choice of the Kahler metric of the nilpotent superfield. This construction is particularly suitable for cosmological and particle physics applications, which may require maximal freedom in the choice of kinetic terms and scalar potentials.</description>

      <title>Effects of New Forces on Scalar Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New long range forces acting on ordinary matter are highly constrained. However it is possible such forces act on dark matter, as it is less constrained observationally. In this work, we consider dark matter to be made of light bosons, such as axions. We introduce a mediator that communicates a new force between dark matter particles, in addition to gravity. The mediator is taken to be light, but not massless, so that it can affect small scale galactic behavior, but not current cosmological behavior. As a concrete application of this idea, we analyze the effects on scalar dark matter solitons bound by gravitation, i.e., boson stars, which have been claimed to potentially provide cores of galaxies. We numerically determine the soliton's profiles in the presence of this new force. We also extend the analysis to multiple mediators. We show that this new force alters the relation between core density and core radius in a way that can provide improvement in fitting data to observed galactic cores, but for couplings of order the gravitational strength, the improvement is only modest.</description>

      <title>Scattering of massive spin-2 field via graviton exchanges with different spin fields and the gravitational potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we compute the graviton mediated scattering amplitude of a massive spin-2 Fierz-Pauli field with various other massive spin fields, and in the non-relativistic limit, find out the corresponding two-body gravitational potentials. The massive spin-2 field does not represent gravity here. Instead, the theory of gravity is taken to be the usual massless general relativity, and the massive spin-2 field is taken as a test quantum field coupled to gravity via the standard minimal prescription. We first compute the tree level 2-2 scattering of a massive spin-2 field with massive scalar, spin-1, and spin-1/2 fields with one graviton exchanges. Leading Newton potential, as well as the subleading spin or polarisation dependent terms at ${\cal O}(G)$ have been computed. We also consider the next to the leading order (${\cal O}(G^2)$) scattering of the massive spin-2 field with a massive scalar, and demonstrate the spin independent, spherically symmetric leading part of the two body gravitational potential. The present paper could be considered as an attempt to compute the gravitational potential in the context of a higher spin field theory.</description>

      <title>Linearized $\mathcal{N}=2$ conformal supergravity in the harmonic approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the harmonic superspace approach we construct the superconformal harmonic action for $\mathcal{N}=2$ Weyl supermultiplet. The fundamental objects of the theory are unconstrained analytic potentials $h^{++\alpha\dot{\alpha}}, h^{++\alpha+}, h^{++\dot{\alpha}+}, h^{(+4)}$, which distinguishes our construction among the previously known ones. An important role is played by the ``half-analyticity'' conditions introduced in arxiv:2407.08524 [hep-th]. The structure of the harmonic linearized $\mathcal{N}=2$ Weyl action to large extent repeats the structure of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ Maxwell action, which suggests a conjecture on the possible structure of the complete nonlinear $\mathcal{N}=2$ Weyl theory action in the harmonic superspace. We also provide a detailed study of the rigid superconformal properties of the proposed action and prove its invariance in both harmonic and chiral superspaces.</description>

      <title>Towards a worldsheet theory of entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new action for entanglement entropy in the framework of the AdS$_{3}$/CFT$_{2}$ correspondence. This action is constructed directly from the entanglement entropy of the CFT$_{2}$, and we show that the Einstein equations of AdS$_{3}$ gravity can be derived from it. In the near-coincidence limit, using Riemann normal coordinates, the action reduces to a string worldsheet action in a curved background that naturally includes the symmetric spacetime metric, an antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field, and a dilaton. The Kalb-Ramond field gives rise to a string charge density, from which we demonstrate that bit threads can be exactly reproduced. This correspondence provides a clear physical interpretation of bit threads. Exploiting this correspondence, we establish explicit relations between the emergent string worldsheet and the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface, providing new insights into entanglement entropy. In particular, entanglement entropy can be computed from open string charge, while Bekenstein-Hawking entropy arises from closed string charge through open-closed string duality. These results suggest a unified picture in which the Susskind-Uglum conjecture, open-closed string duality, and the ER=EPR proposal emerge as equivalent manifestations of the same underlying principle. Finally, we propose a quantization of the RT surface, pointing to a possible connection with loop quantum gravity that refines Wall's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Dark energy after pre-recombination early dark energy in light of DESI DR2 and the latest ACT and SPT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been noted that with the pre-recombination early dark energy (EDE) resolution of Hubble tension, the preference of recent datasets for the evolving dark energy (DE) can be suppressed significantly. In this work, we clarify and reconfirm this result with DESI DR2 and the latest ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1, the tightest small-scale CMB constraints up to date. In the $w_0w_a$CDM model with EDE, a quintessence-like component ($w_0+w_a\geq-1$) can be 1$\sigma$ consistent with Planck+ACT+SPT+DESI+Pantheon+SH0ES datasets, and $\Delta\chi^2\lesssim -14$ compared with $w_0w_a$CDM model without EDE. This reveals the possibility that when the potential resolutions of Hubble tension are considered, current accelerated expansion can attribute to a canonical evolving scalar field or cosmological constant, and again highlights the importance of re-examining the nature of DE within the broader context of cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Domain walls in the scaling regime: Equal Time Correlator and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain walls are topological defects that may have formed in the early Universe through the spontaneous breakdown of discrete symmetries, and can be a strong source of gravitational waves (GWs). We perform 3D lattice field theory simulations with CosmoLattice, considering grid sizes $N = 1250$, $2048$ and $4096$, to study the dynamics of the domain wall network and its GW signatures. We first analyze how the network approaches the scaling regime with a constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ number of domain walls per Hubble volume, including setups with a large initial number of domains as expected in realistic scenarios, and find that scaling is always reached in a few Hubble times after the network formation. To better understand the properties of the scaling regime, we then numerically extract the Equal Time Correlator (ETC) of the energy-momentum tensor of the network, thus determining its characteristic shape for the case of domain walls, and verifying explicitly its functional dependence as predicted by scaling arguments. The ETC can be further extended to the Unequal Time Correlator (UTC) controlling the GW emission by making assumptions on the coherence of the source. By comparison with the actual GW spectrum evaluated by CosmoLattice, we are then able to infer the degree of coherence of the domain wall network. Finally, by performing numerical simulations in different background cosmologies, e.g. radiation domination and kination, we find evidence for a universal ETC at subhorizon scales and hence a universal shape of the GW spectrum in the UV, while the expansion history of the Universe may instead be determined by the IR features of the GW spectrum.</description>

      <title>Worldline EFT treatment of quadratic and cubic gravity theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores modifications to General Relativity (GR) by considering higher-order curvature terms in the gravitational action, specifically focusing on the quadratic Ricci scalar and a particular cubic contraction of the Riemann tensor. These modifications introduce new interactions at short distances, potentially altering the dynamics of compact objects. We calculate the effective two-body binding potential energy for these modified theories to quantify these effects using the worldline effective field theory (WEFT) formalism. This approach allows us to systematically integrate out short-distance gravitational effects, capturing the modifications to the binding potential. Our results demonstrate how the quadratic Ricci scalar and cubic Riemann tensor terms contribute to the two-body interaction at the leading order, highlighting deviations from classical GR predictions. These findings offer insight into the potential observational signatures of modified gravity theories in binary systems and other astrophysical settings.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting asteroid-mass primordial black holes in extreme mass-ratio inspirals with continuous gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, the existence of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) remains almost completely unconstrained and thus could still comprise the totality of dark matter (DM). In this paper, we show that standard searches for continuous gravitational waves -- long-lived, quasi-monochromatic signals -- could detect extreme mass-ratio inspirals of asteroid-mass PBHs in orbit around a stellar-mass companion using future gravitational-wave (GW) data from Einstein Telescope (ET) and the Neutron Star Extreme Matter Observatory (NEMO). We evaluate the robustness of our projected constraints against the eccentricity of the binary, the choice of the mass of the primary object, and the GW frequency range that we analyze. Furthermore, to determine whether there could be ways to detect asteroid-mass PBHs using current GW data, we quantify the impact of changes in current techniques on the sensitivity towards asteroid-mass PBHs. We show that methods that allow for signals with increased and more complicated frequency drifts over time could obtain much more stringent constraints now than those derived from standard techniques, though at slightly larger computational cost, potentially constraining the fraction of DM that certain asteroid-mass PBHs could compose to be less than one with current detectors.</description>

      <title>Partial tidal disruption of White Dwarfs in off-equatorial orbits around Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a suite of numerical simulations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics to study partial tidal disruption events (TDEs) of white dwarfs (WDs) in off-equatorial orbits in intermediate mass spinning (Kerr) black hole backgrounds. We carry out this analysis for both parabolic and eccentric WD orbits and also take into account possible initial WD spins. Our objective here is to quantify the differences in variables like the mass of the self-bound core, the peak fallback rate of debris and gravitational wave signature in off-equatorial orbits compared to equatorial ones. The analysis is carried out using a hybrid numerical scheme, one which involves integrating the exact Kerr geodesics while adopting a Newtonian formalism for the stellar fluid dynamics, justified by our choice of simulation parameters. We find that the physics of TDEs in off-equatorial orbits present several interesting and novel features due to black hole spin, which in some cases enhances when coupled with the rotation of the WD. However, numerical values of observable quantities in TDEs involving off-equatorial orbits cannot possibly distinguish between such orbits from equatorial ones. We further comment on the genericness of our results and argue that these should extend to a general TDE scenario involving a spinning BH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The black hole shadow is fundamentally connected to the structure of light rings and the photon region in the background geometry. We investigate the photon region boundary in a generic asymptotically flat, stationary, axisymmetric black hole spacetime that admits spherical photon orbits (SPOs). Explicit expressions possessing real solutions are provided for the photon region's boundary purely in terms of the background metric functions, independent of the photon's parameters like energy or angular momentum, which are applicable to both separable and non-separable spacetimes. We further analyze its common features, including overlap with the ergoregion and rotation sense of SPOs. Additionally, light rings are identified at the extrema of the photon region boundary curves in the $(r,\theta)$ plane. Our approach is validated against a few exact black hole solutions. Implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Tilt in quadratic gravity II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a tilted fluid component on a Bianchi V geometry in the theories of General Relativity (GR) and Quadratic Gravity (QG). The main objective of this work is the study of how the properties of matter can modify the future evolution of the attractors and their consequences on the regions of initial conditions of the solutions. As is well known, QG contains the Ruzmaikina-Ruzmaikin (RR) solution. This solution describes the slow-roll regime of Starobinsky's inflationary model, which is currently the best one due to the excellent agreement with Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) data. In QG, we found universes that can be attracted to the RR solution or recollapse toward the isotropic singularity attractor. If the Equation of State (EoS) parameter is ultra-radiative w&gt;1/3, the tilt variable increases both in RR and Milne for QG or GR, respectively. In both cases, the fluid expansion and acceleration diverge, while the vorticity initially increases and then decreases to zero.</description>

      <title>Dynamical theory for spherical black holes in modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a general algorithm to construct a Hamiltonian, such that its dynamical flow covariantly defines any given spherically symmetric and static metric. This Hamiltonian is defined as a linear combination of the standard (general relativistic) radial diffeomorphism constraint plus a Hamiltonian constraint that is appropriately deformed as compared to its corresponding form in general relativity though it does not include higher-derivative terms. Therefore, given a static model of spherical gravity, it is possible to obtain its Hamiltonian, and, thus, its canonical (second-order) equations of motion. A particularly relevant application of this construction is the study of regular black holes, where proposed geometries often lack an underlying dynamical theory. The present method provides such a theory. In particular, for a wide class of deformations of the Schwarzschild geometry, we explicitly obtain their corresponding Hamiltonian. This construction can be further used to covariantly couple matter. In this way, one can analyze the backreaction of matter fields on the geometry of interest, and, specifically, whether a particular black-hole model may emerge as the end state of a dynamical collapse.</description>

      <title>Creating a Universe from Nothing as an Alternative to the Cosmological Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the cosmological Robertson-Walker geometry required of the cosmological principle both the Weyl tensor $C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ and the Bach tensor $W^{\mu\nu}=[2\nabla_{\kappa}\nabla_{\lambda}-R_{\lambda\kappa}]C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ vanish. In general, in perturbations around the cosmological background neither of the fluctuating $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ or $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ would vanish. However, it is possible for $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ to vanish even as $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ does not. In this paper we construct an explicit model in which this is the case. The model consists of a 3-tensor gravitational wave
  fluctuating around a background with a constant negative 3-curvature. The model is exactly solvable and consists purely of geometric quantities with no matter fields at all (i.e., $G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $W^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta W^{\mu\nu}=0$, where $G^{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor). The model can thus be created out of nothing, with creating a universe from nothing thus being an alternative principle to the cosmological principle. The fluctuating gravitational wave contributes to the temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background and its $B$ mode polarization in a calculable manner, one for which we provide a simple analytic way of treating spatial modes that is based on the use of a spatial mode addition theorem. In addition, we provide a treatment of the anisotropy that is based on properties of bandwidth limited functions. Classically by ``nothing" we mean that there are no $T^{\mu\nu}$ or $\delta T^{\mu\nu}$ matter field terms. Quantum-mechanically by ``nothing" we mean that all fields other than the gravitational field are in a negative energy mode vacuum state, with the only occupied positive energy modes being graviton modes. As well as use the Bach tensor as a diagnostic, we consider dynamics based on it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate heat propagation in rigidly rotating bodies within the theory of general relativity. Using a first-order gradient expansion, we derive a universal partial differential equation governing the temperature evolution. This equation is hyperbolic, causal, and stable, and it naturally accounts for both rotational and gravitational Tolman-Ehrenfest effects. Any other first-order theory consistent with established physics (including the parabolic theories used in neutron star cooling models) must be equivalent to our formulation within an error that is of higher order in gradients. As a case study, we analyze heat transfer in solid cylinders rotating around their symmetry axis, so that the tangential speed approaches the speed of light on the surface. We also compute the relativistic rotational corrections to the cooling law of black bodies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider gravitational collapse of a fluid sphere with torsion generated by spin, which forms a black hole. We use the Tolman metric and the Einstein$-$Cartan field equations with a relativistic spin fluid as a source. We show that gravitational repulsion of torsion prevents a singularity, replacing it with a nonsingular bounce. Quantum particle creation during contraction prevents shear from overcoming torsion. Particle creation during expansion can generate a finite period of inflation and produce large amounts of matter. The resulting closed universe on the other side of the event horizon may have several bounces. Such a universe is oscillatory, with each cycle larger than the preceding cycle, until it reaches a size at which dark energy dominates and expands indefinitely. Our Universe might have therefore originated from a black hole existing in another universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a general class of spacetime metrics that mimic the properties of black holes without possessing a true event horizon. These metrics are constrained by the requirements of being singularity-free and geodesically complete. Specifically, we study metrics that do not possess $Z_2$ symmetry and may deviate slightly or significantly from the symmetric case. Focusing on scalar perturbations propagating on such backgrounds, we analyze the resulting effective radial potentials and their dependence on different corners of the mimicker landscape. We further investigate the corresponding quasinormal modes and explore their characteristic features. Finally, we survey the landscape for potential observational signatures, including shadow properties and the possible presence or absence of echo effects.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulation is a rapidly evolving tool with great potential for research at the frontiers of physics, and is particularly suited to be used in computationally intensive lattice simulations, such as problems with non-equilibrium. In this work, a basic scenario, namely free fermions in an expanding universe, is considered and quantum simulations are used to perform the evolution and study the phenomena involved. Using digital quantum simulations with the Jordan-Wigner transformation and Trotter expansion, the evolutions of fermion number density, correlation functions, polarization, and chiral condensation are analyzed. A spread out phenomenon can be observed in the simulation, which is a consequence of momentum redshift. This work also demonstrates the simplicity and convenience of using quantum simulations when studying time-evolution problems.</description>

      <title>Did DESI DR2 truly reveal dynamical dark energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in cosmology is whether dark energy evolves over time, a topic that has gained prominence since the discovery of cosmic acceleration. Recently, the DESI collaboration has reported increasing evidence for evolving dark energy using combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN), and their new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). However, our analysis reveals that these combinations are problematic due to clear tensions among the CMB, BAO and SN datasets. Consequently, DESI's claim of dynamical dark energy (DDE) is not robust. A more reliable approach involves constraining the evolution of dark energy using each dataset independently. Through a statistical comparison for each dataset, on average, we find that DDE is strongly preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model. This suggests that DDE likely exists, although its real parameter space remains elusive due to weak constraints on the dark energy equation of state and inconsistencies among the datasets. Interestingly, when considering DDE, none of the individual datasets -- including CMB, DESI DR2, Pantheon+, Union3, and DESY5 -- can independently detect cosmic acceleration at a significant level. Our findings not only clarify the current understanding of the nature of dark energy but also challenge the established discovery of cosmic acceleration and the long-held notion that dark energy exerts negative pressure. Both individual and combined datasets suggest that the ultimate fate of the universe is likely to be dominated by matter rather than dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15291v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether gravity must be quantized remains one of the biggest open problems in fundamental physics. Classical-quantum hybrid theories have recently attracted attention as a possible framework in which gravity is treated classically yet interacts consistently with quantum matter. Schemes based on completely positive dynamics satisfy most formal consistency requirements and enable a systematic treatment of quantum backreaction, but they also give rise to features that challenge conventional physical intuition, such as the breakdown of conservation laws. To illustrate this issue, we consider a qubit interacting with a classical particle and demonstrate that the corresponding hybrid system violates angular momentum conservation despite rotational symmetry of the underlying equations of motion. This provides an explicit example of a fully closed, rotationally invariant classical-quantum system with completely positive dynamics that violates a conservation law.</description>

Abstract: We construct a consistent three-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory as a vector-tensor theory within the generalized Proca class by employing a regularization procedure based on the Weyl geometry, which was introduced recently in \link{2504.13084}. We then obtain an asymptotically AdS$_3$, static, and circularly symmetric black hole solution with primary Proca hair. Afterward, we investigate the effect of the scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet coupling constructed previously by different regularization schemes. We further generalize these solutions by incorporating an electric charge. As special cases, we find a regular black hole solution in addition to charged and uncharged stealth BTZ black hole solutions.</description>

Abstract: The expansion history of the Universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) remains largely unconstrained. The high-energy post-inflationary era may involve multiple distinct epochs, each characterized by a different equation of state (EoS). A key prediction of inflation is the generation of tensor perturbations that later manifest as a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The large-scale amplitude and small-scale spectral tilt ($n_{\rm GW}$) of these GWs encode the inflationary energy scale and the subsequent expansion history, respectively. A soft post-inflationary EoS ($w&lt;1/3$) yields red-tilted GW spectra ($n_{\rm GW}&lt;0$), while a stiff EoS ($w&gt;1/3$) results in a blue-tilt ($n_{\rm GW}&gt;0$). In our previous work [arXiv:2407.07956], we developed an analytical framework for computing the GW spectral energy density, $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$, for multiple post-inflationary transitions ($w_1 \to w_2 \to \cdots \to w_n \to 1/3$), focusing on the parameter space relevant for future GW observations. In this paper, we extend that framework to systematically investigate the $morphological~diversity$ of inflationary GW spectra generated by multi-epoch post-inflationary histories. Remaining model agnostic, we demonstrate that a wide variety of spectral shapes, ranging from convex and concave monotonic profiles to multi-peaked non-monotonic spectra, can naturally emerge depending on the sequence and duration of these epochs. We also introduce GWInSpect, a publicly available Python package that computes $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$ for arbitrary sequences of EoS transitions, providing a practical tool to study the pre-BBN expansion history of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Invariant Entire-Function Regulators and UV Finiteness in NonLocal Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We clarify the status of gauge-invariant entire-function regulators in NonLocal Quantum Field Theory. The regulator is implemented as an entire function of the covariant Laplace--Beltrami operator. Working in the background-field formalism and expanding around flat, trivial backgrounds, we show that plane waves diagonalize the d'Alembertian, so that the entire function reduces to a multiplicative form factor in Minkowski momentum space. After Wick rotation, to the Euclidean axis, producing exponential ultraviolet damping in loop integrals without introducing additional poles or branch cuts. Our analysis provides a concise, gauge-covariant justification for the use of entire-function regulators in nonlocal quantum field theory.</description>
