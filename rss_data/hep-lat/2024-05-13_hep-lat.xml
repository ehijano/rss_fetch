      <title>Primitive Quantum Gates for an SU(3) Discrete Subgroup: $\Sigma(36\times3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the primitive gate set for the digital quantum simulation of the 108-element $\Sigma(36\times3)$ group. This is the first time a nonabelian crystal-like subgroup of $SU(3)$ has been constructed for quantum simulation. The gauge link registers and necessary primitives -- the inversion gate, the group multiplication gate, the trace gate, and the $\Sigma(36\times3)$ Fourier transform -- are presented for both an eight-qubit encoding and a heterogeneous three-qutrit plus two-qubit register. For the latter, a specialized compiler was developed for decomposing arbitrary unitaries onto this architecture.</description>

      <title>Updates on inclusive charmed and bottomed meson decays from the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of lattice QCD in recent years, a determination of decay rates for inclusive semileptonic decays from lattice correlators now seems viable. We report on the calculation of the inclusive semileptonic decay of the $D_s$ meson on the lattice. We simulate the $D_s \rightarrow X_s\ell\nu_\ell$ process with M\"obius domain-wall charm and strange quarks, whose masses were approximately tuned to the physical values. We cover the whole kinematical region. We present a general overview on how the inclusive decays are treated on the lattice and discuss ongoing challenges, such as the estimation of systematic errors and future prospects of the project.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing generalised parton distributions from the lattice off-forward Compton amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a determination of the structure functions of the off-forward Compton amplitude $\mathcal{H}_1$ and $\mathcal{E}_1$ from the Feynman-Hellmann method in lattice QCD. At leading twist, these structure functions give access to the generalised parton distributions (GPDs) $H$ and $E$, respectively. This calculation is performed for an unphysical pion mass of $m_{\pi}=412\;\text{MeV}$ and four values of the soft momentum transfer, $t\approx 0, -0.3, -0.6, -1.1\;\text{GeV}^2$, all at a hard momentum scale of $\bar{Q}^2\approx 5\;\text{GeV}^2$. Using these results, we test various methods to determine properties of the real-time scattering amplitudes and GPDs: (1) we fit their Mellin moments, and (2) we use a simple GPD ansatz to reconstruct the entire distribution. Our final results show promising agreement with phenomenology and other lattice results, and highlight specific systematics in need of control.</description>

      <title>Scattering of dark pions in Sp(4) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzes of astrophysical data provide first hints on the self-interactions of dark matter at low energies. Lattice calculations of dark matter theories can be used to investigate them, especially in the case of strongly-interacting dark matter. We consider Sp(4) gauge theory with two fundamental fermions as a candidate theory. We compute the scattering phase shift for the scattering of two identical dark pions and determine the parameters of the effective range expansion. Our exploratory results in the supposedly most common interaction channel provide a lower limit for the dark matter mass when compared to astrophysical data. We also provide first benchmarks of velocity-weighted cross-sections in the relevant non-relativistic domain.</description>

      <title>Steady electric currents in magnetized QCD and their use for the equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the emergence of steady electric currents in QCD as a response to a non-uniform magnetic background using lattice simulations with 2 + 1 quark flavors at the physical point, as well as leading-order chiral perturbation theory. Using these currents, we develop a novel method to determine the leading-order coefficient of the equation of state in a magnetic field expansion: the magnetic susceptibility of the QCD medium. We decompose the current expectation value into valence- and sea-quark contributions and demonstrate that the dominant contribution to the electric current is captured by the valence term alone, allowing for a comparably cheap determination of the susceptibility. Our continuum extrapolated lattice results for the equation of state confirm the findings of some of the existing studies in the literature, namely that the QCD medium behaves diamagnetically at low and paramagnetically at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Automatic Structural Search of Tensor Network States including Entanglement Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network (TN) states, including entanglement renormalization (ER), can encompass a wider variety of entangled states. When the entanglement structure of the quantum state of interest is non-uniform in real space, accurately representing the state with a limited number of degrees of freedom hinges on appropriately configuring the TN to align with the entanglement pattern. However, a proposal has yet to show a structural search of ER due to its high computational cost and the lack of flexibility in its algorithm. In this study, we conducted an optimal structural search of TN, including ER, based on the reconstruction of their local structures with respect to variational energy. Firstly, we demonstrated that our algorithm for the spin-$1/2$ tetramer singlets model could calculate exact ground energy using the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) structure as an initial TN structure. Subsequently, we applied our algorithm to the random XY models with the two initial structures: MERA and the suitable structure underlying the strong disordered renormalization group. We found that, in both cases, our algorithm achieves improvements in variational energy, fidelity, and entanglement entropy. The degree of improvement in these quantities is superior in the latter case compared to the former, suggesting that utilizing an existing TN design method as a preprocessing step is important for maximizing our algorithm's performance.</description>

      <title>SO(5) multicriticality in two-dimensional quantum magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve the nature of the quantum phase transition between a N\'eel antiferromagnet and a valence-bond solid in two-dimensional spin-1/2 magnets. We study a class of $J$-$Q$ models, in which Heisenberg exchange $J$ competes with interactions $Q_n$ formed by products of $n$ singlet projectors on adjacent parallel lattice links. QMC simulations provide unambiguous evidence for first-order transitions, with the discontinuities increasing with $n$. For $n=2$ and $n=3$ models, the first-order signatures are very weak. On intermediate length scales, we extract well-defined scaling dimensions (critical exponents) that are common to the models with small $n$, indicating proximity to a quantum critical point. By combining two $Q$ terms, the transition can be tuned from weak to more strongly first-order. The two coexisting orders on the first-order line scale with a large exponent $\beta \approx 0.85$. This exponent and others are close to bounds for an SO($5$) symmetric CFT with a relevant SO($5$) singlet. We characterize the emergent SO($5$) symmetry by the scaling dimensions of its leading irrelevant perturbations. The large $\beta$ value and a large correlation length exponent, $\nu \approx 1.4$, partially explain why the transition remains near-critical even quite far away from the critical point and in many different models without fine-tuning. In addition, we find that few-spin lattice operators are dominated by the SO($5$) violating field (the traceless symmetric tensor), and interactions involving many spins are required to observe strong effects of the relevant SO($5$) singlet. The exponent that had previously been identified with the divergent correlation length when crossing between the two phases does not have a corresponding CFT operator. We explain this emergent pseudocritical scale by a mechanism relying on a dangerously irrelevant SO($5$) perturbation.</description>

      <title>Steps Toward Quantum Simulations of Hadronization and Energy-Loss in Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of particles in dense matter using quantum computers is developed. As a demonstration, we perform classical simulations of heavy-hadrons propagating through a dense medium in the Schwinger model. Measurements of the time-dependent energy and charge density are used to identify mechanisms responsible for energy loss and hadron production (hadronization). A study of entanglement dynamics highlights the importance of quantum coherence between the particles that make up the dense medium. Throughout this work, care is taken to isolate, and remove, phenomena that arise solely from a finite lattice spacing. It is found that signatures of entanglement are more sensitive to lattice artifacts than other observables. Toward quantum simulations, we present an efficient method and the corresponding quantum circuits for preparing ground states in the presence of heavy mesons. These circuits are used to estimate the resources required to simulate in-medium energy loss and hadronization in the Schwinger model using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>The $\theta$-dependence of the Yang-Mills spectrum from analytic continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $\theta$-dependence of the string tension and of the lightest glueball mass in four-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills theories. More precisely, we focus on the coefficients parametrizing the $\mathcal{O}(\theta^2)$ dependence of these quantities, which we investigate by means of numerical simulations of the lattice-discretized theory, carried out using imaginary values of the $\theta$ parameter. Topological freezing at large $N$ is avoided using the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions algorithm. We provide controlled continuum extrapolations of such coefficients in the $N=3$ case, and we report the results obtained on two fairly fine lattice spacings for $N=6$.</description>

      <title>Scalable, ab initio protocol for quantum simulating SU($N$)$\times$U(1) Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a protocol for the scalable quantum simulation of SU($N$)$\times$U(1) lattice gauge theories with alkaline-earth like atoms in optical lattices in both one- and two-dimensional systems. The protocol exploits the combination of naturally occurring SU($N$) pseudo-spin symmetry and strong inter-orbital interactions that is unique to such atomic species. A detailed ab initio study of the microscopic dynamics shows how gauge invariance emerges in an accessible parameter regime, and allows us to identify the main challenges in the simulation of such theories. We provide quantitative results about the requirements in terms of experimental stability in relation to observing gauge invariant dynamics, a key element for a deeper analysis on the functioning of such class of theories in both quantum simulators and computers.</description>

      <title>Nucleon resonance parameters from Roy-Steiner equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A reliable determination of the pole parameters and residues of nucleon resonances is notoriously challenging, given the required analytic continuation into the complex plane. We provide a comprehensive analysis of such resonance parameters accessible with Roy-Steiner equations for pion-nucleon scattering - a set of partial-wave dispersion relations that combines the constraints from analyticity, unitarity, and crossing symmetry - most prominently of the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance. Further, we study the Roper, $N(1440)$, resonance, which lies beyond the strict domain of validity, in comparison to Pad\'e approximants, comment on the role of subthreshold singularities in the $S$-wave, and determine the residues of the $f_0(500)$, $\rho(770)$, and $f_0(980)$ resonances in the $t$-channel process $\pi\pi\to\bar NN$. The latter allows us to test - for the first time fully model independently in terms of the respective residues - universality of the $\rho(770)$ couplings and the Goldberger-Treiman relation expected if the scalars behaved as dilatons, in both cases revealing large deviations from the narrow-resonance limit.</description>

      <title>Transversity generalized parton distributions in spin-3/2 particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The definitions of the quark and gluon transversity generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in spin-3/2 particles are obtained in the light-cone gauge. It is found that they contain 16 independent components for each parton. Their even or odd property is found in terms of skewness variable, and the odd transversity GPDs vanish in the forward limit. There are 16 amplitudes with helicity flip of quark or gluon. We conclude that all the amplitudes, unpolarized, polarized, and transversity amplitudes, have a common factor $F(\zeta)$ carrying all the complex part. Here, the variable $\zeta$ is the helicity difference $\zeta=(\lambda' -\lambda)-(\mu' - \mu)$ for the amplitude $\mathcal{A}_{\lambda' \mu',\lambda\mu}$. This kinematical factor is associated with the transfer of the orbital angular momentum in the quark- and gluon-spin-3/2 particle scattering amplitudes. We also derive another main physical quantity, transversity distribution, from the transversity GPDs in the forward limit for the spin-3/2 particles.</description>
