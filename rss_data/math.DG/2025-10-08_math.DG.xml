      <title>Prescribed $p$-curvature problem on Riemannian manifolds with negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(N,g)$ be a compact Riemannian manifold with negative curvature of dimension $n\geq 3$. This paper investigates the prescribed curvature problem defined by the $p$-fold sum of the modified Shouten tensor for $1\leq p\leq n$. As an application, we establish the existence of a metric $\tilde{g}$ conformal to $g$ such that \[ \mathcal{M}_{p}(\mathrm{Ric}_{\tilde{g}})=constant. \] In the case $p=1$, this resolves a well-known result of Gursky and Viaclovsky [Indiana Univ. Math. J. 52 (2003), no. 2, 399--419 MR1976082].</description>

      <title>K\"ahlerness of compact Hermitian surfaces under semi-definite Strominger-Bismut-Ricci curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a compact Hermitian surface is K\"ahler under certain non-positivity or non-negativity conditions on Strominger-Bismut-Ricci curvatures. The key tools for achieve these results are new Ricci curvature and Chern number identities for the Strominger-Bismut connection. This work complements and extends earlier results of Yang.</description>

      <title>Volume growth and asymptotic cones of manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an open (i.e. complete and noncompact) manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature. In this paper, we study whether the volume growth order of $M$ is always greater than or equal to the dimension of some (or every) asymptotic cone of $M$.
  Our first main result asserts that, under the conic at infinity condition, if the infimum of the volume growth order of $M$ equals $k$, then there exists an asymptotic cone of $M$ whose upper box dimension is at most $k$. In particular, this yields a complete affirmative answer to our problem in the setting of nonnegative sectional curvature.
  In the subsequent part of the paper, we extend or partially extend Sormani's results concerning $M$ with linear volume growth to more relaxed volume growth conditions. Our approach also allows us to present a new proof of Sormani's sublinear diameter growth theorem for open manifolds with $\mathrm{Ric}\geq 0$ and linear volume growth.
  Finally, we construct an example of an open $n$-manifold $M$ with $\mathrm{sec}_M\geq0$ whose volume growth order oscillates between 1 and $n$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the CR Yamabe type equation \begin{align}
  \Delta_b u+F(u)=0 \nonumber
  \end{align} on complete noncompact $(2n+1)$-dimensional Sasakian manifolds with nonnegative curvature. Under some assumptions, we prove a rigidity result, that is, the manifold is CR isometric to Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$. The proofs are based on the Jerison-Lee's differential identity combining with integral estimates.</description>

      <title>Stability of asymptotically conical gradient K\"ahler-Ricci expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a perturbation of an asymptotically conical gradient expanding K\"ahler-Ricci soliton metric $g$ in the same K\"ahler class. We demonstrate that, under suitable assumptions, the normalized K\"ahler-Ricci flow starting from the initial perturbed metric exists for all time and converges uniformly to an asymptotically conical gradient expanding K\"ahler-Ricci soliton metric $g_\infty$. Moreover, if the perturbed initial metric is asymptotic to $g$ at spatial infinity, then the limiting metric coincides with the original soliton, that is, $g_\infty = g$.</description>

      <title>Some results on evolutoids of convex curves in $2$-dimensional space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M_c$ be a $2$-dimensional space form of constant curvature $c=-1,0,1$ and $\gamma$ a smooth, closed, convex curve in $M_c$. We explicitly parametrize the \textit{$\alpha$-evolutoid} of $\gamma$, i.e.\ the closed curve $\gamma_\alpha$ describing the envelope of all geodesics $\sigma_s=\sigma_s(t)$ such that $\sigma_s(0)=\gamma(s)$ and $\sphericalangle(\sigma_s'(0),\gamma'(s))=\alpha$, with $\alpha\in[0,\pi/2]$ fixed and determine its lenght. Also, we deduce that for each $s$ the points $\gamma(s),\gamma_\alpha(s),\gamma_{\pi/2}(s)$ belong to a distinct geodesic circle. A constraint for the smoothness of $\gamma_\alpha$ is calculated and, using tools from singularity theory, we prove that its singularities present cuspidal features, which mimics the classical evolute ($\alpha=\pi/2$) in the plane case. Also, we define the \textit{$\alpha$-involutoids} of a given curve $\eta$ in $M_c$ to be any curve $\gamma$ in $M_c$ such that $\gamma_\alpha=\eta$ and study some of its properties. In particular, we prove that any convex, closed curve in $M_{-1,0}$ has associated to itself exactly one closed $\alpha$-involutoid. Finally, we show that the evolutoids can be seen as singular sets of wavefronts.</description>

      <title>Some rigidity results for static three-manifolds with boundary and positive scalar curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies three-dimensional compact static manifolds with boundary and positive scalar curvature. We prove that, under a suitable bound on the Ricci curvature, the orientable quotient of the Nariai static manifold with boundary $Nar_{-1,1}(\mathbb S^2)$ is the only such manifold with connected boundary, provided that the zero-level set of the potential is connected and does not intersect the boundary. We also establish a rigidity theorem for the upper hemisphere with the standard static potential, in the spirit of Cruz and Nunes.</description>

      <title>On the Bergman metric of Cartan-Hartogs domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Bergman metric and introduce the Bergman dual on Cartan-Hartogs (CH) domains. For a bounded domain D in C^n with Bergman kernel K_D, we define the Bergman dual of (D, g_D) as (D*, g_D*), where D* is the maximal domain on which the modified kernel K_D*(z, zbar) = K_D(z, -zbar) is positive, and g_D* is the Kahler metric obtained from K_D*. For a Cartan-Hartogs domain M_{Omega, mu} we prove the equivalence of: (i) M_{Omega, mu} is biholomorphic to the unit ball; (ii) its Bergman metric is a Kahler-Ricci soliton; (iii) after rescaling by a constant factor, the Bergman dual is finitely projectively induced. Conditions (i) and (ii) are Bergman-metric analogues of classical rigidity for Kahler-Einstein metrics (related to Yau's problem and Cheng's conjecture) and to recent rigidity for Kahler-Ricci solitons. Condition (iii) emphasizes the duality viewpoint, inspired by bounded symmetric domains and their compact duals. We also compare our results with other canonical metrics on CH domains, namely g_{Omega, mu} and hat g_{Omega, mu}, and discuss open problems about the maximal domain on which the Bergman dual is defined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct a three--parameter family of asymptotically flat Einstein--Maxwell instantons. These solutions are toric, regular, and free of conical and orbifold singularities on the manifold $M=\CP^2\setminus S^1$. They are counterexamples to the Euclidean Einstein--Maxwell Black Hole Uniqueness Conjecture. In the case of vanishing charge these instantons reduce to the Chen--Teo Ricci flat instantons.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness in Mean Curvature Flow: Non-canonical solutions via the parabolic Allen--Cahn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When mean curvature flow evolves non-uniquely, the flow is said to fatten. The work of Ilmanen shows that any weak MCF is supported inside the fattening, and work of Hershkovits--White identified canonical weak flows supported on the boundary of the fattening, known as the outermost flows. It is natural to ask, when the flow fattens, are there weak mean curvature flows supported strictly inside the fattening? Outside of some special cases (e.g. flow from cones), this question was entirely open. We show these interior flows exist, providing a general construction for non-outermost flows as limits of solutions to the parabolic $\varepsilon$-Allen--Cahn. This gives the first examples of closed, non-trivial, non-canonical, integral Brakke motions. As part of this construction, we study the $\varepsilon$-Allen--Cahn flow from low regularity initial data, and our results demonstrate the existence of integral Brakke motions from fractal sets. This includes the existence portion of Hershkovits's work on mean curvature flow from Reifenberg sets.</description>

Abstract: We showed that a sequence of ALH*-gravitational instantons from pairs consisting of a weak del Pezzo surface and a smooth anti-canonical divisor towards a large complex structure limit introduced by Collins, Jacobs and the first author collapsing to a punctured plane with a special Kahler metric, which can be viewed as a non-compact version of the collapsing result of Gross-Wilson. We provide a partial compactification of the moduli space of pointed ALH*-gravitational instantons with respect to the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff topology and locally is a polyhedron complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08619v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a compact manifold with boundary, the map consisting of the scalar curvature in the interior and the mean curvature on the boundary is a local surjection at generic metrics. We prove that this result may be localized to compact subdomains in an arbitrary Riemannian manifold with boundary. This result is a generalization of Corvino's result about localized scalar curvature deformations; however, the existence part needs to be handled delicately since the problem is non-variational. We also briefly discuss generic conditions that guarantee localized deformations, and some related geometric properties.</description>

Abstract: Bamler--Kleiner recently proved a multiplicity-one theorem for mean curvature flow in R^3 and combined it with the authors' work on generic mean curvature flows to fully resolve Huisken's genericity conjecture. In this paper we show that a short density-drop theorem plus the Bamler--Kleiner multiplicity-one theorem for tangent flows at the first nongeneric singular time suffice to resolve Huisken's conjecture -- without relying on the strict genus drop theorem for one-sided ancient flows previously established by the authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a CMC hypersurface with an isolated singular point at which the tangent cone is regular, and such that, in a neighbourhood of said point, the hypersurface is the boundary of a Caccioppoli set that minimises the standard prescribed-mean-curvature functional. We prove that in a ball centred at the singularity there exists a sequence of smooth CMC hypersurfaces, with the same prescribed mean curvature, that converge to the given one. Moreover, these hypersurfaces arise as boundaries of minimisers. In ambient dimension $8$ the condition on the cone is redundant. (When the mean curvature vanishes identically, the result is the well-known Hardt--Simon approximation theorem.)</description>

Abstract: We establish a Mittag-Leffler-type theorem with approximation and interpolation for meromorphic curves $M\to \mathbb{C}^n$ ($n\geq 3$) directed by Oka cones in $\mathbb{C}^n$ on any open Riemann surface $M$. We derive a result of the same type for proper conformal minimal immersions $M\to \mathbb{R}^n$. This includes interpolation in the poles and approximation by embeddings, the latter if $n\ge 5$ in the case of minimal surfaces. As applications, we show that complete minimal ends of finite total curvature in $\mathbb{R}^5$ are generically embedded, and characterize those open Riemann surfaces which are the complex structure of a proper minimal surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ of weak finite total curvature.</description>

      <title>Curvature pinching of asymptotically conical gradient expanding Ricci solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the well-known work of Hamilton [62] and Ivey [64], the Hamilton-Ivey curvature pinching and its generalizations have become a signature feature of gradient shrinking and steady Ricci solitons, and more generally, of ancient solutions to the Ricci flow. However, analogous results for gradient expanding Ricci solitons have remained elusive. This is largely due to the fact that the proofs of existing curvature pinching estimates crucially rely on shrinking and steady solitons being ancient, a property not shared by gradient Ricci expanders. In this paper, we investigate curvature pinching phenomena in non-compact asymptotically conical gradient expanding Ricci solitons and establish several Hamilton-Ivey type curvature pinching estimates. These results are parallel to those known for shrinking and steady Ricci solitons. In particular, we prove a three-dimensional Hamilton-Ivey type curvature pinching theorem: any three-dimensional non-compact gradient Ricci expander, which is asymptotic to a cone with positive scalar curvature, must have positive sectional curvature. As an application, we combine our result with that of Deruelle [51] to establish a uniqueness theorem for three-dimensional asymptotically conical expanders with positive scalar curvature.
  Furthermore, we formulate a general proof method and apply it to obtain analogues of several additional known generalized Hamilton-Ivey type curvature pinching results for ancient solutions. Among these is a curvature pinching estimate for four-dimensional asymptotically conical Ricci expanders with uniformly positive isotropic curvature, analogous to a result for four-dimensional gradient steady solitons due to Brendle [7].</description>

      <title>Linearization in incompatible elasticity for general ambient spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08041v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interest in elastic problems in which the target space is non-Euclidean, we study a limit where local rest distances within an elastic body are incompatible, yet close to, distances within the ambient space. Specifically, we obtain, via $\Gamma$-convergence, a limit elastic model for a sequence of elastic bodies $(M,g_\varepsilon)$ in an ambient space $(S,s)$, for Riemannian metrics $g_\varepsilon$ and $s$ such that $g_\varepsilon \to s$. Furthermore, we relate the minimum of the limit problem to a linearized curvature discrepancy between $g_\varepsilon$ and $s$, using recent results of Kupferman and Leder. This relation confirms a linearized version of a long-standing conjecture in elasticity regarding the relation between the elastic energy and the curvature of the underlying space. The main technical challenge, compared to other linearization results in elasticity, is obtaining the correct notion of displacement for manifold-valued configurations, using Sobolev truncations and parallel transport. We show that the associated compactness result is obtained if $(S,s)$ satisfies a quantitative rigidity property, analogous to the Friesecke--James--M\"uller rigidity estimate in Euclidean space, and show that this property holds when $(S,s)$ is a round sphere.</description>

      <title>On material-uniform elastic bodies with disclinations and their homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we define material-uniform hyperelastic bodies (in the sense of Noll) containing discrete disclinations and dislocations, and study their properties. We show in a rigorous way that the size of a disclination is limited by the symmetries of the constitutive relation; in particular, if the symmetry group of the body is discrete, it cannot admit arbitrarily small, yet non-zero, disclinations. We then discuss the application of these observations to the derivations of models of bodies with continuously-distributed defects.</description>

      <title>Topological Kleene Field Theories as a model of computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish the foundations of a computational field theory, which we term Topological Kleene Field Theory (TKFT), inspired by Stephen Kleene's seminal work on partial recursive functions and drawing parallels with Topological Field Theory. Our central result shows that any computable function can be simulated by the flow on a smooth bordism of a vector field with good local properties, setting an alternative model of computation to Turing machines. We thus establish that a computable function can be fully realized within a single go of a dynamical system, differing from previous works where computation is encoded as an iterative process. The output of the computable function emerges directly, laying the groundwork for potential applications that accelerate the physical realization of computation.</description>

      <title>Charges, complex structures, and perturbations of instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main result of this paper is that infinitesimal rigidity of the moduli space for Hermitian gravitational instantons holds. An important step in the proof is to show that, provided certain boundary conditions hold, a curve of Riemannian metrics passing through a Hermitian non-K\"ahler Einstein metric is conformally K\"ahler to second perturbative order. This uses ideas of Wu and LeBrun. Hermitian non-K\"ahler Einstein 4-manifolds have a quasi-locally conserved charge, which is shown to correspond to a parameter of the moduli space. This charge is evaluated for all explicitly known examples. It follows from the proof of our main theorem that infinitesimal Einstein deformations admit a closed 2-form that measures the perturbation in the moduli parameter.</description>

      <title>A new energy method for shortening and straightening complete curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel energy method that reinterprets ``curve shortening'' as ``tangent aligning''. This conceptual shift enables the variational study of infinite-length curves evolving by the curve shortening flow, as well as higher order flows such as the elastic flow, which involves not only the curve shortening but also the curve straightening effect. For the curve shortening flow, we prove convergence to a straight line under mild assumptions on the ends of the initial curve. For the elastic flow, we establish a global well-posedness theory, and investigate the precise long-time behavior of solutions. In fact, our method applies to a more general class of geometric evolution equations including the surface diffusion flow, Chen's flow, and the free elastic flow.</description>
