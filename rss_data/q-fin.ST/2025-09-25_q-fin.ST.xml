      <title>Long-Range Dependence in Financial Markets: Empirical Evidence and Generative Modeling Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive empirical investigation of the presence of long-range dependence (LRD) in the dynamics of major U.S. stock market indexes--S\&amp;P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq--at daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies. We employ three distinct methods: the classical rescaled range (R/S) analysis, the more robust detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and a sophisticated ARFIMA--FIGARCH model with Student's $t$-distributed innovations. Our results confirm the presence of LRD, primarily driven by long memory in volatility rather than in the mean returns. Building on these findings, we explore the capability of a modern deep learning approach, Quant generative adversarial networks (GANs), to learn and replicate the LRD observed in the empirical data. While Quant GANs effectively capture heavy-tailed distributions and some aspects of volatility clustering, they suffer from significant limitations in reproducing the LRD, particularly at higher frequencies. This work highlights the challenges and opportunities in using data-driven models for generating realistic financial time series that preserve complex temporal dependencies.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Beta: A Causal Take on CAPM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CAPM regression is typically interpreted as if the market return contemporaneously \emph{causes} individual returns, motivating beta-neutral portfolios and factor attribution. For realized equity returns, however, this interpretation is inconsistent: a same-period arrow $R_{m,t} \to R_{i,t}$ conflicts with the fact that $R_m$ is itself a value-weighted aggregate of its constituents, unless $R_m$ is lagged or leave-one-out -- the ``aggregator contradiction.'' We formalize CAPM as a structural causal model and analyze the admissible three-node graphs linking an external driver $Z$, the market $R_m$, and an asset $R_i$. The empirically plausible baseline is a \emph{fork}, $Z \to \{R_m, R_i\}$, not $R_m \to R_i$. In this setting, OLS beta reflects not a causal transmission, but an attenuated proxy for how well $R_m$ captures the underlying driver $Z$. Consequently, ``beta-neutral'' portfolios can remain exposed to macro or sectoral shocks, and hedging on $R_m$ can import index-specific noise. Using stylized models and large-cap U.S.\ equity data, we show that contemporaneous betas act like proxies rather than mechanisms; any genuine market-to-stock channel, if at all, appears only at a lag and with modest economic significance. The practical message is clear: CAPM should be read as associational. Risk management and attribution should shift from fixed factor menus to explicitly declared causal paths, with ``alpha'' reserved for what remains invariant once those causal paths are explicitly blocked.</description>
