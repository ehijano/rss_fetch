      <title>Methane Emission From a Cool Brown Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond our solar system, aurorae have been inferred from radio observations of isolated brown dwarfs (e.g. Hallinan et al. 2006; Kao et al. 2023). Within our solar system, giant planets have auroral emission with signatures across the electromagnetic spectrum including infrared emission of H3+ and methane. Isolated brown dwarfs with auroral signatures in the radio have been searched for corresponding infrared features but have only had null detections (e.g. Gibbs et al. 2022). CWISEP J193518.59-154620.3. (W1935 for short) is an isolated brown dwarf with a temperature of ~482 K. Here we report JWST observations of strong methane emission from W1935 at 3.326 microns. Atmospheric modeling leads us to conclude that a temperature inversion of ~300 K centered at 1-10 millibar replicates the feature. This represents an atmospheric temperature inversion for a Jupiter-like atmosphere without irradiation from a host star. A plausible explanation for the strong inversion is heating by auroral processes, although other internal and/or external dynamical processes cannot be ruled out. The best fit model rules out the contribution of H3+ emission which is prominent in solar system gas giants however this is consistent with rapid destruction of H3+ at the higher pressure where the W1935 emission originates (e.g. Helling et al. 2019).</description>

      <title>Can mid-infrared spectral energy distribution quantitatively trace protoplanetary disk evolution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) spectral energy distribution (SED) is the major tracer of protoplanetary disks. It was recently proposed to use the mid-IR (MIR) SED slope $\alpha$ defined between 2-24$\mu$m as a potential quantitative tracer of disk age. We critically examine the viability of this idea and confront it with additional statistics of IR luminosities and SED shapes. We point out that, because the statistical properties of most of the complicated physical factors involved in disk evolution are still poorly understood in a quantitative sense, the only viable way is to assume them to be random so that an idealized `average disk' can be defined, which allows the $\alpha$ histogram to trace its age. We confirm that the statistics of the zeroth order (luminosity), first order (slope $\alpha$) and second order characteristics (concavity) of the observed MIR SED indeed carry useful information upon the evolutionary processes of the `average disk' and provide useful constraints to future disk population synthesis modeling. We also demonstrate that intrinsic diversities in MIR SED shapes and luminosities are always large at the level of individual stars so that the application of the evolutionary path of the `average disk' to individual stars must be done with care. The data of all curves in plots are provided on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Neutron-capture elements in a sample of field metal-poor N-rich dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to measure the abundances of n-capture elements in a sample of six metal-poor N-rich dwarfs that were formed in globular clusters, and  subsequently became unbound from the cluster. These N-rich stars, HD 25329, HD 74000, HD 160617, G 24-3, G 53-41, and G 90-3, were previously studied in  Paper I. The abundances of the n-capture elements in these stars were compared to the abundances in normal metal-poor dwarfs and in globular cluster stars in the same metallicity range in order to find  evidence of an enrichment of the material from which  these N-rich stars were formed, by the ejecta of massive asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB) inside the cluster.The abundances of 15 elements,  from Sr to Yb,  were derived line by line by comparing the observed profiles to synthetic spectra in a sample of six metal-poor N-rich dwarfs and nine classical metal-poor dwarfs. We show that, generally speaking, the behaviours of the intermediate metal-poor stars here studied and the extremely metal-poor stars are very different. In particular, the scatter of the [X/Fe] ratios is much smaller since many more stars contribute to the enrichment.Among our six metal-poor N-rich stars, three stars (G24-3 and HD 74000 and maybe also HD 160617) present an enrichment in elements formed by the s-process, typical of a contribution of AGB stars, unexpected at the metallicity of these stars. This suggests that the intracluster medium from which these stars were formed was enriched by a first generation of massive AGB stars. Another N-rich star, G53-41, is also rich in s-process elements, but since it is more metal-rich this could be due to the normal galactic enrichment by low-mass AGB stars before the formation of the cluster. In contrast, two stars (G90-3 and HD 25329) have an abundance pattern compatible with a pure r-process such as that seen in  metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]&lt;--1.5.</description>

      <title>Photometric sample of early B-type pulsators in eclipsing binaries observed with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismology coupled with eclipsing binary modelling shows a great potential in improving the efficiency of measurements or calibrations of the interior mixing profile in massive stars. This helps, for instance in treating the challenging and mysterious discrepancies between observations and models of its stellar structure and evolution. This paper discusses the findings in our work titled "$\beta$ Cephei pulsators in eclipsing binaries observed with TESS", which aimed to compile a comprehensive catalogue of $\beta$ Cep pulsators in eclipsing binaries. Seventy eight (78) pulsators of the $\beta$ Cep type in eclipsing binaries among which are 59 new discoveries were reported. Here, we also report a fresh analysis of eight additional stars which were outside the scope of the earlier mentioned work. Six $\beta$ Cep pulsators in eclipsing binaries are reported, among which 5 are new discoveries and 1 is a confirmation of a candidate earlier suggested in literature. Our sample allows for future ensemble asteroseismic modelling of massive pulsators in eclipsing binaries to treat the discrepancy between observations and models.</description>

      <title>Identifying coronal sources of L1 solar wind disturbances using the Fisk heliospheric magnetic field and potential field extrapolations during three solar minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar minima between solar cycles 22-23, 23-24 and 24-25 are the best observed minima on record. In situ solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field measurements by the WIND and ACE spacecraft at L1 with one-hour cadence are explored using wavelet analyses for the most quiescent year during each minimum. Times of local peaks in periodicities are identified in the solar wind velocity, magnetic field components, and proton number densities. The measured radial velocities at these times are used to trace magnetic field lines to the photosphere using two models. The first is the Fisk heliospheric magnetic field that traces field lines from L1 to the photosphere. They connect exclusively to solar poles and in 88% instances to locations of polar coronal holes. The second model uses the Parker spiral to trace from L1 to the solar source surface and potential field extrapolations from the source surface to the photosphere. These field lines terminate at equatorial and mid-latitude coordinates of which some are located close to coronal holes. This study connects for the first time coronal hole signatures in the ecliptic plane at L1 with polar coronal holes using the Fisk field. It shows how sources from both the solar equator and poles influence the solar wind at L1 and how the two models compliment each other to identify these sources.</description>

      <title>Physics of nova outbursts: Theoretical models of classical nova outbursts with optically thick winds on $1.2~M_\odot$ and $1.3~M_\odot$ white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present time-dependent nova outburst models with optically thick winds for a 1.2 and 1.35 $M_\odot$ white dwarfs (WDs) with a mass accretion rate of $5 \times 10^{-9}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and for a 1.3 $M_\odot$ WD with $2 \times 10^{-9}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The X-ray flash occurs 11 days before the optical peak of the 1.2 $M_\odot$ WD and 2.5 days before the peak of the 1.3 $M_\odot$ WD. The wind mass loss rate of the 1.2 $M_\odot$ WD (1.3 $M_\odot$ WD) reaches a peak of $6.4 \times 10^{-5}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ ($7.4 \times 10^{-5}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) at the epoch of the maximum photospheric expansion with the lowest photospheric temperature of $\log T_{\rm ph}$ (K)=4.33 (4.35). The nuclear energy generated during the outburst is lost in a form of radiation (61% for the 1.2 $M_\odot$ WD; 47% for the 1.3 $M_\odot$ WD), gravitational energy of ejecta (39%; 52%), and kinetic energy of the wind (0.28%; 0.29%). We found an empirical relation for fast novae between the time to optical maximum from the outburst $t_{\rm peak}$ and the expansion timescale $\tau_{\rm exp}$ at $t=0$. With this relation, we are able to predict the time to optical maximum $t_{\rm peak}$ from the ignition model (at $t=0$) without following a time-consuming nova wind evolution.</description>

      <title>Fresh view of the hot brown dwarf HD 984 B through high-resolution spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. High-resolution spectroscopy has the potential to drive a better understanding of the atmospheric composition, physics, and dynamics of young exoplanets and brown dwarfs, bringing clear insights into the formation channel of individual objects. Aims. Using the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC; R = 35,000), we aim to characterize a young brown dwarf HD 984 B. By measuring its C/O and 12CO/13CO ratios, we expect to gain new knowledge about its origin by confirming the difference in the formation pathways between brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters. Methods. We analysed the KPIC high-resolution spectrum (2.29-2.49 {\mu}m) of HD 984 B using an atmospheric retrieval framework based on nested sampling and petitRADTRANS, using both clear and cloudy models. Results. Using our best-fit model, we find C/O = 0.50+0.01-0.01 (0.01 is the statistical error) for HD 984 B which agrees with that of its host star within 1{\sigma} (0.40+0.20-0.20). We also retrieve an isotopolog 12CO/13CO ratio of 98+20-25 in its atmosphere, which is similar to that of the Sun. In addition, HD 984 B has a substellar metallicity with [Fe/H] = -0.62+0.02-0.02. Finally, we find that most of the retrieved parameters are independent of our choice of retrieval model. Conclusions. From our measured C/O and 12CO/13CO, the favored formation mechanism of HD 984 B seems to be via gravitational collapse or disk instability and not core accretion, which is a favored formation mechanism for giant exoplanets with m &lt; 13 MJup and semimajor axis between 10 and 100 au. However, with only a few brown dwarfs with a measured 12CO/13CO ratio, similar analyses using high-resolution spectroscopy will become essential in order to determine planet formation processes more precisely.</description>

      <title>Signature of systemic rotation in 21 Galactic Globular Clusters from APOGEE-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Traditionally, Globular Clusters (GCs) have been assumed to be quasi-relaxed non-rotating systems, characterized by spherical symmetry and orbital isotropy. However, in recent years, a growing set of observational evidence is unveiling an unexpected dynamical complexity in Galactic GCs. Indeed, kinematic studies show that a measurable amount of internal rotation is present in many present-day GCs. Aims. The objective of this work is to analyse the APOGEE-2 Value-Added Catalogs (VACs) DR17 data of a sample of 21 GCs to extend the sample showing signatures of systemic rotation, in order to better understand the kinematic properties of GCs in general. Also, we aim to identify the fastest rotating GC from the sample of objects with suitable measurements. Methods. From the sample of 23 GCs included in this work, the presence of systemic rotation was detected in 21 of the GCs, using three different methods. All these methods use the radial velocity referred to the cluster systemic velocity. Using the first method, it was possible to visually verify the clear-cut signature of systemic rotation. Whereas, using the second and third methods, it was possible to determine the amplitude of the rotation curve and the position angle of the rotation axis. Results. This study shows that 21 GCs have a signature of systemic rotation. For these clusters, the rotation amplitude and the position angle of the rotation axis have been calculated. The clusters cover a remarkable range of rotational amplitudes, from 0.77 km/s to 13.85 km/s.</description>

      <title>Detection of the actinide Th in an r-process-enhanced star with accretion origin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thorium and six second-peak r-process element (56&lt;Z&lt;72) abundances are determined for the alpha-poor star LAMOST J1124+4535 based on a high-resolution spectrum obtained with the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) on the Subaru telescope. The age of J1124+4535 is 11.3$\pm$4.4 Gyr using thorium and other r-process element abundances. J1124+4535 is confirmed to be a Galactic halo metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -1.27$\pm$0.1) star with extreme r-process element over-abundance ([Eu/Fe] = 1.13$\pm$0.08) and alpha element deficiency ([Mg/Fe] = -0.31$\pm$0.09) by the LAMOST-Subaru project. Along with the sub-solar alpha to iron ratios (e.g. [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe]), the relatively low abundances of Na, Cr, Ni and Zn in J1124+4535 show significant departure from the general trends of the Galactic halo but are in good agreement with those of dwarf galaxies. The chemical abundances and kinematics of J1124+4535 suggest it was formed in the late stage of star formation in a dwarf galaxy which has been disrupted by the Milky Way (MW). The star formation of its progenitor dwarf galaxy lasted more than 2 Gyr and has been affected by a rare r-process event before the occurrence of accretion event.</description>

      <title>Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES). I. Astrometric Noise and Planetary Detection Efficiency due to Stellar Spots and Faculae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) is dedicated to the astrometric exploration for habitable-zone Earth-like planets orbiting solar-type stars in close proximity, achieving unprecedented micro-arcsecond precision. Given the elevated precision, thorough consideration of photocenter jitters induced by stellar activity becomes imperative. This study endeavors to model the stellar activity of solar-type stars, compute astrometric noise, and delineate the detection limits of habitable planets within the astrometric domain. Simulations were conducted for identified primary targets of CHES, involving the generation of simulated observed data for astrometry and photometry, accounting for the impact of stellar activity. Estimation of activity levels in our samples was achieved through chromospheric activity indices, revealing that over 90% of stars exhibited photocenter jitters below 1 $\mu\mathrm{as}$. Notably, certain proximate stars, such as $\alpha$ Cen A and B, displayed more discernible noise arising from stellar activity. Subsequent tests were performed to evaluate detection performance, unveiling that stellar activity tends to have a less pronounced impact on planetary detectability for the majority of stars. Approximately 95% of targets demonstrated a detection efficiency exceeding 80%. However, for several cold stars, e.g., HD 32450 and HD 21531, with the habitable zones close to the stars, a reduction in detection efficiency was observed. These findings offer invaluable insights into the intricate interplay between stellar activity and astrometric precision, significantly advancing our understanding in the search for habitable planets.</description>

      <title>Carbon- and Oxygen-rich stars in MaStar: identification and classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon- and Oxygen-rich stars populating the Thermally-Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) phase of stellar evolution are relevant contributors to the spectra of ~1 Gyr old populations. Atmosphere models for these types are uncertain, due to complex molecules and mass-loss effects. Empirical spectra are then crucial, but samples are small due to the short (~3 Myr) TP-AGB lifetime. Here we exploit the vastness of the MaNGA Stellar library MaStar (~60,000 spectra) to identify C,O-rich type stars. We define an optical colour selection with cuts of (g-r)&gt;2 and (g-i)&lt;1.55(g-r)-0.07, calibrated with known C- and O- rich spectra. This identifies C-,O-rich stars along clean, separated sequences. An analogue selection is found in V,R,I bands. Our equation identifies C- and O-rich spectra with predictive performance metric F1-scores of 0.72 and 0.74 (over 1), respectively. We finally identify 41 C- and 87 O-rich type AGB stars in MaStar, 5 and 49 of which do not have a SIMBAD counterpart. We also detect a sample of non-AGB, dwarf C-stars. We further design a fitting procedure to classify the spectra into broad spectral types, by using as fitting templates empirical C and O-rich spectra. We find remarkably good fits for the majority of candidates and categorise them into C- and O-rich bins following existing classifications, which correlate to effective temperature. Our selection models can be applied to large photometric surveys (e.g. Euclid, Rubin). The classified spectra will facilitate future evolutionary population synthesis models.</description>

      <title>The Low-Mass Stellar Initial Mass Function in Nearby Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (IMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses that form in a given star-formation event. The long main-sequence lifetimes of low-mass stars mean that the IMF in this regime (below $\sim~1~\rm{M}_\odot$) can be investigated through star counts. Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies are low luminosity systems with ancient, metal poor stellar populations. We investigate the low-mass IMF in four such systems (Reticulum II, Ursa Major II, Triangulum II, and Segue 1), using Hubble Space Telescope imaging data that reaches to $\lesssim~0.2~\rm{M}_\odot$ in each galaxy. The analysis techniques that we adopt depend on the number of low-mass stars in each sample. We use Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for all four galaxies to determine whether their observed apparent magnitude distributions can reject a given combination of IMF parameters and binary fraction for the underlying population. We forward model a thousand synthetic populations for each combination of parameters, and reject those parameters only if each of the thousand realizations reject the null hypothesis. We find that all four galaxies reject a variety of IMFs, and the IMFs that they cannot reject include those that are identical, or similar, to that of the stellar populations of the Milky Way. We determine the best-fit parameter values for the IMF in Reticulum II and Ursa Major II and find that the IMF in Reticulum II is generally consistent with that of the Milky Way, while the IMF in Ursa Major II is more bottom-heavy. The interpretation of the results for Ursa Major II is complicated by possible contamination from two known background galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>The 33 M$_\odot$ black hole Gaia BH3 is part of the disrupted ED-2 star cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11604</link>

Abstract: The Gaia Collaboration has recently reported the detection of a 33 M$_\odot$ black hole in a wide binary system located in the Solar neighbourhood. Here we explore the relationship between this black hole, known as Gaia BH3, and the nearby ED-2 halo stellar stream. We study the orbital characteristics of the Gaia BH3 binary and present measurements of the chemical abundances of ED-2 member stars derived from high-resolution spectra obtained with the VLT. We find that the Galactic orbit of the Gaia BH3 system and its metallicity are entirely consistent with being part of the ED-2 stream. The characteristics of the stream, particularly its negligible spread in metallicity and in other chemical elements as well as its single stellar population, suggest that it originated from a disrupted star cluster of low mass. Its age is comparable to that of the globular cluster M92 that has been estimated to be as old as the Universe. This is the first black hole unambiguously associated with a disrupted star cluster. We infer a plausible mass range for the cluster to be relatively narrow, between $2\times 10^3M_\odot$ and $4.2\times 10^4M_\odot$. This implies that the black hole could have formed directly from the collapse of a massive very-metal-poor star, but that the alternative scenario of binary interactions inside the cluster environment also deserves to be explored.</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Parameters of Astrophysical Plasma Turbulence and its Dissipation: Nonrelativistic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A specific set of dimensionless plasma and turbulence parameters is introduced to characterize the nature of turbulence and its dissipation in weakly collisional space and astrophysical plasmas. Key considerations are discussed for the development of predictive models of the turbulent plasma heating that characterize the partitioning of dissipated turbulent energy between the ion and electron species and between the perpendicular and parallel degrees of freedom for each species. Identifying the kinetic physical mechanisms that govern the damping of the turbulent fluctuations is a critical first step in constructing such turbulent heating models. A set of ten general plasma and turbulence parameters are defined, and reasonable approximations along with the exploitation of existing scaling theories for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence are used to reduce this general set of ten parameters to just three parameters in the isotropic temperature case. A critical step forward in this study is to identify the dependence of all of the proposed kinetic mechanisms for turbulent damping in terms of the same set of fundamental plasma and turbulence parameters. Analytical estimations of the scaling of each damping mechanism on these fundamental parameters are presented, and this information is synthesized to produce the first phase diagram for the turbulent damping mechanisms as a function of driving scale and ion plasma beta.</description>

      <title>Signatures of magnetic braking in Class 0 protostars ? Exploring the gas kinematics in magnetized models of low-mass star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Only indirect evidence of the role of magnetic braking in regulating gravitational collapse and the formation of circumstellar disks was found from observational work, such as compact disk sizes and the launching of high-velocity collimated protostellar jets. More direct tests of the magnetic braking shaping the angular momentum (AM) of the gas in Class 0 protostars are crucially needed. In the present work we have used non-ideal MHD models of protostellar collapse and synthetic observations of molecular gas spectral emission that we analyze to test whether possible kinematic signatures of the magnetic braking in the gas velocity field can be captured from maps of the molecular gas emission in protostellar envelopes. By comparing the 3D Specific AM of models with varying turbulent energy and magnetization, we show that, in the numerical models of protostellar evolution explored, the increase in magnetization and its consequences on the spatial redistribution of SAM modifies the shapes of the radial profiles of SAM. We show that widely used observational methods fail to quantitatively capture the magnitude of SAM of the gas in protostellar envelopes, and that no method allows to measure the differences in radial evolution of SAM due to different magnetization at all envelope radii. This is especially true in the more magnetized cases. However, our analysis suggests that the detection of symmetric patterns and organized velocity fields, in the moment-1 maps of the molecular line emission as well as monotonous radial profiles of the SAM showing a power-law decline, should be suggestive of a less magnetized scenario. Protostellar cores where efficient magnetic braking is at work are more likely to present a highly asymmetric velocity field, and more prone to show complex radial profiles of their specific angular momentum measured in the equatorial plane.</description>

      <title>Wide Binaries and Modified Gravity (MOG)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wide binary stars are used to test the modified gravity called Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity or MOG. This theory is based on the additional gravitational degrees of freedom, the scalar field $G=G_N(1+\alpha)$, where $G_N$ is Newton's constant, and the massive (spin-1 graviton) vector field $\phi_\mu$. The wide binaries have separations of 2-30 kAU. The MOG acceleration law, derived from the MOG field equations and equations of motion of a massive test particle for weak gravitational fields, depends on the enhanced gravitational constant $G=G_N(1+\alpha)$ and the effective running mass $\mu$. The magnitude of $\alpha$ depends on the physical length scale or averaging scale $\ell$ of the system. The modified MOG acceleration law for weak gravitational fields predicts that for the solar system and for the wide binary star systems gravitational dynamics follows Newton's law.</description>

      <title>The Basic Iterative Deconvolution: A fast instrumental point-spread function deconvolution method that corrects for light that is scattered out of the field of view of a detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A point-spread function describes the optics of an imaging system and can be used to correct collected images for instrumental effects. The state of the art for deconvolving images with the point-spread function is the Richardson-Lucy algorithm; however, despite its high fidelity, it is slow and cannot account for light scattered out of the field of view of the detector. We reinstate the Basic Iterative Deconvolution (BID) algorithm, a deconvolution algorithm that considers photons scattered out of the field of view of the detector, and extend it for image subregion deconvolutions. Its runtime is 1.8 to 7.1 faster than the Richardson-Lucy algorithm for 4096 x 4096 pixels images and up to an additional factor of 150 for subregions of 250 x 250 pixels. We test the extended BID algorithm for solar images taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and find that the deviations between the reconstructed intensities of BID and the Richardson-Lucy algorithm are smaller than 1%.</description>

      <title>Evaporation of Close-in Sub-Neptunes by Cooling White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent surge in interest concerning white dwarf (WD) planets, this work presents the first numerical exploration of WD-driven atmospheric escape, whereby the high-energy radiation from a hot/young WD can trigger the outflow of the hydrogen-helium envelope for close-in planets. As a pilot investigation, we focus on two specific cases: a gas giant and a sub-Neptune-sized planet, both orbiting a rapidly cooling WD with mass $M_\ast$ = 0.6 \msun\ and separation $a$ = 0.02 AU. In both cases, the ensuing mass outflow rates exceed $10^{14}$ g sec$^{-1}$ for WD temperatures greater than $T_{\rm WD} \simeq$ 50,000 K. At $T_{\rm WD} \simeq$ 18,000 K [/22,000 K], the sub-Neptune [/gas giant] mass outflow rate approaches $10^{12}$ g sec$^{-1}$, i.e., comparable to the strongest outflows expected from close-in planets around late main-sequence stars. Whereas the gas giant remains virtually unaffected from an evolutionary standpoint, atmospheric escape may have sizable effects for the sub-Neptune, depending on its dynamical history, e.g., assuming that the hydrogen-helium envelope makes up 1 [/4] per cent of the planet mass, the entire envelope would be evaporated away so long as the planet reaches 0.02 AU within the first 230 [/130] Myr of the WD formation. We discuss how these results can be generalized to eccentric orbits with effective semi-major axis $a'=a/(1-e^2)^{1/4}$, which receive the same orbit-averaged irradiation. Extended to a much broader parameter space, this approach can be exploited to model the expected demographics of WD planets as a function of their initial mass, composition and migration history, as well as their potential for habitability.</description>
