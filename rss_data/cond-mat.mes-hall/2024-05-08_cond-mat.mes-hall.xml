      <title>Anatomy of Higher-Order Non-Hermitian Skin and Boundary Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems featuring an intricate interplay between skin and boundary modes has attracted enormous theoretical and experimental attention. Still, in dimensions higher than one, this interplay remains much less understood. Here we provide insights from exact analytical solutions of a large class of models in any dimension, $d$, with open boundaries in $d_c \le d$ directions and by tracking their topological origin. Specifically, we show that Amoeba theory accounting for the separation gaps of the bulk skin modes augmented with higher-dimensional generalizations of the biorthogonal polarization and the generalized Brillouin zone approaches accounting for boundary modes provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems.</description>

      <title>Band structure engineering using a moir\'e polar substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying long wavelength periodic potentials on quantum materials has recently been demonstrated to be a promising pathway for engineering novel quantum phases of matter. Here, we utilize twisted bilayer boron nitride (BN) as a moir\'e substrate for band structure engineering. Small-angle-twisted bilayer BN is endowed with periodically arranged up and down polar domains, which imprints a periodic electrostatic potential on a target two-dimensional (2D) material placed on top. As a proof of concept, we use Bernal bilayer graphene as the target material. The resulting modulation of the band structure appears as superlattice resistance peaks, tunable by varying the twist angle, and Hofstadter butterfly physics under a magnetic field. Additionally, we demonstrate the tunability of the moir\'e potential by altering the dielectric thickness underneath the twisted BN. Finally, we find that near-60{\deg}-twisted bilayer BN provides a unique platform for studying the moir\'e structural effect without the contribution from electrostatic moir\'e potentials. Tunable moir\'e polar substrates may serve as versatile platforms to engineer the electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Noise Correlations in a 1D Silicon Spin Qubit Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlated noise across multi-qubit architectures is known to be highly detrimental to the operation of error correcting codes and the long-term feasibility of quantum processors. The recent discovery of spatially dependent correlated noise in multi-qubit architectures of superconducting qubits arising from the impact of cosmic radiation and high-energy particles giving rise to quasiparticle poisoning within the substrate has led to intense investigations of mitigation strategies to address this. In contrast correlated noise in semiconductor spin qubits as a function of distance has not been reported to date. Here we report the magnitude, frequency and spatial dependence of noise correlations between four silicon quantum dot pairs as a function of inter-dot distance at frequencies from 0.3mHz to 1mHz. We find the magnitude of charge noise correlations, quantified by the magnitude square coherence $C_{xy}$, are significantly suppressed from $&gt;0.5$ to $&lt;0.1$ as the inter-dot distance increases from 75nm to 300nm. Using an analytical model we confirm that, in contrast to superconducting qubits, the dominant source of correlated noise arises from low frequency charge noise from the presence of two level fluctuators (TLFs) at the native silicon-silicon dioxide surface. Knowing this, we conclude with an important and timely discussion of charge noise mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Light-induced Hall currents in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Berry curvature, a momentum space property, can manifest itself in current responses. The well-known anomalous Hall effect in time-reversal-breaking systems arises from a Berry curvature monopole. In time-reversal-invariant materials, a second-order Hall conductivity emerges from a Berry curvature dipole. Recently, it has been shown that a Berry curvature quadrupole induces a third-order ac Hall response in systems that break time reversal ($K$) and a fourfold rotational ($C_{4}$) symmetry, while remaining invariant under the combination of the two ($C_{4}K$). In this letter, we demonstrate that incident light can induce a $\rm dc$ Hall current in such systems, driven by the Berry curvature quadrupole. We consider a combination of a static $\rm dc$ electric field and an ac light-induced electric field. We calculate the current perpendicular to both the static electric field and the fourfold axis. Remarkably, the induced current is generically spin-polarized. A net charge current appears for light that is linearly or elliptically polarized, but not for circular polarization. In contrast, the spin current remains unchanged when the polarization of light is varied. This allows for rich possibilities such as generating a spin current by shining circularly polarized light on an altermagnetic material. We demonstrate this physics using a two-dimensional toy model for altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Identifying the topological order of quantized half-filled Landau levels through their daughter states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states at a half-filled Landau level are believed to carry an integer number $\mathcal{C}$ of chiral Majorana edge modes, reflected in their thermal Hall conductivity. We show that this number determines the primary series of Abelian fractional quantum Hall states that emerge above and below the half-filling point. On a particular side of half-filling each series may originate from two consecutive values of $\mathcal{C}$, but the combination of the series above and below half-filling uniquely identifies $\mathcal{C}$. We analyze these states both by a hierarchy approach and by a composite fermion approach. In the latter, we map electrons near a half-filled Landau level to composite fermions at a weak magnetic field and show that a bosonic integer quantum Hall state is formed by pairs of composite fermions and plays a crucial role in the state's Hall conductivity.</description>

      <title>Theory of inverse Edelstein effect induced by thermal spin injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically consider a junction composed of a ferromagnetic insulator (FI) and a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with Rashba- and Dresselhaus-type spin-orbit interactions. Using the Boltzmann equation, we calculate an electric current in 2DEG induced by the inverse Edelstein when imposing the temperature difference between FI and 2DEG. We clarify how the induced current depends on the magnetization direction of FI, spin texture on the Fermi surface of 2DEG, and temperature. Our result provides an important foundation for an accurate analysis of the inverse Edelstein effect induced by thermal spin injection.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Gate-tunable Capacitance in Graphene Moir\'e Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interface engineered ferroelectricity in van der Waals heterostructures is of broad interest both fundamentally and technologically for the applications in neuromorphic computing and so on. In particular, the moir\'e ferroelectricity in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructures driven by charge ordering instead of traditional lattice displacement has drawn considerable attention because of its fascinating properties and promising high-frequency programmable electrical polarization switching. Yet, the underlying mechanism of the electronic ferroelectricity is still under debate. On the other hand, combining the interface engineered ferroelectricity and strong correlations in moir\'e heterostructures could enable the realization of novel quantum states such as ferroelectric superconductivity and multiferroicity. Here we study the electronic transport properties of twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBLG), aligned with one of the neighbouring hBN. We observe a strong gating hysteresis and ferroelectric-like behaviour, as well as the electronic ratchet effect. We find that the top gate is anomalously screened. On the contrary, the back gate is anomalously doubly efficient in injecting charges into graphene, that is, the effective back gate capacitance is two times larger than its geometry capacitance. This unexpected gate-tunable capacitance causes a dramatic change of electric fields between forward and backward scans. The asymmetric gating behaviours and anomalous change in capacitance could be explained with a simple model involved with a spontaneous electric polarization between top hBN and graphene. Our work provides more insights into the mysterious ferroelectricity in graphene/hBN moir\'e heterostructures and paves the way to the understanding of the underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>Super-suppression of long wavelength phonons in constricted nanoporous geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a typical semiconductor material, the majority of heat is carried by long wavelength, long mean-free-path phonons. Nanostructuring strategies to reduce thermal conductivity, a promising direction in the field of thermoelectrics, place scattering centers of size and spatial separation comparable to the mean-free-paths of the dominant phonons to selectively scatter them. The resultant thermal conductivity is in most cases well predicted using Matthiessens rule. In general, however, long wavelength phonons are not as effectively scattered as the rest of the phonon spectrum. In this work, using large-scale Molecular Dynamics simulations, Non-Equilibrium Greens Function simulations, and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that specific nanoporous geometries, which create narrow constrictions in the passage of phonons, lead to anticorrelated heat currents in the phonon spectrum. This results in super-suppression of long-wavelength phonons due to heat trapping, and reductions in the thermal conductivity well below what is predicted by Matthiessens rule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade atomically thin 2D materials have emerged as a perfect platform for studying and tuning light-matter interaction and electronic properties in nanostructures. The optoelectronic properties in layered materials such as transition-metal-dichalcogenides (TMDs) are governed by excitons, Coulomb bound electron-hole pairs, even at room temperature. The energy, wave function extension, spin and valley properties of optically excited conduction electrons and valence holes are controllable via multiple experimentally accessible knobs, such as lattice strain, varying atomic registries, dielectric engineering as well as electric and magnetic fields. This results in a multitude of fascinating physical phenomena in optics and transport linked to excitons with very specific properties, such as bright and dark excitons, interlayer and charge transfer excitons as well as hybrid and moir\'e excitons. In this book chapter we introduce general optoelectronic properties of 2D materials and energy landscapes in TMD monolayers as well as their vertical and lateral heterostructures, including twisted TMD hetero- and homobilayer bilayers with moir\'e excitons and lattice recombination effects. We review the recently gained insights and open questions on exciton diffusion, strain- and field-induced exciton drift. We discuss intriguing non-linear many-particle effects, such as exciton halo formation, negative and anomalous diffusion, the surprising anti-funneling of dark excitons.</description>

      <title>Topologically trivial gap-filling in superconducting Fe(Se,Te) by one dimensional defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural distortions and imperfections are a crucial aspect of materials science, on the macroscopic scale providing strength, but also enhancing corrosion and reducing electrical and thermal conductivity. At the nanometre scale, multi-atom imperfections, such as atomic chains and crystalline domain walls have conversely been proposed as a route to topological superconductivity, whose most prominent characteristic is the emergence of Majorana Fermions that can be used for error-free quantum computing. Here, we shed more light on the nature of purported domain walls in Fe(Se,Te) that may host 1D dispersing Majorana modes. We show that the displacement shift of the atomic lattice at these line-defects results from sub-surface impurities that warp the topmost layer(s). Using the electric field between the tip and sample, we manage to reposition the sub-surface impurities, directly visualizing the displacement shift and the underlying defect-free lattice. These results, combined with observations of a completely different type of 1D defect where superconductivity remains fully gapped, highlight the topologically trivial nature of 1D defects in Fe(Se,Te).</description>

      <title>MSene: A new large family of two-dimensional transition metal sulfide with MXene structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, discovering new two-dimensional (2D) materials with unique properties and potential applications remains a focus in condensed matter physics. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we report a new large family of transition metal sulfides M2S with MXene structure in 2H and 1T phases, which we name as MSene. Twenty-four out of fifty-eight MSenes are proved to be stable. Notably, this family includes twelve superconducting (SC) materials, seven SC topological metals (SCTMs), four charge density wave (CDW) materials, and five magnetic materials including one ferromagnetic (FM) and four antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials. For example, 2H-W2S is a SCTM which exhibits SC transition temperature (Tc) of 12.4 K and nontrivial topological properties as evidenced by topological invariant Z2=1 and the presence of edge states; 1T-Hf2S is a CDW material with the CDW originating from electron-phonon coupling. The CDW can be suppressed by compressive strain, leading to the emergence of superconductivity; 2H-Cr2S and 1T-Mn2S show FM and AFM properties, respectively. Thus, the new large family we predicted shows rich physical properties and significantly expands the repertoire of 2D materials. It serves as a novel platform for investigating the competition or coexistence of multiple orders such as SC, CDW, FM, AFM and topological orders in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Memristive switching in the surface of a charge-density-wave topological semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to the outstanding properties provided by nontrivial band topology, topological phases of matter are considered as a promising platform towards low-dissipation electronics, efficient spin-charge conversion, and topological quantum computation. Achieving ferroelectricity in topological materials enables the non-volatile control of the quantum states, which could greatly facilitate topological electronic research. However, ferroelectricity is generally incompatible with systems featuring metallicity due to the screening effect of free carriers. In this study, we report the observation of memristive switching based on the ferroelectric surface state of a topological semimetal (TaSe4)2I. We find that the surface state of (TaSe4)2I presents out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization due to surface reconstruction. With the combination of ferroelectric surface and charge-density-wave-gapped bulk states, an electric switchable barrier height can be achieved in (TaSe4)2I-metal contact. By employing a multi-terminal grounding design, we manage to construct a prototype ferroelectric memristor based on (TaSe4)2I with on/off ratio up to 10^3, endurance over 10^3 cycles, and good retention characteristics. The origin of the ferroelectric surface state is further investigated by first-principles calculations, which reveals an interplay between ferroelectricity and band topology. The emergence of ferroelectricity in (TaSe4)2I not only demonstrates it as a rare but essential case of ferroelectric topological materials, but also opens new routes towards the implementation of topological materials in functional electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional hidden phase probed by in-plane magnetotransport in kagome metal CsV3Sb5 thin flakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal compounds with kagome structure have been found to exhibit a variety of exotic structural, electronic, and magnetic orders. These orders are competing with energies very close to each other, resulting in complex phase transitions. Some of the phases are easily observable, such as the charge density wave (CDW) and the superconducting phase, while others are more challenging to identify and characterize. Here we present magneto-transport evidence of a new phase below ~35 K in the kagome topological metal CsV3Sb5 (CVS) thin flakes between the CDW and the superconducting transition temperatures. This phase is characterized by six-fold rotational symmetry in the in-plane magnetoresistance (MR) and is connected to the orbital current order in CVS. Furthermore, the phase is characterized by a large in-plane negative magnetoresistance, which suggests the existence of a three-dimensional, magnetic field-tunable orbital current ordered phase. Our results highlight the potential of magneto-transport to reveal the interactions between exotic quantum states of matter and to uncover the symmetry of such hidden phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete analytical solution of the mean-field Hubbard model of undoped and doped graphene rectangulenes. These are non-chiral ribbons of arbitrary length and width, whose dimensions range from simple short acene molecules all the way up to the bulk limit. We rewrite the Hubbard model in the basis of bulk and edge non-interacting eigen-states, and provide explicit expressions for the Coulomb matrix elements. We present a general mean-field decoupling of the Hamiltonian, and discuss in detail the paramagnetic, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic mean-field solutions. We calculate the eigen-energies, occupations, spin densities and addition energies of rectangulenes with lengths and widths ranging from a nanometer to several hundreds of them. We rewrite the exact mean-field tight-binding Hamiltonian back in the site-occupation basis, that can be used to model electronic, thermo-electric, transport and optical properties of experimental-size graphene flakes.</description>

Abstract: Quantum processing units will be modules of larger information processing systems containing also digital and analog electronics modules. Silicon-based quantum computing offers the enticing opportunity to manufacture all the modules using the same technology platform. Here, we present a cryogenic multi-module assembly for multiplexed readout of silicon quantum devices where all modules have been fabricated using the same fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS process. The assembly is constituted by three chiplets: (i) a low-noise amplifier (LNA), (ii) a single-pole eight-throw switch (SP8T), and (iii) a silicon quantum dot (QD) array. We characterise each module individually and show (i) a gain over 35 dB, a bandwidth of 118 MHz, a minimum noise temperature of 4.2 K, (ii) an insertion loss smaller than 1.1 dB, a noise temperature smaller than 1.1 K across 0-2 GHz, and (iii) single-electron box (SEB) charge sensors. Finally, we combine all elements into a single demonstration showing time-domain radio-frequency multiplexing of two SEBs paving the way to an all-silicon quantum computing system.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity by Strong Electron Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality-induced spin selectivity is a spin-splitting phenomenon from a helical structure with a considerably effective spin-orbit coupling. This unexpectedly large spin-splitting phenomenon has been experimentally observed in chiral organic molecules, which typically show a weak spin-orbit coupling. To understand this, we use the renormalized mean-field theory and Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formulas to study the transport properties of single-stranded DNA in the presence of strong electron correlation. It shows a significant spin polarization of 46.5% near the Coulomb repulsion limit, which explains the extremely high spin polarization observed in experiments. Compared to systems without electron correlation, the averaged spin polarization in this case is 2 to 4 times greater across various system sizes. Furthermore, the parameter dependence of the spin polarization and the underlying Metal-Insulator transition are studied.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Quantum States for the Interacting Hofstadter Model with Higher Local Occupations and Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their immense representative power, neural network quantum states (NQS) have gained significant interest in current research. In recent advances in the field of NQS, it has been demonstrated that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, making NQS a compelling alternative, in particular for the simulation of large, two-dimensional quantum systems. In this study, we show that recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions can be employed to study systems relevant to current research in quantum many-body physics. Specifically, we employ a 2D tensorized gated RNN to explore the bosonic Hofstadter model with a variable local Hilbert space cut-off and long-range interactions. At first, we benchmark the RNN-NQS for the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) Hamiltonian on a square lattice. We find that this method is, despite the complexity of the wave function, capable of efficiently identifying and representing most ground state properties. Afterwards, we apply the method to an even more challenging model for current methods, namely the Hofstadter model with long-range interactions. This model describes Rydberg-dressed atoms on a lattice subject to a synthetic magnetic field. We study systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ sites and identify three different regimes by tuning the interaction range and the filling fraction $\nu$. In addition to phases known from the HBH model at short-ranged interaction, we observe bubble crystals and Wigner crystals for long-ranged interactions. Especially interesting is the evidence of a bubble crystal phase on a lattice, as this gives experiments a starting point for the search of clustered liquid phases, possibly hosting non-Abelian anyon excitations. In our work we show that NQS are an efficient and reliable simulation method for quantum systems, which are the subject of current research.</description>

      <title>Tunable superconductivity in electron- and hole-doped Bernal bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene-based, high quality two-dimensional electronic systems have emerged as a highly tunable platform for studying superconductivity. Specifically, superconductivity has been observed in both electron-doped and hole-doped twisted graphene moire systems, whereas in crystalline graphene systems, superconductivity has so far only been observed in hole-doped rhombohedral trilayer and hole-doped Bernal bilayer graphene (BBG). Recently, enhanced superconductivity has been demonstrated in BBG due to the proximity with a monolayer WSe2. Here, we report the observation of superconductivity and a series of flavor-symmetry-breaking phases in both electron- and hole-doped BBG/WSe2 device by electrostatic doping. The strength of the observed superconductivity is tunable by applied vertical electric fields. The maximum Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition temperature for the electron- and hole-doped superconductivity is about 210 mK and 400 mK, respectively. Superconductivities emerge only when applied electric fields drive BBG electron or hole wavefunctions toward the WSe2 layer, underscoring the importance of the WSe2 layer in the observed superconductivity. We find the hole-doped superconductivity violates the Pauli paramagnetic limit, consistent with an Ising-like superconductor. In contrast, the electron-doped superconductivity obeys the Pauli limit, even though the proximity induced Ising spin-orbit coupling is also notable in the conduction band. Our findings highlight the rich physics associated with the conduction band in BBG, paving the way for further studies into the superconducting mechanisms of crystalline graphene and the development of novel superconductor devices based on BBG.</description>

      <title>Large mechanical squeezing through synthetic magnetism in optomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to generate large amount of mechanical squeezing, far beyond the $\rm{3dB}$ limit, which is based on synthetic magnetism in optomechanical system that hosts a Backward Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (BSBS) process. Our benckmark system consists of an acoustic mode coupled to two optical modes through the BSBS process, and a Duffing mechanical oscillator that couples to the same optical modes through the standard optomechanical radiation pressure. The synthetic magnetism comes from the modulation of the mechanical coupling between the acoustic and the mechanical modes. When there is no synthetic magnetism, a given amount of mechanical squeezing is generated in the system. This squeezing is mainly dependent on the BSBS process, and it is fragile against thermal noise. By switching on the synthetic magnetism, the degree of the generated squeezing is greatly enhanced and goes far beyond the limit of the $\rm{3dB}$. This large magnetism induced squeezing persists even when there is no BSBS process in the system. Moreover, this generated squeezing is robust enough against thermal noise in comparison to the one induced when the synthetic magnetism is off. Furthermore, both the mechanical variance squeezing and effective phonon number exhibit series of peaks and dips depending on the phase modulation of the mechanical coupling. This oscillatory feature is reminscent of a sudden death and revival of squeezing phenomenon, which can be used to maintain a desired magnitude of squeezing by tuning this phase. Our proposal provides a path toward a flexible scheme that generates large amount of squeezing, far beyond the $\rm{3dB}$ limit. Such a generated squeezed states can be use for quantum applications including quantum information processing, quantum sensing and metrology, and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Neural network based deep learning analysis of semiconductor quantum dot qubits for automated control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning offers a largely unexplored avenue for improving noisy disordered devices in physics using automated algorithms. Through simulations that include disorder in physical devices, particularly quantum devices, there is potential to learn about disordered landscapes and subsequently tune devices based on those insights. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology that employs machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to discern the disorder landscape in the parameters of the disordered extended Hubbard model underlying the semiconductor quantum dot spin qubit architectures. This technique takes advantage of experimentally obtainable charge stability diagrams from neighboring quantum dot pairs, enabling the CNN to accurately identify disorder in each parameter of the extended Hubbard model. Remarkably, our CNN can process site-specific disorder in Hubbard parameters, including variations in hopping constants, on-site potentials (gate voltages), and both intra-site and inter-site Coulomb terms. This advancement facilitates the prediction of spatially dependent disorder across all parameters simultaneously with high accuracy ($R^2&gt;0.994$) and fewer parameter constraints, marking a significant improvement over previous methods that were focused only on analyzing on-site potentials at low coupling. Furthermore, our approach allows for the tuning of five or more quantum dots at a time, effectively addressing the often-overlooked issue of crosstalk. Not only does our method streamline the tuning process, potentially enabling fully automated adjustments, but it also introduces a "no trust" verification method to rigorously validate the neural network's predictions. Ultimately, this work aims to lay the groundwork for generalizing our method to tackle a broad spectrum of physical problems.</description>

Abstract: We consider adiabatic quantum pumping through a resonant level model, a single-level quantum dot connected to two fermionic leads. Using the tools of adiabatic expansion, we develop a consistent thermodynamic description of this model accounting for the variation of the energy level of the dot and the tunnelling rates with the thermal baths. This enables us to study various examples of pumping cycles computing the relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as the entropy produced and the dissipated power. These quantities are compared with the transport properties of the system, i.e. the pumped charge and the charge noise. Among other results, we find that the entropy production rate vanishes in the charge quantization limit while the dissipated power is quantized in the same limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional charges of anyons can be extracted from shot noise in two ways. One can use either the auto-correlation noise of the current in one drain or the cross-correlation noise between two drains on the two sides of the device. The former approach typically overestimates the charge. This may happen due to upstream edge modes. We propose a mechanism for the excess auto-correlation noise without upstream modes. It applies to systems with multiple co-propagating edge modes and assumes that the noise is measured at a low but non-zero frequency.</description>

      <title>Emergence of two-fold non-Hermitian spectral topology through synthetic spin engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The union of topology and non-Hermiticity has led to the unveiling of many intriguing phenomena. We introduce a synthetic spin-engineered model belonging to symmetry class AI, which is a rare occurrence, and demonstrate the emergence of a multi-fold spectral topology. As an example of our proposal, we engineer non-Hermiticity in the paradigmatic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model by introducing a generalized synthetic spin, leading to an emergent two-fold spectral topology that governs the decoupled behaviour of the corresponding non-Hermitian skin effect. As a consequence of the spin choice, our model exhibits a rich phase diagram consisting of distinct topological phases, which we characterize by introducing the notion of paired winding numbers, which, in turn, predict the direction of skin localization under open boundaries. We demonstrate that the choice of spin parameters enables control over the directionality of the skin effect, allowing for it to be unilateral or bilateral. Furthermore, we discover non-dispersive flat bands emerging within the inherent SSH model framework, arising from the spin-engineering approach. We also introduce a simplified toy model to capture the underlying physics of the emergent flat bands and direction-selective skin effect. As an illustration of experimental feasibility, we present a topoelectric circuit that faithfully emulates the underlying spin-engineered Hamiltonian, providing a viable platform for realizing our predicted effects. Our findings pave way for the exploration of unconventional spectral topology through spin-designed models.</description>

      <title>Exciton Spin Hall Effect In Arc-Shaped Strained WSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating a pure spin current using electrons, which have degrees of freedom beyond spin, such as electric charge and valley index, presents challenges. In response, we propose a novel mechanism based on intervalley exciton dynamics in {\em arc-shaped} strained transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to achieve the {\em exciton spin Hall effect} in an electrically insulating regime, without the need for an external electric field. The interplay between strain gradients and strain-induced pseudomagnetic fields results in a net Lorentz force on long-lived intervalley excitons in WSe$_2$, carrying non-zero spin angular momentum. This process generates an exciton-mediated pure spin Hall current, resulting in opposite-sign spin accumulations and local magnetization on the two sides of the single-layer arc-shaped TMD. We demonstrate that the magnetic field induced by spin accumulation, at approximately $\sim {\rm mT}$, can be detected using techniques such as superconducting quantum interference magnetometry or spatially-resolved magneto-optical Faraday and Kerr rotations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we employ the generalized Bloch theory to rediscover the generalized Brillouin zone theory and follow this way to obtain the Green's function of the non-Hermitian system. We focus on a classical chiral model and give the exact expression of the Green's function for a finite-size system and the formal expression of the Green's function suitable for infinite size. Based on these results, we further derive the correlation matrix and validate it numerically against direct calculations for a system of size 40. The numerical results show the accuracy of our exact expression and the high fidelity of our formal expression.</description>

      <title>Thermal boundary conductance and thermal conductivity strongly depend on nearby environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the nanoscale, the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) and thermal conductivity are not intrinsic properties of interfaces or materials but depend on the nearby environment. However, most studies focused on single interfaces or superlattices, and the thermal transport across heterostructures formed by multiple different materials is still mysterious. In this study, we demonstrate how much the TBC of an interface is affected by the existence of a second interface, as well as how much the thermal conductivity of a material is affected by the nearby materials. Using Si and Ge modeled by classical molecular dynamics simulations, the following phenomena are demonstrated. (1) The existence of a nearby interface can significantly change the TBC of the original interface. For example, by adding an interface after Si/Ge, the TBC can be increased from 400 to 700 MW/m2K. This is because the nearby interface serves as a filter of phonon modes, which selectively allows particular modes to pass through and affect the TBC of the original interfaces. This impact will disappear at the diffusive limit when the distance between interfaces is much longer than the phonon mean free path so that phonon modes recover equilibrium statistics before arriving at the second interface. (2) The thermal conductivity of a material can be significantly changed by the existence of neighboring materials. For example, a standalone 30-nm-thick Si's thermal conductivity can be increased from 50 to 280 W/mK, a more than 4-fold increase, beating the bulk thermal conductivity of Si, after being sandwiched between two Ge slabs. This is because the Ge slabs on the two sides serve as filters that only allow low-frequency phonons to transport heat in Si, which carry more heat than optical phonons. This work opens a new area of successive interface thermal transport and is expected to be important for nanoscale thermal characterization and thermal management of semiconductor devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between light and matter at the single quantum level and has played a central role in quantum science and technology. Combining the idea of cavity QED with moir\'e materials, we theoretically show that strong quantum light-matter interaction provides a way to control frustrated magnetism. Specifically, we develop a theory of moir\'e materials confined in a cavity consisting of thin polar van der Waals crystals. We show that nontrivial quantum geometry of moir\'e flat bands leads to electromagnetic vacuum dressing of electrons, which produces appreciable changes in single-electron energies and manifests itself as long-range electron hoppings. We apply our general formulation to a twisted transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayer encapsulated by ultrathin hexagonal boron nitride layers and predict its phase diagram at different twist angles and light-matter coupling strengths. Our results indicate that the cavity confinement enables one to control magnetic frustration of moir\'e materials and might allow for realizing various exotic phases such as a quantum spin liquid.</description>

Abstract: We propose new ideas to directly search for light dark matter, such as the axion or the dark photon, by using magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds. If the dark matter couples to the electron spin, it affects the evolution of the Bloch vectors consisting of the spin triplet states, which may be detected through several magnetometry techniques. We give several concrete examples with the use of dc and ac magnetometry and estimate the sensitivity on dark matter couplings.</description>

Abstract: We consider Josephson junctions formed by multiple superconductors with distinct phases and explore the formation of nonlocal or inter-superconductor pair correlations. We find that the multiple superconductor nature offers an additional degree of freedom that broadens the classification of pair symmetries, enabling nonlocal even- and odd-frequency pairings that can be highly controlled by the superconducting phases and the energy of the superconductors. Specially, when the phase difference between two superconductors is $\pi$, their associated nonlocal odd-frequency pairing is the only type of inter-superconductor pair correlations. Finally, we show that these nonlocal odd-frequency Cooper pairs dominate the nonlocal conductance via crossed Andreev reflections, which constitutes a direct evidence of odd-frequency pairing.</description>

Abstract: Polycrystalline {\alpha}-tantalum (110) films deposited on c-plane sapphire substrate by sputtering are used in superconducting qubits nowadays. However, these films always occasionally form other structures, such as {\alpha}-tantalum (111) grains and \b{eta}-tantalum grains. To improve the film quality, we investigate the growth of {\alpha}-tantalum (110) films on a-plane sapphire substrate under varying conditions by molecular beam epitaxy technology. The optimized {\alpha}-tantalum (110) film is single crystal, with a smooth surface and atomically flat metal-substrate interface. The film with thickness of 30 nm shows a Tc of 4.12K and a high residual resistance ratio of 9.53. The quarter wavelength coplanar waveguide resonators fabricated with the 150 nm optimized {\alpha}-tantalum (110) film, exhibits intrinsic quality factor of over one million under single photon excitation at millikelvin temperature.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Mixed-state Quantum Topological Order</title>

Abstract: Decoherence is a major obstacle to the preparation of topological order in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we show that decoherence can also give rise to new types of topological order. Specifically, we construct concrete examples by proliferating fermionic anyons in the toric code via local quantum channels. The resulting mixed states retain long-range entanglement, which manifests in the nonzero topological entanglement negativity, though the topological quantum memory is destroyed by decoherence. By comparison to the gapless spin liquid in pure states, we show that the identified states represent a novel intrinsic mixed-state quantum topological order, which has no counterpart in pure states. Through the lens of quantum anomalies of 1-form symmetries, we then provide general constructions of intrinsic mixed-state quantum topological order, and reveal the existence of non-bosonic deconfined anyons as another key feature of these novel phases. The extended meaning and characterization of deconfined excitations and their statistics in mixed states are clarified. Moreover, when these deconfined anyons have nontrivial braiding statistics, we prove that the mixed states %must be bipartite long-range entangled for any bipartition. That is, such mixed states cannot be prepared via finite-depth local quantum channels from any bipartite separable states. We further demonstrate our construction using the decohered Kitaev honeycomb model and the decohered double semion model. In the latter case, a surprising scenario arises where decoherence gives rise to additional types of deconfined anyons.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable Josephson diode effect in Rashba spin-orbit coupled quantum dot junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically explore Josephson diode effect (JDE) in superconductor/quantum dot (QD)/superconductor junction in the presence of a magnetic field and Rashba spin-orbit interaction (RSOI). We calculate the Josephson current in our QD junction using Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function technique. We show that JDE is induced in our chiral QD junction with large rectification coefficient (RC) in the presence of RSOI and external magnetic field simultaneously. Interestingly, the sign and magnitude of the RC are highly controllable by the magnetic field and RSOI. For realistic RSOI strength in the presence of magnetic field and chirality, the RC can be tuned to be as high as $70\%$ by an external gate potential, indicating a giant JDE in our QD junction. Our proposed QD-based Josephson diode (JD) may serve as a potential superconducting device component.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory of the vortex spin Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory of the vortex spin Hall effect, i.e., a spin Hall effect that is driven by the motion of superconducting vortices. For the direct vortex spin Hall effect in which an input charge current drives the transverse spin current accompanying the vortex motion, we start from the well-known Schmid-Caroli-Maki solution for the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation under the applied electric field, and find out the expression of the induced spin current. For the inverse vortex spin Hall effect in which an input spin current drives the longitudinal vortex motion and produces the transverse charge current, we microscopically construct the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation under the applied spin accumulation gradient, and calculate the induced transverse charge current as well as the open circuit voltage. The time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and its analytical solution developed here can be a basis for more quantitative numerical simulations of the vortex spin Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Explainable Classification Techniques for Quantum Dot Device Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the physical sciences, there is an increased need for robust feature representations of image data: image acquisition, in the generalized sense of two-dimensional data, is now widespread across a large number of fields, including quantum information science, which we consider here. While traditional image features are widely utilized in such cases, their use is rapidly being supplanted by Neural Network-based techniques that often sacrifice explainability in exchange for high accuracy. To ameliorate this trade-off, we propose a synthetic data-based technique that results in explainable features. We show, using Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs), that this method offers superior explainability without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, we show that there is a meaningful benefit to this technique in the context of quantum dot tuning, where human intervention is necessary at the current stage of development.</description>

      <title>BCS surrogate models for floating superconductor-semiconductor hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18357</link>

Abstract: Superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, involving quantum dots interfaced with floating and/or grounded superconductors, have reached a level of complexity which calls for the development of versatile and numerically efficient modelling tools. Here, we propose an extension of the surrogate model solver for sub-gap states [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023)], which is able to handle floating superconducting islands with finite charging energy. Upon eliminating all finite-size effects of the computationally demanding Richardson model approach, we achieve a more efficient way of calculating the sub-gap spectra and related observables without compromising their accuracy. We provide a number of benchmarks between the two approaches and showcase the versatility of the extended surrogate model solver by studying the stability of spin-triplet ground states in various tunable devices. The methods introduced here set the stage for reliable microscopic simulations of complex superconducting quantum circuits across all their relevant parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of twist-dependent electron transfer rate in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular simulation and continuum dielectric theory, we consider how electrochemical kinetics are modulated as a function of twist angle in bilayer graphene electrodes. By establishing an effective connection between twist angle and the screening length of charge carriers within the electrode, we investigate how tunable metallicity can result in modified statistics of the electron transfer energy gap. Constant potential molecular simulations show that the activation free energy for electron transfer is an increasing function of the screening length, or decreasing function the density of states at the Fermi energy in the electrode, and subsequently a non-monotonic function of twist angle. We find the twist angle alters the density of states, which tunes the number of thermally-accessible channels for electron transfer, as well as the reorganization energy by altering the stability of the vertically excited state through attenuated image charge interactions. Understanding these effects allows us to cast the Marcus rate of interfacial electron transfer as a function of twist angle, in a manner consistent with a growing body of experimental observations.</description>
