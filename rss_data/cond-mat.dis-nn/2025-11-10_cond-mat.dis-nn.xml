      <title>Interpretable disorder-promoted synchronization and coherence in coupled laser networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled lasers offer a promising approach to scaling the power output of photonic devices for applications demanding high frequency precision and beam coherence. However, maintaining coherence among lasers remains a fundamental challenge due to desynchronizing instabilities arising from time delay in the optical coupling. Here, we depart from the conventional notion that disorder is detrimental to synchronization and instead propose an interpretable mechanism through which heterogeneity in the laser parameters can be harnessed to promote synchronization. Our approach allows stabilization of pre-specified synchronous states that, while abundant, are often unstable in systems of identical lasers. The results show that stable synchronization enabling coherence can be frequently achieved by introducing intermediate levels of random mismatches in any of several laser constructive parameters. Our results establish a principled framework for enhancing coherence in large laser networks, offering a robust strategy for power scaling in photonic systems.</description>

      <title>From single-particle to many-body chaos in Yukawa--SYK: theory and a cavity-QED proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how quantum systems transition from integrable to fully chaotic behavior remains a central open problem in physics. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model provides a paradigmatic framework for studying many-body chaos and holography, yet it captures only the strongly correlated limit, leaving intermediate regimes unexplored. Here, we investigate the Yukawa--SYK (YSYK) model, where bosonic fields mediate random fermionic interactions, and demonstrate that it naturally bridges single-particle and many-body chaos. Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, we perform a comprehensive finite-size characterization of the YSYK model. We show that the interaction strength acts as a tunable control parameter interpolating between the SYK$_2$ and SYK$_4$ limits, and introduce a framework enabling direct and quantitative comparison with these benchmark models. In the intermediate regimes, we uncover distinct dynamical regimes marked by partial ergodicity breaking, prethermalization plateaus, and incomplete scrambling. Finally, we propose a feasible optical-cavity implementation of the YSYK model using ultra-cold atoms. Our results establish the YSYK model as a unifying platform connecting single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental observation of these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Neural Network Performance and Interpretability of Quantum Wavefunction Probability Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting quantum wavefunction probability distributions is crucial for computational chemistry and materials science, yet machine learning (ML) models often face a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. This study compares Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) in modeling quantum probability distributions for the H$_{2}^+$ ion, leveraging data generated via Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While ANN achieved superior accuracy (R$^2$ = 0.99 vs ANFIS's 0.95 with Gaussian membership functions), it required over 50x more parameters (2,305 vs 39-45). ANFIS, however, provided unique interpretability: its Gaussian membership functions encoded spatial electron localization near proton positions ($\mu = 1.2 A$), mirroring Born probability densities, while fuzzy rules reflected quantum superposition principles. Rules prioritizing the internuclear direction revealed the system's 1D symmetry, aligning with Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals theory--a novel data-driven perspective on orbital hybridization. Membership function variances ($\sigma$) further quantified electron delocalization trends, and peak prediction errors highlighted unresolved quantum cusps. The choice of functions critically impacted performance: Gaussian/Generalized Bell outperformed Sigmoid, with errors improving as training data increased, showing scalability. This study underscores the context-dependent value of ML: ANN for precision and ANFIS for interpretable, parameter-efficient approximations that link inputs to physical behavior. These findings advocate hybrid approaches in quantum simulations, balancing accuracy with explainability to accelerate discovery. Future work should extend ANFIS to multi-electron systems and integrate domain-specific constraints (e.g., kinetic energy terms), bridging data-driven models and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Engineering Anderson Localization in Arbitrary Dimensions with Interacting Quasiperiodic Kicked Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay of interactions and quasiperiodic driving in the Lieb-Liniger model of one-dimensional bosons subjected to a sequence of delta kicks. Building on the known mapping between the kicked rotor and the Anderson model, we show that both interparticle interactions and quasiperiodic modulations of the kicking strength can independently and simultaneously generate synthetic dimensions. In the absence of modulation, interactions between two bosons already promote an effective two-dimensional Anderson model. Introducing one or two additional incommensurate frequencies further extends the system to three and four effective dimensions, respectively. Through extensive numerical simulations of the two-body dynamics and finite-time scaling analysis, we observe Anderson localization and the associated critical behavior characteristic of the orthogonal universality class. This combined use of interactions and quasiperiodic driving thus provides a versatile framework for emulating Anderson localization and its transition in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Compensation between the parameters of the Jonschers's Universal Relaxation Law in disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18515v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental results for a huge number of different materials published during the past fifty years confirm the validity of the Jonscher's Universal Dielectric Response Law. Accordingly,the ac conductivity is a fractional power of frequency. Otemperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, spectra recorded at different temperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, as well. The dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac conductivity are three state variables, which describe the electric and dielectric properties. These constitute a unique relation by merging the Dielectric Response Law and the Ghosh - Pan Scaling Rule, respectively. A partial differentiation chain theorem combined with the temperature dependencies of the dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac response, establishes a compensation rule between the parameters of the Universal Dielectric Response Law. The compatibility of the present theorynwth published experimental data is discussed.</description>

      <title>Unifying Anderson transitions and topological amplification in non-Hermitian chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems with non-reciprocal hopping may display the non-Hermitian skin effect, where states under open boundary conditions localize exponentially at one edge of the system. This localization has been linked to spectral winding and topological gain, forming a bulk-boundary correspondence akin to the one relating edge modes to bulk topological invariants in topological insulators and superconductors. In this work, we establish a bulk-boundary correspondence for disordered Hatano-Nelson models. We relate the localization of states to spectral winding using the Lyapunov exponent and the Thouless formula. We identify two kinds of phase transitions and relate them to transport properties. Our framework is relevant to a broad class of 1D non-Hermitian models, opening new directions for disorder-resilient transport and quantum-enhanced sensing in photonic, optomechanical, and superconducting platforms.</description>

      <title>Local insulator-to-superconductor transition in amorphous InO$_x$ films modulated by e-beam irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method enabling precise post-fabrication modulation of the electrical resistance in micrometer-scale regions of amorphous indium oxide (a-InO$_x$) films. By subjecting initially insulating films to an electron beam at room temperature, we demonstrate that the exposed region of the films becomes superconducting. The resultant superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) is adjustable up to 2.8 K by changing the electron dose and accelerating voltage. This technique offers a compelling alternative to traditional a-InO$_x$ annealing methods for both fundamental investigations and practical applications. Moreover, it empowers independent adjustment of electrical properties across initially identical a-InO$_x$ samples on the same substrate, facilitating the creation of superconducting microstructures with precise $T_c$ control at the micrometer scale. Some possible mechanisms for the observed resistance modifications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Gyromorphs: a new class of functional disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of functional correlated disordered materials, termed Gyromorphs, which uniquely combine liquid-like translational disorder with quasi-long-range rotational order, induced by a ring of $G$ delta peaks in their structure factor. We generate gyromorphs in $2d$ and $3d$ by spectral optimization methods, verifying that they display strong discrete rotational order but no long-range translational order, while maintaining rotational isotropy at short range for sufficiently large $G$. Using a coupled dipoles approximation, we numerically show that these structures outperform quasicrystals, stealthy hyperuniformity, and Vogel spirals in the formation of low-index-contrast isotropic bandgaps in $2d$, for both scalar and vector waves, and open complete isotropic bandgaps in $3d$. This claim is further supported by analytical effective-medium theory and by numerical estimates of scattering mean-free paths. Finally, we introduce ``polygyromorphs'' with several rotational symmetries at different length scales (i.e., multiple rings of delta peaks), enabling the formation of multiple bandgaps in a single structure, thereby paving the way for fine control over optical properties.</description>

      <title>Topological Modes in Monitored Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum systems both driven by unitary evolutions and monitored through measurements have proved to be fertile ground for exploring new dynamical quantum matters. While the entanglement structure and symmetry properties of monitored systems have been intensively studied, the role of topology in monitored dynamics is much less explored. In this work, we investigate novel topological phenomena in the monitored dynamics through the lens of free-fermion systems. Free-fermion monitored dynamics were previously shown to be unified with the Anderson localization problem under the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classification. Guided by this unification, we identify the topological area-law-entangled phases in the former setting through the topological classification of disordered insulators and superconductors in the latter. As examples, we focus on 1+1D free-fermion monitored dynamics in two symmetry classes, DIII and A. We construct quantum circuit models to study different topological area-law phases and their domain walls in the respective symmetry classes. We find that the domain wall between topologically distinct area-law phases hosts dynamical topological modes whose entanglement is protected from being quenched by the measurements in the monitored dynamics. We demonstrate how to manipulate these topological modes by programming the domain-wall dynamics. In particular, for topological modes in class DIII, which behave as unmeasured Majorana modes, we devise a protocol to braid them and study the entanglement generated in the braiding process.</description>

      <title>Scaling theory of fading ergodicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In most noninteracting quantum systems, the scaling theory of localization predicts one-parameter scaling flow in both ergodic and localized regimes. On the other hand, it is expected that the one-parameter scaling hypothesis breaks down for interacting systems that exhibit the many-body ergodicity breaking transition. Here we introduce a scaling theory of fading ergodicity, which is a precursor regime of many-body ergodicity breaking. We argue that the two-parameter scaling governs the entire ergodic regime; however, (i) it evolves into the one-parameter scaling at the ergodicity breaking critical point with the critical exponent $\nu=1$, and (ii) it gives rise to the resilient one-parameter scaling close to the ETH point. Our theoretical framework may serve as a building block for two-parameter scaling theories of many-body systems.</description>
