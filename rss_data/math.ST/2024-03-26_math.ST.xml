      <title>Geometric planted matchings beyond the Gaussian model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering an unknown matching between a set of $n$ randomly placed points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and random perturbations of these points. This can be seen as a model for particle tracking and more generally, entity resolution. We use matchings in random geometric graphs to derive minimax lower bounds for this problem that hold under great generality. Using these results we show that for a broad class of distributions, the order of the number of mistakes made by an estimator that minimizes the sum of squared Euclidean distances is minimax optimal when $d$ is fixed and is optimal up to $n^{o(1)}$ factors when $d = o(\log n)$. In the high-dimensional regime we consider a setup where both initial positions and perturbations have independent sub-Gaussian coordinates. In this setup we give sufficient conditions under which the same estimator makes no mistakes with high probability. We prove an analogous result for an adapted version of this estimator that incorporates information on the covariance matrix of the perturbations.</description>

      <title>Computing conservative probabilities of rare events with surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a critical review of the main methods used to produce conservative estimators of probabilities of rare events, or critical failures, for reliability and certification studies in the broadest sense. These probabilities must theoretically be calculated from simulations of (certified) numerical models, but which typically suffer from prohibitive computational costs. This occurs frequently, for instance, for complex and critical industrial systems. We focus therefore in adapting the common use of surrogates to replace these numerical models, the aim being to offer a high level of confidence in the results. We suggest avenues of research to improve the guarantees currently reachable.</description>

      <title>Counting Stars is Constant-Degree Optimal For Detecting Any Planted Subgraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the computational limits of the following general hypothesis testing problem. Let H=H_n be an \emph{arbitrary} undirected graph on n vertices. We study the detection task between a ``null'' Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph G(n,p) and a ``planted'' random graph which is the union of G(n,p) together with a random copy of H=H_n. Our notion of planted model is a generalization of a plethora of recently studied models initiated with the study of the planted clique model (Jerrum 1992), which corresponds to the special case where H is a k-clique and p=1/2.
  Over the last decade, several papers have studied the power of low-degree polynomials for limited choices of H's in the above task. In this work, we adopt a unifying perspective and characterize the power of \emph{constant degree} polynomials for the detection task, when \emph{H=H_n is any arbitrary graph} and for \emph{any p=\Omega(1).} Perhaps surprisingly, we prove that the optimal constant degree polynomial is always given by simply \emph{counting stars} in the input random graph. As a direct corollary, we conclude that the class of constant-degree polynomials is only able to ``sense'' the degree distribution of the planted graph H, and no other graph theoretic property of it.</description>

      <title>Sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum hypothesis testing has been traditionally studied from the information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of samples of an unknown state. In this paper, we study the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of samples needed to reach a desired error probability. By making use of the wealth of knowledge that already exists in the literature on quantum hypothesis testing, we characterize the sample complexity of binary quantum hypothesis testing in the symmetric and asymmetric settings, and we provide bounds on the sample complexity of multiple quantum hypothesis testing. In more detail, we prove that the sample complexity of symmetric binary quantum hypothesis testing depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the fidelity. As a counterpart of the quantum Stein's lemma, we also find that the sample complexity of asymmetric binary quantum hypothesis testing depends logarithmically on the inverse type~II error probability and inversely on the quantum relative entropy. Finally, we provide lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of multiple quantum hypothesis testing, with it remaining an intriguing open question to improve these bounds.</description>

      <title>Improved covariance estimation: optimal robustness and sub-Gaussian guarantees under heavy tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an estimator of the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ of random $d$-dimensional vector from an i.i.d. sample of size $n$. Our sole assumption is that this vector satisfies a bounded $L^p-L^2$ moment assumption over its one-dimensional marginals, for some $p\geq 4$. Given this, we show that $\Sigma$ can be estimated from the sample with the same high-probability error rates that the sample covariance matrix achieves in the case of Gaussian data. This holds even though we allow for very general distributions that may not have moments of order $&gt;p$. Moreover, our estimator can be made to be optimally robust to adversarial contamination. This result improves the recent contributions by Mendelson and Zhivotovskiy and Catoni and Giulini, and matches parallel work by Abdalla and Zhivotovskiy (the exact relationship with this last work is described in the paper).</description>

      <title>Differentially private multivariate medians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical tools which satisfy rigorous privacy guarantees are necessary for modern data analysis. It is well-known that robustness against contamination is linked to differential privacy. Despite this fact, using multivariate medians for differentially private and robust multivariate location estimation has not been systematically studied. We develop novel finite-sample performance guarantees for differentially private multivariate depth-based medians, which are essentially sharp. Our results cover commonly used depth functions, such as the halfspace (or Tukey) depth, spatial depth, and the integrated dual depth. We show that under Cauchy marginals, the cost of heavy-tailed location estimation outweighs the cost of privacy. We demonstrate our results numerically using a Gaussian contamination model in dimensions up to d = 100, and compare them to a state-of-the-art private mean estimation algorithm. As a by-product of our investigation, we prove concentration inequalities for the output of the exponential mechanism about the maximizer of the population objective function. This bound applies to objective functions that satisfy a mild regularity condition.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Gaussian Approximation for Random Forest via Region-based Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive Gaussian approximation bounds for random forest predictions based on a set of training points given by a Poisson process, under fairly mild regularity assumptions on the data generating process. Our approach is based on the key observation that the random forest predictions satisfy a certain geometric property called region-based stabilization. In the process of developing our results for the random forest, we also establish a probabilistic result, which might be of independent interest, on multivariate Gaussian approximation bounds for general functionals of Poisson process that are region-based stabilizing. This general result makes use of the Malliavin-Stein method, and is potentially applicable to various related statistical problems.</description>

      <title>Recursive Neyman Algorithm for Optimum Sample Allocation under Box Constraints on Sample Sizes in Strata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07034v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimum sample allocation in stratified sampling is one of the basic issues of survey methodology. It is a procedure of dividing the overall sample size into strata sample sizes in such a way that for given sampling designs in strata the variance of the stratified $\pi$ estimator of the population total (or mean) for a given study variable assumes its minimum. In this work, we consider the optimum allocation of a sample, under lower and upper bounds imposed jointly on sample sizes in strata. We are concerned with the variance function of some generic form that, in particular, covers the case of the simple random sampling without replacement in strata. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we establish (using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions) a generic form of the optimal solution, the so-called optimality conditions. Second, based on the established optimality conditions, we derive an efficient recursive algorithm, named RNABOX, which solves the allocation problem under study. The RNABOX can be viewed as a generalization of the classical recursive Neyman allocation algorithm, a popular tool for optimum allocation when only upper bounds are imposed on sample strata-sizes. We implement RNABOX in R as a part of our package stratallo which is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) repository.</description>

      <title>On the large deviation principle for Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chains: the Lyapunov function condition and examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With an aim to analyse the performance of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, in our recent work we derive a large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical measures of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) chains on a continuous state space. One of the (sufficient) assumptions for the LDP involves the existence of a particular type of Lyapunov function, and it was left as an open question whether or not such a function exists for specific choices of MH samplers. In this paper we analyse the properties of such Lyapunov functions and investigate their existence for some of the most popular choices of MCMC samplers built on MH dynamics: Independent Metropolis Hastings, Random Walk Metropolis, and the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm. We establish under what conditions such a Lyapunov function exists, and from this obtain LDPs for some instances of the MCMC algorithms under consideration. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first large deviation results for empirical measures associated with Metropolis-Hastings chains for specific choices of proposal and target distributions.</description>
