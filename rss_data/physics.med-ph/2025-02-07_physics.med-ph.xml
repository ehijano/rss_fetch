      <title>Calculation of a force effect from muscle action to a quaternion-based musculoskeletal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euler angle representation in biomechanical analysis allows straightforward description of joints rotations. However, application of Euler angles could be limited due to singularity called gimbal lock. Quaternions offer an alternative way to describe rotations but they have been mostly avoided in biomechanics as they are complex and not inherently intuitive, specifically in dynamic models actuated by muscles. This study introduces a mathematical framework for describing muscle actions in dynamic quaternion-based musculoskeletal simulations. The proposed method estimates muscle torques in quaternion-based musculoskeletal model. Its application is shown on three-dimensional double-pendulum system actuated by muscle elements. Furthermore, transformation of muscle moment arms obtained from muscle paths based on Euler angles into quaternions description is presented. The proposed method is advantageous for dynamic modeling of musculoskeletal models with complex kinematics and large range of motion like the shoulder joint.</description>

      <title>A Physiological-Model-Based Neural Network Framework for Blood Pressure Estimation from Photoplethysmography Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous blood pressure (BP) estimation via photoplethysmography (PPG) remains a significant challenge, particularly in providing comprehensive cardiovascular insights for hypertensive complications. This study presents a novel physiological model-based neural network (PMB-NN) framework for BP estimation from PPG signals, incorporating the identification of total peripheral resistance (TPR) and arterial compliance (AC) to enhance physiological interpretability. Preliminary experimental results, obtained from a single healthy participant under varying activity intensities, demonstrated promising accuracy, with a median root mean square error of 6.69 mmHg for systolic BP and 3.26 mmHg for diastolic BP. The median (min, max) difference between estimated and measured TPR was 0.043 (0.024, 0.061) mmHg*s/cm^3. As expected, estimated TPR decreased with increasing activity intensity, while AC increased within a physiologically plausible range (0.5-2.5 cm^3/mmHg).</description>

      <title>A necessary condition for the guarantee of the superiorization method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a method that involves principally convex feasibility-seeking and makes secondary efforts of objective function value reduction. This is the well-known superiorization method (SM), where the iterates of an asymptotically convergent iterative feasibility-seeking algorithm are perturbed by objective function nonascent steps. We investigate the question under what conditions a sequence generated by an SM algorithm asymptotically converges to a feasible point whose objective function value is superior (meaning smaller or equal) to that of a feasible point reached by the corresponding unperturbed one (i.e., the exactly same feasibility-seeking algorithm that the SM algorithm employs.) This question is yet only partially answered in the literature. We present a condition under which an SM algorithm that uses negative gradient descent steps in its perturbations fails to yield such a superior outcome. The significance of the discovery of this negative condition is that it necessitates that the inverse of this condition will have to be assumed to hold in any future guarantee result for the SM. The condition is important for practitioners who use the SM because it is avoidable in experimental work with the SM, thus increasing the success rate of the method in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A Cloud-native Agile approach to cyber platform prototyping and integration for astronomy: the ENGAGE SKA case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Observatory is gearing up the formal construction of its two radio interferometers in Australia and South Africa after the end of design and pre-construction phases. Agile methodologies, the Cloud native Computing technologies and the DevOps software ideas are influencing the design of compute infrastructures that will be key to reduce the operational costs of SKA while improving the control and monitoring of the SKA antennas and ancillary systems, Correlators, HPC facilities or related data centre tiered systems. These tools will likely include advanced power metering technologies and efficient distribution automation and Network Operation Centres (NOC). SKA will become the world's largest radio telescope and is expected to achieve its first science by 2026. To cope with this dimension and complexity, a key part of this distributed Observatory is the overall software control and monitoring system embodied in the Observatory Management and Control (OMC) and the Services Teams that requires specialized Agile Teams to assist in software and cyber infrastructure building using an Agile development environment that includes test automation, Continuous Integration, and Continuous Deployment. To manage such a large and distributed machine, the Agile approach was adopted for the core software package of the SKA Telescope aimed at scheduling observations, controlling their execution, monitoring the telescope status and ensuring scalability and reliability. Here, we report on the ENGAGE SKA ciberinfrastructure prototyping support to the SKA Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</description>

      <title>Effects of skull properties on long-pulsed transcranial focused ultrasound transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08489v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound can deliver energy to the brain in a minimally invasive manner for neuromodulation applications. However, continuous sonication through the skull introduces significant wave interactions, complicating precise energy delivery to the target. We present a comprehensive examination of intracranial acoustic fields generated by focused ultrasound transducers and assess the characteristics of cranial bone that affect acoustic transmission. Acoustic field maps were generated at 88 regions of interest across 10 historical and 2 Thiel-embalmed human skull specimens with sonication at frequencies of 220 kHz, 650 kHz, and 1000 kHz. The average peak pressure insertion losses for historical were 3.6$\pm$3.4 dB, 9.3$\pm$3.3 dB, and 14.8$\pm$5.8 dB, respectively, and for Thiel skulls, the respective losses were 2.9$\pm$1.8 dB, 9.4$\pm$2.6 dB, and 17.0$\pm$5.5 dB. The effect of skull thickness, skull density ratio, and skull curvature on intracranial peak pressure, power and focal area was investigated and linear fits produced. Several unfavorable focusing performances were observed in regions with excessive thickness variation. The effects of angulation and spacing between the transducer and the skull were also investigated. Preliminary findings indicate that wave superposition resulting from skull and transducer spacing could lead to a 30-40% uncertainty in peak recorded intracranial pressure.</description>

      <title>Censor-Aware Semi-Supervised Survival Time Prediction in Lung Cancer Using Clinical and Radiomics Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objectives: Lung cancer poses a significant global health challenge, necessitating improved prognostic methods for personalized treatment. This study introduces a censor-aware semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework that integrates clinical and imaging data, addressing biases in traditional models handling censored data. Methods: We analyzed clinical, PET and CT data from 199 lung cancer patients from public and local data respositories, focusing on overall survival (OS) time as the primary outcome. Handcrafted (HRF) and Deep Radiomics features (DRF) were extracted after preprocessing using ViSERA software and were combined with clinical features (CF). Feature dimensions were optimized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), followed by the application of supervised learning (SL) and SSL. SSL incorporated pseudo-labeling of censored data to improve performance. Seven regressors and three hazard ratio survival analysis (HRSA) algorithms were optimized using five-fold cross-validation, grid search and external test bootstrapping. Results: For PET HRFs, SSL reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) by 26.5%, achieving 1.55 years with PCA+decision tree regression, compared to SL's 2.11 years with PCA+KNNR (p&lt;0.05). Combining HRFs (CT_HRF) and DRFs from CT images using SSL+PCA+KNNR achieved an MAE of 2.08 years, outperforming SL's 2.26 years by 7.96% (p&lt;0.05). In HRSA, CT_HRF applied to PCA+Component Wise Gradient Boosting Survival Analysis achieved an external c-index of 0.65, effectively differentiating high- and low-risk groups. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the SSL strategy significantly outperforms SL across PET, CT, and CF. As such, censor-aware SSL applied to HRFs from PET images significantly improved survival prediction performance by 26.5% compared to the SL approach.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic cesium iodide as a potential PET material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Total Body PET (TBPET) scanners have recently demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce both acquisition time and the administered radioactive dose, thanks to their increased sensitivity. However, their widespread adoption is limited by the high costs associated with the current available systems. Cesium iodide (CsI), though historically less favored for PET due to its lower stopping power and light yield compared to crystals like LYSO, shows remarkable improvement when operated at cryogenic temperatures ($\sim$100 K). Under these conditions, CsI light yield rises dramatically to about 100 photons/keV, providing excellent energy resolution and good coincidence time resolution at a lower cost - typically 3 to 5 times cheaper than other crystals at parity of radiation length. In our study, we measured the light yield, the energy resolution and the coincidence time resolution as a function of temperature for two pure CsI crystals read out by a pair of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). An energy resolution of 6.3% FWHM and a coincidence time resolution of 1.84 ns at 511 keV were achieved at a temperature of 104 K. These results point towards the potential of cryogenic CsI as a cost-effective, high-performance material for TBPET scanners.</description>
