      <title>Colouring of Maximal $F$-free Subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each finite poset $F$ with $|F| &gt; 1$, $\chi_{ac}(F)$ denotes the smallest integer $n$ (if it exists) such that the elements of every finite poset $P$ with $|P| &gt; 1$ can be coloured with at most $n$ colours so that every maximal $F$-free subset of $P$ with more than one element gets at least two colours. In this note we discuss the problem of determining $\chi_{ac}(F)$ for each poset $F$, give one new result, and summarize what is known for posets $F$ with at most four elements.</description>

      <title>Some Results on Critical ($P_5,H$)-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$, a graph is $(H_1,H_2)$-free if it contains no induced subgraph isomorphic to $H_1$ nor $H_2$. A graph $G$ is $k$-vertex-critical if every proper induced subgraph of $G$ has chromatic number less than $k$, but $G$ has chromatic number $k$. The study of $k$-vertex-critical graphs for specific graph classes is an important topic in algorithmic graph theory because if the number of such graphs that are in a given hereditary graph class is finite, then there exists a polynomial-time certifying algorithm to decide the $k$-colorability of a graph in the class. In this paper, we show that: (1) for $k \ge 1$, there are finitely many $k$-vertex-critical $(P_5,K_{1,4}+P_1)$-free graphs; (2) for $s \ge 1$, there are finitely many 5-vertex-critical $(P_5,K_{1,s}+P_1)$-free graphs; (3) for $k \ge 1$, there are finitely many $k$-vertex-critical $(P_5,\overline{K_3+2P_1})$-free graphs. Moreover, we characterize all $5$-vertex-critical $(P_5,H)$-free graphs where $H \in \{K_{1,3}+P_1,K_{1,4}+P_1,\overline{K_3+2P_1}\}$ using an exhaustive graph generation algorithm.</description>

      <title>The metric Menger problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the well-known disjoint paths problem which we call the metric Menger problem, denoted MM(r,k), where one is given two subsets of a graph and must decide whether they can be connected by $k$ paths of pairwise distance at least $r$. We prove that this problem is NP-complete for every $r\geq 3$ and $k\geq 2$ by giving a reduction from 3SAT. This resolves a conjecture recently stated by Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu. On the other hand, we show that the problem is in XP when parameterised by treewidth and maximum degree by observing that it is `locally checkable'. In the case $r\leq 3$, we prove that it suffices to parameterise by treewidth. We also state some open questions relating to this work.</description>

      <title>On certain properties of the $p$-unitary Cayley graph over a finite ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, we study certain Cayley graphs associated with a finite commutative ring and their multiplicative subgroups. Among various results that we prove, we provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for such a Cayley graph to be prime. In this paper, we continue this line of research. Specifically, we investigate some basic properties of certain $p$-unitary Cayeley graphs associated with a finite commutative ring. In particular, under some mild conditions, we provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for this graph to be prime.</description>

      <title>Improved Lower Bounds for Property B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If an $n$-uniform hypergraph can be 2-colored, then it is said to have property B. Erd\H{o}s (1963) was the first to give lower and upper bounds for the minimal size $m(n)$ of an $n$-uniform hypergraph without property B. His asymptotic upper bound $O(n^22^n)$ still is the best we know, his lower bound $2^{n-1}$ has seen a number of improvements, with the current best $\Omega$ $(2^n\sqrt{n/\log(n)})$ established by Radhakrishnan and Srinivasan (2000). Cherkashin and Kozik (2014) provided a simplified proof of this result, using Pluh\'ar's (2009) idea of a random greedy coloring. In the present paper, we use a refined version of this argument to obtain improved lower bounds on $m(n)$ for small values of $n$. We also study $m(n,v)$, the size of the smallest $n$-hypergraph without property B having $v$ vertices.</description>

      <title>On the multicolor Ramsey numbers of balanced double stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The balanced double star on $2n+2$ vertices, denoted $S_{n,n}$, is the tree obtained by joining the centers of two disjoint stars each having $n$ leaves. Let $R_r(G)$ be the smallest integer $N$ such that in every $r$-coloring of the edges of $K_N$ there is a monochromatic copy of $G$, and let $R_r^{\mathrm{bip}}(G)$ be the smallest integer $N$ such that in every $r$-coloring of the edges of $K_{N,N}$ there is a monochromatic copy of $G$. It is known that $R_2(S_{n,n})=3n+2$ and $R_2^{\mathrm{bip}}(S_{n,n})=2n+1$ \cite{HJ}, but very little is known about $R_r(S_{n,n})$ and $R^{\mathrm{bip}}_r(S_{n,n})$ when $r\geq 3$ (other than the bounds which follow from considerations on the number of edges in the majority color class).
  In this paper we prove the following for all $n\geq 1$ (where the lower bounds are adapted from existing examples): \[(r-1)2n+1\leq R_r(S_{n,n})\leq (r-\frac{1}{2})(2n+2)-1,\]and
  \[(2r-4)n+1\leq R^{\mathrm{bip}}_r(S_{n,n})\leq (2r-3+\frac{2}{r}+O(\frac{1}{r^2}))n.\] These bounds are similar to the best known bounds on $R_r(P_{2n+2})$ and $R_r^{\mathrm{bip}}(P_{2n+2})$, where $P_{2n+2}$ is a path on $2n+2$ vertices (which is also a balanced tree). We also give an example which improves the lower bound on $R^{\mathrm{bip}}_r(S_{n,n})$ when $r=3$ and $r=5$.</description>

      <title>Generalized polynomials and hyperplane functions in $(\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z})^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $p$ prime, let $\mathcal{H}^n$ be the linear span of characteristic functions of hyperplanes in $(\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z})^n$. We establish new upper bounds on the dimension of $\mathcal{H}^n$ over $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$, or equivalently, on the rank of point-hyperplane incidence matrices in $(\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z})^n$ over $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$. Our proof is based on a variant of the polynomial method using binomial coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z}$ as generalized polynomials. We also establish additional necessary conditions for a function on $(\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z})^n$ to be an element of $\mathcal{H}^n$.</description>

      <title>A survey of degree-boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a graph has no large balanced bicliques, but has large minimum degree, then what can we say about its induced subgraphs? This question motivates the study of degree-boundedness, which is like $\chi$-boundedness but for minimum degree instead of chromatic number. We survey this area with an eye towards open problems.</description>

      <title>A direct proof of well-definedness for the polymatroid Tutte polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a polymatroid $P$ over $[n]$, Bernardi, K\'{a}lm\'{a}n and Postnikov [\emph{Adv. Math.} 402 (2022) 108355] introduced the polymatroid Tutte polynomial $\mathscr{T}_{P}$ relying on the order $1&lt;2&lt;\cdots&lt;n$ of $[n]$, which generalizes the classical Tutte polynomial from matroids to polymatroids. They proved the independence of this order by the fact that $\mathscr{T}_{P}$ is equivalent to another polynomial that only depends on $P$. In this paper, similar to the Tutte's original proof of the well-definedness of the Tutte polynomial defined by the summation over all spanning trees using activities depending on the order of edges, we give a direct and elementary proof of the well-definedness of the polymatroid Tutte polynomial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halin's well-known grid theorem states that a graph $G$ with a thick end must contain a subdivision of the hexagonal half-grid. We obtain the following strengthening when $G$ is vertex-transitive and locally finite. Either $G$ is quasi-isometric to a tree (and therefore has no thick end), or it contains a subdivision of the full hexagonal grid.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap percolation on the Hamming graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $r$-edge bootstrap percolation on a graph is an activation process of the edges. The process starts with some initially activated edges and then, in each round, any inactive edge whose one of endpoints is incident to at least $r$ active edges becomes activated. A set of initially activated edges leading to the activation of all edges is said to be a percolating set. Denote the minimum size of a percolating set in the $r$-edge bootstrap percolation process on a graph $G$ by $m_e(G, r)$. The importance of the $r$-edge bootstrap percolation relies on the fact that $m_e(G, r)$ provides bounds on $m(G, r)$, that is, the minimum size of a percolating set in the $r$-neighbor bootstrap percolation process on $G$. In this paper, we explicitly determine $m_e(K_n^d, r)$, where $K_n^d$ is the Cartesian product of $d$ copies of the complete graph on $n$ vertices which is referred as Hamming graph. Using this, we show that $m(K_n^d, r)=(1+o(1))\frac{d^{r-1}}{r!}$ when $n, r$ are fixed and $d$ goes to infinity which extends a known result on hypercubes.</description>

      <title>Determining the Locating Rainbow Connection Number of Vertex-Transitive Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The locating rainbow connection number of a graph is defined as the minimum number of colors required to color vertices such that every two vertices there exists a rainbow vertex path and every vertex has a distinct rainbow code. This rainbow code signifies a distance between vertices within a given set of colors in a graph. This paper aims to determine the locating rainbow connection number for vertex-transitive graphs. Three main theorems are derived, focusing on the locating rainbow connection number for some vertex-transitive graphs</description>

      <title>A method for constructing graphs with the same resistance spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V(G),E(G))$ be a graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. The resistance distance $R_G(x,y)$ between two vertices $x,y$ of $G$ is defined to be the effective resistance between the two vertices in the corresponding electrical network in which each edge of $G$ is replaced by a unit resistor. The resistance spectrum $\mathrm{RS}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the multiset of the resistance distances of all pairs of vertices in the graph. This paper presents a method for constructing graphs with the same resistance spectrum. It is obtained that for any positive integer $k$, there exist at least $2^k$ graphs with the same resistance spectrum. Furthermore, it is shown that for $n \geq 10$, there are at least $2(n-9) p(n-9)$ pairs of graphs of order $n$ with the same resistance spectrum, where $p(n-9)$ is the number of partitions of the integer $n-9$.</description>

Abstract: We say that a graph $G$ is chromatic-choosable when its list chromatic number $\chi_{\ell}(G)$ is equal to its chromatic number $\chi(G)$. Chromatic-choosability is a well-studied topic, and in fact, some of the most famous results and conjectures related to list coloring involve chromatic-choosability. In 2002 Ohba showed that for any graph $G$ there is an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the join of $G$ and a complete graph on at least $N$ vertices is chromatic-choosable. The Ohba number of $G$ is the smallest such $N$. In 2014, Noel suggested studying the Ohba number, $\tau_{0}(a,b)$, of complete bipartite graphs with partite sets of size $a$ and $b$. In this paper we improve a 2009 result of Allagan by showing that $\tau_{0}(2,b) = \lfloor \sqrt{b} \rfloor - 1$ for all $b \geq 2$, and we show that for $a \geq 2$, $\tau_{0}(a,b) = \Omega( \sqrt{b} )$ as $b \rightarrow \infty$. We also initiate the study of some relaxed versions of the Ohba number of a graph which we call generalized Ohba numbers. We present some upper and lower bounds of generalized Ohba numbers of complete bipartite graphs while also posing some questions.</description>

      <title>Lattice Points and Rational $q$-Catalan Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each pair of coprime integers $a$ and $b$ one defines the "rational $q$-Catalan number" $\mathrm{Cat}_q(a,b)=\bigl[\hskip-1.5pt \begin{smallmatrix}{a-1+b}\\{a-1}\end{smallmatrix}\hskip-1pt\bigr]_q/[a]_q$. It is known that this is a polynomial in $q$ with nonnegative integer coefficients, but this phenomenon is mysterious. Despite recent progress in the understanding of these polynomials and their two-variable $q,t$-analogues, we still lack a simple combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients. The current paper builds on a conjecture of Paul Johnson relating $q$-Catalan numbers to lattice points. The main idea of this approach is to fix $a$ and express everything in terms of the weight lattice of type $A_{a-1}$. For a given $a$ we construct a family of $(a-2)\phi(a)+1$ polynomials called "$q$-Catalan germs" and for each integer $b$ coprime to $a$ we express $\mathrm{Cat}(a,b)_q$ in terms of germs. We conjecture that the germs have nonnegative coefficients and we show that this nonnegativity conjecture is implied by a stronger conjecture about "ribbon partitions" of certain subposets of Young's lattice.</description>

      <title>Tight bound for the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property of tree minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a tree on $t$ vertices. We prove that for every positive integer $k$ and every graph $G$, either $G$ contains $k$ pairwise vertex-disjoint subgraphs each having a $T$ minor, or there exists a set $X$ of at most $t(k-1)$ vertices of $G$ such that $G-X$ has no $T$ minor. The bound on the size of $X$ is best possible and improves on an earlier $f(t)k$ bound proved by Fiorini, Joret, and Wood (2013) with some very fast growing function $f(t)$. Moreover, our proof is very short and simple.</description>

      <title>The maximum spectral radius of planner graphs without the joint of K2 and a linear forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $F$, let $SPEX_P(n,F)$ be the set of graphs with the maximum spectral radius among all $F$-free $n$-vertex planner graph. In 2017, Tait and Tobin proved that for sufficiently $n$, $K_2+P_{n-2}$ is the unique graph with the maximum spectral radius over all $n$-vertex planner graphs. In this paper, focusing on $SPEX_P(n,K_2+H)$ in which $H$ is a linear forest, we prove that $SPEX_P(n,K_2+H)=\{2K_1+C_{n-2}\}$ when $H\in \{pK_2,P_3,I_q\}$ $(p\geq1, q\geq 3)$, where $K_n$, $P_n$, $I_n$ are complete graph, path and empty graph of order $n$, respectively. When $H$ contains a $P_4$, we prove that $2K_1+C_{n-2}\notin SPEX_P(n,K_2+H)$ and also provide a structural characterization of graphs in $SPEX_P(n,K_2+H)$.</description>

Abstract: The algebra of symmetric functions contains several interesting families of symmetric functions indexed by integer partitions or skew partitions. Given a sequence $\{u_n\}$ of symmetric functions taken from one of these families such that $u_n$ is homogeneous of degree $n$, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the sequence to form a system of algebraically independent generators for the algebra of symmetric functions.</description>

      <title>A Lower bound for Secure Domination Number of an Outerplanar Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a secure dominating set of $G$ if $S$ is a dominating set of $G$ and, for each vertex $u \not\in S$, there is a vertex $v \in S$ such that $uv$ is an edge and $(S \setminus \{v\}) \cup \{u\}$ is also a dominating set of $G$. The secure domination number of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_{s}(G)$, is the cardinality of a smallest secure dominating sets of $G$. In this paper, we prove that for any outerplanar graph with $n \geq 4$ vertices, $\gamma_{s}(G) \geq (n+4)/5$ and the bound is tight.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Regular Sequences: Summatory Functions and Divide-and-Conquer Recurrences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the asymptotic analysis of regular sequences as defined by Allouche and Shallit, it is usually advisable to study their summatory function because the original sequence has a too fluctuating behaviour. It might be that the process of taking the summatory function has to be repeated if the sequence is fluctuating too much. In this paper we show that for all regular sequences except for some degenerate cases, repeating this process finitely many times leads to a ``nice'' asymptotic expansion containing periodic fluctuations whose Fourier coefficients can be computed using the results on the asymptotics of the summatory function of regular sequences by the first two authors of this paper.
  In a recent paper, Hwang, Janson, and Tsai perform a thorough investigation of divide-and-conquer recurrences. These can be seen as $2$-regular sequences. By considering them as the summatory function of their forward difference, the results on the asymptotics of the summatory function of regular sequences become applicable. We thoroughly investigate the case of a polynomial toll function.</description>

      <title>Tur\'{a}n problems for star-path forests in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $r$-uniform hypergraph ($r$-graph) is linear if any two edges intersect at most one vertex. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a given family of $r$-graphs. A hypergraph $H$ is called $\mathcal{F}$-free if $H$ does not contain any hypergraphs in $\mathcal{F}$. The Tur\'{a}n number ${\rm{ex}}_r(n,\mathcal{F})$ of $\mathcal{F}$ is defined as the maximum number of edges of all $\mathcal{F}$-free $r$-graphs on $n$ vertices, and the linear Tur\'{a}n number ${\rm{ex}}^{\rm{lin}}_r(n,\mathcal{F})$ of $\mathcal{F}$ is defined as the Tur\'{a}n number of $\mathcal{F}$ in linear host hypergraphs. An $r$-uniform linear path $P^r_\ell$ of length $\ell$ is an $r$-graph with edges $e_1,\cdots,e_\ell$ such that $|V(e_i)\cap V(e_j)|=1$ if $|i-j|=1$, and $V(e_i)\cap V(e_j)=\emptyset$ for $i\neq j$ otherwise. Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s et al. [Linear Tur\'{a}n numbers of acyclic triple systems, European J. Combin., 2022, 103435] obtained an upper bound for the linear Tur\'{a}n number of $P_\ell^3$. In this paper, an upper bound for the linear Tur\'{a}n number of $P_\ell^r$ is obtained, which generalizes the result of $P_\ell^3$ to any $P_\ell^r$. Furthermore, some results for the linear Tur\'{a}n number and Tur\'{a}n number of some linear star-path forests are obtained.</description>

      <title>$C_{2k+1}$-coloring of bounded-diameter graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed graph $H$, in the graph homomorphism problem, denoted by $Hom(H)$, we are given a graph $G$ and we have to determine whether there exists an edge-preserving mapping $\varphi: V(G) \to V(H)$. Note that $Hom(C_3)$, where $C_3$ is the cycle of length $3$, is equivalent to $3$-Coloring. The question whether $3$-Coloring is polynomial-time solvable on diameter-$2$ graphs is a well-known open problem. In this paper we study the $Hom(C_{2k+1})$ problem on bounded-diameter graphs for $k\geq 2$, so we consider all other odd cycles than $C_3$. We prove that for $k\geq 2$, the $Hom(C_{2k+1})$ problem is polynomial-time solvable on diameter-$(k+1)$ graphs -- note that such a result for $k=1$ would be precisely a polynomial-time algorithm for $3$-Coloring of diameter-$2$ graphs.
  Furthermore, we give subexponential-time algorithms for diameter-$(k+2)$ and -$(k+3)$ graphs.
  We complement these results with a lower bound for diameter-$(2k+2)$ graphs -- in this class of graphs the $Hom(C_{2k+1})$ problem is NP-hard and cannot be solved in subexponential-time, unless the ETH fails.
  Finally, we consider another direction of generalizing $3$-Coloring on diameter-$2$ graphs. We consider other target graphs $H$ than odd cycles but we restrict ourselves to diameter $2$. We show that if $H$ is triangle-free, then $Hom(H)$ is polynomial-time solvable on diameter-$2$ graphs.</description>

Abstract: n this paper, we mainly investigate $K_{1,2}$-structure-connectivity for any connected graph. Let $G$ be a connected graph with $n$ vertices, we show that $\kappa(G; K_{1,2})$ is well-defined if $diam(G)\geq 4$, or $n\equiv 1\pmod 3$, or $G\notin \{C_{5},K_{n}\}$ when $n\equiv 2\pmod 3$, or there exist three vertices $u,v,w$ such that $N_{G}(u)\cap (N_{G}(v,w)\cup\{v,w\})=\emptyset$ when $n\equiv 0\pmod 3$. Furthermore, if $G$ has $K_{1,2}$-structure-cut, we prove $\kappa(G)/3\leq\kappa(G; K_{1,2})\leq\kappa(G)$.</description>

      <title>Weak multiset sequenceability and weak BHR conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of a group $(G,+)$ is $t$-weakly sequenceable if there is an ordering $(y_1, \ldots, y_k)$ of its elements such that the partial sums~$s_0, s_1, \ldots, s_k$, given by $s_0 = 0$ and $s_i = \sum_{j=1}^i y_j$ for $1 \leq i \leq k$, satisfy $s_i \neq s_j$ whenever and $1 \leq |i-j|\leq t$. In this paper, we consider the weak sequenceability problem on multisets. In particular, we are able to prove that a multiset $M=[a_1^{\lambda_1},a_2^{\lambda_2},\dots,a_n^{\lambda_n}]$ of non-identity elements of a generic group $G$ is $t$-weakly sequenceable whenever the underlying set $\{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\}$ is sufficiently large (with respect to $t$) and the smallest prime divisor $p$ of $|G|$ is larger than $t$.
  A related question is the one posed by the Buratti, Horak, and Rosa (briefly BHR) conjecture here considered again in the weak sense. Given a multiset $M$ and a walk $W$ in $Cay[G: \pm M]$, we say that $W$ is a realization of $M$ if $\Delta(W)=\pm M$. Here we prove that a multiset $M=[a_1^{\lambda_1},a_2^{\lambda_2},\dots,a_n^{\lambda_n}]$ of non-identity elements of $G$ admits a realization $W=(w_0,\dots,w_{\ell})$ such that $w_i\neq w_j$ whenever and $1 \leq |i-j|\leq t$ assuming that $|M|=\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\dots+\lambda_n$ is sufficiently large and the smallest prime divisor $p$ of $|G|$ is larger than $t(2t+1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with two conjectures which are intimately related. The first is a generalization to hypergraphs of Vizing's Theorem on the chromatic index of a graph and the second is the well-known conjecture of Erd\H{o}s, Faber and Lov\'asz which deals with the problem of coloring a family of cliques intersecting in at most one vertex. We are led to study a special class of uniform and linear hypergraphs for which a number of properties are established.</description>

Abstract: A positroid is an ordered matroid realizable by a real matrix with all nonnegative maximal minors. Postnikov gave a map from ordered matroids to Grassmann necklaces, for which there is a unique positroid in each fiber of the map. Here, we characterize the ternary positroids and the set of matroids in their respective fibers, referred to as their positroid envelope classes. We show that a positroid is ternary if and only if it is near-regular, and that all ternary positroids are formed by direct sums and 2-sums of binary positroids and positroid whirls. We fully characterize the envelope classes of ternary positroids; in particular, the envelope class of a positroid whirl of rank-$r$ contains exactly four matroids.</description>

      <title>Ehrhart polynomials of partial permutohedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For positive integers $m$ and $n$, the partial permutohedron $\mathcal{P}(m,n)$ is a certain integral polytope in $\mathbb{R}^m$, which can be defined as the convex hull of the vectors from $\{0,1,\ldots,n\}^m$ whose nonzero entries are distinct. For $n=m-1$, $\mathcal{P}(m,m-1)$ is (after translation by $(1,\ldots,1)$) the polytope $P_m$ of parking functions of length $m$, and for $n\ge m$, $\mathcal{P}(m,n)$ is combinatorially equivalent to an $m$-stellohedron. The main result of this paper is an explicit expression for the Ehrhart polynomial of $\mathcal{P}(m,n)$ for any $m$ and $n$ with $n\ge m-1$. The result confirms the validity of a conjecture for this Ehrhart polynomial in arXiv:2207.14253, and the $n=m-1$ case also answers a question of Stanley regarding the number of integer points in $P_m$. The proof of the result involves transforming $\mathcal{P}(m,n)$ to a unimodularly equivalent polytope in $\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$, obtaining a decomposition of this lifted version of $\mathcal{P}(m,n)$ with $n\ge m-1$ as a Minkowski sum of dilated coordinate simplices, applying a result of Postnikov for the number of integer points in generalized permutohedra of this form, observing that this gives an expression for the Ehrhart polynomial of $\mathcal{P}(m,n)$ with $n\ge m-1$ as an edge-weighted sum over graphs (with loops and multiple edges permitted) on $m$ labelled vertices in which each connected component contains at most one cycle, and then applying standard techniques for the enumeration of such graphs.</description>

Abstract: We study the $(k+1,k)$ diagonal map for $k=2,3,4,...$. We call this map $\Delta_k$. The map $\Delta_1$ is the pentagram map and $\Delta_k$ is a generalization. $\Delta_k$ does not preserve convexity, but we prove that $\Delta_k$ preserves a subset $B_k$ of certain star-shaped polygons which we call $k$-birds. The action of $\Delta_k$ on $B_k$ seems similar to the action of $\Delta_1$ on the space of convex polygons. We show that some classic geometric results about $\Delta_1$ generalize to this setting.</description>

      <title>Connection Laplacian on discrete tori with converging property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the spectral properties of the connection Laplacian for both real and discrete tori. We introduce novel methods to examine these eigenvalues by employing parallel orthonormal basis in the pullback bundle on universal covering spaces. Our main results reveal that the eigenvalues of the connection Laplacian on a real torus can be expressed in terms of standard Laplacian eigenvalues, with a unique twist encapsulated in the torsion matrix. This connection is further investigated in the context of discrete tori, where we demonstrate similar results.
  A significant portion of the paper is dedicated to exploring the convergence properties of a family of discrete tori towards a real torus. We extend previous findings on the spectrum of the standard Laplacian to include the connection Laplacian, revealing that the rescaled eigenvalues of discrete tori converge to those of the real torus. Furthermore, our analysis of the discrete torus occurs within a broader context, where it is not constrained to being a product of cyclic groups. Additionally, we delve into the theta functions associated with these structures, providing a detailed analysis of their behavior and convergence.
  The paper culminates in a study of the regularized log-determinant of the connection Laplacian and the converging results of it. We derive formulae for both real and discrete tori, emphasizing their dependence on the spectral zeta function and theta functions.</description>

      <title>A boundary for hyperbolic digraphs and semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on a notion by Gray and Kambites of hyperbolicity in the setting of semimetric spaces like digraphs or semigroups, we will construct (under a small additional geometric assumption) a boundary based on quasi-geodesic rays and anti-rays that is preserved by quasi-isometries and, in the case of locally finite digraphs and right cancellative semigroups, refines their ends. Among other results, we show that it is possible to equip the space, if it is finitely based, together with its boundary with a pseudo-semimetric.</description>

      <title>On the topology of the moduli of tropical unramified $p$-covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of the moduli space of tropical unramified $\mathbb{Z}/p$-covers of tropical curves of genus $g \geq 2$ where $p$ is a prime number. We use recent techniques by Chan--Galatius--Payne to identify a contractible subcomplex of the moduli space. We then use this contractibility result to show that this moduli space is simply connected for all $g$ and $p$. In the case of genus $2$ we fully determine the homotopy type of this moduli space for all primes $p$. This work is motivated by prospective applications to the top-weight cohomology of the space of prime cyclic \'etale covers of smooth algebraic curves.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bounds for Distinct Quartics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental concept related to strings is that of repetitions. It has been extensively studied in many versions, from both purely combinatorial and algorithmic angles. One of the most basic questions is how many distinct squares, i.e., distinct strings of the form $UU$, a string of length $n$ can contain as fragments. It turns out that this is always $\mathcal{O}(n)$, and the bound cannot be improved to sublinear in $n$ [Fraenkel and Simpson, JCTA 1998].
  Several similar questions about repetitions in strings have been considered, and by now we seem to have a good understanding of their repetitive structure. For higher-dimensional strings, the basic concept of periodicity has been successfully extended and applied to design efficient algorithms -- it is inherently more complex than for regular strings. Extending the notion of repetitions and understanding the repetitive structure of higher-dimensional strings is however far from complete.
  Quartics were introduced by Apostolico and Brimkov [TCS 2000] as analogues of squares in two dimensions. Charalampopoulos, Radoszewski, Rytter, Wale\'n, and Zuba [ESA 2020] proved that the number of distinct quartics in an $n\times n$ 2D string is $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log^2 n)$ and that they can be computed in $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log^2 n)$ time. Gawrychowski, Ghazawi, and Landau [SPIRE 2021] constructed an infinite family of $n \times n$ 2D strings with $\Omega(n^2 \log n)$ distinct quartics. This brings the challenge of determining asymptotically tight bounds. Here, we settle both the combinatorial and the algorithmic aspects of this question: the number of distinct quartics in an $n\times n$ 2D string is $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log n)$ and they can be computed in the worst-case optimal $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log n)$ time.</description>

      <title>Untangling Gaussian Mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tangles were originally introduced as a concept to formalize regions of high connectivity in graphs. In recent years, they have also been discovered as a link between structural graph theory and data science: when interpreting similarity in data sets as connectivity between points, finding clusters in the data essentially amounts to finding tangles in the underlying graphs. This paper further explores the potential of tangles in data sets as a means for a formal study of clusters. Real-world data often follow a normal distribution. Accounting for this, we develop a quantitative theory of tangles in data sets drawn from Gaussian mixtures. To this end, we equip the data with a graph structure that models similarity between the points and allows us to apply tangle theory to the data. We provide explicit conditions under which tangles associated with the marginal Gaussian distributions exist asymptotically almost surely. This can be considered as a sufficient formal criterion for the separabability of clusters in the data.</description>

      <title>Non-convex relaxation and 1/2-approximation algorithm for the chance-constrained binary knapsack problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the chance-constrained binary knapsack problem (CKP), where the item weights are independent and normally distributed. We introduce a continuous relaxation for the CKP, represented as a non-convex optimization problem, which we call the non-convex relaxation. A comparative study shows that the non-convex relaxation provides an upper bound for the CKP, at least as tight as those obtained from other continuous relaxations for the CKP. Furthermore, the quality of the obtained upper bound is guaranteed to be at most twice the optimal objective value of the CKP. Despite its non-convex nature, we show that the non-convex relaxation can be solved in polynomial time. Subsequently, we proposed a polynomial-time 1/2-approximation algorithm for the CKP based on this relaxation, providing a lower bound for the CKP. Computational test results demonstrate that the non-convex relaxation and the proposed approximation algorithm yields tight lower and upper bounds for the CKP within a short computation time, ensuring the quality of the obtained bounds.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a collection of cells and $I_\mathcal{P}$ be the associated ideal of inner $2$-minors as defined by A. A. Qureshi in 2012. In this paper, we provide a description of the package $\texttt{PolyominoIdeals}$ for the computer algebra software $\texttt{Macaulay2}$. More precisely, this package provides some functions that allow to define the ideal $I_{\mathcal{P}}$ in $\texttt{Macaulay2}$ and to compute its algebraic invariants or verifying its algebraic properties. We explain the usage of these functions and also give some examples.</description>

      <title>Ramsey expansions of metrically homogeneous graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:1707.02612v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Ramsey expansions, the coherent extension property for partial isometries (EPPA), and the existence of a stationary independence relation for all classes of metrically homogeneous graphs from Cherlin's catalogue. We show that, with the exception of tree-like graphs, all metric spaces in the catalogue have precompact Ramsey expansions (or lifts) with the expansion property. With two exceptions we can also characterise the existence of a stationary independence relation and coherent EPPA.
  Our results are a contribution to Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il's classification programme of Ramsey classes and can be seen as empirical evidence of the recent convergence in techniques employed to establish the Ramsey property, the expansion property, EPPA and the existence of a stationary independence relation. At the heart of our proof is a canonical way of completing edge-labelled graphs to metric spaces in Cherlin's classes. The existence of such a ``completion algorithm'' then allows us to apply several strong results in the areas that imply EPPA or the Ramsey property.
  The main results have numerous consequences for the automorphism groups of the Fraisse limits of the classes. As corollaries, we prove amenability, unique ergodicity, existence of universal minimal flows, ample generics, small index property, 21-Bergman property and Serre's property (FA).</description>

      <title>Minimum algebraic connectivity and maximum diameter: Aldous--Fill and Guiduli--Mohar conjectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aldous and Fill (2002) conjectured that the maximum relaxation time for the random walk on a connected regular graph with $n$ vertices is $(1+o(1)) \frac{3n^{2}}{2\pi ^{2}}$. A conjecture by Guiduli and Mohar (1996) predicts the structure of graphs whose algebraic connectivity $\mu $ is the smallest among all connected graphs whose minimum degree $\delta $ is a given $d$. We prove that this conjecture implies the Aldous--Fill conjecture for odd $d$. We pose another conjecture on the structure of $d$-regular graphs with minimum $\mu $, and show that this also implies the Aldous--Fill conjecture for even $d$. In the literature, it has been noted empirically that graphs with small $\mu $ tend to have a large diameter. In this regard, Guiduli (1996) asked if the cubic graphs with maximum diameter have algebraic connectivity smaller than all others. Motivated by these, we investigate the interplay between the graphs with maximum diameter and those with minimum algebraic connectivity. We show that the answer to Guiduli problem in its general form, that is for $d$-regular graphs for every $d\ge 3$ is negative. We aim to develop an asymptotic formulation of the problem. It is proven that $d$-regular graphs for $d\ge 5$ as well as graphs with $\delta =d$ for $d\ge 4$ with asymptotically maximum diameter, do not necessarily exhibit the asymptotically smallest $\mu$. We conjecture that $d$-regular graphs (or graphs with $\delta =d$) that have asymptotically smallest $\mu $, should have asymptotically maximum diameter. The above results rely heavily on our understanding of the structure as well as optimal estimation of the algebraic connectivity of nearly maximum-diameter graphs, from which the Aldous--Fill conjecture for this family of graphs also follows.</description>

      <title>The one-sided cycle shuffles in the symmetric group algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06274v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of shuffling operators on the symmetric group $S_n$, which includes the top-to-random shuffle. The general shuffling scheme consists of removing one card at a time from the deck (according to some probability distribution) and re-inserting it at a (uniformly) random position further below. Rewritten in terms of the group algebra $\mathbb{R}[S_n]$, our shuffle corresponds to right multiplication by a linear combination of the elements \[t_i:=\text{cyc}_{i}+\text{cyc}_{i,i+1}+\text{cyc}_{i,i+1,i+2}+\cdots+\text{cyc}_{i,i+1,\ldots,n}\in \mathbb{R}[S_n]\] for all $i\in\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ (where $\text{cyc}_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_p}$ stands for a $p$-cycle).
  We compute the eigenvalues of these shuffling operators and of all their linear combinations. In particular, we show that the eigenvalues of right multiplication by a linear combination $\lambda_1t_1+\lambda_2t_2+\cdots+\lambda_nt_n$ are the numbers $\lambda_1m_{I,1}+\lambda_2m_{I,2}+\cdots+\lambda_nm_{I,n}$, where $I$ ranges over the subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n-1\}$ that contain no two consecutive integers; here $m_{I,i}$ are certain integers. We compute the multiplicities of these eigenvalues and show that if they are all distinct, the shuffling operator is diagonalizable. To this purpose, we show that the operators of right multiplication by $t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n$ on $\mathbb{R}[S_n]$ are simultaneously triangularizable (via a combinatorially defined basis). The results stated here over $\mathbb{R}$ for convenience are actually stated and proved over an arbitrary commutative ring $\mathbf{k}$.
  We finish by describing a strong stationary time for the random-to-below shuffle, which is the shuffle in which the card that moves below is selected uniformly at random, and we give the waiting time for this event to happen.</description>

      <title>Weighted Ehrhart Theory: Extending Stanley's nonnegativity theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize R. P. Stanley's celebrated theorem that the $h^\ast$-polynomial of the Ehrhart series of a rational polytope has nonnegative coefficients and is monotone under containment of polytopes. We show that these results continue to hold for weighted Ehrhart series where lattice points are counted with polynomial weights, as long as the weights are homogeneous polynomials decomposable as sums of products of linear forms that are nonnegative on the polytope. We also show nonnegativity of the $h^\ast$-polynomial as a real-valued function for a larger family of weights.
  We then target the case when the weight function is the square of a single (arbitrary) linear form. We show stronger results for two-dimensional convex lattice polygons and give concrete examples showing tightness of the hypotheses. As an application, we construct a counterexample to a conjecture by Berg, Jochemko, and Silverstein on Ehrhart tensor polynomials.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Makeev Problem Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a result of Makeev, in 2012 Blagojevi\'c and Karasev proposed the following problem: given any positive integers $m$ and $1\leq \ell\leq k$, find the minimum dimension $d=\Delta(m;\ell/k)$ such that for any $m$ mass distributions on $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exist $k$ hyperplanes, any $\ell$ of which equipartition each mass. The $\ell=k$ case is a central question in geometric and topological combinatorics which remains open except for few values of $m$ and $k$. For $\ell&lt; k$ and arbitrary $m$, we establish new upper bounds on $\Delta(m;\ell/k)$ when (1) $\ell=2$ and $k$ is arbitrary and (2) $\ell=3$ and $k=4$. When $\ell=k-1$ and $m+1$ is a power of two these bounds are nearly optimal and are exponentially smaller than the current best upper bounds when $\ell=k$. Similar remarks apply to our upper bounds when the hyperplanes are prescribed to be pairwise orthogonal. Lastly, we provide transversal extensions of our results along the lines recently established by Frick et al.: given $m$ families of compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that no $2^\ell$ members of any family are pairwise disjoint, we show that every member of each family is pierced by the union of any $\ell$ of some collection of $k$ hyperplanes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For two given graphs $G$ and $F$, a graph $ H$ is said to be weakly $ (G, F) $-saturated if $H$ is a spanning subgraph of $ G$ which has no copy of $F$ as a subgraph and one can add all edges in $ E(G)\setminus E(H)$ to $ H$ in some order so that a new copy of $F$ is created at each step. The weak saturation number $ wsat(G, F)$ is the minimum number of edges of a weakly $(G, F)$-saturated graph. In this paper, we deal with the relation between $ wsat(G(n,p), F)$ and $ wsat(K_n, F)$, where $G(n,p)$ denotes the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph and $ K_n$ denotes the complete graph on $ n$ vertices. For every graph $ F$ and constant $ p$, we prove that $ wsat( G(n,p),F)= wsat(K_n,F)(1+o(1))$ with high probability. Also, for some graphs $ F$ including complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and connected graphs with minimum degree $ 1$ or $ 2$, it is shown that there exists an $ \varepsilon(F)&gt;0$ such that, for any $ p\geqslant n^{-\varepsilon(F)}\log n$, $ wsat( G(n,p),F)= wsat(K_n,F)$ with high probability.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma({\mathcal{W}})$ be the Cayley graph of a finite Weyl groupoid ${\mathcal{W}}$. In this paper, we show an existence of a Hamitonian cycle of $\Gamma({\mathcal{W}})$ for any ${\mathcal{W}}$. We exatctly draw a Hamiltonian cycle of $\Gamma({\mathcal{W}})$ for any (resp. some) irreducible ${\mathcal{W}}$ of rank three (resp. four). Moreover for the irreducible ${\mathcal{W}}$ of rank three, we give a second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of $\Gamma({\mathcal{W}})$, and know if $\Gamma({\mathcal{W}})$ is a bipartite Ramanujan graph or not.</description>

      <title>A Classification of Graphs through Quadratic Embedding Constants and Clique Graph Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quadratic embedding constant (QEC) of a graph $G$ is a new numeric invariant, which is defined in terms of the distance matrix and is denoted by $\mathrm{QEC}(G)$. By observing graph structure of the maximal cliques (clique graph), we show that a graph $G$ with $\mathrm{QEC}(G)&lt;-1/2$ admits a ``cactus-like'' structure. We derive a formula for the quadratic embedding constant of a graph consisting of two maximal cliques. As an application we discuss characterization of graphs along the increasing sequence of $\mathrm{QEC}(P_d)$, where $P_d$ is the path on $d$ vertices. In particular, we determine graphs $G$ satisfying $\mathrm{QEC}(G)&lt;\mathrm{QEC}(P_5)$.</description>

      <title>Slit-slide-sew bijections for constellations and quasiconstellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend so-called slit-slide-sew bijections to constellations and quasiconstellations. We present an involution on the set of hypermaps given with an orientation, one distinguished corner, and one distinguished edge leading away from the corner while oriented in the given orientation. This involution reverts the orientation, exchanges the distinguished corner with the distinguished edge in some sense, slightly modifying the degrees of the incident faces in passing, while keeping all the other faces intact.
  The construction consists in building a canonical path from the distinguished elements, slitting the map along it, and sewing back after sliding by one unit along the path. The involution specializes into a bijection interpreting combinatorial identities linking the numbers of constellations or quasiconstellations with a given face degree distribution, where the degree distributions differ by one $+1$ and one $-1$. In particular, this allows to recover the counting formula for constellations or quasiconstellations with a given face degree distribution.
  Our bijections furthermore provide an algorithm for sampling a hypermap uniformly distributed among constellations or quasiconstellations with prescribed face degrees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a novel decomposition to create succinct data structures -- supporting a wide range of operations on static trees in constant time -- for a variety tree classes, extending results of Munro, Nicholson, Benkner, and Wild. Motivated by the class of AVL trees, we further derive asymptotics for the information-theoretic lower bound on the number of bits needed to store tree classes whose generating functions satisfy certain functional equations. In particular, we prove that AVL trees require approximately $0.938$ bits per node to encode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multispecies asymmetric simple exclusion process (mASEP) is a Markov chain in which particles of different species hop along a one-dimensional lattice. This paper studies the doubly asymmetric simple exclusion process $\mathrm{DASEP}(n,p,q)$ in which $q$ particles with species $1, \dots, p$ hop along a circular lattice with $n$ sites, but also the particles are allowed to spontaneously change from one species to another. In this paper, we introduce two related Markov chains called the colored Boolean process and the restricted random growth model, and we show that the DASEP lumps to the colored Boolean process, and the colored Boolean process lumps to the restricted random growth model. This allows us to generalize a theorem of David Ash on the relations between sums of steady state probabilities. We also give explicit formulas for the stationary distribution of $\mathrm{DASEP}(n,2,2)$.</description>

Abstract: A placement of chess pieces on a chessboard is called dominating, if each free square of the chessboard is under attack by at least one piece. In this contribution we compute the number of dominating arrangements of $k$ rooks on an $n\times m$ chessboard. To this end we derive an expression for the corresponding generating function, the domination polynomial of the $n\times m$ rook graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a compact tableau formula for the symmetric Macdonald polynomials $P_{\lambda}(X;q,t)$ in terms of a queue inversion statistic on certain sorted non-attacking tableaux. The nonsymmetric components of our formula are the ASEP polynomials, which specialize to the probabilities of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a circle. Moreover, the statistics in our formula are naturally related to the dynamics of the ASEP. Our tableaux are in bijection with Martin's multiline queues (arXiv:1810.10650), from which we obtain an alternative multiline queue formula for $P_{\lambda}$.</description>

      <title>A hypergraph bipartite Tur\'an problem with odd uniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the hypergraph Tur\'an number $ex(n,K^{(r)}_{s,t})$. Here, $K^{(r)}_{s,t}$ denotes the $r$-uniform hypergraph with vertex set $\left(\cup_{i\in [t]}X_i\right)\cup Y$ and edge set $\{X_i\cup \{y\}: i\in [t], y\in Y\}$, where $X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_t$ are $t$ pairwise disjoint sets of size $r-1$ and $Y$ is a set of size $s$ disjoint from each $X_i$. This study was initially explored by Erd\H{o}s and has since received substantial attention in research. Recent advancements by Brada\v{c}, Gishboliner, Janzer and Sudakov have greatly contributed to a better understanding of this problem. They proved that $ex(n,K_{s,t}^{(r)})=O_{s,t}(n^{r-\frac{1}{s-1}})$ holds for any $r\geq 3$ and $s,t\geq 2$. They also provided constructions illustrating the tightness of this bound if $r\geq 4$ is {\it even} and $t\gg s\geq 2$. Furthermore, they proved that $ex(n,K_{s,t}^{(3)})=O_{s,t}(n^{3-\frac{1}{s-1}-\varepsilon_s})$ holds for $s\geq 3$ and some $\epsilon_s&gt;0$. Addressing this intriguing discrepancy between the behavior of this number for $r=3$ and the even cases, Brada\v{c} et al. post a question of whether \begin{equation*} \mbox{$ex(n,K_{s,t}^{(r)})= O_{r,s,t}(n^{r-\frac{1}{s-1}- \varepsilon})$ holds for odd $r\geq 5$ and any $s\geq 3$.} \end{equation*}
  In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to this question, utilizing novel techniques to identify regular and dense substructures. This result highlights a rare instance in hypergraph Tur\'an problems where the solution depends on the parity of the uniformity.</description>

      <title>Conflict-Free Coloring: Graphs of Bounded Clique Width and Intersection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.08693v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A conflict-free coloring of a graph $G$ is a (partial) coloring of its vertices such that every vertex $u$ has a neighbor whose assigned color is unique in the neighborhood of $u$. There are two variants of this coloring, one defined using the open neighborhood and one using the closed neighborhood. For both variants, we study the problem of deciding whether the conflict-free coloring of a given graph $G$ is at most a given number $k$.
  In this work, we investigate the relation of clique-width and minimum number of colors needed (for both variants) and show that these parameters do not bound one another. Moreover, we consider specific graph classes, particularly graphs of bounded clique-width and types of intersection graphs, such as distance hereditary graphs, interval graphs and unit square and disk graphs. We also consider Kneser graphs and split graphs. We give (often tight) upper and lower bounds and determine the complexity of the decision problem on these graph classes, which improve some of the results from the literature. Particularly, we settle the number of colors needed for an interval graph to be conflict-free colored under the open neighborhood model, which was posed as an open problem.</description>

      <title>Supercritical percolation on finite transitive graphs I: Uniqueness of the giant component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.12778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(G_n)_{n \geq 1} = ((V_n,E_n))_{n \geq 1}$ be a sequence of finite, connected, vertex-transitive graphs with volume tending to infinity. We say that a sequence of parameters $(p_n)_{n \geq 1}$ in $[0,1]$ is supercritical with respect to Bernoulli bond percolation $\mathbb P_p^G$ if there exists $\varepsilon &gt;0$ and $N&lt;\infty$ such that \[
  \mathbb P_{(1-\varepsilon)p_n}^{G_n} \left( \text{the largest cluster contains at least $\varepsilon |V_n|$ vertices}\right) \geq \varepsilon \] for every $n\geq N$ with $p_n &lt;1$. We prove that if $(G_n)_{n \geq 1}$ is sparse, meaning that the degrees are sublinear in the number of vertices, then the supercritical giant cluster is unique with high probability in the sense that if $(p_n)_{n \geq 1}$ is supercritical then \[
  \lim_{n\to\infty}\mathbb P_{p_n}^{G_n} \left( \text{the second largest cluster contains at least $c|V_n|$ vertices} \right) = 0 \] for every $c&gt;0$. This result is new even under the stronger hypothesis that $(G_n)_{n \geq 1}$ has uniformly bounded vertex degrees, in which case it verifies a conjecture of Benjamini (2001). Previous work of many authors had established the same theorem for complete graphs, tori, hypercubes, and bounded degree expander graphs, each using methods that are highly specific to the examples they treated. We also give a complete solution to the problem of supercritical uniqueness for dense vertex-transitive graphs, establishing a simple necessary and sufficient isoperimetric condition for uniqueness to hold.</description>

Abstract: The family of bent functions is a known class of Boolean functions, which have a great importance in cryptography. The Cayley graph defined on $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{n}$ by the support of a bent function is a strongly regular graph $srg(v,k\lambda,\mu)$, with $\lambda=\mu$. In this note we list the parameters of such Cayley graphs. Moreover, it is given a condition on $(n,m)$-bent functions $F=(f_1,\ldots,f_m)$, involving the support of their components $f_i$, and their $n$-ary symmetric differences.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Informed Recursive Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement a family of quantum-informed recursive optimization (QIRO) algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems. Our approach leverages quantum resources to obtain information that is used in problem-specific classical reduction steps that recursively simplify the problem. These reduction steps address the limitations of the quantum component and ensure solution feasibility in constrained optimization problems. Additionally, we use backtracking techniques to further improve the performance of the algorithm without increasing the requirements on the quantum hardware. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach by informing QIRO with correlations from classical simulations of shallow (depth $p=1$) circuits of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), solving instances of maximum independent set and maximum satisfiability problems with hundreds of variables. We also demonstrate how QIRO can be deployed on a neutral atom quantum processor available online on Amazon Braket to find large independent sets of graphs. In summary, our scheme achieves results comparable to classical heuristics, such as simulated annealing and greedy algorithms, even with relatively weak quantum resources. Furthermore, enhancing the quality of these quantum resources improves the performance of the algorithms, highlighting the potential of QIRO. Notably, the modular nature of QIRO offers various avenues for modifications, positioning our work as a blueprint for designing a broader class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A celebrated theorem of Fr\"oberg gives a complete combinatorial classification of quadratic square-free monomial ideals with a linear resolution. A generalization of this theorem to higher degree square-free monomial ideals is an active area of research. The existence of a linear resolution of such ideals often depends on the field over which the polynomial ring is defined. Hence, it is too much to expect that in the higher degree case a linear resolution can be identified purely using a combinatorial feature of an associated combinatorial structure. However, some classes of ideals having linear resolutions have been identified using combinatorial structures. In the present paper, we use the notion of $r$-independence to construct an $r$-uniform hypergraph from the given graph. We then show that when the underlying graph is co-chordal, the corresponding edge ideal is vertex splittable, a condition stronger than having a linear resolution. We use this result to explicitly compute graded Betti numbers for various graph classes. Finally, we give a different proof for the existence of a linear resolution using the topological notion of $r$-collapsibility.</description>

Abstract: Linear arrangements of graphs are a well-known type of graph labeling and are found in many important computational problems, such as the Minimum Linear Arrangement Problem ($\texttt{minLA}$). A linear arrangement is usually defined as a permutation of the $n$ vertices of a graph. An intuitive geometric setting is that of vertices lying on consecutive integer positions in the real line, starting at 1; edges are often drawn as semicircles above the real line. In this paper we study the Maximum Linear Arrangement problem ($\texttt{MaxLA}$), the maximization variant of $\texttt{minLA}$. We devise a new characterization of maximum arrangements of general graphs, and prove that $\texttt{MaxLA}$ can be solved for cycle graphs in constant time, and for $k$-linear trees ($k\le2$) in time $O(n)$. We present two constrained variants of $\texttt{MaxLA}$ we call $\texttt{bipartite MaxLA}$ and $\texttt{1-thistle MaxLA}$. We prove that the former can be solved in time $O(n)$ for any bipartite graph; the latter, by an algorithm that typically runs in time $O(n^4)$ on unlabelled trees. The combination of the two variants has two promising characteristics. First, it solves $\texttt{MaxLA}$ for almost all trees consisting of a few tenths of nodes. Second, we prove that it constitutes a $3/2$-approximation algorithm for $\texttt{MaxLA}$ for trees. Furthermore, we conjecture that $\texttt{bipartite MaxLA}$ solves $\texttt{MaxLA}$ for at least $50\%$ of all free trees.</description>
