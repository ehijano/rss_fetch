      <title>Design Limits on Large Space Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the space industry matures, large space stations will be built. This paper organizes and documents constraints on the size of these space stations. Human frailty, station design, and construction impose these constraints. Human limitations include gravity, radiation, air pressure, rotational stability, population, and psychology. Station design limitations include gravity, population, material, geometry, mass, air pressure, and rotational stability. Limits on space station construction include construction approaches, very large stations, and historic station examples. This paper documents all these constraints for thoroughness and review; however, only a few constraints significantly limit the station size. This paper considers rotating stations with radii greater than 10 kilometers. Such stations may seem absurd today; however, with robotic automation and artificial intelligence, such sizes may become feasible in the future.</description>

      <title>Space Station Rotational Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing for rotational stability can dramatically affect the geometry of a space station. If improperly designed, the rotating station could end up catastrophically tumbling end-over-end. Active stabilization can address this problem; however, designing the station with passive rotation stability provides a lower-cost solution. This paper presents passive rotational stability guidelines for four space station geometries. Station stability is first analyzed with thin-shell and thick-shell models. Stability is also analyzed with models of the station's major constituent parts, including outer shells, spokes, floors, air, and shuttle bays.</description>
