      <title>Dual Origins of Rapid Flare Ribbon Downflows in an X9-class Solar Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detect rapid downflows of 150-217 km/s in IRIS Si IV 1402.77 nm measurements of an X9-class solar flare on 2024 October 3rd. The fast redshift values persist for over 15 minutes from flare onset, and can be split into two distinct stages of behavior, suggesting that multiple mechanisms are responsible for the downwards acceleration of flare ribbon plasma. The first stage of rapid downflows are synchronized with peaks in emission from the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory Hard X-ray Imager (ASO-S/HXI) and Large Yield Radiometer (LYRA) Lyman-alpha measurements, indicative that the chromospheric downflows (with a maximum redshift of 176 km/s) result from chromospheric condensations associated with impulsive energy release in the solar flare. Later in the event, strong Si IV flare ribbon downflows persist (to a maximum value of 217 km/s), despite the magnetic flux rate falling to zero, and high-energy HXR and Lyman-alpha measurements returning to background levels. This is reflective of downflows in the flare ribbon footpoints of flare-induced coronal rain. Hard X-ray spectral analysis supports this scenario, revealing strong non-thermal emission during the initial downflow stage, falling near background levels by the second stage. Despite these distinct and contrasting stages of ribbon behavior, Si IV Doppler velocities exhibit quasi-periodic pulsations with a constant ~50 s period across the 15-minute flare evolution (independently of loop length). We deduce that these pulsations are likely caused by MHD oscillations in the magnetic arcade. Finally, we utilize machine learning K-means clustering methods to quantify line profile variations during the stages of rapid downflows.</description>

      <title>Large Magnetic Flux Rope Formation in an X2.1 Flare observed on September 6, 2011</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar active region 11283 produced an X2.1 flare associated with a solar eruption on September 6, 2011. Observations revealed a preflare sigmoidal structure and a circular flare ribbon surrounding the typical two ribbon structure, along with remote brightenings located at a considerable distance from the main flare site. To interpret these observations in terms of the three dimensional (3D) coronal magnetic field dynamics, we conducted data constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Using a non linear force free field (NLFFF) as the initial condition, we reconstructed a realistic pre flare magnetic environment, capturing a sheared sigmoid above the polarity inversion line (PIL) surmounted by a fan spine structure. Our simulations revealed that reconnection between the sigmoidal field, the adjacent fan dome field lines, and the neighboring large loops facilitated the transfer of magnetic twist and led to the formation of a large magnetic flux rope (MFR). This transfer and propagation of twist are clearly visible throughout the MFR. As reconnection progresses, the entire fan spine structure expands along with the evolving MFR. A notable outcome of the simulation is that the footpoints of the newly formed MFR align closely with the observed circular flare ribbon and the remote brightening region. Our findings suggest that a large MFR formed during the X2.1 flare, providing a coherent explanation for the observed phenomena.</description>

      <title>Energy-Containing Electrons in Solar Flares: Improving Hard X-Ray and EUV Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares effectively accelerate particles to non-thermal energies. These accelerated electrons are responsible for energy transport and subsequent emissions in HXR, radio, and UV/EUV radiation. Due to the steeply decreasing electron spectrum, the electron population and consequently the overall flare energetics, are predominantly influenced by low-energy non-thermal electrons. However, deducing the electron distribution in this energy-containing range remains a significant challenge. In this study, we apply the warm-target HXR emission model with kappa-form injected electrons to two well-observed GOES M-class flares. Moreover, we utilize EUV observations to constrain the flaring plasma properties, which enables us to determine the characteristics of accelerated electrons across a range from a few keV to tens of keV. We demonstrate that the warm-target model reliably constrains the properties of flare-associated electrons, even accounting for the uncertainties that had previously been unaddressed. The application of a kappa distribution for the accelerated electrons allows for meaningful comparisons with electron distributions inferred from EUV observations, specifically for energy ranges below the detection threshold of RHESSI. Our results indicate that the accelerated electrons constitute only a small fraction of the total electron population within the flaring region. Moreover, the physical parameters, such as electron escape time and acceleration time scale, inferred from both the warm-target model and the EUV observations further support the scenario in which electrons undergo thermalization within the corona. This study highlights the effectiveness of integrating the warm-target model with EUV observations to accurately characterize energy-containing electrons and their associated acceleration and transport processes.</description>

      <title>Newborn jet in the symbiotic system R Aquarii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: R Aquarii (R Aqr) is a well-known symbiotic binary that has attracted renewed interest during its recent periastron passage, an event that occurs only once every about 40 years. This passage marks the first to be observed with modern, state-of-the-art instruments. We investigate the inner, sub-arcsecond active region of R Aqr during this recent periastron passage, with the goal of gaining insight into the jet-launching mechanisms at work in this system. We analyse Ha speckle interferometric images obtained one month apart using Fourier techniques. These are complemented by high-resolution optical spectra in the same emission line. Our speckle imaging reveals a newborn two-sided jet orientated in the north-south direction. Its proper motion, 66 +- 19 mas per year, confirms that it was launched around 2020 Jan 7, at the onset of the periastron passage. Further analysis of the elongated central structure reveals a knot in the southern counterpart of the jet, moving away from the binary with a 27 +- 17 mas per year at a position angle of 187 degrees, and an ejection time around 2019 Oct 28. This interpretation is further supported by our high-resolution spectroscopic data. In addition, we update the expansion parallax distance of R Aqr to 260 pc.</description>

      <title>MHD waves with mixed properties / Alfv\'{e}n waves with pressure variations: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-uniformity plays an important role for MHD waves. For a uniform plasma of infinite extent the MHD waves can be subdivided in two classes with distinct properties. The first class contains the Alfv\'en waves. The Alfv\'en waves are incompressible and propagate parallel vorticity. They do not have a parallel component of displacement, they do not cause variations in pressure and are driven by magnetic tension only. The second class contains the magneto-sonic waves. They are compressible and have a parallel component of displacement. They do not propagate parallel vorticity and are driven by pressure and magnetic tension. In non-uniform plasmas the situation can be very different. The clear division between Alfv\'en waves and magneto-sonic waves is no longer present. In a given part of the equilibrium an MHD wave can strongly resemble a magneto-sonic wave with little or no resemblance to Alfv\'en waves; while in another part of the equilibrium the MHD wave is practically an Alfv\'en wave, which has the amazing property of being accompanied by variations in pressure.</description>

      <title>Solar carbon abundance from 3D non-LTE modelling of the diagnostic lines of the CH molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The spectral lines of the CH molecule are a key carbon (C) abundance diagnostic in FGKM-type stars. These lines are detectable in metal-rich and, in contrast to atomic C lines, also in metal-poor late-type stars. However, only 3D LTE analyses of the CH lines have been performed so far.
  Aims. We test the formation of CH lines in the solar spectrum, using for the first time, 3D Non-LTE (NLTE) models. We also aim to derive the solar photospheric abundance of C, using the diagnostic transitions in the optical (4218 - 4356 {\AA}) and infrared (33025 - 37944 {\AA}).
  Methods. We use the updated NLTE model molecule from Popa et al. (2023) and different solar 3D radiation-hydrodynamics model atmospheres. The models are contrasted against new spatially-resolved optical solar spectra, and the center-to-limb variation (CLV) of CH lines is studied.
  Results. The 1D LTE and 1D NLTE models fail to describe the line CLV, and lead to underestimated solar C abundances. The 3D NLTE modelling of diagnostic lines in the optical and IR yields a carbon abundance of A(C)=$8.52\pm0.07$ dex. The estimate is in agreement with recent results based on neutrino fluxes measured by Borexino.
  Conclusions. 3D NLTE modelling and tests on spatially-resolved solar data are essential to derive robust solar abundances. The analysis presented here focuses on CH, but we expect that similar effects will be present for other molecules of astrophysical interest.</description>

      <title>On the center-to-limb variations of the He I 10 830 \AA\ triplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the quiet-Sun center-to-limb variations (CLV) of the He I triplet at 10 830 {\AA} and the nearby Si I 10 827 {\AA} line, observed with GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) and the improved High-resolution Fast Imager (HiFI+). The observations cover the interval $\mu = [0.1,\, 1.0]$, where $\mu$ is the cosine of the heliocentric angle. At each $\mu$-position, the spectra are spatially averaged over 0.02 $\mu$, and the resulting CLVs are given both as these averaged data points and as smooth polynomial curves fitted across each wavelength point. The He I spectra were inverted using the HAnle and ZEeman Light (HAZEL) code, showing an increase in optical depth towards the limb and a reversed convective blueshift for the red component, while the blue component was entirely absent. In addition, we find a strong increase in the steepness of the He I CLV compared to that of the nearby continuum. The Si I showed a behavior more typical of photospheric lines, namely shallower CLV, a reduction in width and depth, and a more typical convective blueshift.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic Imprints of Mass Transfer in Binary Stars: Probing the Interiors of Donors and Accretors with Gravity and Acoustic Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The synergy between close binary stars and asteroseismology enables constraints on mass-transfer episodes and their consequences for internal structure, rotation profiles, and oscillation modes. Aims. We investigate how mass accretion and donation in close binaries affects the internal structure and oscillation modes of main-sequence stars. Methods. Building on the established relation between the BruntVaisala (buoyancy) glitch and the Fourier spectra of g-mode period spacings presented in Wu et al. and Guo, we quantitatively explain the origins of the g-mode period-spacing differences between single-star and mass-accretion/donation models of intermediate-mass stars (M = 2.0, 3.0, and 4.5 Msun). In particular, the hydrogen mass fraction profiles X of the donor model show two chemical gradient regions, which results in a double-peaked BruntVaisala profile. The presence of additional buoyancy glitches gives rise to further periodic modulations in the g-mode period spacings. Results. Mass-accretion induced changes in the chemical profile create sharp features in the buoyancy frequency, which modify both the amplitudes and frequencies of the g-mode period-spacing variations. This behavior resembles that produced by multiple chemical transition zones in compact pulsators such as white dwarfs and sub-dwarf B (sdB) stars. Similarly, for acoustic modes in the M = 1 Msun solar-like models, we attribute the differences in frequency-separation ratios between single-star and mass-donor models to the variations in the internal sound-speed gradient (acoustic glitches). We discuss future prospects for using asteroseismology to discover the mass-transfer products and constrain the mass-transfer processes in binary star evolution.</description>

      <title>The Formation of Solar Prominences: Plasma Origin and Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar prominences, or solar filaments, are cool and dense plasma structures in the hot solar corona, whose formation mechanisms have remained a fundamental challenge in solar physics. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current theoretical, numerical, and observational understanding of prominence formation, with a focus on the origin of the dense plasma component. We begin by summarizing the magnetic field configurations that enable prominence support, followed by a classification of four representative plasma formation mechanisms: injection, levitation, evaporation--condensation, and in-situ condensation. Each mechanism is analyzed in terms of its physical basis, numerical realizations, and observational diagnostics. A central focus is placed on the evaporation--condensation scenario, which has seen significant development over the past decade through numerical simulations. We also discuss recent progress in modeling in-situ condensation triggered by magnetic reconnection and levitation dynamics. Throughout, we emphasize the complementary nature of different mechanisms and their potential coexistence in forming and maintaining prominence mass. Observational constraints and recent high-resolution data are reviewed to assess the physical plausibility of each mechanism. We conclude by highlighting open questions and future directions in connecting multi-scale physical processes to the observed diversity of prominence behaviors.</description>

      <title>PyEMILI: A New Generation Computer-aided Spectral Line Identifier -- II. Emission-line Identification and Plasma Diagnostics of a Sample of Gaseous Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to test the robustness and reliability of the new generation spectral-line identifier PyEMILI, as initially introduced in Paper I, in line identification and establish a reference/benchmark dataset for future spectroscopic studies, we run the code on the line lists of a selected sample of emission-line nebulae, including planetary nebulae (PNe), HII regions, and Herbig-Haro (HH) objects with deep high-dispersion spectroscopic observations published over the past two decades. The automated line identifications by PyEMILI demonstrate significant improvements in both completeness and accuracy compared to the previous manual identifications in the literature. Since our last report of PyEMILI, the atomic transition database used by the code has been further expanded by cross-matching the Kurucz Line Lists. Moreover, to aid the PyEMILI identification of numerous faint optical recombination lines (ORLs) of CII, NII, OII and NeII, we compiled a new dataset of effective recombination coefficients for these nebular lines, and created a new subroutine in the code to generate theoretical spectra of heavy-element ORLs at various electron temperature and density cases; these theoretical spectra can be used to fit the observed recombination spectrum of a PN to obtain the electron temperature, density and ionic abundances using the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We present MCMC-derived parameters for a sample of PNe. This work establishes PyEMILI as a robust and versatile tool for both line identification and plasma diagnostics in deep spectroscopy of gaseous nebulae.</description>

      <title>The Role of Binary Configuration in Shaping Nova Evolution via Wind Accretion in Symbiotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the Bondi--Hoyle--Lyttleton (BHL) accretion mechanism on the evolution of nova eruptions in symbiotic systems by systematically varying three key input parameters: the initial donor (asymptotic giant branch; AGB) mass, the initial white dwarf (WD) mass, and the initial binary separation ($a$). We explore models with AGB masses in the range $1.5$--$3.5\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$, WD masses in the range $0.7$--$1.25\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$, and separations in the range $1$--$8\,{\rm kR_{\odot}}$. We find that all models exhibit a significant long-term orbital increase. This trend is primarily driven by the fact that approximately $99\%$ of the AGB mass is lost from the system, either directly via a wind that is not accreted by the WD, or accreted onto the WD and subsequently ejected during nova eruptions. As a result, the secular orbital response to mass loss or mass transfer dominates over angular-momentum-loss sinks that could otherwise shrink the orbit, producing a consistent orbital widening. Consequently, all WD masses gradually decrease with time. More massive WDs achieve higher mass-transfer efficiencies and accretion rates, leading to slightly higher mass-retention efficiencies per nova. However, because higher accretion rates also produce more frequent eruptions, the total WD mass lost over the AGB lifetime is larger in these systems. We conclude that symbiotic systems transferring mass via the BHL mechanism are unlikely to be viable progenitors of Type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Massive runaway star HD 254577: the pre-supernova binary companion to the progenitor of the supernova remnant IC 443</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The secondaries of the massive binary systems can be found as runaway stars after being ejected due to the supernova (SN) of the more massive component. We search for such stars inside the supernova remnants (SNRs), where a recent SN is guaranteed to have happened. In this paper, we present the massive runaway star HD~254577 as the pre-supernova binary companion to the progenitor of the supernova remnant IC~443 and the neutron star (NS) CXOU~J61705.3$+$222127. We performed spectroscopic observations of the runaway star and specified its atmospheric parameters. Together with the precise \textit{Gaia} DR3 astrometry and photometry, we identified the possible birth origin of the runaway star, and by isochrone fitting, we determined the progenitor mass. From the \textit{Gaia} DR3 proper motions, we specified the possible explosion sites and calculated the neutron star (NS) velocity. HD~254577 is a hot and evolved star with an effective temperature of $24000\pm1000$ K (B0.5II) and a surface gravity of $\log({g~\rm[cm/s^2]})=2.75\pm0.25$. It is probably a single star with a peculiar 3-D velocity of $31.3^{+1.2}_{-0.9}$ km~s$^{-1}$, lying at a heliocentric distance of $1701^{+55}_{-54}$ pc. The cometary tail of the NS implies that it is moving away from the same site as the runaway star. From the flight trajectories, we calculated that the NS has typical pulsar velocities such as $254-539$ km~s$^{-1}$ at a distance of $1.7$ kpc for $10-20$ kyr ages. Together with the blue-only shifted interstellar medium lines on its spectrum, HD~254577 must be the pre-supernova binary companion to the progenitor of IC~443. By identifying the pre-supernova companion and the possible parent cluster, we showed that the progenitor zero-age main sequence mass is high: $31-64$ M$_\odot$. We also discuss the expansion dynamics of the SNR due to the highly off-centered explosion site.</description>

      <title>TOI-333b: A Neptune Desert planet around a F7V star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations have shown that planets similar to Neptune are rarely found orbiting Sun-like stars with periods up to ~4 days, defining the so-called Neptune desert region. Therefore, the detection of each individual planet in this region holds a high value, providing detailed insights into how such a population came to form and evolve. Here we report the detection of TOI-333b, a Neptune desert planet with a mass, radius, and bulk density of 20.1 $\pm$ 2.4 M$_{\oplus}$, 4.26 $\pm$ 0.11 R$_{\oplus}$, and 1.42 $\pm$ 0.21 \gccc, respectively. The planet orbits a F7V star every 3.78 d, whose mass, radius and effective temperature are of 1.2 $\pm$ 0.1 \msun, 1.10 $\pm$ 0.03 \rsun, and 6241$^{+73}_{-62}$ K, respectively. TOI-333b is likely younger than 1 Gyr, which is supported by the presence of the doublet Li line around 6707.856 textup{~\AA} and its comparison to Li abundances in open clusters with well constrained ages. The planet is expected to host only 8.5$^{+10.9}_{-8.3}\%$ gas-to-core mass ratio for a H/He envelope. On the other hand, irradiated ocean world models predict 20$^{+11}_{-10}\%$ H$_2$O mass fraction with a core fraction of 35$^{+20}_{-23}\%$. Therefore, we expect that TOI-333b internal composition may be dominated by a pure rocky composition with almost no H/He envelope, or a rocky world with almost equal mass fraction of water. Finally, TOI-333b is more massive and larger than 77$\%$ and 82$\%$ of its Neptune desert counterparts, respectively, while its host ranks among the hottest known for Neptune Desert planets, making this system a unique laboratory to study the evolution of such planets around hot stars.</description>

      <title>Phase-Resolved Spectroscopy of the Polar V379 Vir with a Brown Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polar V379 Vir is a well-known magnetic cataclysmic variable with a brown dwarf donor. Despite numerous studies of this system across various spectral ranges, a detailed investigation of the orbital variability of its optical spectra has not been carried out. In this work, we present an analysis of spectroscopic observations of V379 Vir obtained with the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The orbital variability of the H$\alpha$ emission indicates that the line is most likely formed in the accretion stream near the Lagrangian point L$_1$, rather than on the donor's surface as previously assumed. The analysis of the rotational variability of the Zeeman splitting of hydrogen lines reveals a complex magnetic field topology of the white dwarf, which differs from a simple dipole configuration.</description>

      <title>Feedback and Star Formation Efficiency in High-Mass Star-Forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To advance our understanding of massive star formation, it is essential to perform a comprehensive suite of simulations that explore the relevant parameter space and include enough physics to enable a comparison with observational data. We simulate the gravitational collapse of isolated, parsec-scale turbulent cores using the FLASH code, modelling stars as sink particles. Our simulations incorporate ionizing radiation and the associated radiation pressure from stellar sources, and non-ionizing radiation and its dust heating, along with self-consistent chemistry, to capture the properties of emerging ultra-compact HII regions. Dust, gas, and radiation temperature are computed independently. The initial conditions are informed by ALMAGAL observations. We assess stellar feedback, comparing ionizing radiation and radiation pressure. Ionizing radiation ultimately halts mass accretion on to sink particles, while direct radiation pressure enhances the expansion of HII regions. Heating from non-ionizing radiation suppresses fragmentation. We examine the effect of spatial resolution, finding that higher resolution leads to more sink particles which are situated in environments with higher densities. As a result, ionizing radiation remains trapped longer, allowing continued accretion and yielding a higher overall star formation efficiency (SFE). We explore the impact of varying initial conditions, including the core density profile, virial parameter, and metallicity. Our parameter study reveals that a flatter density profile, higher virial parameter, and increased metallicity promote fragmentation, potentially enhancing the SFE by slowing the growth of the most massive stars and delaying the onset of stellar feedback. Overall, we find SFEs between 35% and 57%. Stellar feedback dictates the final SFE.</description>

      <title>A search for transit timing variations in the transiting hot Jupiter systems HIP 65, NGTS-6, NGTS-10 and WASP-173</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters are Jupiter-mass planets with orbital periods of less than ten days. Their short orbital separations make tidal dissipation within the stellar host especially efficient, potentially leading to a measurable evolution of the orbit. One possible manifestation of this is orbital decay, which presents itself observationally through variations in the orbital period and thus times of transit. Here we select four promising exoplanetary systems for detecting this effect: HIP 65, NGTS-6, NGTS-10 and WASP-173. We present 33 new transit light curves taken with the 1.54 m Danish Telescope, and analyse these alongside photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and transit timing data from the literature. We construct two ephemeris models for each target: a linear ephemeris and a shrinking orbital period due to tidal decay. The linear ephemeris is preferred for all four models - the highest significance for the quadratic ephemeris is 2 sigma for WASP-173. We compare these results to theoretical predictions for tidal dissipation of gravity waves in radiation zones, and find that wave breaking is predicted only in WASP-173, making rapid decay plausible in this system but unclear in the other three. The sensitivity of transit timings to orbital decay depends on the square of the time interval covered by available observations, so our results establish a useful baseline against which future measurements can be compared. NGTS-6 and NGTS-10 are important objects for future study as they are in the first field to be observed by the upcoming PLATO mission.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Milky Way's exoplanet population based on cosmological galaxy simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we aim to simulate realistic exoplanet populations across different regions of the MW by combining state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of our Galaxy with exoplanet formation models and observations. We model the exoplanet populations around single stars, using planet occurrence rates and multiplicity depending on stellar mass, metallicity, and planet type, and assign them physical parameters such as mass and orbital period. Focussing first on the solar vicinity, we find mostly metallicity-driven differences in the distributions of non-hosting and planet-hosting single stars. In our simulated solar neighbourhood, 52.5% of all planets are Earth-like (23% of them located in the Habitable Zone), 44% are super-Earths/Neptunes, and 3.5% are giant planets. A comparison with the census of Kepler exoplanets and candidates shows that, when taking into account the most relevant selection effects, we obtain a similar distribution of exoplanets compared to the observed population. However, we also detect significant differences in the exoplanet and host star distributions (e.g. more planets around F-type and red-giant stars compared to observations) that we attribute mostly to a too strong recent star formation and a too large disc scale height in the simulation, as well as to some caveats in our exoplanet population synthesis that will be addressed in future work. Extending our analysis to other regions of the simulated MW and to other simulated galaxies, we find that the relative percentages of planet types remain largely consistent as long as the simulated galaxy matches the morphology and mass of the MW. We have created a fast and flexible framework to produce exoplanet populations based on MW-like simulations that can easily be adapted to produce predictions for the yields of future exoplanet detection missions.

      <title>Evolution of binaries containing a hot subdwarf and a white dwarf to double white dwarfs, and double detonation supernovae with hypervelocity runaway stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs have the potential to evolve into a variety of explosive transients. These systems could also explain hypervelocity runaway stars such as US 708. We use the detailed binary evolution code MESA to evolve hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars interacting in binaries. We explore their evolution towards double detonation supernovae, helium novae, or double white dwarfs. Our grid of 3120 models maps from initial conditions such as orbital period and masses of hot subdwarf and white dwarf to these outcomes. The minimum amount of helium required to ignite the helium shell that leads to a double detonation supernova in our grid is $\approx 0.05 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, likely too large to produce spectra similar to normal type Ia supernovae, but compatible with inferred helium shell masses from some observed peculiar type I supernovae. We also provide the helium shell masses for our double white dwarf systems, with a maximum He shell mass of $\approx 0.18\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. In our double detonation systems, the orbital velocity of the surviving donor star ranges from $\approx 450 \, \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ to $\approx 1000 \, \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Among the surviving donors, we also estimate the runaway velocities of proto-white dwarfs, which have higher runaway velocities than hot subdwarf stars of the same mass. Our grid will provide a first-order estimate of the potential outcomes for the observation of binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs from future missions like Gaia, LSST, and LISA.</description>

      <title>The formation and evolution of dust in the colliding-wind binary Apep revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are significant contributors of carbonaceous dust to the galactic environment, however the mechanisms and conditions for formation and subsequent evolution of dust around these stars remain open questions. Here we present JWST observations of the WR+WR colliding-wind binary Apep which reveal an intricate series of nested concentric dust shells that are abundant in detailed substructure. The striking regularity in these substructures between successive shells suggests an exactly repeating formation mechanism combined with a highly stable outflow that maintains a consistent morphology even after reaching 0.6 pc (assuming a distance of 2.4 kpc) into the interstellar medium. The concentric dust shells show subtle deviations from spherical outflow, which could reflect orbital modulation along the eccentric binary orbit or non-sphericity in the stellar wind. Tracking the evolution of dust across the multi-tiered structure, we measure the dust temperature evolution that can broadly be described assuming an amorphous carbon composition in radiative thermal equilibrium with the central stars. The temperature profile and orbital period place new distance constraints that support Apep being at a greater distance than previously estimated, reducing the line-of-sight and sky-plane wind speed discrepancy previously thought to characterise the system.</description>

      <title>Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C-MetaLL) survey: VII. Metallicity dependence of Period-Wesenheit relations based on a homogeneous spectroscopic sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The C-MetaLL project has provided homogeneous spectroscopic abundances of 290 Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) for which we have the intensity-averaged magnitudes in multiple optical and near-infrared (NIR) bands, periods, pulsation modes, and Gaia parallaxes. Our goal is to derive updated period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relations using the largest and most homogeneous metallicity sample ever used for such analyses, covering a range of $-1.3&lt;$[Fe/H]$&lt;+0.3$ dex. We computed several optical and NIR Wesenheit magnitudes using 275 DCEPs with reliable parallaxes, by applying a robust photometric parallax technique, which simultaneously fits all parameters -- including the global Gaia parallax counter-correction -- and handles outliers without data rejection. We find a stronger metallicity dependence ($\gamma \approx -0.5$ mag/dex in optical, $-0.4$ mag/dex in NIR) than recent literature reports. Gaia parallax zero-point conter-corrections ($\epsilon$) vary smoothly across bands, with an average value of $\sim$10 $\mu$as, aligning with previous determinations. Applying our PWZ relations to LMC Cepheids yields distances generally consistent within $1\sigma$ with geometric estimates. The choice of reddening law has a negligible impact, while using only fundamental-mode pulsators significantly increases the uncertainties. Including $\alpha$-element corrections increases $|\gamma|$ and reduces $\epsilon$. However, we find statistically consistent $\gamma$ values with the literature, particularly for the key Wesenheit magnitude in the HST bands, by restricting the sample to the brighter (i.e. closer) objects, or by including only pulsators with $-0.7&lt;$[Fe/H]$&lt;$0.2 dex. Our results hint at a large $\gamma$ or a non-linear dependence on metallicity of DCEP luminosities at the metal-poor end, which is difficult to quantify with the precision of parallaxes of the present dataset.</description>

      <title>The lack of fast rotators in Cyg OB2. I. Insights from spectral reclassification of its B0 population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Cygnus OB2, in the Cygnus X complex -- one of the most active star-forming regions of the Galaxy -- hosts hundreds of O- and B-type stars at different evolutionary stages. This association provides a unique laboratory to study massive star evolution and dynamics. However, despite extensive studies, the absence of a fast-rotating group ($v\sin{i}&gt;200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) among the O-type population of Cygnus OB2 challenges current models of massive star evolution.
  Aims. Stellar rotation strongly impacts spectral line shapes of O-type stars, and high rotation can potentially lead to misclassifications. We investigate whether some stars in Cygnus OB2, classified at low spectral resolution as B0, are actually rapidly rotating late-O types. Such cases could explain the observed lack of fast rotators in Cygnus OB2.
  Methods. Accounting for rotation, we reclassified the known B0 population in Cygnus OB2, using the MGB tool and both the new and pre-existing optical spectroscopy. Finally, we computed the projected rotational velocities using iacob-broad.
  Results. About $19\,\%$ of the initial B0 population in Cygnus OB2 are, in fact, late-O types. Only six stars in the entire dataset show $v\sin{i}&gt;200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, with just one new O-type star exceeding this threshold.
  Conclusions. In our study of Cygnus OB2, we continue to find a notable lack of fast rotators among its O-type population. We propose a combination of three factors as the most likely explanation: (i) the young age of Cygnus OB2 may imply that fast rotators have not been produced yet due to binary interactions; (ii) fast rotators may have been dynamically ejected from the core as runaway stars; and (iii) local star formation conditions may hinder binary formation (reducing spin-up interactions) or result in slower rotational velocities at birth.</description>

Abstract: The Luminosity Oscillations Imager (LOI) of the Variability of Solar Irradiance and Gravity Oscillations (VIRGO) instrument aboard the SoHO mission has been operating for almost the past 30 years.
  I report on the effect of solar activity upon mode frequencies, linewidths, height and energy rate. I report on the variation as a function of frequency for frequency, $a_2$ coefficient and linewidth changes, as well as the average over the degree and the frequency of these changes. Using the 29-year time series, I report on the frequencies, linewidths and mode height fitted with \texttt{progFIT}. Using the collapsogram technique, I also report on the detection of modes below 1600 $\mu$Hz, making the lowest frequencies detected with an instrument observing the Sun in intensity. I also report on the detection of p mode in the high voltage and guiding pixel signals with a mode height about 5 to 10 times larger than what is observed in the Sun-as-a-star signal for $l=1$. The ratios of the observed mode visibilities for the different signals are provided following a calibration of the size of the guiding pixels. While the visibility ratios for the signals excluding the limb are in good agreement with theory, those covering the solar limb are in strong disagreement.</description>

Abstract: Latitude distribution of stellar magnetic activity is not well constrained by observations, despite its importance for a better understanding of stellar dynamos. We aim to obtain an accurate reconstruction of the surface spot distribution on the young, rapidly rotating K2 star PW And by combining spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics. In particular, we seek to assess how the inclusion of continuous high-precision TESS photometry in parallel with high-resolution spectroscopy improves latitude recovery of starspots, especially at low latitudes and in the southern hemisphere, which are poorly constrained by Doppler imaging (DI) alone. We explore the spatial origins of the observed white-light flares. We performed simultaneous Doppler imaging and light curve inversion (DI+LCI) using contemporaneous high-resolution GAOES-RV spectra from the 3.8 m Seimei telescope (R~65000) and high-precision TESS light curves. Surface reconstructions employ the SpotDIPy code to model both line profiles and continuum brightness variations. We compare DI+LCI maps with DI-only solutions, conduct artificial-spot simulations to evaluate the effects of latitude, phase coverage, and S/N on reconstruction reliability. We also investigate the spatial correlation between the DI+LCI reconstructed map and flares detected in the TESS data. The DI+LCI reconstruction reveals significant spot features at mid-to-low latitudes, equatorial regions, and even in the southern hemisphere. Simulations show that DI+LCI provides more accurate reconstructions than DI-only, especially under conditions of incomplete phase coverage and low S/N, by better recovering both spot latitudes and filling factors. A comparison between the DI+LCI map and the TESS flare timings also suggests potential association between flare occurrence and reconstructed spot longitudes.</description>

      <title>SN 2016iog: A fast declining Type II-L supernova with an ultra-faint tail, persistently interacting with circumstellar material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the rapidly declining Type IIL supernova (SN) 2016iog. SN 2016iog reached its peak $\sim$ 14 days after explosion, with an absolute magnitude in the $V$ band of $-18.64 \pm 0.15$ mag, followed by a steep decline of $8.85 \pm 0.15$~mag~(100\,d)$^{-1}$ post-peak. Such a high decline rate makes SN~2016iog one of the fastest declining Type~IIL SNe observed to date. The rapid rise in the light curve, combined with the nearly featureless continuum observed in the spectrum at +9.3 days, suggests the presence of interaction. In the recombination phase, we observed broad H$\alpha$ lines that persist at all epochs. In addition, the prominent double-peaked H$\alpha$ feature observed in the late-time spectrum (+190.8 days) is likely attributable either to significant dust formation within a cool dense shell or to asymmetric circumstellar material. These features suggest the presence of sustained interaction around SN~2016iog. We propose that the observed characteristics of SN~2016iog can be qualitatively explained by assuming a low-mass H-rich envelope surrounding a red supergiant progenitor star with low-density circumstellar material.</description>

      <title>A Bimodal Metallicity Distribution Function in the Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxy Reticulum II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Star formation in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs, $M_* &lt;10^5M_\odot$) is suppressed by reionization, but may not be completely quenched. The metallicity distribution function (MDF) of stars in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies could show these signatures of reionization. However, past studies of UFD MDFs have been limited, because there are only a few dozen red giant branch (RGB) stars in such low-mass galaxies. We present low-resolution Magellan/IMACS spectroscopy of 167 stars in the UFD Reticulum II ($M_* \approx 3000 M_\odot$), increasing the number of stellar metallicities by 6.5 times and resulting in the most populated spectroscopic metallicity distribution function of any UFD. This is possible because we determined the first spectroscopic metallicities of main sequence turn-off stars in any UFD. The MDF of Reticulum II is clearly a bimodal distribution, displaying two peaks with about $80\%$ of the stars in the metal-poor peak at $\rm[Fe/H]=-3.0$ and $20\%$ of the stars in the more metal-rich peak at $\rm[Fe/H]=-2.1$. Such a large metallicity gap can be explained by Type Ia supernova enrichment during a long quiescent period. This supports the currently-favored two-burst star formation history for Reticulum II and shows that such low-mass galaxies clearly can form stars after reionization.</description>

      <title>JWST's PEARLS: Temperatures of Nine Highly Magnified Stars in a Galaxy at Redshift 0.94 and Simulated Stellar Population Dependence on Stellar Metallicity and the Initial Mass Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present stellar atmosphere modeling of JWST NIRCam photometry of nine highly magnified individual stars in a single galaxy at redshift z=0.94 known as the Warhol arc, which is strongly lensed by the galaxy cluster MACSJ0416. Seven of these transients were identified by Yan et al. (2023). The nine sources are all likely red supergiants with temperatures of T~4000K. We present new longslit spectroscopy of the Warhol arc acquired with Keck-I and the Large Binocular Telescope, and use these data to constrain the arc's oxygen abundance to be 12+log(O/H)=8.45+-0.08. We perform a microlensing simulation on synthetic stellar populations using a range of stellar metallicities and initial mass function slopes. The temperature distribution of the simulated detectable stars is sensitive to the choice of stellar metallicity, and setting the stellar metallicity equal to the arc's nebular metallicity (log(Z*/Zsun)=-0.24) produces a simulated temperature distribution that is consistent with the observations, while lower stellar metallicities (log(Z*/Zsun)&lt;-0.75) produce simulated temperatures that are inconsistent with the observations. The expected detection rate is strongly anticorrelated with the IMF slope for alpha&gt;1.2. For the canonical IMF slope alpha=2.35, the simulation yields expected transient detection rates that agree with the observed detection rates in the HST Flashlights filters, but over predicts the detection rate by a factor of ~3-12 (&lt;2sigma tension) in the JWST filters. The simulated detection rate is sensitive to the choice of stellar metallicity, with lower metallicities (log(Z*/Zsun)&lt;-0.75) yielding a significantly lower simulated detection rate that further reduces the modest tension with the observations.</description>

      <title>The periastron regression of 2M1510 AB, the jet precession of M87* and Telisto/Planet Nine: three different scenarios for a possible common cause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-term rates of change of all the Keplerian orbital elements of a two-body system acted upon by a remote massive pointlike object are analytically worked out, to the Newtonian quadrupolar level, without any restriction either on the orbital eccentricity and inclination of the disturbed pair or the position of the distant perturber. The latter is considered fixed during the average over one orbital revolution of the inner binary by means of which its orbital perturbations are calculated. The results are presented in a compact form that facilitates a straightforward application, for example, to the cases of the eclipsing binary 2M1510 AB made of two brown dwarfs, the supermassive black hole-or megapyknon-M87$^\ast$ and our solar system, although they are not limited to such interesting astronomical scenarios alone. The aforementioned systems may all have in common the presence of a distant point mass perturbing in some ways their inner dynamics. That is, respectively, a circumbinary exoplanet whose orbital plane should be perpendicular to that of its host inner binary, an intermediate mass black hole potentially causing the observed jet precession, and a still unseen planet, known as Telisto or Planet Nine, which may, perhaps, have been recently spotted in archival images although in a quite different orbit with respect to that originally expected. For each of the considered cases, exclusion plots in their parameter spaces are provided.</description>

      <title>Hubble reveals complex multi-scale structure in the edge-on protoplanetary disk IRAS 23077+6707</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present high-resolution ($\lesssim 0.1''$) Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) imaging of the near edge-on ($i{\sim}80^\circ$) protoplanetary disk IRAS 23077+6707 ("Dracula's Chivito") obtained across six broadband filters spanning $0.4-1.6\,\mu$m. These observations unveil the scattered light from this unusually large disk (${\sim}14''$, or ${\sim}4200\,\mathrm{au}$ at $300\,\mathrm{pc}$) in remarkable detail, revealing a rich tapestry of substructures, including brightness asymmetries and signatures of dynamical activity. Extended filaments are detected extending ${\sim}10''$ from the northern edges of both nebulae, while no comparable southern features are observed. In addition to large-scale asymmetries, the disk exhibits prominent wispy features that extend well above the midplane and are visible in all filters, suggesting a complex, possibly turbulent outer disk atmosphere shaped by infall, dynamical stirring, or gravitational instability. The central dark lane narrows from optical to near-IR wavelengths, and high-resolution millimeter data reveal compact midplane emission. Although our radiative transfer simulations show that the current data cannot yet distinguish between dust settling and no-settling scenarios, they underscore the need for resolved mid-infrared observations of this unique system. IRAS 23077+6707 thus represents a rare and valuable laboratory for studying the vertical structure, asymmetries, and evolutionary state of protoplanetary disks.</description>
