      <title>A Survey of Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pinching-antenna system (PASS), recently proposed as a flexible-antenna technology, has been regarded as a promising solution for several challenges in next-generation wireless networks. It provides large-scale antenna reconfiguration, establishes stable line-of-sight links, mitigates signal blockage, and exploits near-field advantages through its distinctive architecture. This article aims to present a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in PASS. The fundamental principles of PASS are first discussed, including its hardware architecture, circuit and physical models, and signal models. Several emerging PASS designs, such as segmented PASS (S-PASS), center-fed PASS (C-PASS), and multi-mode PASS (M-PASS), are subsequently introduced, and their design features are discussed. In addition, the properties and promising applications of PASS for wireless sensing are reviewed. On this basis, recent progress in the performance analysis of PASS for both communications and sensing is surveyed, and the performance gains achieved by PASS are highlighted. Existing research contributions in optimization and machine learning are also summarized, with the practical challenges of beamforming and resource allocation being identified in relation to the unique transmission structure and propagation characteristics of PASS. Finally, several variants of PASS are presented, and key implementation challenges that remain open for future study are discussed.</description>

      <title>SynthRM: A Synthetic Data Platform for Vision-Aided Mobile System Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-aided wireless sensing is emerging as a cornerstone of 6G mobile computing. While data-driven approaches have advanced rapidly, establishing a precise geometric correspondence between ego-centric visual data and radio propagation remains a challenge. Existing paradigms typically either associate 2D topology maps and auxiliary information with radio maps, or provide 3D perspective views limited by sparse radio data. This spatial representation flattens the complex vertical interactions such as occlusion and diffraction that govern signal behavior in urban environments, rendering the task of cross-view signal inference mathematically ill-posed. To resolve this geometric ambiguity, we introduce SynthRM, a scalable synthetic data platform. SynthRM implements a Visible-Aligned-Surface simulation strategy: rather than probing a global volumetric grid, it performs ray-tracing directly onto the geometry exposed to the sensor. This approach ensures pixel-level consistency between visual semantics and electromagnetic response, transforming the learning objective into a physically well-posed problem. We demonstrate the platform's capabilities by presenting a diverse, city-scale dataset derived from procedurally generated environments. By combining efficient procedural synthesis with high-fidelity electromagnetic modeling, SynthRM provides a transparent, accessible foundation for developing next-generation mobile systems for environment-aware sensing and communication.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Consistent Low-Complexity Outlier Hypothesis Testing for Continuous Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit outlier hypothesis testing and propose exponentially consistent, low-complexity fixed-length tests that achieve a better tradeoff between detection performance and computational complexity than existing exhaustive-search methods. In this setting, the goal is to identify outlying sequences from a set of observed sequences, where most sequences are i.i.d. from a nominal distribution and outliers are i.i.d. from a different anomalous distribution. While prior work has primarily focused on discrete-valued sequences, we extend the results of Bu et al. (TSP 2019) to continuous-valued sequences and develop a distribution-free test based on the MMD metric. Our framework handles both known and unknown numbers of outliers. In the unknown-count case, we bound the detection performance and characterize the tradeoff among the exponential decay rates of three types of error probabilities. Finally, we quantify the performance penalty incurred when the number of outliers is unknown.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces-Based Electromagnetic Wave Domain Interference-Free Precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an interference-free multi-stream transmission architecture leveraging stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), from a new perspective of interference exploitation. Unlike traditional interference exploitation precoding (IEP) which relies on computational hardware circuitry, we perform the precoding operations within the analog wave domain provided by SIMs. However, the benefits of SIM-enabled IEP are limited by the nonlinear distortion (NLD) caused by power amplifiers. A hardware-efficient interference-free transmitter architecture is developed to exploit SIM's high and flexible degree of freedom (DoF), where the NLD on modulated symbols can be directly compensated in the wave domain. Moreover, we design a frame-level SIM configuration scheme and formulate a maxmin problem on the safety margin function. With respect to the optimization of SIM phase shifts, we propose a recursive oblique manifold (ROM) algorithm to tackle the complex coupling among phase shifts across multiple layers. A flexible DoF-driven antenna selection (AS) scheme is explored in the SIM-enabled IEP system. Using an ROM-based alternating optimization (ROM-AO) framework, our approach jointly optimizes transmit AS, SIM phase shift design, and power allocation (PA), and develops a greedy safety margin-based AS algorithm. Simulations show that the proposed SIM-enabled frame-level IEP scheme significantly outperforms benchmarks. Specifically, the strategy with AS and PA can achieve a 20 dB performance gain compared to the case without any strategy under the 12 dB signal-to-noise ratio, which confirms the superiority of the NLD-aware IEP scheme and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Double IRS aided Secure Communication for MIMO-OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative double intelligent reflecting surface (double-IRS) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing physical layer security (PLS) in MIMO systems. However, existing studies are limited to narrowband scenarios and fail to address wideband MIMO-OFDM. In this regime, frequency-flat IRS phases and cascaded IRS links cause severe coupling, rendering narrowband designs inapplicable. To overcome this challenge, we introduce cooperative double-IRS-assisted wideband MIMO-OFDM and propose an efficient manifold-based solution. By regarding the power and constant modulus constraints as Riemannian manifolds, we reformulate the non-convex secrecy sum rate maximization as an unconstrained optimization on a product manifold. Building on this formulation, we further develop a product Riemannian gradient descent (PRGD) algorithm with guaranteed stationary convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively resolves the OFDM coupling issue and achieves significant secrecy rate gains, outperforming single-IRS and distributed multi-IRS benchmarks by 32.0% and 22.3%, respectively.</description>

      <title>AoI-Driven Queue Management and Power Control in V2V Networks: A GNN-Enhanced MARL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Queue management and resource allocation play a critical role in enabling cooperative status awareness in vehicular networks. This paper investigates the problem of age of information (AoI)-aware status updates in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, where each vehicle's status is represented by multiple interdependent packets. To enable fine-grained queue management at the packet level under resource constraints, we formulate a joint optimization problem that simultaneously learns active packet dropping and transmit power control strategies. A hybrid action space is designed to support both discrete dropping decisions and continuous power control. To exploit the graph-structured interference inherent in V2V topology, a graph neural network (GNN) is introduced to aggregate slowly varying large-scale fading, allowing agents to capture topological dependencies implicitly without frequent message exchange. The overall framework is built upon multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE). Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces average AoI across a wide range of network densities, channel conditions, and traffic loads, consistently outperforming several baselines.</description>

      <title>Master-Assisted Distributed Uplink Operation for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output is considered a promising technology for the next generation of wireless communication networks. The main idea is to distribute a large number of access points (APs) in a geographical region to serve the user equipments (UEs) cooperatively. In the uplink, one of two types of operations is often adopted: centralized or distributed. In centralized operation, channel estimation and data decoding are performed at the central processing unit (CPU), whereas in distributed operation, channel estimation occurs at the APs and data detection at the CPU. In this paper, we propose a novel uplink operation, termed Master-Assisted Distributed Uplink Operation (MADUO), where each UE is assigned a master AP, which receives soft data estimates from the other APs and decodes the data using its local signals and the received data estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed operation performs comparably to the centralized operation and balances fronthaul signaling and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Design of RIS-aided mMTC+ Networks for Rate Maximization under the Finite Blocklength Regime with Imperfect Channel Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the context of massive machine-type communications+, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) represent a promising technology to boost system performance in scenarios with poor channel conditions. Considering single-antenna sensors transmitting short data packets to a multiple-antenna collector node, we introduce and design an RIS to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of the system working in the finite blocklength regime. Due to the large number of reflecting elements and their passive nature, channel estimation errors may occur. In this letter, we then propose a robust RIS optimization to combat such a detrimental issue. Based on concave bounds and approximations, the nonconvex WSR problem for the RIS response is addressed via successive convex optimization (SCO). Numerical experiments validate the performance and complexity of the SCO solutions.</description>

      <title>Cramer-Rao Bound for Arbitrarily Constrained Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the estimation of parameters confined to an arbitrary set. Unlike existing results that rely on equality or inequality constraints, manifold structures, or the nonsingularity of the Fisher information matrix, the derived CRB applies to any constrained set and holds for any estimation bias and any Fisher information matrix. The key geometric object governing the new CRB is the tangent cone to the constraint set, whose span determines how the constraints affect the estimation accuracy. This CRB subsumes, unifies, and generalizes known special cases, offering an intuitive and broadly applicable framework to characterize the minimum mean-square error of constrained estimators.</description>

      <title>Exposure-Aware Beamforming for mmWave Systems: From EM Theory to Thermal Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) exposure compliance has long been recognized as a crucial aspect of communications terminal designs. However, accurately assessing the impact of EM exposure for proper design strategies remains challenging. In this paper, we develop a long-term thermal EM exposure constraint model and propose a novel adaptive exposure-aware beamforming design for an mmWave uplink system. Specifically, we first establish an equivalent channel model based on Maxwell's radiation equations, which accurately captures the EM physical effects. Then, we derive a closed-form thermal impulse response model from the Pennes bioheat transfer equation (BHTE), characterizing the thermal inertia of tissue. Inspired by this model, we formulate a beamforming optimization problem that translates rigid instantaneous exposure limits into a flexible long-term thermal budget constraint. Furthermore, we develop a low-complexity online beamforming algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization theory, obtaining a closed-form near-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively stabilizes tissue temperature near a predefined safety threshold and significantly outperforms the conventional scheme with instantaneous exposure constraints.</description>

      <title>Robust Design of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for Parameter Estimation in MTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to support parameter estimation in machine-type communications (MTC). We focus on a network where single-antenna sensors transmit spatially correlated measurements to a multiple-antenna collector node (CN) via non-orthogonal multiple access. We propose an estimation scheme based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. We also integrate successive interference cancelation (SIC) at the receiver to mitigate communication failures in noisy and interference-prone channels under the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. Moreover, recognizing the importance of channel state information (CSI), we explore various methodologies for its acquisition at the CN. We statistically design the RIS configuration and SIC decoding order to minimize estimation error while accounting for channel temporal variations and short packet lengths. To mirror practical systems, we incorporate the detrimental effects of FBL communication and imperfect CSI errors in our analysis. Simulations demonstrate that larger reflecting surfaces lead to smaller MSEs and underscore the importance of selecting an appropriate decoding order for accuracy and ultimate performance.</description>

      <title>Initial Characterization of Healthy and Malignant in vivo and ex vivo Human Colon Tissues under Surgery Procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dielectric characterization of human tissues can play a crucial role in the development of new medical diagnostic tools. In particular, the characterization of healthy and pathological tissues can provide vital information for diagnosis. In this paper, preliminary results from a small-scale measurement campaign conducted in 0.5-26.5GHz during real surgeries on healthy and malignant human colon tissues are presented. Those measurements were carried out externally to the colon, without direct contact to the tumor growing inside the colon. Furthermore, different tumor stages are taken into account. Initial findings reveal that advanced tumor stages are related with increased higher values of dielectric properties in malignant tumor tissues compared to the healthy ones.</description>

      <title>Robust Covariance-Based DoA Estimation under Weather-Induced Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate robust direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation for sensor arrays operating in adverse weather conditions, where weather-induced distortions degrade estimation accuracy. Building on a physics-based $S$-matrix model established in prior work, we adopt a statistical characterization of random phase and amplitude distortions caused by multiple scattering in rain. Based on this model, we develop a measurement framework for uniform linear arrays (ULAs) that explicitly incorporates such distortions. To mitigate their impact, we exploit the Hermitian Toeplitz (HT) structure of the covariance matrix to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated. We then apply a generalized least squares (GLS) approach for calibration. Simulation results show that the proposed method effectively suppresses rain-induced distortions, improves DoA estimation accuracy, and enhances radar sensing performance in challenging weather conditions.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free MIMO in Space: Cooperative Satellite Transmission with Multi-Antenna Ground Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a multi-user downlink communication framework for distributed low Earth orbit satellite networks serving ground users equipped with multiple antennas. Building upon the concept of cell-free multiple-input multiple-output in terrestrial networks, we propose a coordinated transmission scheme where multiple satellites jointly transmit spatially multiplexed data streams to each user. Using a new approximate achievable rate expression, we formulate a sum rate maximization problem under per-satellite and per-antenna power constraints and use the classical equivalence between sum rate maximization and mean square error minimization to optimize the satellites' precoding matrices using statistical channel state information. We numerically examine the performance of the proposed scheme in different settings and validate its effectiveness by comparing it against traditional precoding designs.</description>

      <title>Maximum A Posteriori Probability Channel Tracking with an Intelligent Transmitting Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers an intelligent transmitting surface (ITS) integrated into a base station and develops a low-overhead maximum a posteriori (MAP) probability channel tracking method for the dominant line-of-sight link between the ITS and the user equipment. We cast the per-block channel as a three-parameter model consisting of the channel amplitude, channel phase, and angle-of-arrival at the ITS. We exploit temporal correlation by updating the priors using the estimates from the previous block. Using only two pilots per coherence block alongside a targeted beam alignment strategy, the proposed method achieves precise channel tracking and attains spectral efficiency close to that achievable under perfect channel knowledge.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation using 5G Sounding Reference Signals: A Delay-Doppler Domain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delay-Doppler multicarrier modulation (DDMC) techniques have been among the central topics of research for high-Doppler channels. However, a complete transition to DDMC-based waveforms is not yet practically feasible. This is because 5G NR based waveforms, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM), remain as the modulation schemes for the sixth-generation radio (6GR). Hence, in this paper, we demonstrate how we can still benefit from DD-domain processing in high-mobility scenarios using 5G NR sounding reference signals (SRSs). By considering a DFT-s-OFDM receiver, we transform each received OFDM symbol into the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the channel is then estimated. With this approach, we estimate the DD channel parameters, allowing us to predict the aged channel over OFDM symbols without pilots. To improve channel prediction, we propose a linear joint channel estimation and equalization technique, where we use the detected data in each OFDM symbol to sequentially update our channel estimates. Our simulation results show that the proposed technique significantly outperforms the conventional frequency-domain estimation technique in terms of bit error rate (BER) and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). Furthermore, we show that using only two slots with SRS for initial channel estimation, our method supports pilot-free detection for more than 25 subsequent OFDM symbols.</description>

      <title>Generative Latent Alignment for Interpretable Radar Based Occupancy Detection in Ambient Assisted Living</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study how to make mmWave radar presence detection more interpretable for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) settings, where camera-based sensing raises privacy concerns. We propose a Generative Latent Alignment (GLA) framework that combines a lightweight convolutional variational autoencoder with a frozen CLIP text encoder to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of radar Range-Angle (RA) heatmaps. The latent space is softly aligned with two semantic anchors corresponding to "empty room" and "person present", and Grad-CAM is applied in this aligned latent space to visualize which spatial regions support each presence decision. On our mmWave radar dataset, we qualitatively observe that the "person present" class produces compact Grad-CAM blobs that coincide with strong RA returns, whereas "empty room" samples yield diffuse or no evidence. We also conduct an ablation study using unrelated text prompts, which degrades both reconstruction and localization, suggesting that radar-specific anchors are important for meaningful explanations in this setting.</description>

      <title>How Much Temporal Modeling is Enough? A Systematic Study of Hybrid CNN-RNN Architectures for Multi-Label ECG Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains challenging due to the coexistence of multiple cardiac conditions, pronounced class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead recordings. Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity. This configuration attains superior Hamming loss (0.0338), macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723) compared with deeper recurrent combinations. Although stacked recurrent models occasionally improve recall for specific rare classes, our results provide empirical evidence that increasing recurrent depth yields diminishing returns and may degrade generalization due to reduced precision and overfitting. These findings suggest that architectural alignment with the intrinsic temporal structure of ECG signals, rather than increased recurrent depth, is a key determinant of robust performance and clinically relevant deployment.</description>

      <title>Accelerated training of Gaussian processes using banded square exponential covariances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to computationally efficient GP training based on the observation that square-exponential (SE) covariance matrices contain several off-diagonal entries extremely close to zero. We construct a principled procedure to eliminate those entries to produce a \emph{banded}-matrix approximation to the original covariance, whose inverse and determinant can be computed at a reduced computational cost, thus contributing to an efficient approximation to the likelihood function. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method to preserve the structure of the original covariance in the 1D setting with SE kernel, and validate its computational efficiency against the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single-Window Graph Fourier Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multi-windowed graph Fourier transform (MWGFT) for the joint vertex-frequency analysis of signals defined on graphs. Building on generalized translation and modulation induced by the graph Laplacian, the proposed framework extends the windowed graph Fourier transform by allowing multiple analysis and synthesis windows. Exact reconstruction formulas are derived for complex-valued graph signals, together with sufficient and computable conditions guaranteeing stable invertibility. The associated families of windowed graph Fourier atoms are shown to form frames for the space of graph signals. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world graphs confirm exact reconstruction up to machine precision and demonstrate improved stability and vertex-frequency localization compared to single-window constructions, particularly on irregular graph topologies.</description>

      <title>Recover Cell Tensor: Diffusion-Equivalent Tensor Completion for Fluorescence Microscopy Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy (FM) imaging is a fundamental technique for observing live cell division, one of the most essential processes in the cycle of life and death. Observing 3D live cells requires scanning through the cell volume while minimizing lethal phototoxicity. That limits acquisition time and results in sparsely sampled volumes with anisotropic resolution and high noise. Existing image restoration methods, primarily based on inverse problem modeling, assume known and stable degradation processes and struggle under such conditions, especially in the absence of high-quality reference volumes. In this paper, from a new perspective, we propose a novel tensor completion framework tailored to the nature of FM imaging, which inherently involves nonlinear signal degradation and incomplete observations. Specifically, FM imaging with equidistant Z-axis sampling is essentially a tensor completion task under a uniformly random sampling condition. On one hand, we derive the theoretical lower bound for exact cell tensor completion, validating the feasibility of accurately recovering 3D cell tensor. On the other hand, we reformulate the tensor completion problem as a mathematically equivalent score-based generative model. By incorporating structural consistency priors, the generative trajectory is effectively guided toward denoised and geometrically coherent reconstructions. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on SR-CACO-2 and three real \textit{in vivo} cellular datasets, showing substantial improvements in both signal-to-noise ratio and structural fidelity.</description>

      <title>Scalable Beamforming Design for Multi-RIS-Aided MU-MIMO Systems with Imperfect CSIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a scalable beamforming design for maximizing the spectral efficiency (SE) of multi-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided communications through joint optimization of the precoder and RIS phase shifts in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems under imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). To address key challenges of the joint optimization problem, we first decompose it into two subproblems by deriving a proper lower bound. We then leverage a generalized power iteration (GPI) approach to identify a superior local optimal precoding solution. We further extend this approach to the RIS design using regularization; we set a RIS regularization function to efficiently handle the unit-modulus constraints, and also find the superior local optimal solution for RIS phase shifts under the GPI-based optimization framework. Subsequently, we propose an alternating optimization method. Our proposed algorithm offers scalable multi-RIS beamforming in terms of computational complexity that scales linearly with the number of RISs, while achieving superior performance. We further reduce the complexity with respect to the number of RIS elements by using diagonal approximation of the channel error covariance and avoiding direct matrix inversion. Simulations validate the proposed algorithm in terms of both the sum SE performance and the scalability.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Performance of a Keyhole-based Multi-user System with Multiple Eavesdroppers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the secrecy performance of a keyhole-aided multi-user communication network in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. The communication happens through the same keyhole for legitimate users and eavesdroppers. In this context, the secrecy performance is evaluated for a user scheduling technique by obtaining the exact closed-form expression of secrecy outage probability (SOP). Further, a simplified asymptotic SOP expression is derived assuming high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenario for a better understanding of the impact of system parameters. The effect of the keyhole parameters, number of users, number of eavesdroppers, and threshold secrecy rate on the SOP performance are also investigated for the considered system model. In the high-SNR regime, the asymptotic SOP saturates to a constant value and does not depend on the keyhole parameter and the channel parameter of the source-to-keyhole channel.</description>

      <title>Image Steganography For Securing Intellicise Wireless Networks: "Invisible Encryption" Against Eavesdroppers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As one of the most promising technologies for intellicise (intelligent and consice) wireless networks, Semantic Communication (SemCom) significantly improves communication efficiency by extracting, transmitting, and recovering semantic information, while reducing transmission delay. However, an integration of communication and artificial intelligence (AI) also exposes SemCom to security and privacy threats posed by intelligent eavesdroppers. To address this challenge, image steganography in SemCom embeds secret semantic features within cover semantic features, allowing intelligent eavesdroppers to decode only the cover image. This technique offers a form of "invisible encryption" for SemCom. Motivated by these advancements, this paper conducts a comprehensive exploration of integrating image steganography into SemCom. Firstly, we review existing encryption techniques in SemCom and assess the potential of image steganography in enhancing its security. Secondly, we delve into various image steganographic paradigms designed to secure SemCom, encompassing three categories of joint source-channel coding (JSCC) models tailored for image steganography SemCom, along with multiple training strategies. Thirdly, we present a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of coverless steganography SemCom. Finally, we propose future research directions for image steganography SemCom.</description>

      <title>Attention-Aided MMSE for OFDM Channel Estimation: Learning Linear Filters with Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00452v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing-based approaches, such as linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) estimation, often require second-order statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural network (DNN)-based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often suffer from high inference complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE (A-MMSE), a model-based DNN framework that learns the linear MMSE filter via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE performs channel estimation through a single linear operation, eliminating nonlinear activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To improve the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention encoder that captures the frequency and temporal correlation structure of OFDM channels. We also introduce a rank-adaptive extension that enables a flexible performance-complexity trade-off. Numerical simulations show that the proposed A-MMSE consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its rank-adaptive extension provide an improved performance-complexity trade-off, providing a powerful and highly efficient solution for practical channel estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04435v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) offer remarkable spatial flexibility but face significant challenges in acquiring high-resolution channel state information (CSI), leading to considerable overhead. To address this issue, we propose CANet, a robust deep learning model for channel extrapolation in FAS. CANet combines context-adaptive modeling with a cross-scale attention mechanism and is built on a ConvNeXt v2 backbone to improve extrapolation accuracy for unobserved antenna ports. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a novel spatial amplitude perturbation strategy, inspired by frequency-domain augmentation techniques in image processing. This motivates the incorporation of a Fourier-domain loss function, capturing frequency-domain consistency, alongside a spectral structure consistency loss that reinforces learning stability under perturbations. Our simulation results demonstrate that CANet outperforms benchmark models across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels.</description>

      <title>HYPERDOA: Robust and Efficient DoA Estimation using Hyperdimensional Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation techniques face a critical trade-off, as classical methods often lack accuracy in challenging, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, while modern deep learning approaches are too energy-intensive and opaque for resource-constrained, safety-critical systems. We introduce HYPERDOA, a novel estimator leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). The framework introduces two distinct feature extraction strategies -- Mean Spatial-Lag Autocorrelation and Spatial Smoothing -- for its HDC pipeline, and then reframes DoA estimation as a pattern recognition problem. This approach leverages HDC's inherent robustness to noise and its transparent algebraic operations to bypass the expensive matrix decompositions and "black-box" nature of classical and deep learning methods, respectively. Our evaluation demonstrates that HYPERDOA achieves ~35.39% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in low-SNR, coherent-source scenarios. Crucially, it also consumes ~93% less energy than competing neural baselines on an embedded NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform. This dual advantage in accuracy and efficiency establishes HYPERDOA as a robust and viable solution for mission-critical applications on edge devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a record-high 62.6 GHz solidly mounted acoustic resonator (SMR) incorporating a 67.6 nm scandium aluminum nitride (Sc0.3Al0.7N) piezoelectric layer on a 40 nm buried platinum (Pt) bottom electrode, positioned above an acoustic Bragg reflector composed of alternating SiO2 (28.2 nm) and Ta2O5 (24.3 nm) layers in 8.5 pairs. The Bragg reflector and piezoelectric stack above are designed to confine a third-order thickness-extensional (TE) bulk acoustic wave (BAW) mode, while efficiently transducing with thickness-field excitation. The fabricated SMR exhibits an extracted piezoelectric coupling coefficient (k2) of 0.8% and a maximum Bode quality factor (Q) of 51 at 63 GHz, representing the highest operating frequency reported for an SMR to date. These results establish a pathway toward mmWave SMR devices for filters and resonators in next-generation RF front ends.</description>

      <title>Delay-Multiply-And-Sum Beamforming for Real-Time In-Air Acoustic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-air acoustic imaging systems demand beamforming techniques that offer a high dynamic range and spatial resolution while also remaining robust. Conventional Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamforming fails to meet these quality demands due to high sidelobes, a wide main lobe and the resulting low contrast, whereas advanced adaptive methods are typically precluded by the computational cost and the single-snapshot constraint of real-time field operation. To overcome this trade-off, we propose and detail the implementation of higher-order non-linear beamforming methods using the Delay-Multiply-and-Sum technique, coupled with Coherence Factor weighting, specifically adapted for ultrasonic in-air microphone arrays. Our efficient implementation allows for enabling GPU-accelerated, real-time performance on embedded computing platforms. Through validation against the DAS baseline using simulated and real-world acoustic data, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides significant improvements in image contrast, establishing higher-order non-linear beamforming as a practical, high-performance solution for in-air acoustic imaging.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Source Separation, Synchronization, Localization and Mapping for 6G Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multipath-based simultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) is a promising approach for future 6G networks to jointly estimate the positions of transmitters and receivers together with the propagation environment. In cooperative MP-SLAM, information collected by multiple mobile-terminals (MTs) is fused to enhance accuracy and robustness. Existing methods, however, typically assume perfectly synchronized base stations (BSs) and orthogonal transmission sequences, rendering inter-BS interference at the MT negligible. In this work, we relax these assumptions and address simultaneous source separation, synchronization, and mapping. A relevant example arises in modern 5G systems, where BSs employ muting patterns to mitigate interference, yet localization performance still degrades. We propose a novel BS-dependent data association and synchronization bias model, integrated into a joint Bayesian framework and inferred via the sum-product algorithm on a factor graph. The impact of joint synchronization and source separation is analyzed under various system configurations. Compared with state-of-the-art cooperative MP-SLAM assuming orthogonal and synchronized BSs, our statistical analysis shows no significant performance degradation. The proposed BS-dependent data association model constitutes a principled approach for classifying features by arbitrary properties that persist over time, such as reflection order or feature type (scatter points versus walls).</description>

      <title>Delay-Aware Task Offloading for Heterogeneous VLC-RF-based Vehicular Fog Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicular fog computing (VFC) is a promising paradigm for reducing the computation burden of vehicles, thus supporting delay-sensitive services in next-generation transportation networks. However, traditional VFC schemes rely on radio frequency (RF) communications, which limits their adaptability for dense vehicular environments. In this paper, a heterogeneous visible light communication (VLC)-RF architecture is designed for VFC systems to facilitate efficient task offloading. Specifically, computing tasks are dynamically partitioned and offloaded to idle vehicles via both VLC and RF links, thereby fully exploiting the interference resilience of VLC and the coverage advantage of RF. To minimize the average task processing delay (TPD), an optimization problem of task offloading and computing resource allocation is formulated, and then solved by the developed residual-based majorization-minimization (RBMM) algorithm. Simulation results confirm that the heterogeneous VLC-RF architecture with the proposed algorithm achieves a 15% average TPD reduction compared to VFC systems relying solely on VLC or RF.</description>

      <title>Time-Constrained Erasure Correction for Data Recovery in UAV-Aided IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09782v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose data-recovery schemes to improve the uplink reliability of Internet of Things (IoT) networks in which a gateway mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collects data from sensor nodes on the ground. The proposed techniques employ fountain coding and message replication to correct frame erasures on the sensor-to-UAV links. A salient feature of the proposed schemes is their adaptive selection of the redundancy amount depending on the contact times between a sensor and the UAV. We illustrate our design philosophy for the special case of a network in which wake-up radios (WuRs) are used for activating the sensors upon the UAV's arrival, and the sensor-to-UAV data transfer employs the Long Range (LoRa) communication technology with random access.</description>

      <title>Robust Instance Optimal Phase-Only Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase-only compressed sensing (PO-CS) concerns the recovery of sparse signals from the phases of complex measurements. Recent results show that sparse signals in the standard sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ can be exactly recovered from complex Gaussian phases by a linearization procedure, which recasts PO-CS as linear compressed sensing and then applies (quadratically constrained) basis pursuit to obtain $\mathbf{x}^\sharp$. This paper focuses on the instance optimality and robustness of $\mathbf{x}^{\sharp}$. First, we strengthen the nonuniform instance optimality of Jacques and Feuillen (2021) to a uniform one over the entire signal space. We show the existence of some universal constant $C$ such that $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2\le Cs^{-1/2}\sigma_{\ell_1}(\mathbf{x},\Sigma^n_s)$ holds for all $\mathbf{x}$ in the unit Euclidean sphere, where $\sigma_{\ell_1}(\mathbf{x},\Sigma^n_s)$ is the $\ell_1$ distance of $\mathbf{x}$ to its closest $s$-sparse signal. This is achieved by showing the new sensing matrices corresponding to all approximately sparse signals simultaneously satisfy RIP. Second, we investigate the estimator's robustness to noise and corruption. We show that dense noise with entries bounded by some small $\tau_0$, appearing either prior or posterior to retaining the phases, increments $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2$ by $O(\tau_0)$. This is near-optimal (up to log factors) for any algorithm. On the other hand, adversarial corruption, which changes an arbitrary $\zeta_0$-fraction of the measurements to any phase-only values, increments $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2$ by $O(\sqrt{\zeta_0\log(1/\zeta_0)})$. The developments are then combined to yield a robust instance optimal guarantee that resembles the standard one in linear compressed sensing.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization for On-Board Routing in High-Throughput Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite Internet services has led to increasing demand, often exceeding available data rates and compromising the quality of service. While deploying more satellites offers a short-term fix, designing higher-performance satellites with enhanced transmission capabilities provides a more sustainable solution. Achieving the necessary high capacity requires interconnecting multiple modem banks within a satellite payload. However, there is a notable gap in research on internal packet routing within extremely high-throughput satellites. To address this, we propose a real-time optimal flow allocation and priority queue scheduling method using online convex optimization-based model predictive control. We model the problem as a multi-commodity flow instance and employ an online interior-point method to solve the routing and scheduling optimization iteratively. This approach minimizes packet loss and supports real-time rerouting with low computational overhead. Our method is tested in simulation on a next-generation extremely high-throughput satellite model, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to a reference batch optimization and to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Extensions on Low-complexity DCT Approximations for Larger Blocklengths Based on Minimal Angle Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is a central tool for image and video coding because it can be related to the Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform (KLT), which is the optimal transform in terms of retained transform coefficients and data decorrelation. In this paper, we introduce 16-, 32-, and 64-point low-complexity DCT approximations by minimizing individually the angle between the rows of the exact DCT matrix and the matrix induced by the approximate transforms. According to some classical figures of merit, the proposed transforms outperformed the approximations for the DCT already known in the literature. Fast algorithms were also developed for the low-complexity transforms, asserting a good balance between the performance and its computational cost. Practical applications in image encoding showed the relevance of the transforms in this context. In fact, the experiments showed that the proposed transforms had better results than the known approximations in the literature for the cases of 16, 32, and 64 blocklength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel training objective for GPs constructed using lower-dimensional linear projections of the data, referred to as \emph{projected likelihood} (PL). We provide a closed-form expression for the information loss related to the PL and empirically show that it can be reduced with random projections on the unit sphere. We show the superiority of the PL, in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, over the exact GP training and the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs over different optimisers, kernels and datasets of moderately large sizes.</description>
