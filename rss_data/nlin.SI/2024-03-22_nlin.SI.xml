      <title>Singularities and growth of higher order discrete equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the link between the degree growth of integrable birational mappings of order higher than two and their singularity structures. The higher order mappings we use in this study are all obtained by coupling mappings that are integrable through spectral methods, typically belonging to the QRT family, to a variety of linearisable ones. We show that by judiciously choosing these linearisable mappings, it is possible to obtain higher order mappings that exhibit the maximal degree growth compatible with integrability, i.e. for which the degree grows as a polynomial of order equal to the order of the mapping. In all the cases we analysed, we found that maximal degree growth was associated with the existence of an unconfining singularity pattern. Several cases with submaximal growth but which still possess unconfining singularity patterns are also presented. In many cases the exact degrees of the iterates of the mappings were obtained by applying a method due to Halburd, based on the preimages of specific values that appear in the singularity patterns of the mapping, but we also present some examples where such a calculation appears to be impossible.</description>

      <title>Integrable geodesic flows with simultaneously diagonalisable quadratic integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if $n$ functionally independent commutative quadratic in momenta integrals for the geodesic flow of a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian metric on an $n$-dimensional manifold are simultaneously diagonalisable at the tangent space to every point, then they come from the St\"ackel construction, so the metric admits orthogonal separation of variables.</description>

      <title>Decorating the gauge/YBE correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the three-dimensional $\mathcal N=2$ supersymmetric dual gauge theories on $S_b^3/\mathbb{Z}_r$ in the context of the gauge/YBE correspondence. We consider hyperbolic hypergeometric integral identities acquired via the equality of supersymmetric lens partition functions as solutions to the decoration transformation and the flipping relation in statistical mechanics. The solutions of those transformations aim at investigating various decorated lattice models possessing the Boltzmann weights of integrable Ising-like models obtained via the gauge/YBE correspondence. We also constructed The Bailey pairs for the decoration transformation and the flipping relation.</description>
