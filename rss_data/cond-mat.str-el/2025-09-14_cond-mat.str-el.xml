      <title>Pseudogap-induced change in the nature of the Lifshitz transition in the two-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the density of states and the $B_{1g}$ nematic susceptibility extracted from Raman response data across the doping-driven Lifshitz transition comparing the weak and strong interaction cases. Our results were obtained using cluster dynamical mean field theory for the two-dimensional Hubbard model. In the weakly correlated Fermi liquid regime, both quantities are approximately symmetric around the Lifshitz transition doping $p_{LT}$. In the strongly correlated regime, the low-doping pseudogap leads to an asymmetric, discontinuous evolution when the Fermi surface changes from hole-like to electron-like at $p_{LT}$. The Lifshitz transition thus changes character because it is tied to the pseudogap-Fermi-liquid transition. These results are consistent with available observations and should foster further experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Pressure tuning of putative quantum criticality on YbV6Sn6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ is a recently discovered heavy-fermion compound that orders at T$_N\approx 0.4$ K and exhibits a magnetic field-tuned quantum critical point at $H \approx 10$ kOe. In this work, we have grown YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ single crystals by the self-flux method, to investigate their physical properties at ambient pressure and their electrical transport properties under hydrostatic pressure. At higher temperatures, we observed a decrease in the Kondo temperature, accompanied by the appearance of a local minimum followed by a local maximum, associated with the onset of the coherent Kondo regime. Power law fitting at low temperatures indicated a recovery of the Fermi-liquid regime for pressures below 1 GPa. Above 1 GPa, a reentrance of non-Fermi-liquid behavior is suggested by a decrease in the exponent $n$, accompanied by a substantial increase in the parameter $A$, indicating the approach of a new quantum criticality tuned by hydrostatic pressure. The broad range of interactions present in YbV$_6$Sn$_6$, including RKKY, crystalline electric field (CEF), and Kondo lattice effects, appears to lead to a complex phase diagram. We present a putative phase diagram featuring double quantum criticality tuned by both magnetic field and hydrostatic pressure.</description>

      <title>Surface Topological Quantum Criticality II: Conformal manifolds, Isolated fixed points and Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose the realization of conformal manifolds, which are smooth manifolds of scale-conformal invariant interacting Hamiltonians in two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. Such phenomena can occur in various interacting systems, including topological surfaces or 2D bulks. Building on previous observations, we demonstrate that a conformal manifold can emerge as an exact solution when the number of fermion colors, \(N_c\), becomes infinite. We identify distinct exact marginal deformation operators uniquely associated with the conformal manifolds. By considering \(N_c\) as finite but large, we show that quantum fluctuations induce a fermion field renormalization that results in mildly infrared relevant or irrelevant renormalization-group (RG) flow within a conformal manifold, producing standard isolated infrared stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points. These can be grouped with ultraviolet stable fixed points into a discrete manifold due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of an emergent \(SO(\mathcal{N})\) dynamical symmetry in the RG flow as \(N_c \rightarrow \infty\). Additionally, we find a correlation between the direction of the RG flow within the manifold and an increase in EPR-like entanglement entropy. The infrared-stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points, induced by quantum fluctuations, are linked to theories on the conformal manifold where interaction operators are maximally entangled in flavor space. Our studies provide an effective framework for addressing topological quantum critical points with high-dimensional interaction parameter spaces, potentially housing many fixed points of various stabilities. They also highlight the central role of entangled conformal operators and their entropy in shaping universality classes of surface topological quantum phase transitions. We conclude with open questions and possible future directions.</description>

      <title>TbPt6Al3: A rare-earth-based g-wave altermagnet with a honeycomb structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of the Tb-honeycomb lattice compound TbPt6Al3, which crystallizes in the NdPt6Al3-type trigonal structure, have been studied by the measurements of electrical resistivity, magnetization M(T, B), and specific heat on single-crystalline samples. The magnetic susceptibility, M(T)/B, for B || c = 0.1 T shows a cusp at TN = 3.5 K, which temperature decreases with increasing the magnitude of B || c, while M(T)/B for B || a = 0.1 T remains constant with decreasing temperature below TN. This anisotropic behavior suggests a collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) order of the Tb3+ moments pointing along the c axis. The data of M(T)/B for T &gt; 10 K on the single crystal and that of inelastic neutron scattering from powdered samples have been simultaneously analyzed using the crystal field model. The analysis reveals the non-Kramers doublet ground state for the Tb3+ ion under the trigonal crystal field. The neutron powder diffraction measurement shows that the collinear AFM structure with a magnetic propagation vector k = [0, 0, 0] is associated with moments of 5.1 {\mu}B/Tb pointing along the c axis. Comparison of the magnetic point group with the nontrivial spin Laue group indicates that TbPt6Al3 is classified into bulk g-wave altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Entanglement architecture of beyond-Landau quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum critical points beyond the Landau paradigm exhibit fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. Here, we use entanglement microscopy--full tomography of the reduced density matrix of small subregions and subsequent extraction of their quantum correlations--to resolve the entanglement architecture near such exotic critical points. We focus on genuine multipartite entanglement (GME). Through unbiased quantum Monte Carlo sampling of RDMs across conventional O(2)/O(3) Wilson-Fisher transitions, and unconventional XY$^*$, and N\'eel-VBS transitions in (2+1)d, we discover a dichotomy: Landau criticality amplifies GME within compact subregions, while non-Landau criticality redistributes entanglement into larger, loopy configurations. Key signatures at non-Landau criticality include the absence of three-spin GME, and the loss of non-loopy entanglement in unicursal regions. Similar results in a critical resonating valence bond wavefunction confirm this multipartite entanglement structure as a common feature of emergent gauge theories. Our findings reveal a distinct entanglement architecture in beyond-Landau quantum critical theories.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic disorder in the candidate quantum spin ice Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids with long-range entanglement are of great interest for applications in quantum technology. The quantum spin ice Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ is a promising example, where it is believed that structural disorder plays a key role in enhancing quantum mechanical effects by introducing strains that split the ground state doublet akin to the effect of a local disordered transverse field. However, the precise defect structure responsible for this behaviour is unknown. Here we have determined the intrinsic defect structure of Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ using neutron and x-ray scattering techniques supported by density functional theory. We find the main defect is the stuffing of Zr$^{4+}$ sites by Pr$^{3+}$ ions, accompanied by charge compensating O$^{2-}$ vacancies, and the relaxation of a neighbouring O$^{2-}$ ion to an interstitial site. Our results explain the single-ion magnetism by considering the non-magnetic singlets that arise on neighbouring sites as a result of the defect structure. These singlets account for additional features in the crystal electric field excitations. The effects caused by this low level of structural disorder are magnified since several neighbouring Pr sites are affected. This makes a significant contribution towards the observed broadening of pinch points in the magnetic diffuse scattering, which was previously attributed purely to quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Dependence of Critical Fluctuations in CeCu$_{5.8}$Ag$_{0.2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are among the most intriguing phenomena that can occur when the electronic ground state of correlated metals are tuned by external parameters such as pressure, magnetic field or chemical substitution. Such transitions between distinct states of matter are driven by quantum fluctuations, and can give rise to macroscopically coherent phases that are at the forefront of condensed matter research. However, the nature of the critical fluctuations, and thus the fundamental physics controlling many quantum phase transitions, remain poorly understood in numerous strongly correlated metals. Here we study the model material CeCu$_{5.8}$Ag$_{0.2}$ to gain insight into the implications of critical fluctuations originating from different regions in reciprocal space. By employing an external magnetic field along the crystallographic $a$- and $c$-axis as auxiliary tuning parameter we observe a pronounced anisotropy in the suppression of the quantum critical fluctuations, reflecting the spin anisotropy of the long-range ordered ground state at larger silver concentration. Coupled with the temperature dependence of the quantum critical fluctuations, these results suggest that the quantum phase transition in CeCu$_{5.8}$Ag$_{0.2}$ is driven by three-dimensional spin-density wave fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Gradient-based search of quantum phases: discovering unconventional fractional Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery and understanding of new quantum phases has time and again transformed both fundamental physics and technology, yet progress often relies on slow, intuition-based theoretical considerations or experimental serendipity. Here, we introduce a general gradient-based framework for targeted phase discovery. We define a differentiable function, dubbed "target-phase loss function", which encodes spectral fingerprints of a quantum state, thereby recasting phase search as a tractable optimization problem in Hamiltonian space. The method is broadly applicable to phases characterized by ground-state degeneracy and can be extended to a wide range of symmetry-broken and topological orders. As a demonstration, we apply it to spinless fermions on the kagome lattice and discover two distinctive fractional Chern insulators (FCIs), verified through detailed exact diagonalization: (i) at filling $\nu = 1/3$, a "non-ideal" Abelian FCI whose band geometry lies far beyond the Landau-level mimicry paradigm and all recent generalizations; and (ii) at $\nu = 1/2$, a non-Abelian FCI stabilized purely by finite-range two-body interactions. These results provide the first explicit realization of such types of FCIs and establish a versatile paradigm for systematic quantum-phase discovery.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality reduction of optically generated vortex strings in a charge density wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In phase transitions, mesoscale structures such as topological defects, vortex strings, and domain walls control the path towards equilibrium, and thus the functional properties of many active devices. In photoinduced phase transitions driven by femtosecond laser excitation, the temporal (pulse duration) and spatial (penetration depth) structure of the optical excitation present opportunities for control and creating structures with unique topologies. By performing time-resolved optical pump, x-ray probe experiments on the CDW system Pd-intercalated ErTe$_{3}$, we gain access to the nanoscale dynamics of the mesoscale topological features (vortex strings) produced after a quench, which have a different apparent dimensionality than the topological defects predicted from the bulk system. We show that these vortex strings persist for much longer than the electronic recovery time. The critical exponent obtained from power-law scaling of the intensity as a function of wavevector shows a reduction in the effective dimensionality of the topological defects in the system, corroborated by time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations. Our results demonstrate a novel pathway to use light to control the dimensionality and orientation of topological defects in quantum materials, which could be used to stabilize competing quantum states.</description>

      <title>Evolution from Topological Dirac Metal to Flat-band-Induced Antiferromagnet in Layered KxNi4S2 (0&lt;=x&lt;=1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Condensed matter systems with coexisting Dirac cones and flat bands, and a switchable control between them within a single system, are desirable but remarkably uncommon. Here we report a layered quantum material system, KxNi4S2 (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1), that simultaneously hosts both characteristics without involving typical Kagome/honeycomb lattices. Enabled by a topochemical K-deintercalation process, the Fermi surface can be fine-tuned continuously over a wide range of energies. Consequently, a non-magnetic Dirac-metal state with a topological nontrivial Z2 index of 1;(000), supported by first-principles calculations and high mobility up to 1471 cm2V-1s-1, is observed on the K-rich x = 1 side, whereas a flat-band induced antiferromagnetic state with TN up to 10.1 K emerges as K-content approaches 0. The KxNi4S2 system offers a versatile platform for exploring emerging phenomena and underscores a viable pathway for in-situ control of quantum materials dominated by Dirac cones, flat bands, and their interplay.</description>

      <title>Impact of Disorder on the Superconducting Properties and BCS-BEC Crossover in FeSe Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the crystal structure, transport properties and specific heat in five selected FeSe single crystals containing different amounts of disorder. Transport measurements show that disorder significantly suppresses superconducting transition temperature, $T_\mathrm{c}$, and upper critical field, $H_\mathrm{c2}$. Specific heat results confirm a robust multi-gap nature, a larger isotropic gap ($\Delta_\mathrm{s}$) and a smaller anisotropic gap ($\Delta_\mathrm{es}$). The smaller gap $\Delta_\mathrm{es}$ becomes more isotropic with increasing disorder. Additionally, FeSe is regarded as a superconductor in the crossover regime from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) because of its comparable $\Delta$ and Fermi energy $E_\mathrm{F}$. By introducing disorder, the BCS-BEC crossover in FeSe can be tuned closer to BCS limit, reducing $\Delta/E_\mathrm{F}$ from 1.3 to 0.4.</description>

      <title>Switching magnetic texture via in-plane magnetic field in noncentrosymmetric dipolar magnets: From skyrmions to antiskyrmions and nontopological magnetic bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate field-induced switching of magnetic topology in a nanodisk-shaped sample of noncentrosymmetric dipolar magnet in which the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that stabilizes an antiskyrmion with $N_{\rm sk}$=+1 and the magnetic dipole interaction that stabilizes a skyrmion with $N_{\rm sk}$=$-1$ are in keen competition where $N_{\rm sk}$ is the skyrmion number. Our micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the competition offers a unique opportunity to switch magnetic textures with distinct magnetic topology among the antiskyrmion ($N_{\rm sk}$=+1), elliptical skyrmion ($N_{\rm sk}$=$-1$), and nontopological bubble ($N_{\rm sk}$=0) in a deterministic manner by application of magnetic fields parallel to the sample plane. By calculating time and spatial profiles of energy contributions from respective interactions and magnetic anisotropy, we clarify the physical mechanism and properties of the observed field-induced topology switching phenomena. Our findings are expected to provide useful insights into the spintronic application of topological magnetism.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence Paradox on Low-Symmetry Surfaces of Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-symmetry surfaces of topological semimetals offer access to boundary phenomena hidden on conventional facets, yet systematic studies remain scarce due to experimental challenges and the lack of a general framework for reconciling bulk and surface periodicities. Here, we investigate the (103) surface of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory. The (103) surface is an example of a low symmetry surface that presents an apparent paradox to the bulk-boundary correspondence. The surface periodicity to which the topological surface states are expected to adhere does not correspond to the bulk periodicity of the Weyl points. By showing that successive bulk Brillouin zones generate replicas that accumulate into a superlattice commensurate with the surface Brillouin zone, we demonstrate how the apparent bulk boundary correspondence paradox is resolved and establish a universal criterion for arbitrary facets. The framework and experimental results further suggests that overlapping Fermi arcs can hybridize into closed Fermi arc loops, enriching boundary topology and enabling unconventional transport, interference, and collective phenomena unique to lowsymmetry facets.</description>

      <title>Experimental validation of electron correlation models in warm dense matter</title>

Abstract: We report X-ray Thomson scattering measurements of warm dense aluminium at densities 3.75-4.5 g/cm$^3$ and a temperature of approximately 0.6 eV, performed at the HED-HiBEF instrument of the European XFEL using the DiPOLE-100X drive laser. By probing plasmon dispersion across momentum transfers $k$ = 0.99-2.57 Angstrom$^{-1}$ with high statistical fidelity, we directly test competing theories of electron dynamics under extreme conditions. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) reproduces both the observed plasmon energies and spectral shapes across the full $k$ range, whereas the random phase approximation (RPA) and static local-field-correction (LFC) models systematically overestimate the plasmon frequency, even for aluminium (a canonical uniform electron gas metal). Considering electron localisation around ions and the loss of crystalline symmetry due to liquid-state disorder, our measurements provide direct evidence that simple uniform electron gas models fail in warm dense matter and establish TDDFT as a reliable approach for electronic correlations in this regime.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained BCFT Tensor Networks and Holographic Reflected Entropy in 3D Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the framework of $\textit{BCFT tensor networks}$ to present a microscopic CFT derivation of the correspondence between reflected entropy (RE) and entanglement wedge cross section (EW) in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, for both bipartite and multipartite settings. These fixed-point tensor networks, obtained by triangulating Euclidean CFT path integrals, allow us to explicitly construct the canonical purification via cutting-and-gluing CFT path integrals. Employing modular flow in the large-$c$ limit, we demonstrate that these intrinsic CFT manipulations reproduce bulk geometric prescriptions, without assuming the AdS/CFT dictionary. The emergence of bulk geometry is traced to coarse-graining over heavy states in the large-$c$ limit. Universal coarse-grained BCFT data for compact 2D CFTs, through the relation to Liouville theory with ZZ boundary conditions, yields hyperbolic geometry on the Cauchy slice. The corresponding averaged replica partition functions reproduce all candidate EWs, arising from different averaging patterns, with the dominant one providing the correct RE and EW. In this way, many heuristic tensor-network intuitions in toy models are made precise and established directly from intrinsic CFT data.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence for the absence of coupling between shear strain and superconductivity in Sr2RuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting symmetry of Sr2RuO4 has been intensely debated for many years. A crucial controversy recently emerged between shear-mode ultrasound experiments, which suggest a two-component order parameter, and some uniaxial pressure experiments that suggest a one-component order parameter. To resolve this controversy, we use a new approach to directly apply three different kinds of shear strain to single crystals of Sr2RuO4 and investigate the coupling to superconductivity. After characterising the strain by optical imaging, we observe variations of the transition temperature Tc smaller than 10mK/% as measured by low-frequency magnetic susceptibility, indicating that shear strain has little to no coupling to superconductivity. Our results are consistent with a one-component order parameter model, but such a model cannot consistently explain other experimental evidence such as time-reversal symmetry breaking, superconducting domains, and horizontal line nodes, thus calling for alternative interpretations.</description>

      <title>Tunable Magnetic Order in Chiral Coupled Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the ground-state phase diagram of two spin chains consisting in a set two-level systems asymmetrically coupled to an XX chain through a chiral interaction. The interaction is parametrized by its magnitude and an angle defined by the relative orientation of the spins in different chains. From the entanglement spectrum, we identify the critical lines separating distinct magnetically ordered phases, with the interaction angle able to shift or fully suppress the transition. By increasing the coupling strength, the systems is driven through a quantum phase transition, leading to the formation of two types of in-plane antiferromagnetic stripes. The interaction strength sets stripe formation, while the angle controls the spins orientations. The chiral interaction also induces a non-trivial finite vector spin chirality with opposite orientation on the chains. We show that the vector spin chirality emerges smoothly from the decoupled limit and occurs for angles different from zero and $\pi/2$, where collinear order is favored instead.</description>

      <title>Spin-qubit Noise Spectroscopy of Magnetic Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose using spin-qubit noise magnetometry to probe dynamical signatures of magnetic Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) physics. For a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center coupled to two-dimensional XY magnets, we predict distinctive features in the magnetic noise spectral density in the sub-MHz to GHz frequency range. In the quasi-long-range ordered phase, the spectrum exhibits a temperature-dependent power law characteristic of algebraic spin correlations. Above the transition, the noise reflects the proliferation of free vortices and enables quantitative extraction of the vortex conductivity, a key parameter of vortex transport. These results highlight NV as a powerful spectroscopic method to resolve magnetic dynamics in the mesoscopic and low-frequency regimes and to probe exotic magnetic phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a bulk--boundary correspondence for translation-invariant stabilizer states in arbitrary spatial dimension, formulated in the framework of modules over Laurent polynomial rings. To each stabilizer state restricted to half-space geometry we associate a boundary operator module. Boundary operator modules provide examples of quasi-symplectic modules, which are objects of independent mathematical interest. In their study, we use ideas from algebraic L-theory in a setting involving non-projective modules and non-unimodular forms. Our results about quasi-symplectic modules in one spatial dimension allow us to resolve the conjecture that every stabilizer state in two dimensions is characterized by a corresponding abelian anyon model with gappable boundary. Our techniques are also applicable beyond two dimensions, such as in the study of fractons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution neutron spectroscopy on Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ reveals a correlated state characterized by distinct dipolar scattering signals -- quasi-elastic and inelastic contributions consistent with `photon' and `spinon' excitations in quantum spin ice. These signals coexist with weak octupolar scattering. Fits of thermodynamic data using numerical methods indicate a dominant octupolar exchange, $J_{x}$ or $J_{y}$, with substantial dipolar $J_{z}$ and minute dipole-octupole $J_{xz}$ couplings. The $J_{xz}$ value is corroborated by an independent fit of the neutron scattering amplitude balance between dipolar and octupolar `photon' contributions, highlighting its importance to understand neutron scattering results in this family. Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ enriches the landscape of dipole-octupole pyrochlore physics, and reveals a `quantum multipolar liquid' where hybrid correlations involve multiple terms in moment series expansion, opening questions on their intertwining and hierarchy in quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Strange metals and planckian transport in a gapless phase from spatially random interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05365v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: `Strange' metals that do not follow the predictions of Fermi liquid theory are prevalent in materials that feature superconductivity arising from electron interactions. In recent years, it has been hypothesized that spatial randomness in electron interactions must play a crucial role in strange metals for their hallmark linear-in-temperature ($T$) resistivity to survive down to low temperatures where phonon and Umklapp processes are ineffective, as is observed in experiments. However, a clear picture of how this happens has not yet been provided in a realistic model free from artificial constructions such as large-$N$ limits and replica tricks. We study a realistic model of two-dimensional metals with spatially random antiferromagnetic interactions in a non-perturbative regime, using numerically exact high-performance large-scale hybrid Monte Carlo and exact averages over the quenched spatial randomness. Our simulations reproduce strange metals' key experimental signature of linear-in-$T$ resistivity with a universal `planckian' transport scattering rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{tr} \sim k_B T/\hbar$ that is independent of coupling constants. We further find that strange metallicity in these systems is not associated with a quantum critical point, and instead arises from a phase of matter with gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations that lacks long-range correlations and spans an extended region of parameter space: a feature that is also observed in several experiments. These gapless antiferromagnetic fluctuations take the form of spatially localized overdamped modes, whose presence could possibly be detected using recently developed nanoscale magnetometry methods. Our work paves the way for an eventual microscopic understanding of the role of spatial disorder in determining important properties of correlated electron materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Anisotropy and Absence of Long-Range Order in the Triangular Magnet NdMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rare-earth triangular-lattice magnet NdMgAl11O19 offers an ideal platform for examining the interplay of crystal electric field effects, geometric frustration, and weak exchange interactions. Using high-quality single crystals, we measured magnetic susceptibility and magnetization down to 1.8 K, while specific heat was measured down to 45 mK. The system exhibits uniaxial anisotropy along the c-axis, with a ground-state Kramers doublet. A Curie-Weiss temperature of -0.38 K indicates weak antiferromagnetic interactions, while a specific heat anomaly at 81 mK suggests weak magnetic correlations with no long-range magnetic order. The absence of long-range magnetic order down to 45 mK makes it a very interesting material, which is highly frustrated but weakly correlated. Under external fields, the Zeeman splitting of the ground-state doublet leads to a field-tunable Schottky anomaly, with the specific heat peak shifting to 0.65 meV at 3 T, with g ~ 3.7. A Brillouin function fit to magnetization yields g ~ 3.72, confirming the quasi-paramagnetic nature of NdMgAl11O19. These findings highlight NdMgAl11O19 as a promising candidate to investigate quantum spin liquid and exotic spin states in frustrated triangular magnets.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Co-3d high- and low-spin states in an Ising spin chain magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Properties of trivalent cobalt oxide compounds are largely influenced by the spin state of the six 3d electrons at each Co site. High-spin Co3+ ions, where orbital angular momentum is only partially quenched, often exhibit significant anisotropy, providing playgrounds for Ising spin systems. However, real-space observations of their orbital states have remained limited. Here, we determine the Co-3d spin and orbital states in an Ising spin chain magnet Ca3Co2O6, where high- and low-spin states alternate along the chain. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction and valence electron density (VED) analysis, utilizing the core differential Fourier synthesis (CDFS) method, reveal distinct anisotropic VED distributions around the two inequivalent Co sites. The VED distribution around the octahedral Co site corresponds to a low-spin state, while the trigonal-prismatic Co site exhibits anisotropic VED that cannot be explained by the crystal electric field (CEF) alone. This anisotropy is quantitatively captured by a model incorporating CEF, spin-orbit coupling, and on-site 3d-4p orbital hybridization, consistent with a high-spin state exhibiting Ising magnetism.</description>

      <title>Violation of Luttinger's theorem in one-dimensional interacting fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we systematically investigate the evolution of the Luttinger integral in the one-dimensional generalized $t$-$V$ model as a function of filling and interaction strength, and identify three representative phases. In the weak-coupling regime, the zero-frequency Green's function exhibits a branch-cut structure at the Fermi momentum, and the Luttinger integral accurately reflects the particle density, indicating that the Luttinger theorem holds. As the interaction increases, the spectral weight near the Fermi momentum is gradually suppressed. Interestingly, in the strong coupling regime near half-filling, this singularity is progressively destroyed, accompanied by the emergence of momentum-space zeros in the real part of the Green's function, leading to a novel non-Fermi liquid metallic phase beyond the classic Luttinger liquid paradigm, where the Luttinger surface is no longer defined by a single singularity. While finite spectral weight remains at the original Fermi momentum, the singularity gradually diminishes. Meanwhile, zeros with negligible spectral weight appear away from this momentum, significantly affecting the integral. At exact half-filling, a single-particle gap opens, and the Green's function becomes nearly vanishing across the entire momentum space, indicating the complete suppression of low-energy electronic states consistent with the nature of an insulating charge-density-wave phase. These results suggest that the breakdown of the Luttinger theorem is not triggered by a single mechanism, but rather results from the interplay between interaction-driven evolution of excitation modes and the breaking of particle-hole symmetry, ultimately leading to a continuous reconstruction of the generalized Fermi surface from topologically protected to correlation-driven.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly correlated materials, such as twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers, host a variety of exotic quantum phases but remain notoriously difficult to solve due to strong interactions. We introduce a powerful neural network ansatz, Neural Transformer Backflow (NTB), formulated within a multi-band projection framework. It naturally enforces momentum conservation and enables efficient calculations of momentum-resolved ground states. NTB attains high accuracy on small systems and scales to higher bands and larger system sizes far beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. By evaluating observables such as the structure factor and momentum distribution, we show that NTB captures diverse correlated states in tMoTe$_2$, including charge density waves, fractional Chern insulators, and anomalous Hall Fermi liquids, within a unified framework. Our approach paves the way for understanding and discovering novel phases of matter in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Slow quasiparticle dynamics and anyonic statistics in a fractional quantum Hall Fabry-P\'erot interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anyons are particles with fractional exchange statistics that emerge as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall phases. Experimentally, their exchange statistics can be measured in the edge-state Fabry-P\'erot interferometer. In these devices, the presence of $N_{qp}$ localized anyons in the bulk contributes a phase $N_{qp}\theta_a$ to the interference signal. Here we report the observation of large, hysteretic phase jumps in a monolayer graphene Fabry-P\'erot interferometer at $\nu=1/3$. When the filling factor is increased from $\nu&lt;1/3$ towards the center of the plateau, we observe phase slips with magnitude $\Delta \theta \approx 2\pi/3$, consistent with the addition of individual quasiparticles to the interferometer bulk. In contrast to prior work, however, the phase slips occur as instantaneous jumps in the interference signal, indicative of quasiparticle equilibration times exceeding 20 minutes. We use this long timescale to investigate the effect of changes in interferometer area $A_I$ and $N_{QP}$ independently at fixed magnetic field, revealing a striking memory effect in the phase slip magnitude. In particular, as the $\nu=1/3$ plateau is approached from higher filling, we observed phase slips with $\Delta \theta$ significantly larger than $2\pi/3$ over the same range of gate voltage where quantized jumps are seen for increasing $\nu$. We discuss this asymmetry in terms of bulk-edge coupling of quasiparticles localized near the edge or in the bulk, and argue that this effect can be qualitatively reconciled with theoretical expectations for strongly interacting quasiparticles in the presence of weak disorder and strongly nonequilibrium charge dynamics. Our results highlight the key role played by charge dynamics on signatures of the anyon phase, and demonstrate that fractional quasiparticles can be indefinitely localized in nonequilibrium configurations.</description>

Abstract: We develop a unified framework for open quantum systems composed of many mutually interacting quantum spins, or any isomorphic systems like qubits and qudits, surrounded by one or more independent bosonic baths. Our framework, based on Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT), can handle arbitrary spin value S, dimensionality of space, and geometry, while being applicable to a large parameter space for system and bath or their coupling. It can probe regimes in which non-Markovian dynamics and nonperturbative effects pose formidable challenges for other state-of-the-art theoretical methods. This is achieved by working with the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action, which resums classes of Feynman diagrams of SKFT to an infinite order. Furthermore, such diagrams are generated via an expansion in 1/N, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons we employ to map spin operators onto canonically commuting ones, rather than via conventional expansion in system-bath coupling constant. We carefully benchmark our SKFT+2PI-computed results vs. numerically (quasi)exact ones from tensor network calculations applied to the archetypical spin-boson model where both methodologies are applicable. Additionally, we demonstrate the capability of SKFT+2PI to handle a much more complex spin-chain-boson model with multiple baths interacting with each spin where no benchmark from other methods is available at present. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by the SKFT+2PI framework with an increasing number of spins and time steps makes it a promising route for simulating driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing, quantum magnonics, and quantum spintronics.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic quantum state preparation in integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose applying the adiabatic algorithm to prepare high-energy eigenstates of integrable models on a quantum computer. We first review the standard adiabatic algorithm to prepare ground states in each magnetization sector of the prototypical XXZ Heisenberg chain. Based on the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, we show that the algorithm circuit depth is polynomial in the number of qubits $N$, outperforming previous methods explicitly relying on integrability. Next, we propose a protocol to prepare arbitrary eigenstates of integrable models that satisfy certain conditions. For a given target eigenstate, we construct a suitable parent Hamiltonian written in terms of a complete set of local conserved quantities. We propose using such Hamiltonian as an input for an adiabatic algorithm. After benchmarking this construction in the case of the non-interacting XY spin chain, where we can rigorously prove its efficiency, we apply it to prepare arbitrary eigenstates of the Richardson-Gaudin models. In this case, we provide numerical evidence that the circuit depth of our algorithm is polynomial in $N$ for all eigenstates, despite the models being interacting.</description>

      <title>Symmetry TFTs for Continuous Spacetime Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) for continuous spacetime symmetries. For a $d$-dimensional theory, it is given by a $(d+1)$-dimensional BF-theory for the spacetime symmetry group, and whenever $d$ is even, it can also include Chern-Simons couplings that encode conformal and gravitational anomalies. We study the boundary conditions for this SymTFT and describe the general setup to study symmetry breaking of spacetime symmetries. We then specialize to the conformal symmetry case and derive the dilaton action for conformal symmetry breaking. To further substantiate that our setup captures spacetime symmetries, we demonstrate that the topological defects of the SymTFT realize the associated spacetime symmetry transformations. Finally, we study the relation to gravity and holography. The proposal classically coincides with two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity for $d=1$ as well as the topological limit of four-dimensional gravity in the $d=3$ case.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric Effect Dependent on Electric Field Direction in a Pyroelectric Ferrimagnet CaBaCo$_4$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the dependence of the static magnetoelectric (ME) effect on the external field direction in the pyroelectric-ferrimagnet CaBaCo$_4$O$_7$, a topic that remains largely unexplored compared to dynamical nonreciprocal ME effects. We measured the magnetization with respect to the inherent polarization and found that an external electric field stabilizes the ferrimagnetic phase when applied parallel to the polarization, and destabilizes it when antiparallel. These results clearly demonstrate the electric-field-direction dependent control of the static ME effect, suggesting a new route to enhancing ME effects in pyroelectric-magnetic materials.</description>
