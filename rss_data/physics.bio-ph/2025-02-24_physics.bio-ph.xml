      <title>Developing an unfolding-incorporated coarse-grained polymer model for fibrinogen to study the mechanical behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fibrinogen is a protein found in blood that forms Fibrin polymer network to build a clot during wound healing process when there is a cut in the blood vessel. The fibrin fiber is highly stretchable and shows a complex mechanical properties. The fibrin monomer, Fibrinogen, has a very complex structure which is responsible for its unusual elastic behaviour. In this work, we focus on mechanism of unfolding of D-domain of Fibrinogen, and study its effect in the mechanical behaviour. We develop a coarse-grained (CG) bead-spring model for Fibrinogen which captures the unfolding of folded D-domains along with other necessary structural properties which affect the mechanical behaviour. The results from our unfolding-incorporated coarse-grained polymer (UCGP) model matches with the experimental results. This model has capacity to serve as the minimal unit to build a large-scale hierarchical structure of fibrin fiber and network to possibly unfold the mystery of fibrin's unusual elastic behaviour. This model can also be used for other polymers having folded domains or sacrificial bonds.</description>

      <title>A Primitive Model for Predicting Membrane Currents in Excitable Cells Based Only on Ion Diffusion Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical models for predicting current flow in excitable cells such as axons, originally proposed by Hodgkin and Huxley, rely on empirical voltage-gating parameters that quantify ion transport across sodium and potassium ion channels. We propose a primitive model for predicting these currents based entirely on well-established ion diffusion coefficients. Changes inside the excitable cell due to the opening of a central sodium channel are confined to a growing hemisphere with a radius that is governed by the sodium ion diffusion coefficient. The sodium channel, which is open throughout the calculation, activates and deactivates naturally due to coupled electrodiffusion processes. The characteristic time of current pulses, which are in the picoampere range, increases from 10$^{-5}$ to 10$^{-1}$ s as channel density is decreased from 10,000 to 1 channel per micrometer squared. Model predictions are compared with data obtained from giant squid axons without invoking any gating parameters.</description>
