      <title>Experimental Realization of Special-Unitary Operations in Classical Mechanics by Non-Adiabatic Evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial classical wave systems such as wave crystals and metamaterials have demonstrated promising capabilities in simulating a wide range of quantum mechanical phenomena. Yet some gaps between quantum and classical worlds are generally considered fundamental and difficult to bridge. Dynamics obeying special unitary groups, e.g., electronic spins described by SU(2), color symmetries of fundamental particles described by SU(3), are such examples. In this work, we present the experimental realization of universal SU(2) and SU(3) dynamic operations in classical mechanical oscillator systems with temporally modulated coupling terms. Our approach relies on the sequential execution of non-adiabatic holonomic evolutions, which are typically used in constructing quantum-logic gates. The method is swift and purely geometric and can be extended to realize more sophisticated dynamic operations. Our results open a new way for studying and simulating quantum phenomena in classical systems.</description>

      <title>On Minimizing Phase Space Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A primary technical challenge for harnessing fusion energy is to control and extract energy from a non-thermal distribution of charged particles. The fact that phase space evolves by symplectomorphisms fundamentally limits how a distribution may be manipulated. While the constraint of phase-space volume preservation is well understood, other constraints remain to be fully appreciated. To better understand these constraints, we study the problem of extracting energy from a distribution of particles using area-preserving and symplectic linear maps. When a quadratic potential is imposed, we find that the maximal extractable energy can be computed as trace minimization problems. We solve these problems and show that the extractable energy under linear symplectomorphisms may be much smaller than the extractable energy under special linear maps. The method introduced in the present study enables an energy-based proof of the linear Gromov non-squeezing theorem.</description>
