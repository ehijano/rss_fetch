      <title>An Empirical Framework for Discrete Games with Costly Information Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel econometric framework for static discrete choice games with costly information acquisition. In traditional discrete games, players are assumed to perfectly know their own payoffs when making decisions, ignoring that information acquisition can be a strategic choice. In the proposed framework, I relax this assumption by allowing players to face uncertainty about their own payoffs and to optimally choose both the precision of information and their actions, balancing the expected payoffs from precise information against the information cost. The model provides a unified structure to analyze how information and strategic interactions jointly determine equilibrium outcomes. The model primitives are point identified, and the identification results are illustrated through Monte Carlo experiments. The empirical application of the U.S airline entry game shows that the low-cost carriers acquire less precise information about profits and incur lower information costs than other airlines, which is consistent with their business model that focuses on cost efficiency. The analysis highlights how differences in firms' information strategies can explain observed heterogeneity in market entry behavior and competition.</description>

      <title>Using did_multiplegt_dyn to Estimate Event-Study Effects in Complex Designs: Overview, and Four Examples Based on Real Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The command did_multiplegt_dyn can be used to estimate event-study effects in complex designs with a potentially non-binary and/or non-absorbing treatment. This paper starts by providing an overview of the estimators computed by the command. Then, simulations based on three real datasets are used to demonstrate the estimators' properties. Finally, the command is used on four real datasets to estimate event-study effects in complex designs. The first example has a binary treatment that can turn on an off. The second example has a continuous absorbing treatment. The third example has a discrete multivalued treatment that can increase or decrease multiple times over time. The fourth example has two, binary and absorbing treatments, where the second treatment always happens after the first.</description>

      <title>Network Contagion Dynamics in European Banking: A Navier-Stokes Framework for Systemic Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a continuous functional framework for analyzing contagion dynamics in financial networks, extending the Navier-Stokes-based approach to network-structured spatial processes. We model financial distress propagation as a diffusion process on weighted networks, deriving a network diffusion equation from first principles that predicts contagion decay depends on the network's algebraic connectivity through the relation $\kappa = \sqrt{\lambda_2/D}$, where $\lambda_2$ is the second-smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. Applying this framework to European banking data from the EBA stress tests (2018, 2021, 2023), we estimate interbank exposure networks using maximum entropy methods and track the evolution of systemic risk through the COVID-19 crisis. Our key finding is that network connectivity declined by 45\% from 2018 to 2023, implying a 26\% reduction in the contagion decay parameter. Difference-in-differences analysis reveals this structural change was driven by regulatory-induced deleveraging of systemically important banks, which experienced differential asset reductions of 17\% relative to smaller institutions. The networks exhibit lognormal rather than scale-free degree distributions, suggesting greater resilience than previously assumed in the literature. Extensive robustness checks across parametric and non-parametric estimation methods confirm declining systemic risk, with cross-method correlations exceeding 0.95. These findings demonstrate that post-COVID-19 regulatory reforms effectively reduced network interconnectedness and systemic vulnerability in the European banking system.</description>

      <title>Policy Learning with Abstention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However, most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR) objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption, connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over a baseline policy with high probability.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sampling for Realized Variance Estimation in Time-Changed Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11833v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the benefits of sampling intraday returns in intrinsic time for the realized variance (RV) estimator. We theoretically show in finite samples that depending on the permitted sampling information, the RV estimator is most efficient under either hitting time sampling that samples whenever the price changes by a pre-determined threshold, or under the new concept of realized business time that samples according to a combination of observed trades and estimated tick variance. The analysis builds on the assumption that asset prices follow a diffusion that is time-changed with a jump process that separately models the transaction times. This provides a flexible model that allows for leverage specifications and Hawkes-type jump processes and separately captures the empirically varying trading intensity and tick variance processes, which are particularly relevant for disentangling the driving forces of the sampling schemes. Extensive simulations confirm our theoretical results and show that for low levels of noise, hitting time sampling remains superior while for increasing noise levels, realized business time becomes the empirically most efficient sampling scheme. An application to stock data provides empirical evidence for the benefits of using these intrinsic sampling schemes to construct more efficient RV estimators as well as for an improved forecast performance.</description>

      <title>From Reviews to Actionable Insights: An LLM-Based Approach for Attribute and Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research proposes a systematic, large language model (LLM) approach for extracting product and service attributes, features, and associated sentiments from customer reviews. Grounded in marketing theory, the framework distinguishes perceptual attributes from actionable features, producing interpretable and managerially actionable insights. We apply the methodology to 20,000 Yelp reviews of Starbucks stores and evaluate eight prompt variants on a random subset of reviews. Model performance is assessed through agreement with human annotations and predictive validity for customer ratings. Results show high consistency between LLMs and human coders and strong predictive validity, confirming the reliability of the approach. Human coders required a median of six minutes per review, whereas the LLM processed each in two seconds, delivering comparable insights at a scale unattainable through manual coding. Managerially, the analysis identifies attributes and features that most strongly influence customer satisfaction and their associated sentiments, enabling firms to pinpoint "joy points," address "pain points," and design targeted interventions. We demonstrate how structured review data can power an actionable marketing dashboard that tracks sentiment over time and across stores, benchmarks performance, and highlights high-leverage features for improvement. Simulations indicate that enhancing sentiment for key service features could yield 1-2% average revenue gains per store.</description>
