      <title>Compared analysis of DInSAR data from ascending and descending orbits of Sentinel-1: the Cazzaso case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR), by providing displacement time series over coherent objects on the Earth's surface (persistent scatterers), allows to analyze wide areas, identify ground displacements, and study their evolution at large times. In this work we implement an innovative approach that relies exclusively on line-of-sight displacement time series, applicable to cases of correlated persistent-scatterer displacements. We identify the locus of the final positions of the persistent scatterers and automatically calculate the lower bound of the magnitude of the potential three-dimensional displacements. We present the results obtained by using Sentinel-1 data for investigating the ground stability of the hilly village Cazzaso located in the Italian Alps (Friuli Venezia Giulia region) in an area affected by an active landslide. SAR datasets acquired by Sentinel-1 from both ascending and descending orbits were processed using the SPINUA algorithm. Displacement time series were analysed in order to solve phase unwrapping issues and displacement field calculation.</description>

      <title>A novel fast sweeping method for computing the attenuation operator $t^*$ in absorbing media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $t^*$ represents the total path attenuation and characterizes the amplitude decay of a propagating seismic wave. Calculating the attenuation operator $t^*$ is typically required in seismic attenuation tomography. Traditional methods for calculating $t^*$ require determining the ray path explicitly. However, ray tracing can be computationally intensive when processing large datasets, and conventional ray tracing techniques may fail even in mildly heterogeneous media. In this study, we propose a modified fast sweeping method (MFSM) to solve the governing equation for $t^*$ without explicitly calculating the ray path. The approach consists of two main steps. First, the traveltime field is calculated by numerically solving the eikonal equation using the fast sweeping method. Second, $t^*$ is computed by solving its governing equation with the MFSM, based on the discretization of the gradient of $t^*$ using an upwinding scheme derived from the traveltime gradient. The MFSM is rigorously validated through comparisons with analytical solutions and by examining $t^*$ errors under grid refinement in both simple and complex models. Key performance metrics, including convergence, number of iterations, and computation time, are evaluated. Two versions of the MFSM are developed for both Cartesian and spherical coordinate systems. We demonstrate the practical applicability of the developed MFSM in calculating $t^*$ in North Island, and discuss the method's efficiency in estimating earthquake response spectra.</description>

      <title>Fine Flood Forecasts: Incorporating local data into global models through fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floods are the most common form of natural disaster and accurate flood forecasting is essential for early warning systems. Previous work has shown that machine learning (ML) models are a promising way to improve flood predictions when trained on large, geographically-diverse datasets. This requirement of global training can result in a loss of ownership for national forecasters who cannot easily adapt the models to improve performance in their region, preventing ML models from being operationally deployed. Furthermore, traditional hydrology research with physics-based models suggests that local data -- which in many cases is only accessible to local agencies -- is valuable for improving model performance. To address these concerns, we demonstrate a methodology of pre-training a model on a large, global dataset and then fine-tuning that model on data from individual basins. This results in performance increases, validating our hypothesis that there is extra information to be captured in local data. In particular, we show that performance increases are most significant in watersheds that underperform during global training. We provide a roadmap for national forecasters who wish to take ownership of global models using their own data, aiming to lower the barrier to operational deployment of ML-based hydrological forecast systems.</description>

      <title>Differentiating frictionally locked asperities from kinematically coupled zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismogenic areas on plate-boundary faults resist slipping until earthquakes begin. Therefore, slip deficit, also called coupling, which represents delay relative to rigid-body motion, is an interseismic proxy of seismic potential. However, when a part of a frictional interface sticks together (locked), its sliding surroundings are braked and slowed (coupled), so coupled zones are overestimates of locked zones. Several indicators collectively termed mechanical coupling have been proposed to capture locked zones, but their relationship with true frictional locking is unclear. This study investigates the frictional physics that locked and unlocked zones should observe, elucidating the physical foundation of inference on frictionally locked segments, known as asperities in fault mechanics. Definitions of locking in various friction laws are shown to have a unified expression. (I) In any friction law, locking means zero slip rate (pre-yield), and unlocking means stress at strength (post-yield). (II) Intersesismically, while locking keeps denoting a stationary state with constant slip, unlocking becomes synonymous with a quasi-steady state of constant stress. We use this result to develop slip-deficit inversions that incorporate physical constraints of locking-unlocking, estimating locked zones as distributed circular asperities over unlocked interfaces. Our inversion of geodetic data detects five primary asperities in the Nankai subduction zone in southwestern Japan. Detected asperities spatially correlate with seafloor topography. Their locations are also consistent with slip zones of historical megathrust earthquakes but mostly non-overlapping with slow-earthquake occurrence zones at depth, supporting the hypothesis that the areas hosting slow earthquakes are normally in long spatiotemporal scales coupled but unlocked.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Reconstruction of Ground Motion During Small Magnitude Earthquakes: A Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a pilot investigation into a novel method for reconstructing real-time ground motion during small magnitude earthquakes (M &lt; 4.5), removing the need for computationally expensive source characterization and simulation processes to assess ground shaking. Small magnitude earthquakes, which occur frequently and can be modeled as point sources, provide ideal conditions for evaluating real-time reconstruction methods. Utilizing sparse observation data, the method applies the Gappy Auto-Encoder (Gappy AE) algorithm for efficient field data reconstruction. This is the first study to apply the Gappy AE algorithm to earthquake ground motion reconstruction. Numerical experiments conducted with SW4 simulations demonstrate the method's accuracy and speed across varying seismic scenarios. The reconstruction performance is further validated using real seismic data from the Berkeley area in California, USA, demonstrating the potential for practical application of real-time earthquake data reconstruction using Gappy AE. As a pilot investigation, it lays the groundwork for future applications to larger and more complex seismic events.</description>
