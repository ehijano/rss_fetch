      <title>MVBIND: Self-Supervised Music Recommendation For Videos Via Embedding Space Binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of short videos, which usually contain both visual and audio modalities. Background music is important to the short videos, which can significantly influence the emotions of the viewers. However, at present, the background music of short videos is generally chosen by the video producer, and there is a lack of automatic music recommendation methods for short videos. This paper introduces MVBind, an innovative Music-Video embedding space Binding model for cross-modal retrieval. MVBind operates as a self-supervised approach, acquiring inherent knowledge of intermodal relationships directly from data, without the need of manual annotations. Additionally, to compensate the lack of a corresponding musical-visual pair dataset for short videos, we construct a dataset, SVM-10K(Short Video with Music-10K), which mainly consists of meticulously selected short videos. On this dataset, MVBind manifests significantly improved performance compared to other baseline methods. The constructed dataset and code will be released to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Scalable Image Coding for Humans and Machines Using Feature Fusion Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As image recognition models become more prevalent, scalable coding methods for machines and humans gain more importance. Applications of image recognition models include traffic monitoring and farm management. In these use cases, the scalable coding method proves effective because the tasks require occasional image checking by humans. Existing image compression methods for humans and machines meet these requirements to some extent. However, these compression methods are effective solely for specific image recognition models. We propose a learning-based scalable image coding method for humans and machines that is compatible with numerous image recognition models. We combine an image compression model for machines with a compression model, providing additional information to facilitate image decoding for humans. The features in these compression models are fused using a feature fusion network to achieve efficient image compression. Our method's additional information compression model is adjusted to reduce the number of parameters by enabling combinations of features of different sizes in the feature fusion network. Our approach confirms that the feature fusion network efficiently combines image compression models while reducing the number of parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scalable coding method by evaluating the image compression performance in terms of decoded image quality and bitrate.</description>

      <title>QMedShield: A Novel Quantum Chaos-based Image Encryption Scheme for Secure Medical Image Storage in the Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the age of digital technology, medical images play a crucial role in the healthcare industry which aids surgeons in making precise decisions and reducing the diagnosis time. However, the storage of large amounts of these images in third-party cloud services raises privacy and security concerns. There are a lot of classical security mechanisms to protect them. Although, the advent of quantum computing entails the development of quantum-based encryption models for healthcare. Hence, we introduce a novel quantum chaos-based encryption scheme for medical images in this article. The model comprises bit-plane scrambling, quantum logistic map, quantum operations in the diffusion phase and hybrid chaotic map, DNA encoding, and computations in the confusion phase to transform the plain medical image into a cipher medical image. The proposed scheme has been evaluated using multiple statistical measures and validated against more attacks such as differential attacks with three different medical datasets. Hence the introduced encryption model has proved to be attack-resistant and robust than other existing image encryption schemes, ensuring the secure storage of medical images in cloud environments.</description>

      <title>Dance Any Beat: Blending Beats with Visuals in Dance Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of generating dance from music is crucial, yet current methods, which mainly produce joint sequences, lead to outputs that lack intuitiveness and complicate data collection due to the necessity for precise joint annotations. We introduce a Dance Any Beat Diffusion model, namely DabFusion, that employs music as a conditional input to directly create dance videos from still images, utilizing conditional image-to-video generation principles. This approach pioneers the use of music as a conditioning factor in image-to-video synthesis. Our method unfolds in two stages: training an auto-encoder to predict latent optical flow between reference and driving frames, eliminating the need for joint annotation, and training a U-Net-based diffusion model to produce these latent optical flows guided by music rhythm encoded by CLAP. Although capable of producing high-quality dance videos, the baseline model struggles with rhythm alignment. We enhance the model by adding beat information, improving synchronization. We introduce a 2D motion-music alignment score (2D-MM Align) for quantitative assessment. Evaluated on the AIST++ dataset, our enhanced model shows marked improvements in 2D-MM Align score and established metrics. Video results can be found on our project page: https://DabFusion.github.io.</description>

      <title>ReconBoost: Boosting Can Achieve Modality Reconcilement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel multi-modal alternating learning paradigm pursuing a reconciliation between the exploitation of uni-modal features and the exploration of cross-modal interactions. This is motivated by the fact that current paradigms of multi-modal learning tend to explore multi-modal features simultaneously. The resulting gradient prohibits further exploitation of the features in the weak modality, leading to modality competition, where the dominant modality overpowers the learning process. To address this issue, we study the modality-alternating learning paradigm to achieve reconcilement. Specifically, we propose a new method called ReconBoost to update a fixed modality each time. Herein, the learning objective is dynamically adjusted with a reconcilement regularization against competition with the historical models. By choosing a KL-based reconcilement, we show that the proposed method resembles Friedman's Gradient-Boosting (GB) algorithm, where the updated learner can correct errors made by others and help enhance the overall performance. The major difference with the classic GB is that we only preserve the newest model for each modality to avoid overfitting caused by ensembling strong learners. Furthermore, we propose a memory consolidation scheme and a global rectification scheme to make this strategy more effective. Experiments over six multi-modal benchmarks speak to the efficacy of the method. We release the code at https://github.com/huacong/ReconBoost.</description>

      <title>MMFusion: Multi-modality Diffusion Model for Lymph Node Metastasis Diagnosis in Esophageal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Esophageal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and ranks sixth in cancer-related mortality. Accurate computer-assisted diagnosis of cancer progression can help physicians effectively customize personalized treatment plans. Currently, CT-based cancer diagnosis methods have received much attention for their comprehensive ability to examine patients' conditions. However, multi-modal based methods may likely introduce information redundancy, leading to underperformance. In addition, efficient and effective interactions between multi-modal representations need to be further explored, lacking insightful exploration of prognostic correlation in multi-modality features. In this work, we introduce a multi-modal heterogeneous graph-based conditional feature-guided diffusion model for lymph node metastasis diagnosis based on CT images as well as clinical measurements and radiomics data. To explore the intricate relationships between multi-modal features, we construct a heterogeneous graph. Following this, a conditional feature-guided diffusion approach is applied to eliminate information redundancy. Moreover, we propose a masked relational representation learning strategy, aiming to uncover the latent prognostic correlations and priorities of primary tumor and lymph node image representations. Various experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/wuchengyu123/MMFusion.</description>

      <title>A vector quantized masked autoencoder for audiovisual speech emotion recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The limited availability of labeled data is a major challenge in audiovisual speech emotion recognition (SER). Self-supervised learning approaches have recently been proposed to mitigate the need for labeled data in various applications. This paper proposes the VQ-MAE-AV model, a vector quantized masked autoencoder (MAE) designed for audiovisual speech self-supervised representation learning and applied to SER. Unlike previous approaches, the proposed method employs a self-supervised paradigm based on discrete audio and visual speech representations learned by vector quantized variational autoencoders. A multimodal MAE with self- or cross-attention mechanisms is proposed to fuse the audio and visual speech modalities and to learn local and global representations of the audiovisual speech sequence, which are then used for an SER downstream task. Experimental results show that the proposed approach, which is pre-trained on the VoxCeleb2 database and fine-tuned on standard emotional audiovisual speech datasets, outperforms the state-of-the-art audiovisual SER methods. Extensive ablation experiments are also provided to assess the contribution of the different model components.</description>

      <title>MusicMagus: Zero-Shot Text-to-Music Editing via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music generation models have opened new avenues in musical creativity. However, music generation usually involves iterative refinements, and how to edit the generated music remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel approach to the editing of music generated by such models, enabling the modification of specific attributes, such as genre, mood and instrument, while maintaining other aspects unchanged. Our method transforms text editing to \textit{latent space manipulation} while adding an extra constraint to enforce consistency. It seamlessly integrates with existing pretrained text-to-music diffusion models without requiring additional training. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over both zero-shot and certain supervised baselines in style and timbre transfer evaluations. Additionally, we showcase the practical applicability of our approach in real-world music editing scenarios.</description>

      <title>ALMol: Aligned Language-Molecule Translation LLMs through Offline Preference Contrastive Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of chemistry and Artificial Intelligence (AI) intersection is an area of active research that aims to accelerate scientific discovery. The integration of large language models (LLMs) with scientific modalities has shown significant promise in this endeavour. However, challenges persist in effectively addressing training efficacy and the out-of-distribution problem, particularly as existing approaches rely on larger models and datasets. In this context, we focus on machine language-molecule translation and deploy a novel training approach called contrastive preference optimisation, which avoids generating translations that are merely adequate but not perfect. To ensure generalisability and mitigate memorisation effects, we conduct experiments using only 10\% of the data. Our results demonstrate that our models achieve up to a 32\% improvement compared to counterpart models. We also introduce a scalable fine-grained evaluation methodology that accommodates responsibility.</description>
