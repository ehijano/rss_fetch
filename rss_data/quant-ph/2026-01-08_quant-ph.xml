      <title>Duality and measurement: the Copenhagen reconciliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Duality, not monism, constitutes the hermeneutic lens that characterizes the original Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Therefore, evoking the principles of correspondence and complementarity, in this work we re assert a dual-aspect reading of quantum theory, structured through a multi-perspective schema encompassing its ontological, analytical, epistemological, causal, and information dimensions. We then show how this schema dissolves the so-called measurement problem, along with the associated knowledge-information and macro-micro dichotomies, issues historically raised within later monistic or universalist philosophical settings that ultimately depart from the traditional Copenhagen spirit.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Fault-tolerant Cat State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cat states are an important resource for fault-tolerant quantum computing, where they serve as building blocks for a variety of fault-tolerant primitives. Consequently, the ability to prepare high-quality cat states at large fault distances is essential. While optimizations for low fault distances or small numbers of qubits exist, higher fault distances can be achieved via generalized constructions with potentially suboptimal circuit sizes. In this work, we propose a cat state preparation scheme based on preparing two cat states with low-depth circuits, followed by a transversal CNOT and measurement of one of the states. This scheme prepares $w$-qubit cat states fault-tolerantly up to fault distances of $9$ using $\lceil\log_2 w\rceil+1$ depth and at most $3w-2$ CNOTs and $2w$ qubits. We discuss that the combinatorially challenging aspect of this construction is the precise wiring of the transversal CNOT and propose three methods for finding these: two based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory solving and one heuristic search based on a local repair strategy. Numerical evaluations show that our circuits achieve a high fault-distance while requiring fewer resources as generalized constructions.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Dunkl-Pauli Oscillator in the Presence of the Aharonov-Bohm Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact, time-dependent solution for a two-dimensional Pauli oscillator deformed by Dunkl operators in the presence of an Aharonov--Bohm (AB) flux. By replacing conventional momenta with Dunkl momenta and allowing arbitrary time dependence in both, mass and frequency, we derive a deformed Pauli Hamiltonian that encodes reflection symmetries and topological gauge phases. Employing the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method, we derive exact expressions for the eigenvalues and spinor eigenfunctions of the system. Crucially, the AB flux imposes symmetry constraints on the Dunkl parameters of the form $\nu_1 = \mp \nu_2 $, linking the reflection symmetry ($\epsilon = \pm 1 $) to the quantization of angular momentum. These constraints modify the energy spectrum and wavefunctions of the angular operator and the invariant operator. Our framework reveals novel spectral characteristics arising from the interplay between topology and Dunkl symmetry, with potential implications for quantum simulation in engineered systems such as cold atoms and quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian dynamics of the giant atom beyond the rotating-wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits coupled to meandering transmission lines or surface acoustic waves may realize giant artificial atoms, whose spatially separated coupling points give rise to long-lived non-Markovian dynamics. Previous studies were limited to the zero-temperature, weak-coupling regime, where the rotating-wave approximation applies and only single-phonon processes contribute. Here we go beyond these limits using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). We show that HEOM accurately captures the exact dynamics at zero temperature and weak coupling, whereas perturbative Redfield theory fails due to long bath memory times. The non-Markovian effects persist at finite temperatures. In the strong-coupling regime, they are further enhanced, and we observe bound-state formation at zero temperature with only two coupling points. These results establish giant atoms as a powerful platform for exploring non-Markovian open quantum dynamics and their applications in quantum information and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton Interference with a symmetric SU(N) beam splitter and the generalization of the extended Hong-Ou-Mandel effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine multiphoton interference with a symmetric $SU(N)$ beam splitter $S_N$, an extension of features of the $SU(2)$ 50/50 beam splitter extended Hong-Ou-Mandel (eHOM) effect, whereby one obtains a zero amplitude (probability) for the output coincidence state (defined by equal number of photons $n/N$ in each output port), when a total number $n$ of photons impinges on the $N$-port device. These are transitions of the form $|n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_N\rangle\overset{S_N}{\to}|n/N\rangle^{\otimes N}$, where $n=\sum_{i=1}^N n_i$, which generalize the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect $|1,1\rangle \overset{S_2}{\to}|1,1\rangle $, the eHOM effect $|n_1,n_2\rangle \overset{S_2}{\to}|\tfrac{n_1+n_2}{2},\tfrac{n_1+n_2}{2}\rangle $, and the generalized HOM effect (gHOM) $|1\rangle^{\otimes N}\overset{S_N}{\to}|1\rangle^{\otimes N}$, which have previously been studied in the literature. The emphasis of this work is on illuminating how the overall destructive interference occurs in separate groups of destructive interferences of sub-amplitudes of the total zero amplitude. We develop symmetry properties for the generalized eHOM effect (geHOM) $|n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_N\rangle\overset{S_N}{\to}|n/N\rangle^{\otimes N}$ involving a zero amplitude governed by Perm($\Lambda$)=0, for an appropriately constructed matrix $\Lambda(S_N)$ built from the matrix elements of $S_N$. We develop an analytical constraint equation for Perm$(\Lambda)$ for arbitrary $N$ that allows us to determine when it is zero. We generalize the SU(2) beam splitter feature of central nodal line (CNL), which has a zero diagonal along the output probability distribution when one of the input states is of odd parity (containing only odd number of photons), to the general case of $N = 2 * N'$ where $N'\in odd$.</description>

      <title>Hybrid non-degenerate parametric amplifier for a microwave cavity mode and an NV ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an implementation of a non-degenerate parametric amplifier in which the signal and idler modes, respectively, a microwave mode and an ensemble of spins (e.g., nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond), are operated in their linear regime. This paramp, which amplifies signals in both parts at room and cryogenic temperatures, can be used to generate both the two-mode and single-mode squeezing of either system. It requires merely modulating the frequency of the spin ensemble at the sum of the cavity and spin frequencies (providing the classical pump) with the two systems sufficiently detuned. This effect is remarkable given that modulating a spin ensemble by itself produces neither amplification nor squeezing, unlike modulating an oscillator, and that an off-resonant perturbative analysis would suggest that modulating the spin ensemble merely parametrically drives the cavity mode. With typical cavity parameters including a cavity quality factor~$Q=10^4$, and a 1 GHz modulation amplitude, the microwave signal can be amplified by approximately $18~\mbox{dB}$ in $1.7~\mbox{$\mu$s}$, with a resonant bandwidth of about $0.5~\mbox{MHz}$. At $10~\mbox{mK}$ with the same modulation amplitude and a cavity and spin $Q=5\times 10^4$ it generates approximately $5~\mbox{dB}$ of squeezing. We also examine the experimental requirements for implementation.</description>

      <title>Testing measurement-based computational phases of quantum matter on a quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many symmetry protected or symmetry enriched phases of quantum matter have the property that every ground state in a given such phase endows measurement based quantum computation with the same computational power. Such phases are called computational phases of quantum matter. Here, we experimentally verify four theoretical predictions for them on an IBM superconducting quantum device. We comprehensively investigate how symmetric imperfections of the resource states translate into logical decoherence, and how this decoherence is mitigated. In particular, the central experiment probes the scaling law from which the uniformity of computational power follows. We also analyze the correlated regime, where local measurements give rise to logical operations collectively. We test the prediction that densest packing of a measurement-based algorithms remains the most efficient, in spite of the correlations. Our experiments corroborate the operational stability of measurement based quantum computation in quantum phases of matter with symmetry.</description>

      <title>Many-body Quantum Score: a scalable benchmark for digital and analog quantum processors and first test on a commercial neutral atom device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the Many-body Quantum Score (MBQS), a practical and scalable application-level benchmark protocol designed to evaluate the capabilities of quantum processing units (QPUs)--both gate-based and analog--for simulating many-body quantum dynamics. MBQS quantifies performance by identifying the maximum number of qubits with which a QPU can reliably reproduce correlation functions of the transverse-field Ising model following a specific quantum quench. This paper presents the MBQS protocol and highlights its design principles, supported by analytical insights, classical simulations, and experimental data. It also displays results obtained with Ruby, an analog QPU based on Rydberg atoms developed by the Pasqal company. These findings demonstrate MBQS's potential as a robust and informative tool for benchmarking near-term quantum devices for many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions via Double-Mode Squeezing Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a protocol to tailor dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) by double-mode squeezing onto the initial state in the XY chain. The effect of squeezing depends critically on the system's symmetry and parameters. When the squeezing operator breaks particle-hole symmetry (PHS), DQPTs become highly tunable, allowing one to either induce transitions within a single phase or suppress them. Remarkably, when PHS is preserved and the squeezing strength reaches $r=\pi/4$, a universal class of DQPTs emerges, independent of the quench path. This universality is characterized by two key features: (i) the collapse of all Fisher zeros onto the real-time axis, and (ii) the saturation of intermode entanglement to its maximum in each $(k,-k)$ modes. Moreover, the critical momenta governing the DQPTs coincide exactly with the modes attaining the maximal entanglement. At this universal point, the dynamical phase vanishes, leading to a purely geometric evolution marked by $\pi$-jumps in the Pancharatnam geometric phase. Our work establishes initial-state squeezing as a versatile tool for tailoring far-from-equilibrium criticality and reveals a direct link between entanglement saturation and universal nonanalytic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (deBroglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance of the quantum state in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf{1}^2[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schr\"odinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique.</description>

      <title>Transmutation based Quantum Simulation for Non-unitary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating dissipative diffusion dynamics generated by positive semidefinite operators of the form $A=L^\dagger L$, a structure that arises naturally in standard discretizations of elliptic operators. Our main tool is the Kannai transform, which represents the diffusion semigroup $e^{-TA}$ as a Gaussian-weighted superposition of unitary wave propagators. This representation leads to a linear-combination-of-unitaries implementation with a Gaussian tail and yields query complexity $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\|A\| T \log(1/\varepsilon)})$, up to standard dependence on state-preparation and output norms, improving the scaling in $\|A\|, T$ and $\varepsilon$ compared with generic Hamiltonian-simulation-based methods. We instantiate the method for the heat equation and biharmonic diffusion under non-periodic physical boundary conditions, and we further use it as a subroutine for constant-coefficient linear parabolic surrogates arising in entropy-penalization schemes for viscous Hamilton--Jacobi equations. In the long-time regime, the same framework yields a structured quantum linear solver for $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ with $A=L^\dagger L$, achieving $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa^{3/2}\log^2(1/\varepsilon))$ queries and improving the condition-number dependence over standard quantum linear-system algorithms in this factorized setting.</description>

      <title>Strip-Symmetric Quantum Codes for Biased Noise: Z-Decoupling in Stabilizer and Floquet Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bias-tailored codes such as the XZZX surface code and the domain wall color code achieve high dephasing-biased thresholds because, in the infinite-bias limit, their $Z$ syndromes decouple into one-dimensional repetition-like chains; the $X^3Z^3$ Floquet code shows an analogous strip-wise structure for detector events in spacetime. We capture this common mechanism by defining strip-symmetric biased codes, a class of static stabilizer and dynamical (Floquet) codes for which, under pure dephasing and perfect measurements, each elementary $Z$ fault is confined to a strip and the Z-detector--fault incidence matrix is block diagonal. For such codes the Z-detector hypergraph decomposes into independent strip components and maximum-likelihood $Z$ decoding factorizes across strips, yielding complexity savings for matching-based decoders. We characterize strip symmetry via per-strip stabilizer products, viewed as a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ 1-form symmetry, place XZZX, the domain wall color code, and $X^3Z^3$ in this framework, and introduce synthetic strip-symmetric detector models and domain-wise Clifford constructions that serve as design tools for new bias-tailored Floquet codes.</description>

      <title>Double interval entanglement in quasiparticle excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate double-interval entanglement measures, specifically reflected entropy, mutual information, and logarithmic negativity, in quasiparticle excited states for classical, bosonic, and fermionic systems. We develop an algorithm that efficiently calculates these measures from density matrices expressed in a non-orthonormal basis, enabling straightforward numerical implementation. We find a universal additivity property that emerges at large momentum differences, where the entanglement measures for states with distinct quasiparticle sets equal the sum of their individual contributions. The classical limit arises as a special case of this additivity, with both bosonic and fermionic results converging to classical behavior when all momentum differences are large.</description>

      <title>Computational hardness of estimating quantum entropies via binary entropy bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the computational hardness of estimating the quantum $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropy ${\rm S}^{\tt R}_{\alpha}(\rho) = \frac{\ln {\rm Tr}(\rho^\alpha)}{1-\alpha}$ and the quantum $q$-Tsallis entropy ${\rm S}^{\tt T}_q(\rho) = \frac{1-{\rm Tr}(\rho^q)}{q-1}$, both converging to the von Neumann entropy as the order approaches $1$. The promise problems Quantum $\alpha$-R\'enyi Entropy Approximation (R\'enyiQEA$_\alpha$) and Quantum $q$-Tsallis Entropy Approximation (TsallisQEA$_q$) ask whether $ {\rm S}^ {\tt R}_{\alpha}(\rho)$ or ${\rm S}^{\tt T}_q(\rho)$, respectively, is at least $\tau_{\tt Y}$ or at most $\tau_{\tt N}$, where $\tau_{\tt Y} - \tau_{\tt N}$ is typically a positive constant. Previous hardness results cover only the von Neumann entropy (order $1$) and some cases of the quantum $q$-Tsallis entropy, while existing approaches do not readily extend to other orders.
  We establish that for all positive real orders, the rank-$2$ variants Rank2R\'enyiQEA$_\alpha$ and Rank2TsallisQEA$_q$ are ${\sf BQP}$-hard. Combined with prior (rank-dependent) quantum query algorithms in Wang, Guan, Liu, Zhang, and Ying (TIT 2024), Wang, Zhang, and Li (TIT 2024), and Liu and Wang (SODA 2025), our results imply:
  - For all real orders $\alpha &gt; 0$ and $0 &lt; q \leq 1$, LowRankR\'enyiQEA$_\alpha$ and LowRankTsallisQEA$_q$ are ${\sf BQP}$-complete, where both are restricted versions of R\'enyiQEA$_\alpha$ and TsallisQEA$_q$ with $\rho$ of polynomial rank.
  - For all real order $q&gt;1$, TsallisQEA$_q$ is ${\sf BQP}$-complete.
  Our hardness results stem from reductions based on new inequalities relating the $\alpha$-R\'{e}nyi or $q$-Tsallis binary entropies of different orders, where the reductions differ substantially from previous approaches, and the inequalities are also of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Detection-loophole-free nonlocality in the simplest scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loophole-free quantum nonlocality often demands experiments with high complexity (defined by all parties' settings and outcomes) and multiple efficient detectors. Here, we identify the fundamental efficiency and complexity thresholds for quantum steering using two-qubit entangled states. Remarkably, it requires only one photon detector on the untrusted side, with efficiency $\epsilon &gt; 1/X$, where $X \geq 2$ is the number of settings on that side. This threshold applies to all pure entangled states, in contrast to analogous Bell-nonlocality tests, which require almost unentangled states to be loss-tolerant. We confirm these predictions in a minimal-complexity ($X = 2$ for the untrusted party and a single three-outcome measurement for the trusted party), detection-loophole-free photonic experiment with $\epsilon = (51.6 \pm 0.4)\% $.</description>

      <title>Topological Sensing in the Dynamics of Quantum Walks with Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum sensing leverages unique topological features to suppress noise and improve the precision of parameter estimation, emerging as a promising tool in both fundamental research and practical application. In this Letter, we propose a sensing protocol that exploits the dynamics of topological quantum walks incorporating localized defects. Unlike conventional schemes that rely on topological protection to suppress disorder and defects, our protocol harnesses the evolution time as a resource to enable precise estimation of the defect parameter. By utilizing topologically nontrivial properties of the quantum walks, the sensing precision can approach the Heisenberg limit. We further demonstrate the performance and robustness of the protocol through Bayesian estimation. Our results show that this approach maintains high precision over a broad range of parameters and exhibits strong robustness against disorder, offering a practical pathway for topologically enhanced quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Finite-size security of QKD: comparison of three proof techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare three proof techniques for composable finite-size security of quantum key distribution under collective attacks, with emphasis on how the resulting secret-key rates behave at practically relevant block lengths. As a benchmark, we consider the BB84 protocol and evaluate finite-size key-rate estimates obtained from entropic uncertainty relations (EUR), from the asymptotic equipartition property (AEP), and from a direct finite-block analysis based on the conditional min-entropy, which we refer to as the finite-size min-entropy (FME) approach. For BB84 we show that the EUR-based bound provides the most favorable performance across the considered parameter range, while the AEP bound is asymptotically tight but can become overly pessimistic at moderate and small block sizes, where it may fail to certify a positive key. The FME approach remains effective in this small-block regime, yielding nonzero rates in situations where the AEP estimate vanishes, although it is not asymptotically optimal for BB84. These results motivate the use of FME-type analyses for continuous-variable protocols in settings where tight EUR-based bounds are unavailable, notably for coherent-state schemes where current finite-size analyses typically rely on AEP-style corrections.</description>

      <title>Iterative Matrix Product State Simulation for Scalable Grover's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grover's algorithm is a cornerstone of quantum search algorithm, offering quadratic speedup for unstructured problems. However, limited qubit counts and noise in today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices hinder large-scale hardware validation, making efficient classical simulation essential for algorithm development and hardware assessment. We present an iterative Grover simulation framework based on matrix product states (MPS) to efficiently simulate large-scale Grover's algorithm. Within the NVIDIA CUDA-Q environment, we compare iterative and common (non-iterative) Grover's circuits across statevector and MPS backends. On the MPS backend at 29 qubits, the iterative Grover's circuit runs about 15x faster than the common (non-iterative) Grover's circuit, and about 3-4x faster than the statevector backend. In sampling experiments, Grover's circuits demonstrate strong low-shot stability: as the qubit number increases beyond 13, a single-shot measurement still closely mirrors the results from 4,096 shots, indicating reliable estimates with minimal sampling and significant potential to cut measurement costs. Overall, an iterative MPS design delivers speed and scalability for Grover's circuit simulation, enabling practical large-scale implementations.</description>

      <title>MPM-QIR: Measurement-Probability Matching for Quantum Image Representation and Compression via Variational Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MPM-QIR, a variational-quantum-circuit (VQC) framework for classical image compression and representation whose core objective is to achieve equal or better reconstruction quality at a lower Parameter Compression Ratio (PCR). The method aligns a generative VQC's measurement-probability distribution with normalized pixel intensities and learns positional information implicitly via an ordered mapping to the flattened pixel array, thus eliminating explicit coordinate qubits and tying compression efficiency directly to circuit (ansatz) complexity. A bidirectional convolutional architecture induces long-range entanglement at shallow depth, capturing global image correlations with fewer parameters. Under a unified protocol, the approach attains PSNR $\geq$ 30 dB with lower PCR across benchmarks: MNIST 31.80 dB / SSIM 0.81 at PCR 0.69, Fashion-MNIST 31.30 dB / 0.91 at PCR 0.83, and CIFAR-10 31.56 dB / 0.97 at PCR 0.84. Overall, this compression-first design improves parameter efficiency, validates VQCs as direct and effective generative models for classical image compression, and is amenable to two-stage pipelines with classical codecs and to extensions beyond 2D imagery.</description>

      <title>Integration and Resource Estimation of Cryoelectronics for Superconducting Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling superconducting quantum computers to the fault-tolerant regime calls for a commensurate scaling of the classical control and readout stack. Today's systems largely rely on room-temperature, rack-based instrumentation connected to dilution-refrigerator cryostats through many coaxial cables. Looking ahead, superconducting fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQCs) will likely adopt a heterogeneous quantum-classical architecture that places selected electronics at cryogenic stages -- for example, cryo-CMOS at 4~K and superconducting digital logic at 4~K and/or mK stages -- to curb wiring and thermal-load overheads. This review distills key requirements, surveys representative room-temperature and cryogenic approaches, and provides a transparent first-order accounting framework for cryoelectronics. Using an RSA-2048-scale benchmark as a concrete reference point, we illustrate how scaling targets motivate constraints on multiplexing and stage-wise cryogenic power, and discuss implications for functional partitioning across room-temperature electronics, cryo-CMOS, and superconducting logic.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Driven Multispectral Gain for High-Sensitivity NV Center Magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a cavity-enabled solid-state magnetometer based on an NV ensemble coupled with a dielectric cavity, achieving 12 pT/$\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ sensitivity and a nearly threefold gain from multispectral features. The features originate from cavity-induced splitting of the NV hyperfine levels and leverages robust quantum coherence in the doubly dressed states of the system to achieve high sensitivity. We project simulated near-term sensitivities approaching 100 fT/$\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$, close to the Johnson-Nyquist limit. Our results establish frequency multiplexing as a new operational paradigm, offering a robust and scalable quantum resource for metrology under ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Limitations for adaptive quantum state tomography in the presence of detector noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assumption-free reconstruction of quantum states from measurements is essential for benchmarking and certifying quantum devices, but it remains difficult due to the extensive measurement statistics and experimental resources it demands. An approach to alleviating these demands is provided by adaptive measurement strategies, which can yield up to a quadratic improvement in reconstruction accuracy for pure states by dynamically optimizing measurement settings during data acquisition. A key open question is whether these asymptotic advantages remain in realistic experiments, where readout is inevitably noisy. In this work, we analyze the impact of readout noise on adaptive quantum state tomography with readout-error mitigation, focusing on the challenging regime of reconstructing pure states using mixed-state estimators. Using analytical arguments based on Fisher information optimization and extensive numerical simulations using Bayesian inference, we show that any nonzero readout noise eliminates the asymptotic quadratic scaling advantage of adaptive strategies. We numerically investigate the behavior for finite measurement statistics for single- and two-qubit systems with exact readout-error mitigation and find a gradual transition from ideal to sub-optimal scaling. We furthermore investigate realistic scenarios where detector tomography is performed with a limited number of state copies for calibration, showing that insufficient detector characterization leads to estimator bias and limited reconstruction accuracy. Although our result imposes an upper bound on the reconstruction accuracy that can be achieved with adaptive strategies, we nevertheless observe numerically a constant-factor gain in reconstruction accuracy, which becomes larger as the readout noise decreases. This indicates potential practical benefits in using adaptive measurement strategies in well-calibrated experiments.</description>

      <title>Phase-Randomized Laser Pulse Generation at 10 GHz for Quantum Photonic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04031v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gain-switching laser diodes is a well-established technique for generating optical pulses with random phases, where the quantum randomness arises naturally from spontaneous emission. However, the maximum switching rate is limited by phase diffusion: at high repetition rates, residual photons in the cavity seed subsequent pulses, leading to phase correlations, which degrade randomness. We present a method to overcome this limitation by employing an external source of spontaneous emission in conjunction with the laser. Our results show that this approach effectively removes interpulse phase correlations and restores phase randomization at repetition rates as high as 10 GHz. This technique opens new opportunities for high-rate quantum key distribution and quantum random number generation.</description>

      <title>Surface Optimization of Aluminum Resonators for Robust Quantum Device Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum remains the central material for superconducting qubits, and considerable effort has been devoted to optimizing its deposition and patterning for quantum devices. However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity. Sequential application of both etches yielded dielectric losses as low as $\delta_\mathrm{LP} = 5.2 \times 10^{-7}$ ($Q\mathrm{i} \approx 1.9\,\mathrm{M}$) in the single photon regime, demonstrating a promising pathway for robust Al-based resonator fabrication.</description>

      <title>Extracting scattering phase shift in quantum mechanics on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of extracting infinite volume scattering phase shift on quantum computers in a simple one-dimensional quantum mechanical model, using the formalism established in Ref.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc} that relates the integrated correlation functions (ICF) for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral. The system is first discretized in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions, and the formalism in real time is verified by employing a contact interaction potential with exact solutions. Quantum circuits are then designed and constructed to implement the formalism on current quantum computing architectures. To overcome the fast oscillatory behavior of the integrated correlation functions in real-time simulation, different methods of post-data analysis are proposed and discussed. Test results on IBM hardware show that good agreement can be achieved with two qubits, but complete failure ensues with three qubits due to two-qubit gate operation errors and thermal relaxation errors.</description>

      <title>Below-shot-noise capacity in phase estimation using nonlinear interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, several schemes for imaging and sensing based on nonlinear interferometers have been proposed and demonstrated experimentally. These interferometers exhibit two main advantages. First, they enable probing a sample at a chosen wavelength while detecting light at a different wavelength with high efficiency (bicolor quantum imaging and sensing with undetected light). Second, they can show quantum-enhanced sensitivities below the shot-noise limit, potentially reaching Heisenberg-limited precision in parameter estimation. Here, we compare three quantum-imaging configurations using only easily accessible intensity-based measurements for phase estimation: a Yurke-type SU(1,1) interferometer, a Mandel-type induced-coherence interferometer, and a hybrid scheme that continuously interpolates between them. While an ideal Yurke interferometer can exhibit Heisenberg scaling, this advantage is known to be fragile under realistic detection constraints and in the presence of loss. We demonstrate that differential intensity detection in the Mandel interferometer provides the highest and most robust phase sensitivity among the considered schemes, reaching but not surpassing the shot-noise limit, even in the presence of loss. Intensity measurements in a Yurke-type configuration can achieve genuine sub-shot-noise sensitivity under balanced losses and moderate gain; however, their performance degrades in realistic high-gain regimes. Consequently, in this regime, the Mandel configuration with differential detection outperforms the Yurke-type setup and constitutes the most robust approach for phase estimation.</description>

      <title>Improved Lower Bounds for Learning Quantum Channels in Diamond Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that learning an unknown quantum channel with input dimension $d_A$, output dimension $d_B$, and Choi rank $r$ to diamond distance $\varepsilon$ requires $ \Omega\!\left( \frac{d_A d_B r}{\varepsilon \log(d_B r / \varepsilon)} \right)$ queries. This improves the best previous $\Omega(d_A d_B r)$ bound by introducing explicit $\varepsilon$-dependence, with a scaling in $\varepsilon$ that is near-optimal when $d_A=rd_B$ but not tight in general. The proof constructs an ensemble of channels that are well-separated in diamond norm yet admit Stinespring isometries that are close in operator norm.</description>

      <title>Robust and fragile quantum effects in the transfer kinetics of delocalized excitons between B850 units of LH2 complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aggregates of light harvesting 2 (LH2) complexes form the major exciton-relaying domain in the photosynthetic unit of purple bacteria. Application of a generalized master equation to pairs of the B850 units of LH2 complexes, where excitons predominantly reside, provide quantitative information on how the inter-LH2 exciton transfer depends on the distance, relative rotational angle, and the relative energies of the two LH2s. The distance dependence demonstrates significant enhancement of the rate due to quantum delocalization of excitons, the qualitative nature of which remains robust against the disorder. The angle dependence reflects isotropic nature of exciton transfer, which remains similar for the ensemble of disorder. The variation of the rate on relative excitation energies of LH2 exhibits resonance peaks, which however is fragile as the disorder becomes significant. Overall, the average transfer times between two LH2s are estimated to be in the range of 4 - 25 ps for physically plausible inter-LH2 distances.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Small Dataset Classification Using Projected Quantum Kernels with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in efficiency and accuracy in image classification. However, their efficacy often relies on large, labeled datasets, posing challenges for applications with limited data availability. Our research addresses these challenges by introducing an innovative approach that leverages projected quantum kernels (PQK) to enhance feature extraction for CNNs, specifically tailored for small datasets. Projected quantum kernels, derived from quantum computing principles, offer a promising avenue for capturing complex patterns and intricate data structures that traditional CNNs might miss. By incorporating these kernels into the feature extraction process, we improved the representational ability of CNNs. Our experiments demonstrated that, with 1000 training samples, the PQK-enhanced CNN achieved 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset and 90% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming the classical CNN, which achieved only 60% and 12% accuracy on the respective datasets. This research reveals the potential of quantum computing in overcoming data scarcity issues in machine learning and paves the way for future exploration of quantum-assisted neural networks, suggesting that projected quantum kernels can serve as a powerful approach for enhancing CNN-based classification in data-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Optical Spectroscopy of Waveguide coupled Er$^{3+}$ ensembles in CaWO$_4$ and YVO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an optical study of near-surface Er$^{3+}$ ensembles in waveguide-integrated CaWO$_4$ and YVO$_4$, investigating how nanophotonic coupling modifies rare-earth spectroscopy. In particular, we compare bulk excitation with evanescently coupled TE and TM waveguide modes. In Er$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$, we observe a pronounced polarization-dependent surface effect. TE-coupled spectra closely reproduce bulk behavior. In contrast, TM coupling induces strong inhomogeneous broadening and an asymmetric low-energy shoulder of the site S1 Y1Z1 transition, with linewidths exceeding those of the bulk by more than a factor of four. Temperature-dependent measurements and surface termination studies indicate that surface charges are the dominant mechanism. Er$^{3+}$:YVO$_4$ remains largely unaffected by mode polarization, and surface termination leads only to minor spectral shifts. These observations suggest that non-charge-neutral rare-earth systems are more susceptible to surface-induced decoherence sources than charge-neutral hosts.</description>

      <title>Unitary Transformation of Two-Dimensional Spin-Orbit Coupled Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rashba, Dresselhaus, and Weyl Hamiltonians form a foundational framework for modeling spin-orbit interactions across condensed matter systems. Although they describe distinct material classes and produce seemingly different spin textures, they are conventionally treated as separate, unrelated theoretical frameworks. Here, this work demonstrates that the linear 2D Rashba and Weyl models are connected by a specific unitary transformation that maps one Hamiltonian exactly onto the other. The same unitary can be applied to map the linear Dresselhaus-1 model onto the Dresselhaus-2 models and vice versa. Such hidden correspondence establishes a unified theoretical foundation for spin-orbit interactions, deepening our conceptual understanding of spin-orbit coupling and opening new avenues for exploring complex spin textures. To illustrate the application, this work introduces a unique, improved, and more realistic model Hamiltonian H_MKM combining all known foundational spintronic models, where the stringent condition of equal spin-orbit coupling strength of Rashba and Dresselhaus may not be required to observe persistent spin texture under MKM transformation.</description>

      <title>Koopman Nonlinear Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects are conventionally manifested as boundary localization of eigenstates in linear systems. In nonlinear settings, however, where eigenstates are no longer well defined, it becomes unclear how skin effects should be faithfully characterized. Here, we propose a Koopman-based characterization of nonlinear skin effects, in which localization is defined in terms of Koopman eigenfunctions in a lifted observable space, rather than physical states. Using a minimal nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model, we show that dominant Koopman eigenfunctions localize sharply on higher-order observables, in stark contrast to linear skin effects confined to linear observables. This lifted-space localization governs the sensitivity to boundary amplitude perturbations, providing a distinct dynamical signature of the nonlinear skin effect. Our results establish the Koopman framework as a natural setting in which skin effects unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems can be identified.</description>

      <title>Interference-Induced Suppression of Doublon Transport and Prethermalization in the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coherent mobility of doublons, arising from second-order virtual dissociation-recombination processes, fundamentally limits their use as information carriers in the strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard model. We propose a disorder-free suppression mechanism by introducing an optimized nearest-neighbor pair-hopping term that destructively interferes with the dominant virtual hopping channel. Using the third-order Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we derive an analytical optimal condition that accounts for lattice geometry corrections. Exact numerical simulations demonstrate that this optimized scheme achieves near-complete dynamical arrest and entanglement preservation in one-dimensional chains, while in two-dimensional square lattices, it significantly suppresses ballistic spreading yet permits a slow residual expansion. Furthermore, in the many-body regime, finite-size scaling analysis identifies the observed long-lived density-wave order as a prethermal plateau emerging from the dramatic separation of microscopic and thermalization timescales.</description>

      <title>Scalar vacuum densities on Beltrami pseudosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of spatial curvature and topology on the properties of the vacuum state for a charged scalar field localized on the (2+1)-dimensional Beltrami pseudosphere, assuming that the field obeys quasiperiodicity condition with constant phase. As important local characteristics of the vacuum state the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the field squared and energy-momentum tensor are evaluated. The contributions in the VEVs coming from geometry with an uncompactified azimuthal coordinate are divergent, whereas the compact counterparts are finite and are analysed both numerically and asymptotically. For small values of proper radius of the compactified dimension, the leading terms of topological contributions are independent of the field mass and curvature coupling parameter, increasing by a power-law. In the opposite limit, the VEVs decay following a power-law in the general case. In the special case of a conformally coupled massless field the behavior is different. Unlike the VEV of field squared and vacuum energy density, the radial and azimuthal stresses are increasing by absolute value. As a consequence, the effects of nontrivial topology are strong for the stresses in this case at small values of radial coordinate.</description>

      <title>Reshaping and quantifying inter- and intramolecular exchange in signal amplification by reversible exchange of pyruvate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) is a nuclear spin hyperpolarization technique in which the transient interaction of parahydrogen (pH2) and a target substrate with an iridium complex leads to polarization transfer to the substrate. Here, we use a parahydrogen-enhanced, spin-selective NMR method to investigate pyruvate binding, which is combined with exchange-model fitting and DFT calculations. Our study reveals several key findings that reshape the current understanding of SABRE: (a) intramolecular hydrogen exchange of the hydrides, occurring faster than pyruvate or H2 loss; (b) the discovery of a novel stable H2-IrImes-DMSO2-pyruvate complex; and (c) the crucial role of counterions, here Na+, in Ir-pyruvate binding. Previously unknown insights into complex kinetics and distributions as a function of temperature, [DMSO], [pyruvate], and hydrogen pressure are presented. The methods demonstrated here, exemplified by SABRE, provide a framework that is expected to guide future research in the field.</description>

      <title>Quantum vs. Classical Machine Learning: A Benchmark Study for Financial Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a reproducible benchmarking framework that systematically compares QML models with architecture-matched classical counterparts across three financial tasks: (i) directional return prediction on U.S. and Turkish equities, (ii) live-trading simulation with Quantum LSTMs versus classical LSTMs on the S\&amp;P 500, and (iii) realized volatility forecasting using Quantum Support Vector Regression. By standardizing data splits, features, and evaluation metrics, our study provides a fair assessment of when current-generation QML models can match or exceed classical methods. Our results reveal that quantum approaches show performance gains when data structure and circuit design are well aligned. In directional classification, hybrid quantum neural networks surpass the parameter-matched ANN by \textbf{+3.8 AUC} and \textbf{+3.4 accuracy points} on \texttt{AAPL} stock and by \textbf{+4.9 AUC} and \textbf{+3.6 accuracy points} on Turkish stock \texttt{KCHOL}. In live trading, the QLSTM achieves higher risk-adjusted returns in \textbf{two of four} S\&amp;P~500 regimes. For volatility forecasting, an angle-encoded QSVR attains the \textbf{lowest QLIKE} on \texttt{KCHOL} and remains within $\sim$0.02-0.04 QLIKE of the best classical kernels on \texttt{S\&amp;P~500} and \texttt{AAPL}. Our benchmarking framework clearly identifies the scenarios where current QML architectures offer tangible improvements and where established classical methods continue to dominate.</description>

      <title>Phases of the $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills theory at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $(2+1)$-dimensional $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SU}(N)_k$ Yang-Mills theory in the lattice Hamiltonian formalism, which is characterized by three parameters: the number of colors $N$, the coupling constant $g$, and the level $k$. By treating these as tunable parameters, we explore how key properties of the theory, such as confinement and topological order, emerge in different regimes. Employing a variational mean-field analysis that interpolates between the strong- and weak-coupling regimes, we determine the large-$N$ phase structure in terms of the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda_\mathrm{tH}=g^2N$ and the ratio $k/N$. We find that the topologically ordered phase remains robust at large $N$ under appropriate scalings of these parameters. This result indicates that the continuum limit of large-$N$ gauge theory may be more intricate than naively expected, and motivates studies beyond the mean-field theory, both to achieve a further understanding of confinement in gauge theories and to guide quantum simulations of large-$N$ gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: The potential application of topological superconductivity in quantum transport and quantum information has fueled an intense investigation of hybrid materials with emergent electronic properties, including magnet-superconductor heterostructures. Here, we report evidence of a topological nodal-point superconducting phase in a one-atom-thick in-plane ferromagnet in direct proximity to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor. Low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy data reveal the presence of a double-peak low-energy feature in the local density of states of the hybrid system, which is rationalized via model calculations to be an emergent topological nodal-point superconducting phase with tilted Weyl cones. Our results further establish the combination of in-plane ferromagnetism and conventional superconductivity as a route to design two-dimensional topological quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Conveyor-mode electron shuttling through a T-junction in Si/SiGe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conveyor-mode shuttling in gated Si/SiGe devices enables adiabatic transfer of single electrons, electron patterns and spin qubits confined in quantum dots across several microns with a scalable number of signal lines. To realize their full potential, linear shuttle lanes must connect into a two-dimensional grid with controllable routing. We introduce a T-junction device linking two independently driven shuttle lanes. Electron routing across the junction requires no extra control lines beyond the four channels per conveyor belt. We measure an inter-lane charge transfer fidelity of $F = 100.0000000^{+0}_{-9\times 10^{-7}}\,\%$ at an instantaneous electron velocity of $270\,\mathrm{mm}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The filling of 54 quantum dots is controlled by simple atomic pulses, allowing us to swap electron patterns, laying the groundwork for a native spin-qubit SWAP gate. This T-junction establishes a path towards scalable, two-dimensional quantum computing architectures with flexible spin qubit routing for quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations for predicting electron-positron pair production via the linear Breit-Wheeler process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) has the potential to revolutionise the future of scientific simulations. To harness the capabilities that QC offers, we can integrate it into hybrid quantum-classical simulations, which can boost the capabilities of supercomputing by leveraging quantum modules that offer speedups over classical counterparts. One example is quantum Monte Carlo integration, which is theorised to achieve a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo, making it suitable for high-energy physics, strong-field QED, and multiple scientific and industrial applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that quantum Monte Carlo can be used to predict the number of pairs created when two photon beams collide head-on, a problem relevant to high-energy physics and intense laser-matter interactions. The results from the quantum simulations demonstrate high accuracy relative to theoretical predictions. The accuracy of the simulations is only constrained by the approximations required to embed polynomials and to initialise the quantum state. We also demonstrate that our algorithm can be used in current quantum hardware, providing up to 90 % accuracy relative to theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we propose pathways towards integrations with classical simulation codes.</description>

Abstract: We define a nonlinear Fourier transform which maps sequences of contractive $n \times n$ matrices to $SU(2n)$-valued functions on the circle $\mathbb{T}$. We characterize the image of finitely supported sequences and square-summable sequences on the half-line, and construct an inverse for $SU(2n)$-valued functions whose diagonal $n \times n$ blocks are outer matrix functions. As an application, we relate this nonlinear Fourier transform with quantum signal processing over $U(2n)$ and multivariate quantum signal processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces an end-to-end framework for multi-asset option pricing that combines market-consistent risk-neutral density recovery with quantum-accelerated numerical integration. We first calibrate arbitrage-free marginal distributions from European option quotes using the Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) model, leveraging its analytical tractability and ability to capture skewness and fat tails. Marginals are coupled via a Gaussian copula to construct joint distributions. To address the computational bottleneck of the high-dimensional integration required to solve the option pricing formula, we employ Quantum Accelerated Monte Carlo (QAMC) techniques based on Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE), achieving quadratic convergence improvements over classical Monte Carlo (CMC) methods. Theoretical results establish accuracy bounds and query complexity for both marginal density estimation (via cosine-series expansions) and multidimensional pricing. Empirical tests on liquid equity entities (Credit Agricole, AXA, Michelin) confirm high calibration accuracy and demonstrate that QAMC requires 10-100 times fewer queries than classical methods for comparable precision. This study provides a practical route to integrate arbitrage-aware modelling with quantum computing, highlighting implications for scalability and future extensions to complex derivatives.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Linear-Quadratic Gap: A Quantum-Classical Hybrid Approach to Robust Supply Chain Design</title>

Abstract: The design of supply chain networks in densely populated urban logistics systems faces a timely dilemma: the traditional optimisation approaches are effective to maximise the level of demand perfusion, but they are limited to embracing large expenses in overlapping the facilities and cannibalisation in the market. When tested on a high-fidelity digital twin of the Delhi NCR road network of thirty candidate sites, we establish that Classical Greedy algorithms using the theoretical maximum demand of (473 units) lack any theoretical overlap penalty, but incur a prohibitive overlap penalty (5.08). Here, in comparison, the Quantum-Inspired solution only losses 3.2% of demand (450 compared to 465 units relative to the optimal solution), but the solution preserves 21.8% less operational overlap risk (3.26 compared to 4.17), which can be viewed as a 35.8% improvement compared to the Greedy solution. Geospatial analysis shows that it can be attributed to a shift in strategies: This, in contrast to Classical approaches, which focus on locating facilities in the high-density central areas (North/Central Delhi), the quantum-inspired solver autonomously chooses the diversified topology of the North-south network, penetrating into the underserved periphery growth markets. This is a spatially balanced arrangement which is congruent to the polycentric structure of modern time megacities, and displays better stability to volatility in demand. We have shown that quantum-inspired optimisation methods can close the so-called Linear-Quadratic Gap phenomenon, i.e. the systematic inability of greedy methods to capture the actual quadratic interactions between facilities, and offer a way of computing the pathway to operationally robust and risk-optimised supply chain networks in dense urban conditions.</description>

      <title>Catalytic channels are the only noise-robust catalytic processes</title>

Abstract: Catalysis refers to the possibility of enabling otherwise inaccessible quantum state transitions by supplying an auxiliary system, provided that the auxiliary is returned to its initial state at the end of the protocol. We show that previous studies on catalysis are largely impractical, because even small errors in the system's initial state can irreversibly degrade the catalyst. To overcome this limitation, we introduce robust catalytic transformations and explore the fundamental extent of their capabilities. We demonstrate that robust catalysis is closely tied to the property of resource broadcasting. In particular, in completely resource non-generating theories, robust catalysis is possible if and only if resource broadcasting is possible. We develop a no-go theorem under a set of general axioms, demonstrating that robust catalysis is unattainable for a broad class of quantum resource theories. However, surprisingly, we also identify thermodynamical scenarios where maximal robust catalytic advantage can be achieved. Our approach clarifies the practical prospects of catalytic advantage for a wide range of quantum resources, including entanglement, coherence, thermodynamics, magic, and imaginarity.</description>

      <title>Extensive manipulation of transition rates and substantial population inversion of rotating atoms inside a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transition rates of a centripetally accelerated atom inside a high-quality cavity and show that they can be extensively tuned by adjusting the cavity resonance and the rotation frequency. Crucially, while inertial atoms cannot be excited in vacuum, rotation induces spontaneous excitation via the circular Unruh effect, with the cavity serving only as an amplifier. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that, in one scenario, the excitation rate can reach $\sim 10^7~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ while emission remains negligible, enabling substantial population inversion. In another scenario, both excitation and emission can simultaneously attain $\sim 10^7~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, corresponding to millions of transitions per second for a single atom. These findings highlight a powerful method for manipulating atomic transition rates for quantum applications and open a promising route toward experimental verification of the circular Unruh effect with state-of-the-art quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that encrypted cloning of unknown quantum states is possible. Any number of encrypted clones of a qubit can be created through a unitary transformation, and each of the encrypted clones can be decrypted through a unitary transformation. The decryption of an encrypted clone consumes the decryption key, i.e., only one decryption is possible, in agreement with the no-cloning theorem. Encrypted cloning represents a new paradigm that provides a form of redundancy, parallelism or scalability where direct duplication is forbidden by the no-cloning theorem. For example, a possible application of encrypted cloning is to enable encrypted quantum multi-cloud storage.</description>

Abstract: We determine the covert capacity for entanglement generation over a noisy quantum channel. While secrecy guarantees that the transmitted information remains inaccessible to an adversary, covert communication ensures that the transmission itself remains undetectable. The entanglement dimension follows a square root law (SRL) in the covert setting, i.e., $O(\sqrt{n})$ EPR pairs can be distributed covertly and reliably over $n$ channel uses. We begin with covert communication of classical information under a secrecy constraint. We then leverage this result to construct a coding scheme for covert entanglement generation.</description>

      <title>Inductive Graph Representation Learning with Quantum Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) offer a promising approach to combining quantum computing with graph-structured data processing. While classical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are scalable and robust, existing QGNNs often lack flexibility due to graph-specific quantum circuit designs, limiting their applicability to diverse real-world problems. To address this, we propose a versatile QGNN framework inspired by GraphSAGE, using quantum models as aggregators. We integrate inductive representation learning techniques with parameterized quantum convolutional and pooling layers, bridging classical and quantum paradigms. The convolutional layer is flexible, allowing tailored designs for specific tasks. Benchmarked on a node regression task with the QM9 dataset, our framework, using a single minimal circuit for all aggregation steps, handles molecules with varying numbers of atoms without changing qubits or circuit architecture. While classical GNNs achieve higher training performance, our quantum approach remains competitive and often shows stronger generalization as molecular complexity increases. We also observe faster learning in early training epochs. To mitigate trainability limitations of a single-circuit setup, we extend the framework with multiple quantum aggregators on QM9. Assigning distinct circuits to each hop substantially improves training performance across all cases. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus as qubit numbers increase, suggesting that the proposed model can scale to larger, more complex graph-based problems.</description>

      <title>The stellar decomposition of Gaussian quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the stellar decomposition, a novel method for characterizing non-Gaussian states produced by photon-counting measurements on Gaussian states. Given an $(m+n)$-mode Gaussian state $G$, we express it as an $(m+n)$-mode "Gaussian core state" $G_{\mathrm{core}}$ followed by an $m$-mode Gaussian transformation $T$ that only acts on the first $m$ modes. The defining property of the Gaussian core state $G_{\mathrm{core}}$ is that measuring the last $n$ of its modes in the photon-number basis leaves the first $m$ modes on a finite Fock support, i.e. a core state. Since $T$ is measurement-independent and $G_{\mathrm{core}}$ has an exact and finite Fock representation, this decomposition exactly describes all non-Gaussian states obtainable by projecting $n$ modes of $G$ onto the Fock basis. For pure states we prove that a physical pair $(G_{\mathrm{core}}, T)$ always exists with $G_{\mathrm{core}}$ pure and $T$ unitary. For mixed states, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for $(G_{\mathrm{core}}, T)$ to be a Gaussian mixed state and a Gaussian channel. We also develop a semidefinite program to extract the "largest" possible Gaussian channel when these conditions fail. Finally, we present a formal stellar decomposition for generic operators, which is useful in simulations where the only requirement is that the two parts contract back to the original operator. The stellar decomposition leads to practical bounds on achievable state quality in photonic circuits and for GKP state generation in particular. Our results are based on a new characterization of Gaussian completely positive maps in the Bargmann picture, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Towards a Generalized Theory of Observers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a formal framework for understanding and unifying the concept of observers across physics, computer science, philosophy, and related fields. Building on cybernetic feedback models, we introduce an operational definition of minimal observers, explore their role in shaping foundational concepts, and identify what remains unspecified in their absence. Drawing upon insights from quantum gravity, digital physics, second-order cybernetics, and recent ruliological and pregeometric approaches, we argue that observers serve as indispensable reference points for measurement, reference frames, and the emergence of meaning. We show how this formalism sheds new light on debates related to consciousness, quantum measurement, and computational boundaries; by way of theorems on observer equivalences and complexity measures. This perspective opens new avenues for investigating how complexity and structure arise in both natural and artificial systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-range quantum systems, in which the interactions decay as $1/r^{\alpha}$, are of increasing interest due to the variety of experimental set-ups in which they naturally appear. Motivated by this, we study fundamental properties of long-range spin systems in thermal equilibrium, focusing on the weak regime of $ \alpha&gt;D$. Our main result is a proof of analiticity of their partition functions at high temperatures, which allows us to construct a classical algorithm with sub-exponential runtime $\exp(\mathcal{O}(\log^2(N/\epsilon)))$ that approximates the log-partition function to small additive error $\epsilon$. As by-products, we establish the equivalence of ensembles and the Gaussianity of the density of states, which we verify numerically in both the weak and strong long-range regimes. This also yields constraints on the appearance of various classes of phase transitions, including thermal, dynamical and excited-state ones. Our main technical contribution is the extension to the quantum long-range regime of the convergence criterion for cluster expansions of Koteck\'y and Preiss.</description>

      <title>Classical capacities under physical constraints: More capacity with less entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current advancements in communication equipment demand the investigation of classical information transfer over quantum channels, by encompassing realistic scenarios in finite dimensions. To address this issue, we develop a framework for analyzing classical capacities of quantum channels where the set of states used for encoding information is restricted based on various physical properties. Specifically, we provide expressions for the classical capacities of noiseless and noisy quantum channels when the average energy of the encoded ensemble or the energy of each of the constituent states in the ensemble is bounded. In the case of qubit energy-preserving dephasing channels, we demonstrate that a nonuniform probability distribution based on the energy constraint maximizes capacity, while we derive the compact form of the capacity for equiprobable messages. We suggest an energy-constrained dense coding (DC) protocol that we prove to be optimal in the two-qubit situation and obtain a closed-form expression for the DC capacity. Additionally, we demonstrate a no-go result, which states that when the dimension of the sender and the receiver is two, no energy-preserving operation can offer any quantum advantage for energy-constrained entanglement-assisted capacity. We exhibit that, in the energy-constrained situation, classical-quantum noisy channels can show improved capabilities under entanglement assistance, a phenomenon that is unattainable in the unrestricted scenario.</description>

      <title>NonHermitian Topological Phases in a Hermitian Modified Bosonic Kitaev Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a modification to the bosonic Kitaev chain that, despite being Hermitian, supports both nonHermitian skin effect and nontrivial topological edge modes in its excitation Hamiltonian. We establish an exact mapping between the excitation Hamiltonian of our system and a nonHermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, which allows for a completely analytical characterization of its topology. In particular, topological phase transition points separating a topologically trivial and nontrivial regime were identified analytically by the appropriate winding number invariant and the presence of zero energy modes. Similarly to the regular bosonic Kitaev chain, the nonHermitian skin effect and some (but not all) topological edge modes are quickly destroyed at nonzero bosonic onsite potential (harmonic oscillator frequency). Remarkably, however, disorder partially recovers some of these features. This work thus demonstrates the potential of a modified bosonic Kitaev chain as a platform to generate rich nonHermitian topological phenomena from a completely Hermitian system's perspective. Lastly, we suggest a possible experimental realization of the model, which could allow for total control over the parameter space.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the phase diagram of an anisotropic Dicke model by revealing the non-analyticity induced by underlying exceptional points. We find that, from a dynamical perspective, the conventional superradiant phase can be further separated into three regions, in which the systems are characterized by different effective Hamiltonians, including the harmonic oscillator, the inverted harmonic oscillator, and their respective counterparts. We employ the Loschmidt echo to characterize different quantum phases by analyzing the quench dynamics of a trivial initial state. Numerical simulations for finite systems confirm our predictions about the existence of hierarchic superradiant phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a reconfigurable quantum network architecture suitable for integrating satellite links in metropolitan quantum networks. The network architecture is designed such that once a satellite is in range, it is configured in a multipoint-to-point topology where all ground nodes establish entanglement with the satellite receiver using time multiplexing to optimize long-distance transmission. Otherwise, the satellite up-link can be rerouted to the ground nodes to form a pair-wise ground network. Leveraging both the time and frequency correlations of our photon-pair source, we demonstrate an increased coincidence-to-accidental ratio without additional resource overhead in a five-node network. To contextualize these experimental findings, we project their performance in a quantum key distribution scenario and outline a feasible route toward field deployment, using integrated photonics to enable network integration of up to 72 users.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing quantum processes is essential for unlocking the potential of quantum devices. However, standard quantum process tomography is resource-intensive and becomes infeasible on large-scale systems. Despite alternative approaches have been successfully developed for specific scenarios, they typically rely on multi-qubit gates or extensive prior knowledge, limiting their practicability and scalability. To address these challenges and complement existing approaches, we introduce influence sampling, an efficient and scalable protocol that quantifies the influence of a quantum process on all qubit subsets using only single-qubit test gates, with sample complexity independent of system size. Using a photonic platform, we demonstrate influence sampling to identify high-influence qubits, reduce the full process to a smaller effective process, i.e., a junta approximation, and then learn it. We further confirm scalability by applying the protocol to a 24-qubit system and validate the junta approximation on a two-qubit process. These results establish influence sampling as a critical characterization technique, facilitating process learning and device assessment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the application of the Jordanian quantum algebra $\mathcal{U}_h (\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R}))$, a Hopf algebra deformation of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$, in order to generate sets of $N$ qubit quantum states. We construct the associated $h$-deformed Dicke states using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for $\mathcal{U}_h (\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R}))$, showing that the former exhibit completely different features than the $q$-Dicke states obtained from the standard quantum deformation $\mathcal U_q (\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R}))$. Moreover, the density matrices of these $h$-deformed Dicke states are compared to the experimental realizations of those of Dicke states, and several similarities are observed, indicating that the $h$-deformation could be used to describe noise and decoherence effects in experimental settings, as well as to control the degree of entanglement of the state in quantum computing protocols. In particular, $h$-Dicke states for $N=2,3,4$ are presented, a method to construct the $h$-deformed analogs of $W$-states for arbitrary $N$ is given, and some algebraic considerations for the explicit derivation of generic $h$-Dicke states are provided.</description>

Abstract: The recent topological classification of non-Hermitian `Hamiltonians' is usually interpreted in terms of pure quantum states that decay or grow with time. However, many-body systems with loss and gain are typically better described by mixed-state open quantum dynamics, which only correspond to pure-state non-Hermitian dynamics upon a postselection of measurement outcomes. Since postselection becomes exponentially costly with particle number, we here investigate to what extent the most important example of non-Hermitian topology can survive without it: the non-Hermitian skin effect and its relationship to a bulk winding number in one spatial dimension. After defining the winding number of the Lindbladian superoperator for a quadratic fermion system, we systematically relate it to the winding number of the associated postselected non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We prove that the two winding numbers are equal (opposite) in the absence of gain (loss), and provide a physical explanation for this relationship. When both loss and gain are present, the Lindbladian winding number typically remains quantized and non-zero, though it can change sign at a phase transition separating the loss and gain-dominated regimes. This transition, which leads to a reversal of the Lindbladian skin effect localization, is rendered invisible by postselection. We also identify a case where removing postselection induces a skin effect from otherwise topologically trivial non-Hermitian dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Multipartite quantum systems are subject to monogamy relations that impose fundamental constraints on the distribution of quantum correlations between subsystems. These constraints can be studied quantitatively through sector lengths, defined as the average value of $m$-body correlations, which have applications in quantum information theory and coding theory. In this work, we derive a set of monogamy inequalities that complement the shadow inequalities, enabling a complete characterization of the numerical range of sector lengths for systems with $N\leq 5$ qubits in a pure state. This range forms a convex polytope, facilitating the efficient extremization of key physical quantities, such as the linear entropy of entanglement and the quantum shadow enumerators, by a simple evaluation at the polytope vertices. For larger systems ($N\geq 6$), we highlight a significant increase in complexity that neither our inequalities nor the shadow inequalities can fully capture.</description>

      <title>Quantum Internet Architecture: unlocking Quantum-Native Routing via Quantum Addressing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The key objective of the Quantum Internet is the distribution and manipulation of entanglement to enable unprecedented applications. This requires a radical departure from classical Internet design principles, such as the end-to-end argument, due to the inherently stateful and non-local nature of entanglement, which demands coordinated in-network operations and persistent state awareness. To this end, we propose a novel hierarchical Quantum Internet architecture centered on the concept of Entanglement-Defined Controller (EDC). This architectural design constitutes the foundational layer, by enabling a clear separation between control and data planes. While necessary, this separation is insufficient to manage entanglement resources, requiring a quantum-native control plane. Consequently, we propose a quantum addressing scheme that embeds quantumness directly into node identifiers, allowing the network to natively track and manipulate entanglement as a dynamic resource. Built upon these two interdependent pillars -- EDC-based architecture and quantum addressing -- we design a quantum-native routing protocol that achieves scalability through compact routing tables, by efficiently operating over entanglement-defined topologies. Finally, we design a quantum address splitting functionality based on Schrodinger's oracles that generalizes classical match-and-forward logic to the quantum domain. Collectively, these contributions demonstrate, for the first time, the fundamental advantages of quantum-by-design network control for enabling scalable quantum networking.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Bayesian Statistics to Accelerate Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a unified statistical framework that underscores the crucial role statistical inference plays in Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE), a task essential to fields ranging from chemistry to finance and machine learning. We use this framework to harness Bayesian statistics for improved measurement efficiency with rigorous interval estimates at all iterations of Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation. We demonstrate the resulting method, Bayesian Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation (BIQAE), accurately and efficiently estimates both quantum amplitudes and molecular ground-state energies to high accuracy, and show in analytic and numerical sample complexity analyses that BIQAE outperforms all other QAE approaches considered. Both rigorous mathematical proofs and numerical simulations conclusively indicate Bayesian statistics is the source of this advantage, a finding that invites further inquiry into the power of statistics to expedite the search for quantum utility.</description>

      <title>Wireless Josephson parametric amplifier above 20 GHz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11137v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operating superconducting qubits at elevated temperatures offers increased cooling power and thus system scalability, but requires suppression of thermal photons to preserve coherence and readout fidelity. This motivates migration to higher operation frequencies, which demands high-frequency amplification with near-quantum-limited noise characteristics for qubit readout. Here, we report the design and experimental realization of a wireless Josephson parametric amplifier (WJPA) operating above 20~GHz. The wireless design eliminates losses and impedance mismatches that become problematic at high frequencies. The WJPA achieves more than 20~dB of gain across a tunable frequency range of 21--23.5~GHz, with a typical dynamic bandwidth of 3~MHz. Through Y-factor measurements and a qubit-based photon number calibration, we show that the amplifier exhibits an added noise of approximately two photons.</description>

      <title>Optimizing decoherence in the generation of optical Schr\"odinger cat states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to use cavity Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency to generate Schr\"odinger cat states of optical photons. We predict that this should make it possible to generate states with relatively large mean photon numbers. With existing technology, mean photon numbers around 30 seem feasible. The main limitation is photon loss during the process, which generates the state. The ability to tune the strength of the photon loss caused by atomic spontaneous emission makes it possible to have little decoherence despite significant photon loss during the generation of the state.</description>

      <title>Theory of dynamical superradiance in organic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of dynamical superradiance -- the collective exchange of energy between an ensemble of initially excited emitters and a single-mode cavity -- for organic materials where electronic states are coupled to vibrational modes. We consider two models to capture the vibrational effects: first, vibrations treated as a Markovian bath for two-level emitters, via a pure dephasing term in the Lindblad master equation for the system; second, vibrational modes directly included in the system via the Holstein--Tavis--Cummings Hamiltonian. By exploiting the permutation symmetry of the emitters and weak U(1) symmetry, we develop a numerical method capable of exactly solving the Tavis-Cummings model with local dissipation for up to 140 emitters. Using the exact method, we validate mean-field and second-order cumulant approximations and use them to describe macroscopic numbers of emitters. We analyse the dynamics of the average cavity photon number, electronic coherence, and Bloch vector length, and show that the effect of vibrational mode coupling goes beyond simple dephasing. Our results show that superradiance is possible in the presence of vibrational mode coupling; for negative cavity detunings, the vibrational coupling may even enhance superradiance. We identify asymmetry of the photon number rise time as a function of the detuning of the cavity frequency as an experimentally accessible signature of such vibrationally assisted superradiance.</description>

Abstract: Measurement incompatibility, or joint measurability, is a cornerstone of quantum theory and a useful resource. For finite-dimensional systems, quantifying this resource and establishing universal bounds valid for all measurements is a long-standing problem. In this work, we exhibit analytical universal parent measurements giving access to bounds that beat the state of the art. In particular, we can show that, for relevant robustnesses, sets of anticommuting observables give rise to the most incompatible dichotomic measurements. We also formalise the construction of such universal parent measurements in the framework of sum-of-squares optimisation and obtain preliminary numerical results demonstrating the power of the method by improving on our own analytical values. All results find direct application for demonstrating genuine high-dimensional steering, that is, certifying the dimensionality of a quantum system in a one-sided device-independent manner.</description>

      <title>Quantum information-cost relations and fluctuations beyond thermal environments: A thermodynamic inference approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of information thermodynamics, provides a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of information erasure in terms of the information content change. However, its traditional formulation is largely confined to systems exchanging solely energy with an ideal thermal bath. In this work, we derive general information-cost trade-off relations that go beyond the scope of Landauer's principle by developing a thermodynamic inference approach based on the maximum entropy principle. These relations require only information about the system and are applicable to complex quantum scenarios involving multiple conserved charges and non-thermal environments. Specifically, we present two key results: (i) In scenarios where only the mean values of observables are accessible, we derive an information-content-informed upper bound on the thermodynamic cost which complements an existing generalized Landauer lower bound. (ii) When second-order fluctuations can also be measured, we obtain an information-content-informed lower bound on the change in variances of observables, thereby extending the Landauer's principle to constrain higher-order fluctuation costs. We numerically validate our information-cost trade-off relations using a coupled-qubit system exchanging energy and excitations, a driven qubit implementing an information erasure process, and a driven double quantum dot system that can operate as an inelastic heat engine. Our results underscore the broad utility of maximum-entropy inference in constraining thermodynamic costs for generic finite-time quantum processes, with direct relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamic applications.</description>

Abstract: We express the probabilistic character associated to the wave function by treating it as a stochastic variable. This is accomplished by means of a stochastic equation for the wave function whose noise changes the phase of the wave function but not its absolute value, so that the norm of the wave function is strictly conserved along a stochastic trajectory. We show that the density matrix that obeys the quantum Liouville equation is the covariance matrix associated to the stochastic wave function.</description>

      <title>Spectral statistics and energy-gap scaling in $k-$local spin Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of all-to-all interacting spin Hamiltonians acting on exactly $k$ spins, whose coupling coefficients are drawn from a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. For $\mu = 0$, we demonstrate that the random matrix ensemble -- Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), or Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE) -- is determined by the parity of system size $L$ and locality $k$, following standard time-reversal symmetry classification. For couplings with a nonzero mean, we map the Hamiltonians to deformed random matrix ensembles and analyze conditions for an energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state. For $\mu &lt; 0$, we find two distinct regimes: for $k \gg \sqrt{L}$, the gap closes at critical disorder $\sigma_{c} \approx |\mu|$. Near this transition the energy gap $\Delta$ exhibits universal quadratic scaling $\Delta /L \sim (\sigma - \sigma_{c})^{2}$. When $k \ll \sqrt{L}$, $\sigma_{c}$ scales with $|\mu|$, but lacks a sharp transition. Our work introduces a semi-solvable model that captures universal features of random-matrix statistics, and spectral gap formation, providing a foundation for systematic extensions to more general many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) requires ancilla qubits to extract error syndromes from data qubits which store quantum information. However, ancilla errors can propagate back to the data qubits, introducing additional errors and limiting fault-tolerance. In superconducting quantum circuits, Kerr-cat qubits (KCQs), which exhibit strongly biased noise, have been proposed as ancillas to suppress this back-action and enhance QEC performance. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a beamsplitter interaction between a KCQ and a transmon, realizing an effective $\sigma_z\sigma_x$ coupling that can be employed for parity measurements in QEC protocols. We characterize the interaction across a range of cat sizes and drive amplitudes, confirming the expected scaling of the interaction rate. These results establish a step towards hybrid architectures that combine transmons as data qubits with noise-biased bosonic ancillas, enabling hardware-efficient syndrome extraction and advancing the development of fault-tolerant quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Ground state energy and phase transitions of Long-range XXZ using VQE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The variational quantum eigen solver (VQE), has been widely used to find the ground state energy of different Hamiltonians with no analytical solutions and are classically difficult to compute. In our work, we have used VQE to identify the phase transition boundary for an infinite order phase transition. We use long-range XXZ (LRXXZ) chain for our study. In order to probe infinite order phase transition, we propose to utilise the ground state energy obtained from VQE. The idea rests on the argument that VQE requires an ansatz circuit; therefore, the accuracy of the VQE will rely on this ansatz circuit. We have designed this circuit such that the estimated ground state energy is sensitive to the phase it is evaluated in. It is achieved by applying the constraint that the net spin remains constant throughout the optimisation process. Consequently, the ansatz works in a certain phase where it gives relatively small random error, as it should, when compared to the error in ground state energy calculations of the other phases, where the ansatz fails. By identifying these changes in the behaviour of the error in ground state energy using VQE, we were able to determine the phase boundaries. Using exact diagonalisation, we also compare the behaviour of the energy gradient and energy gap across both the phase transition boundaries for this model. Further, by increasing the depth of the optimisation circuit, we also accurately evaluate the ground energy of the LRXXZ chain for the value of coupling constant, J equal to -1</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Four decades after Richard Feynman's famous remark, we have reached a stage at which nature can be simulated quantum mechanically. Quantum simulation is among the most promising applications of quantum computing. However, like many quantum algorithms, it is severely constrained by noise in near-term hardware. Quantum-inspired algorithms provide an attractive alternative by avoiding the need for error-prone quantum devices. In this study, we demonstrate that the coherent Ising machine and simulated bifurcation algorithms can accurately reproduce the electronic energy profiles of H_2 and H_2O, capturing their essential energetic features. Notably, we obtain computational times of 1.2 s and 2.4 s for the H_2 and H_2O profiles, respectively, representing a substantial speed-up compared to gate-based quantum computing approaches, which typically require at least 6 s to compute a single molecular geometry with comparable accuracy. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired approaches for scaling to larger molecular systems and for future applications in chemistry and materials science.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how different reservoir memory profiles influence the dynamical evolution of a single waveguide coupled to an external environment. We compare three representative memory kernels: Lorentzian, Gaussian and Uniform, highlighting their distinct spatial correlations and their impact on system behavior. We compute the transmission amplitude, transparency properties, as well as long-time behavior of the system under each memory model. To quantify deviations from Markovian dynamics, we employ a non-Markovianity measure based on information backflow, allowing a direct comparison between the structured reservoirs and the Markovian limit. Our results reveal clear signatures of memoryless-induced modifications in the transmission spectrum and demonstrate how specific reservoir profiles enhance or suppress non-Markovian effects.</description>

      <title>Slow growth of quantum magic in disorder-free Stark many-body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disorder-free quantum many-body localization can strongly suppress transport while still enabling the dynamical buildup of computationally costly non-Clifford resources. In a tilted transverse-field Ising chain realizing disorder-free Stark many-body localization, we use the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy to quantify quantum magic (nonstabilizerness) and find that it remains finite and grows anomalously slowly over extended time windows before saturating to a size-dependent plateau deep in the strong-tilt regime, with pronounced initial-state selectivity. Upon increasing the Stark gradient, the long-time magic and half-chain entanglement exhibit consistent finite-size crossing behavior, indicating a crossover from ergodic dynamics to constrained localization. These results establish stabilizer-based magic as a practical complexity diagnostic of disorder-free ergodicity breaking and constrained dynamics, and provide an experimentally accessible route to benchmarking and designing near-term quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: Through their ability to achieve cryogenic levels of noise performance while operating at room temperature, optically-pumped, solid-state (OPSS) masers show great promise as quantum sensors, oscillators, and amplifiers. We here demonstrate maser oscillation in a microwave cavity containing a crystal of pentacene-doped para-terphenyl (ptc:ptp) pumped by a single, chip-scale LED. Here, unlike previous work, the size of the pump source does not dominate the size of the maser system as a whole. This miniaturization is achieved through invasive optical pumping in the form of a waveguide, the tip of which is embedded into the maser crystal. Using experimental measurements combined with microwave and optical simulations, we find that our approach offers at least a factor-of-2 enhancement in cooperativity over end-on optical excitation. We use our simulations to define a figure of merit for maser pumping efficiency, and conclude that there remains significant headroom to improve the performance of ptc:ptp masers through improved optical design.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Distributed Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Large-Scale MaxCut Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MaxCut is a canonical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem in graph theory with broad applications ranging from physics to bioinformatics. Although variational quantum algorithms offer promising new approaches that may eventually outperform classical schemes, they suffer from resource constraints and trainability issues such as barren plateaus, making large-scale instances intractable on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. In this paper, we propose an enhanced distributed variational quantum eigensolver for large-scale MaxCut problems, which extends our prior distributed variational quantum eigensolver framework by integrating a novel hybrid classical-quantum perturbation strategy, enhances optimization scalability and efficiency. Our algorithm solves weighted MaxCut instances with up to 1000 vertices using only 10 qubits, and numerical results indicate that it consistently outperforms the Goemans-Williamson algorithm. We further employ a warm-start initialization strategy, seeding the algorithm with high-quality solutions from the Goemans-Williamson algorithm, with results confirming that the optimal classical solution can be effectively further improved. The practical utility of the proposed algorithm is further validated through its application to haplotype phasing on genome sequencing data of the human ABCA1 gene, producing high-quality haplotypes that rival those obtained by the Goemans-Williamson algorithm with $10^6$ projections. These results establish the proposed algorithm as a scalable, NISQ-compatible framework for near-term quantum-enhanced large-scale combinatorial optimization.</description>

Abstract: Solving interacting multi-particle systems is a central challenge in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the computation of ground states and ground-state energies for the He-H+ and H2O molecules using quantum computing techniques. We employ the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), implemented both on a quantum computer simulator and on an IBM quantum device. The resulting energies are benchmarked against exact ground-state energies obtained via classical methods. Simulations of the H2O molecule were performed on Nottingham's High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We attempt the use of a unitary operator to approximate the lattice Boltzmann collision operator. We use a modified amplitude encoding to bypass the renormalization that would have required classical processing at every step (thus eroding any quantum advantage to be had). We describe the hard-wiring of the lattice Boltzmann symmetries into the quantum circuit and show that, for the specific case of the cavity flow, approximating the nonlinear system is limited to low velocities. These findings may help us understand better the possibilities of nonlinear simulations on a quantum computer, and also pave the way for a discussion on how quantum machine learning might be harnessed to address more complex problems.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase of exceptional point as quantum resonance in complex scaling method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian operators and exceptional points (EPs) are now routinely realized in few-mode systems such as optical resonators and superconducting qubits. However, their foundations in genuine scattering problems with unbounded Hamiltonians remain much less clear. In this work, we address how the geometric phase associated with encircling an EP should be formulated when the underlying eigenstates are quantum resonances within a one-dimensional scattering model. To do this, we employ the complex scaling method, where resonance poles of the S-matrix are realized as discrete eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian dilated Hamiltonian, to construct situations in which resonant and scattering states coalesce into an EP in the complex energy plane, that is, the resonance pole is embedded into the continuum spectrum. We analyze the self-orthogonality in the vicinity of an EP, the Berry phase, and the Chern characteristic. Our results provide a bridge between non-Hermitian spectral theory and the traditional theory of quantum resonances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We delineate the scope of research on the completeness of eigenstates in quantum mechanics. Based on the limit of the potential function at infinity, the proof of completeness is divided into eight cases, and theoretical proofs or numerical simulations are provided for each case. We present the definition of orthonormalization for general free states and the solution to the normalization coefficients, as well as a general set of initial states, which simplifies and concretizes the proof of completeness. Additionally, we define the spectral function for continuous energy eigenvalues. By taking the spectral function as the original integral variable of the expansion function, the relationship between the measured probability amplitude and the expansion function is endowed with the physical meaning of coordinate-momentum transformation.</description>

      <title>Further Improving the Decoy State Quantum Key Distribution Protocol with Advantage Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the application of classical advantage distillation (CAD) to the decoy-state BB84 protocol. Prior work has shown that CAD can greatly improve maximal distances and noise tolerances of the practical decoy state protocol. However, past work in deriving key-rate bounds for this protocol with CAD have assumed a trivial bound on the quantum entropy, whenever Alice sends a vacuum state in a CAD block (i.e., the entropy of such blocks is taken to be zero). Since such rounds contribute, negatively, to the error correction leakage, this results in a correct, though sub-optimal bound. Here, we derive a new proof of security for CAD applied to the decoy state BB84 protocol, computing a bound on Eve's uncertainty in all possible single and vacuum photon events. We use this to derive a new asymptotic key-rate bound which, we show, outperforms prior work, allowing for increased distances and noise tolerances.</description>

      <title>Trading symmetry for Hilbert-space dimension in Bell-inequality violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum information, asymmetry, i.e., the lack of symmetry, is a resource allowing one to accomplish certain tasks that are otherwise impossible. Similarly, in a Bell test using any given Bell inequality, the maximum violation achievable using quantum strategies respecting or disregarding a certain symmetry can be different. In this work, we focus on the symmetry involved in the exchange of parties and explore when we have to trade this symmetry for a lower-dimensional quantum strategy in achieving the maximal violation of given Bell inequalities. For the family of symmetric Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu inequalities, we provide evidence showing that there is no such trade-off. However, for several other Bell inequalities with a small number of dichotomic measurement settings, we show that symmetric quantum strategies in the minimal Hilbert space dimension can only lead to a suboptimal Bell violation. In other words, there exist symmetric Bell inequalities that can only be maximally violated by asymmetric quantum strategies of minimal dimension. In contrast, one can also find examples of asymmetric Bell inequalities that are maximally violated by symmetric correlations. The implications of these findings on the geometry of the set of quantum correlations and the possibility of performing self-testing therefrom are briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the physical origin of enhanced charging performance in many-body quantum batteries is a key challenge in quantum thermodynamics. We investigate whether improvements in stored energy and instantaneous charging power arise from genuine quantum correlations or from coherent collective dynamics that are not intrinsically quantum. We compare the time evolution of energetic quantities with a hierarchy of information-theoretic measures probing bipartite, tripartite, and further-partite correlations. Across different battery charger configurations, we find a consistent temporal ordering in which the instantaneous power peaks before the buildup of strong quantum correlations, indicating that peak charging is dominated by coherent transport, while entanglement and scrambling develop at later times. Furthermore, charging protocols based on k local interactions are examined under both unconstrained and norm-constrained (fair) settings, enabling a clear distinction between classical scaling effects and genuine collective enhancements. Increasing the interaction order or the participation number does not automatically translate into higher charging power. Instead, the performance is primarily dictated by how many particles actually become mutually correlated and contribute to entanglement. Fully collective interactions provide a genuine advantage because all particles participate coherently, whereas partially extended interaction schemes fail to monotonically increase the number of effectively interacting particles, and therefore do not guarantee improved charging efficiency.</description>

      <title>SQL2Circuits: Estimating Cardinalities, Execution Times, and Costs for SQL Queries with Quantum Natural Language Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing have led to progress in exploring quantum applications across diverse fields, including databases and data management. This work presents a quantum machine learning model that tackles the challenge of estimating metrics, such as cardinalities, execution times, and costs, for SQL queries in relational databases. Precise estimations are crucial for the query optimizer to optimize query processing in relational databases efficiently. Our proposed quantum machine learning model consists of a novel query encoding mechanism, which maps SQL queries into high-dimensional Hilbert spaces using grammatical representations of the queries. The encoding mechanism translates SQL queries into parameterized quantum circuits, forming the core of the quantum machine learning model. The parameters in this model are tuned using standard quantum machine learning techniques. This encoding was first developed in quantum natural language processing (QNLP), and this work demonstrates its natural application in database optimization. Because the encoding mechanism is mathematically robust, the quantum machine learning model is also explainable, allowing us to draw a one-to-one correspondence between the elements in SQL queries and the model's parameters. The method is also scalable because it consists of multiple circuits, and we train and evaluate the model with hundreds of queries. Compared to previous research, our model achieves high accuracy, supporting the results obtained in the original QNLP research. We extend the previous QNLP work by adding 4-class and 8-class classification tasks and comparing the cardinality estimation results with those from state-of-the-art databases. We theoretically analyze the quantum machine learning model by calculating its expressibility and entangling capabilities.</description>

Abstract: A phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) provides a powerful way to shape laser beams into arbitrary intensity patterns, but at the cost of a hard computational problem of determining an appropriate SLM phase. Here we show that optimal transport methods can generate approximate solutions to this problem that serve as excellent initializations for iterative phase retrieval algorithms, yielding vortex-free solutions with superior accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we show that analogous algorithms can be used to measure the intensity and phase of the input beam incident upon the SLM via phase diversity imaging. These techniques furnish flexible and convenient solutions to the computational challenges of beam shaping with an SLM.</description>

For the tripartite case, a field-theoretical calculation is performed using a six-point function of twist operators at large $c$ limit. At both zero and finite temperature, the field-theoretical results match the holographic results, supporting our holographic conjecture of this new measure.</description>

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.</description>

      <title>More is uncorrelated: Tuning the local correlations of SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard systems via controlled symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold-atom experiments based on alkali-like atoms provide us with a tool to experimentally realize Hubbard models with a large number $N$ of components. The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking. We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles through the \emph{inter-flavor mutual information}, an experimentally accessible quantity that rigorously measures the distance from the closest gaussian state, unveiling features that cannot be accessed by conventional probes of Mottness. We prove that these correlations are fully independent from local entanglement and quantum discord, and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation. We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.</description>

Abstract: We show that proximity to an altermagnet provides an efficient route to engineering non-Hermitian higher-order topological phases. The proximity-induced altermagnetic order gaps the edge states of a topological insulator, thereby driving a transition from a first-order to a second-order topological phase. When combined with nonreciprocal hopping, the system exhibits both the non-Hermitian skin effect and a hybrid skin-topological effect, whereby first-order edge states and second-order corner states accumulate at selected corners of the lattice. We demonstrate that the spectral winding number of the edge states under cylindrical geometry dictates this corner localization and can be reversed by tuning the altermagnetic order. Consequently, both edge and corner states become directionally controllable. Our results establish altermagnets as a versatile platform for realizing and tuning skin-topological phenomena in non-Hermitian higher-order topological systems.</description>
