      <title>Toxic behavior silences online political conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying how individuals react to social influence is crucial for tackling collective political behavior online. While many studies of opinion in public forums focus on social feedback, they often overlook the potential for human interactions to result in self-censorship. Here, we investigate political deliberation in online spaces by exploring the hypothesis that individuals may refrain from expressing minority opinions publicly due to being exposed to toxic behavior. Analyzing conversations under YouTube videos from six prominent US news outlets around the 2020 US presidential elections, we observe patterns of self-censorship signaling the influence of peer toxicity on users' behavior. Using hidden Markov models, we identify a latent state consistent with toxicity-driven silence. Such state is characterized by reduced user activity and a higher likelihood of posting toxic content, indicating an environment where extreme and antisocial behaviors thrive. Our findings offer insights into the intricacies of online political deliberation and emphasize the importance of considering self-censorship dynamics to properly characterize ideological polarization in digital spheres.</description>

      <title>Top-r Influential Community Search in Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community search over bipartite graphs is a fundamental problem, and finding influential communities has attracted significant attention. However, all existing studies have used the minimum weight of vertices as the influence of communities. This leads to an inaccurate assessment of real influence in graphs where there are only a few vertices with low weights. In this paper, we propose a new cohesive subgraph model named ($\alpha$,$\beta$)-influential community that considers the average weight of vertices from two layers on bipartite graphs, thereby providing a more comprehensive reflection of community influence. Based on this community model, we present a recursive algorithm that traverses the entire bipartite graph to find top-$r$ ($\alpha$,$\beta$)-influential communities. To further expedite the search for influential communities, we propose a slim tree structure to reduce the search width and introduce several effective upper bounds to reduce the search depth. Since we have proven that this problem is NP-hard, using exact algorithms to find top-$r$ ($\alpha$,$\beta$)-communities accurately is very time-consuming. Therefore, we propose an approximate algorithm using a greedy approach to find top-$r$ ($\alpha$,$\beta$)-communities as quickly as possible. It only takes $O((n+m)+m\log_{}{n})$ time. Additionally, we introduce a new pruning algorithm to improve the efficiency of the search. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world graphs validate both the effectiveness and the efficiency of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Hyperedge Anomaly Detection with Hypergraph Neural Network</title>

Abstract: Hypergraph is a data structure that enables us to model higher-order associations among data entities. Conventional graph-structured data can represent pairwise relationships only, whereas hypergraph enables us to associate any number of entities, which is essential in many real-life applications. Hypergraph learning algorithms have been well-studied for numerous problem settings, such as node classification, link prediction, etc. However, much less research has been conducted on anomaly detection from hypergraphs. Anomaly detection identifies events that deviate from the usual pattern and can be applied to hypergraphs to detect unusual higher-order associations. In this work, we propose an end-to-end hypergraph neural network-based model for identifying anomalous associations in a hypergraph. Our proposed algorithm operates in an unsupervised manner without requiring any labeled data. Extensive experimentation on several real-life datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our model in detecting anomalous hyperedges.</description>

      <title>Mathematical model of dating apps influence on sexually transmitted diseases spread</title>

Abstract: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a group of pathogens infecting new hosts through sexual interactions. Due to its social and economic burden, multiple models have been proposed to study the spreading of pathogens. In parallel, in the ever-evolving landscape of digital social interactions, the pervasive utilization of dating apps has become a prominent facet of modern society. Despite the surge in popularity and the profound impact on relationship formation, a crucial gap in the literature persists regarding the potential ramifications of dating apps usage on the dynamics of STDs. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a novel mathematical framework - an extended Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemiological model to elucidate the intricate interplay between dating apps engagement and the propagation of STDs. Namely, as dating apps are designed to make users revisit them and have mainly casual sexual interactions with other users, they increase the number of causal partners, which increases the overall spread of STDS. Using extensive simulation, based on real-world data, explore the effect of dating apps adoption and control on the STD spread. We show that an increased adoption of dating apps can result in an STD outbreak if not handled appropriately.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Loop and Clique Coarsening Algorithm for Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11869v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have made remarkable achievements in graph-level tasks. However, most existing works regard graph structures as a form of guidance or bias for enhancing node representations, which focuses on node-central perspectives and lacks explicit representations of edges and structures. One natural question arises as to whether we can leverage a hypernode to represent some structures. Through experimental analysis, we explore the feasibility of this assumption. Based on our findings, we propose an efficient Loop and Clique Coarsening algorithm with linear complexity for Graph Classification (LCC4GC) on GT architecture. Specifically, we build three unique views, original, coarsening, and conversion, to learn a thorough structural representation. We compress loops and cliques via hierarchical heuristic graph coarsening and restrict them with well-designed constraints, which builds the coarsening view to learn high-level interactions between structures. We also introduce line graphs for edge embeddings and switch to edge-central perspective to alleviate the impact of coarsening reduction. Experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the improvements of LCC4GC over 31 baselines from various architectures.</description>

      <title>RAGraph: A General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in interpreting relational data across various domains, yet, they often struggle to generalize to unseen graph data that differs markedly from training instances. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning (RAGraph), which brings external graph data into the general graph foundation model to improve model generalization on unseen scenarios. On the top of our framework is a toy graph vector library that we established, which captures key attributes, such as features and task-specific label information. During inference, the RAGraph adeptly retrieves similar toy graphs based on key similarities in downstream tasks, integrating the retrieved data to enrich the learning context via the message-passing prompting mechanism. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that RAGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning methods in multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification across both dynamic and static datasets. Furthermore, extensive testing confirms that RAGraph consistently maintains high performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting its adaptability, robustness, and broad applicability.</description>
