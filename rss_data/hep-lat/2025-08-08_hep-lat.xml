      <title>Non-perturbative determination of meson masses and low-energy constants in large-$N$ QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide first-principles non-perturbative determinations of the low-lying meson mass spectrum of large-$N$ QCD in the 't Hooft limit $N_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm f}}/N\to 0$, as well as of three low-energy constants appearing in the QCD chiral expansion: the quark condensate $\Sigma$, the pion decay constant $F_\pi$, and the next-to-leading-order coupling $\bar{\ell}_4$. Using the excited state masses in the $\pi$ and $\rho$ channels, we are able to investigate the behavior of their radial Regge trajectories. Concerning QCD low-energy constants, we are able to assess the magnitude of sub-leading corrections in $1/N$ by combining our $N=\infty$ results with previous finite-$N$ determinations. Our calculation exploits large-$N$ twisted volume reduction to efficiently perform numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the large-$N$ lattice discretized theory. We employ several values of $N$ up to $N=841$, 5 values of the lattice spacing, and several values of the quark mass, to achieve controlled continuum and chiral extrapolations.</description>

      <title>Gradient and Hessian-Based Temperature Estimator in Lattice Gauge Theories: A Diagnostic Tool for Stability and Consistency in Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a field configuration-based temperature estimator in lattice gauge theories. It is constructed from the gradient and Hessian of the Euclidean action of the theory. Adapted from geometric formulations of entropy in classical statistical mechanics, this estimator provides a gauge-invariant, non-kinetic diagnostic of thermodynamic consistency in Monte Carlo simulations of lattice gauge theories. We validate the method in compact U(1) lattice gauge theories across one, two, and four dimensions, comparing the estimated temperature to the input temperature. Our results show that the estimator accurately reproduces the input temperature and remains robust across a range of lattice volumes and coupling strengths. The temperature estimator offers a general-purpose diagnostic for lattice field theory simulations, with potential applications to non-Abelian theories, anisotropic lattices, and real-time monitoring in hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic tiling neighborhoods in O(1) time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tilings of the hyperbolic plane are of significant interest among many branches of mathematics, physics and computer science. Yet, their construction remains a non-trivial task. Current approaches primarily use tree-based recursive algorithms, which are fundamentally limited: they do not readily yield the neighborhood graph representing cell adjacencies, which is however required for many applications. We introduce a novel approach that allows to build hyperbolic tilings and their associated graph structure simultaneously, using only combinatoric rules without requiring an explicit coordinate representation. This allows to generate arbitrarily large, exact hyperbolic graphs, with an algorithmic complexity that does not depend on the lattice size. We provide an easy-to-use implementation which substantially outperforms existing methods, hence rendering ultra large-scale numerical simulations on these geometric structures accessible for the scientific community.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the $Nc^1$ scaling in the confined but chirally symmetric phase at high T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is lattice evidence that the QCD matter above the chiral restoration temperature Tch and below the deconfinement temperature Td, called stringy fluid, is characterized by an approximate chiral spin symmetry, which is a symmetry of confinement in QCD with light quarks. The energy density, pressure and entropy density in the stringy fluid scale as Nc^1, which is in contrast to the Nc^0 scaling in the hadron gas and to the Nc^2 scaling in the quark-gluon plasma. Here we clarify the origin of the Nc^1 scaling. We employ a solvable field-theoretical large $N_c$ chirally symmetric and confining model. In vacuum the confining potential induces a spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The mesons are spatially localized states of quarks and antiquarks. Still in the confining regime the system undergoes the chiral restoration phase transition at $T_{ch}$ because of Paili blocking of the quark levels required for the existence of the quark condensate, by the thermal excitation of quarks and antiquarks. The same Paili blocking leads to a delocalization of the color singlet low-spin meson-like states that become infinitely large in the chiral limit. Consequently the stringy fluid represents a very dense medium of the overlapping huge color-singlet low-spin quark-antiquark systems. The Bethe-Salpeter equation that determines the rest-frame excitation energies of the color-singlet quark-antiquark system is Nc-independent both in vacuum and in the medium in the confining regime. The excitation energy of the quark-antiquark color-singlet systems scales as Nc^0, i.e. as meson mass in vacuum. The Nc^1 scaling of the energy density in the stringy fluid is provided by the fluctuations of the color-singlet quark-antiquark systems.</description>

      <title>QCD condensates and $\alpha_s$ from $e^+e^-$ and $\tau$-decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this talk, I review the determinations of the QCD condensates and $\alpha_s$ within the SVZ expansion using the ratio of Laplace sum rule (LSR) and $\tau$-like moments in $e^+e^-\to I=1$ Hadrons and in $\tau\to \nu_\tau+$Hadrons Axial-vector (A) and V-A channels. Some misprints in the original papers [1-3] have been corrected. We found that the value of the gluon condensate agrees with the one $\langle \alpha_s G^2\rangle=(6.35\pm 0.35)\times 10^{-2}$ GeV$^4$ from quarkonia and some other sum rules but less accurate, while the factorization of the four-quark condensate is violated by a factor about 6: $\rho\langle\bar\psi\psi\rangle^2=(5.98\pm 0.64)\times 10^{-4}$ GeV$^6$ which confirms previous findings. Extracting the QCD condensates up to dimension D=20 from $e^+e^-$ and the axial-vector channel of $\tau$-decay, we do not find any exponential growth of their values in the Euclidian region, thus excluding (by duality) any significant effect of the so-called Duality Violation (DV) in the Time-like one. The optimal values of $\alpha_s(M_\tau)$ from $e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons and $\tau$-decays agree each others and lead to the average: $\alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.3128(51)$ [resp.0.3330(57)] $ \longrightarrow \alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1176$ [resp. 0.1201] $(7)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$ for Fixed Order (FO) [resp. Contour improved (CI)] PT series to be compared with the PDG24 average (without Lattice calculations): $ \alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1175(10)$.</description>

      <title>Baryon Number Violation: From Nuclear Matrix Elements to BSM Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Processes that violate baryon number, most notably proton decay and $n\bar n$ transitions, are promising probes of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) needed to understand the lack of antimatter in the Universe. To interpret current and forthcoming experimental limits, theory input from nuclear matrix elements to UV complete models enters. Thus, an interplay of experiment, effective field theory, lattice QCD, and BSM model building is required to develop strategies to accurately extract information from current and future data and maximize the impact and sensitivity of next-generation experiments. Here, we briefly summarize the main results and discussions from the workshop "INT-25-91W: Baryon Number Violation: From Nuclear Matrix Elements to BSM Physics," held at the Institute for Nuclear Theory, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, January 13-17, 2025.</description>
