      <title>Attosecond Rabi Oscillations in High Harmonic Generation Resonantly Driven by Extreme Ultraviolet Laser Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation driven by intense extreme ultraviolet (EUV) fields merges quantum optics and attosecond science, giving rise to an appealing route for the generation of coherent EUV and soft X-ray light for high-resolution imaging and spectroscopies. We theoretically investigate ultrafast resonant dynamics during the interaction of He atoms with strong extreme ultraviolet pulses. At high driving intensities, we identify record fast attosecond Rabi oscillations imprinting observable signatures in the high harmonic spectrum. At field strengths suppressing the Coulomb potential barrier for all the bounded states, we demonstrate the survival of the attosecond two-level dynamics for several Rabi cycles. Consequently, this intense EUV laser-atom interaction reveals a new strong-field scenario where the resonant coupling of two-level bound-bound transitions prevails, contrasting with the dominance of bound-continuum transitions in the conventional strong-field infrared regimes. These findings set an interesting perspective for extreme attosecond nonlinear optics with intense short-wavelength fields.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of a Rydberg impurity in an ideal Bose Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the absorption spectrum of a Rydberg impurity immersed in and interacting with an ideal Bose-Einstein condensate. Here, the impurity-bath interaction can greatly exceed the mean interparticle distance; this discrepancy in length scales challenges the assumptions underlying the universal aspects of impurity atoms in dilute bosonic environments. Our analysis finds three distinct parameter regimes, each characterized by a unique spectral response. In the low-density regime, we find that the Rydberg impurity is dressed by the surrounding bath similarly to the known Bose polaron. Transitioning to intermediate densities, the impurity response, given by sharp quasiparticle peaks, fragments into an intricate pattern bearing the hallmarks of a diverse molecular structure. Finally, at high density, a universal Gaussian response emerges as the statistical nature of the bath dominates its quantum dynamics. We complement this analysis with a study of an ionic impurity, which behaves equivalently. Our exploration offers insights into the interplay between interaction range, density, and many-body behavior in impurity systems.</description>

      <title>Low-energy $S$-wave scattering of $\text{H}+e^-$ by a Lagrange-mesh method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method combining the Lagrange-mesh and the complex Kohn variational methods is developed for computing the $\mathcal{S}$ matrix of a 2$+$1 elastic scattering in the frame of three-body Coulomb systems. Resonance parameters can be obtained from values of the $\mathcal{S}$ matrix at several scattering energies. The method is illustrated with the $S$-wave low-energy scattering of an electron onto hydrogen. The computed phase shifts are at least as accurate as the literature results, and the resonance parameters are more accurate than the best literature results by several orders of magnitude. Both the infinite and finite proton mass cases are considered.</description>
