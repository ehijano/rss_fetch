      <title>Development of a Quantum Blackbody Thermometer toward Primary On-orbit Thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a roadmap to a deployable, intrinsically calibrated thermometer with long-term accuracy of 30 mK, exceeding existing on-orbit resistance-based thermometers. Our quantum blackbody thermometer is based on measuring fluorescence ratios of optically excited rubidium atoms in microfabricated vapor cells. The key advantage of the quantum blackbody thermometer is that long-term stability of the fluorescence ratios is guaranteed by the immutable physical properties (transition strengths) of the rubidium atom. This should be compared against resistance-based thermometers, such as platinum resistance thermometers, which may be calibrated with exceptional accuracy but are susceptible to temporal drift and shifts due to improper handling.</description>

      <title>Three-body scattering area of identical bosons in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the wave function $\phi^{(3)}$ of three identical bosons scattering at zero energy, zero total momentum, and zero orbital angular momentum in two dimensions, interacting via short-range potentials with a finite two-body scattering length $a$. We derive asymptotic expansions of $\phi^{(3)}$ in two regimes: the 111-expansion, where all three pairwise distances are large, and the 21-expansion, where one particle is far from the other two. In the 111-expansion, the leading term grows as $\ln^3(B/a)$ at large hyperradius $B=\sqrt{(s_1^2+s_2^2+s_3^2)/2}$. At order $B^{-2}\ln^{-3}(B/a)$, we identify a three-body parameter $D$ with dimension of length squared, which we term the three-body scattering area. This quantity should be contrasted with the three-body scattering area previously studied for infinite or vanishing two-body scattering length. If the two-body interaction is attractive and supports bound states, $D$ acquires a negative imaginary part, and we derive its relation to the probability amplitudes for the production of two-body bound states in three-body collisions. Under weak modifications of the interaction potentials, we derive the corresponding shift of $D$ in terms of $\phi^{(3)}$ and the changes of the two-body and three-body potentials. We also study the effects of $D$ and $\phi^{(3)}$ on three-body and many-body physics, including the three-body ground-state energy in a large periodic volume, the many-body energy and the three-body correlation function of the dilute two-dimensional Bose gas, and the three-body recombination rates of two-dimensional ultracold atomic Bose gases.</description>

      <title>Painted loading: a toolkit for loading spatially large optical tweezer arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arrays of neutral atoms in optical tweezers are widely used in quantum simulation and computation, and precision frequency metrology. The capabilities of these arrays are enhanced by maximising the number of available sites. Here we increase the spatial extent of a two-dimensional array of strontium-88 atoms by sweeping the frequency of the cooling light to move the atomic reservoir across the array. We load arrays with vertical heights of &gt;100 {\mu}m, exceeding the height of an array loaded from a static reservoir by a factor of &gt;3. We investigate the site-to-site atom number distribution, tweezer lifetime, and temperature, achieving an average temperature across the array of 1.49(3) {\mu}K. By controlling the frequency sweep we show it is possible to control the distribution of atoms across the array, including uniform and non-uniformly loaded arrays, and arrays with selectively loaded regions. We explain our results using a rate equation model which is in good qualitative agreement with the data.</description>

      <title>The 1/3 Geometric Constant: Scale Invariance and the Origin of 'Missing Energy' in 3D Quantum Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08255v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a universal geometric constraint on the detection of kinetic energy release (KER) in three-dimensional quantum fragmentation. By analyzing the dissociation of localized wavepackets, we demonstrate that the $4\pi r^2$ radial volume element acts as a topological filter that inherently masks a significant portion of a system's energy budget, imposing a fundamental peak-to-mean bound of $R_E &lt; 0.5$. We introduce an invariant scaling law, $\alpha = MQ/\zeta$, and prove that the resulting energy detection ratio is scale-invariant across twelve orders of magnitude, bridging attosecond molecular science and nuclear physics. We identify a universal \textbf{``Geometric Zero-Point''} at $R_E \approx 0.33$, which precisely replicates the 7~eV discrepancy in $H_2^+$ fragmentation. Furthermore, we show that the population of excited-state manifolds and the increase in nuclear localization ($\zeta$) provide a definitive geometric mechanism for the \textbf{spectral broadening} observed across atomic and subatomic scales. Remarkably, the spectral morphology derived from our scaling law aligns with the universal 1/3 energy landmark of historical beta decay, while the high-mass limit naturally accounts for the sharpening of alpha spectra. Our results suggest that ``missing energy'' is often a topological artifact of 3D geometry rather than an exclusive signature of undetected particles. This work establishes a universal master curve for energy reconstruction and identifies a \textbf{``detection crisis''} in highly localized systems, where the true interaction energy becomes effectively invisible to peak-centric calorimetry.</description>

      <title>Creation of ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the creation of optically trapped ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules in a mixture of 23Na and 87Rb atoms. With loss spectroscopy and binding energy measurements, we systematically characterize the interspecies p-wave Feshbach resonances near 284 G. Leveraging this understanding, we use magneto-association to form p-wave NaRb Feshbach molecules, producing both pure samples and mixtures of molecules in different angular momentum states. Additionally, we investigate the inelastic loss of these molecules, primarily influenced by atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collisions. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing tunable p-wave interactions in heteronuclear ultracold systems and provide a foundation for exploring non-zero angular momentum molecules.</description>

      <title>Optimization-based hologram design for fine optical tweezer arrays and extension of super-resolution criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning light spots into arbitrary shapes is a fundamental challenge in holography, leading to various applications across diverse fields in science and engineering. However, as the spot interval approaches the wavelength of light, interference effects among the spots become prominent, which complicates the generation of a distortion-free alignment. Herein, we introduce a hologram design method based on the optimisation of a nonlinear cost function using a holographic phase pattern as the optimisation parameter. We confirmed a spot interval of 0.952(1) $\mu$m in a $5 \times 5$ multispot pattern on the focal plane of a high-numerical-aperture (0.75) objective by observing the near-infrared (wavelength: 820 nm) holographic output light from a spatial light modulator device, a result which overcomes the limitation of a few micrometres under similar conditions. Furthermore, the definition of the Rayleigh diffraction limit is refined by considering the separation of spots and the spot interval, thereby concluding the achievement of "super-resolution." The proposed method is expected to advance laser fabrication, scanning laser microscopy, and cold atom physics, among other fields.</description>

      <title>Trapping potentials and quantum gates for microwave-dressed Rydberg atoms on an atom chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms in dc electric fields acquire static dipole moments. When the atoms are close to a surface producing an inhomogeneous electric field, such as by the adsorbates on an atom chip, depending on the sign of the dipole moment of the Rydberg-Stark eigenstate, the atoms may experience a force toward or away from the surface. We show that by applying a bias electric field and coupling a desired Rydberg state by a microwave field of proper frequency to another Rydberg state with opposite sign of the dipole moment, we can create a trapping potential for the atom at a prescribed distance from the surface. Perfectly overlapping trapping potentials for several Rydberg states can also be created by multicomponent microwave fields. A pair of such trapped Rydberg states of an atom can represent a qubit. Finally, we discuss an optimal realization of the SWAP gate between pairs of such atomic Rydberg qubits separated by a large distance but interacting with a common mode of a planar microwave resonator at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Efficient and compact quantum network node based on a parabolic mirror on an optical chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a neutral atom networking node that combines high photon collection efficiency with high atom photon entanglement fidelity in a compact, fiber integrated platform. A parabolic mirror is used both to form the trap and to collect fluorescence from a single rubidium atom, intrinsically mode matching $\sigma$ polarized emitted photons to the fiber and rendering the system largely insensitive to small imperfections or drifts. The core optics consist of millimeter scale components that are pre aligned, rigidly bonded on a monolithic invacuum assembly, and interfaced entirely via optical fibers. With this design, we measure an overall photon collection and detection efficiency of $3.66\%$, from which we infer an overall collection efficiency of $6.6\%$ after the single--mode fiber coupling. We generate atom photon entangled states with a raw Bell state fidelity of 0.93 and an inferred fidelity of 0.98 after correcting for atom readout errors. The same node design has been realized in two independent setups with comparable performance and is compatible with adding high NA objective lenses to create and control atomic arrays at each node. Our results establish a robust, cavity free neutral atom interface that operates near the limit set by the collection optics numerical aperture and provides a practical building block for scalable quantum network nodes and repeaters.</description>
