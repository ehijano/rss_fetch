      <title>Multi-scale analysis of flow over heterogeneous urban enviornments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-scale planar-averaging framework for urban areas is developed which enables efficient computation of coarse-grained quantities. We apply the multi-scale framework to a large-eddy simulation of an idealised heterogeneous urban environment of 512 buildings based on a typical London height distribution. We observe that for this geometry, the characteristic urban lengthscale l \approx 50 m, which is the averaging lengthscale L at which as much variance in the flow is resolved as is unresolved. For L&gt;400 m, the statistics become approximately homogeneous, suggesting that non-building-resolving numerical weather prediction (NWP) models can be applied without modification at resolutions of 400 m and above for the case under consideration. We derive the multi-scale plane- and Reynolds-averaged momentum equation and show that for neutral cases, NWP models require parameterisation of the distributed drag and the unresolved turbulence and dispersive stress.We show that the universal drag parameterisation from Sutzl et al. 2020 (Bound-Layer Meteorol.178:225-248) holds reasonably well for resolutions L above 200 m. Below this value the problem becomes inhomogeneous and the parameterisation works less well. The unresolved stresses are well represented by a k-w closure with a value of w=0.4/s. However, an even more accurate closure can be derived from the Sutzl drag parameterisation that does not require further turbulence information.</description>

      <title>A simulation modeling framework for fluid motion and transport in a rocking bioreactor with application to cultivated meat production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rocking or wave-mixed bioreactors have emerged as a promising innovation in the production of cultivated meat due to their disposable nature, low operating costs, and scalability. However, despite these advantages, the performance of rocking bioreactors is not well characterized in view of their relatively short history in the market and the wide range of geometrical and operating parameters. In the present study we develop a rigorous computational framework for this multiphase, multi-physics system to quantitatively evaluate mixing, oxygen transfer, and shear stress within a rectangular rocking bioreactor under various operating conditions. This framework is implemented using the Basilisk open-source platform. We use a second-order finite volume Navier-Stokes solver and a volume-of-fluid interface reconstruction scheme to accurately resolve the highly nonlinear fluid motion. By solving the advection-diffusion equation for a multi-fluid system, we examine mixing time and the oxygen mass transfer coefficient for different operating conditions, both of which show a strong relationship with steady streaming underlying the instantaneous laminar flow. We further highlight two critical hydrodynamic phenomena that significantly influence bioreactor performance. Firstly, we investigate the transitional regime from laminar to turbulent flow. Moreover, we identify specific operating conditions that trigger resonance within the bioreactor, enhancing mixing and oxygen transfer. We finally discuss the potential effects of shear stress and energy dissipation rate on cell survival. Our findings are expected to provide valuable insights and guidelines for designing optimized bioreactors to support the next-generation cultivated meat industry pipelines.</description>

      <title>A mass invariant in a compressible turbulent medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the measurable statistical properties of density fluctuations in a supersonic compressible turbulent flow is a major challenge in physics. In 1951, Chandrasekhar derived an invariant under the assumption of the statistical homogeneity and isotropy of the turbulent density field and stationarity of the background density. Recently, Jaupart &amp; Chabrier (2021) extended this invariant to non-isotropic flows in a time-evolving background and showed that it has the dimension of a mass. This invariant $M_{\rm inv}$ is defined by $M_{\rm inv} = \mathbb{E}(\rho)\text{Var}\left(\frac{\rho}{\mathbb{E}(\rho)}\right)(l_{\rm c}^\rho)^3$ where $\rho$ is the density field and $l_{\rm c}^\rho$ is the correlation length. In this article, we perform numerical simulations of homogeneous and isotropic compressible turbulence to test the validity of this invariant in a medium subject to isotropic decaying turbulence. We study several input configurations, namely different Mach numbers, injection lengths of turbulence and equations of state. We confirm that $M_{\rm inv}$ remains constant during the decaying phase of turbulence. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical model of the density field statistics which predicts without any free parameter the evolution of the correlation length with the variance of the logdensity field beyond the assumption of the gaussian field for the logdensity. Noting that $M_{\rm inv}$ is independent of the Mach number, we show that this invariant can be used to relate the non-gaussian evolution of the logdensity probability distribution function to its variance with no free parameters.</description>

      <title>Thermal-diffusive instabilities in unstretched, planar diffusion flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our recent development of a novel research burner has made it possible to experimentally investigate truly unstretched and planar diffusion flames. Hence it has become feasible to directly validate theoretical models for thermal-diffusive instabilities in idealized one-dimensional diffusion flames by experiment. In this paper, the instabilities observed close to the lean extinction limit have been mapped as a function of the Lewis numbers of both reactants. Cellular and pulsating instabilities are identified in parameter regions corresponding qualitatively to theoretical predictions. A detailed investigation of these two types of instabilities reveals the dependence of the cell size and pulsation frequency of unstable flames on the transport properties of the reactants and on flow conditions. While the experimental scaling of the cell size is found in good agreement with theoretical models, the comparison with theory remains inconclusive for the scaling of the pulsation frequency. An experimental correlation for the pulsation frequency in terms of flow parameters, transport properties, in particular the Damkoohler number, and oscillation amplitude has been developed and awaits theoretical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in a vertical channel. Part 3. Bifurcations of many (additional) unstable equilibria and periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical thermal convection system exhibits weak turbulence and spatio-temporally chaotic behavior. In this system, we report seven equilibria and 26 periodic orbits, all new and linearly unstable. These orbits, together with four previously studied in Zheng et al. (2024) bring the number of periodic orbit branches computed so far to 30, all solutions to the fully non-linear three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. These new invariant solutions capture intricate flow patterns including straight, oblique, wavy, skewed and distorted convection rolls, as well as bursts and defects in rolls. Most of the solution branches show rich spatial and/or spatio-temporal symmetries. The bifurcation-theoretic organisation of these solutions are discussed; the bifurcation scenarios include Hopf, pitchfork, saddle-node, period-doubling, period-halving, global homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations, as well as isolas. Given this large number of unstable orbits, our results may pave the way to quantitatively describing transitional fluid turbulence using periodic orbit theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the model Salinas and discuss its results in modeling corner-turning behavior, including failure and the formation of dead zones. Salinas is a recent reactive-flow model for detonation in insensitive high explosives, inspired by JWL++ models but informed by a range of other models suited for corner turning. The model is computationally efficient and has a minimum of free parameters.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous vortex crystal formation in classical rotating flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex crystals, ordered structures observed in superconductors and rotating superfluids, have also been hypothesized to form in classical fluids, based on numerical simulations and observations of the Jovian polar atmospheres. We perform direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations in rotating frames, to investigate the spontaneous emergence of metastable vortex crystals. We analyze the energy spectrum, vortex morphology, and spatio-temporal dynamics to understand their roles in crystal formation and evolution. In addition, we explore domains with varying aspect ratios to examine their impact on the vortex lattice. Our results indicate a relationship between the crystal lifespan and dissipation, and we propose a scaling law linking the rotation rate, domain geometry, and vortex lattice periodicity. Finally, we identify a critical threshold in the control parameter, the Rossby number, suggesting a behavior similar to that found in phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Statistics of velocity gradient and vortex sheet structures in polymeric turbulent von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n swirling flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigations into the effects of polymers on small-scale statistics and flow patterns were conducted in a turbulent von Karman swirling (VKS) flow. We employed the tomographic particle image velocimetry (Tomo-PIV) technique to obtain full information on three-dimensional velocity data, allowing us to effectively resolve dissipation scales. Under varying Reynolds numbers ($R_\lambda=168 - 235$) and polymer concentrations ($\phi=0 -25~\rm ppm$), we measured the velocity gradient tensor (VGT) and related quantities. Our findings reveal that the ensemble average and probability density function (PDF) of VGT invariants, which represent turbulent dissipation and enstrophy along with their generation terms, are suppressed as polymer concentration increases. Notably, the joint PDFs of the invariants of VGT, which characterize local flow patterns, exhibited significant changes. Specifically, the third-order invariants, especially the local vortex stretching, are greatly suppressed, and strong events of dissipation and enstrophy coexist in space. The local flow pattern tends to be two-dimensional, where the eigenvalues of the rate-of-strain tensor satisfy a ratio $1:0:-1$, and the vorticity aligns with the intermediate eigenvector of the rate-of-strain tensor while is perpendicular to the other two. We find that these statistics observations can be well described by the vortex sheet model. Moreover, we find that these vortex sheet structures align with the symmetry axis of the VKS system and orient randomly in the horizontal plane. Further investigation, including flow visualization and conditional statistics on vorticity, confirms the presence of vortex sheet structures in turbulent flows with polymer additions. Our results establish a link between single-point statistics and small-scale flow topology, shedding light on the previously overlooked small-scale structures in polymeric turbulence.</description>

      <title>Dissolution-driven transport in a rotating horizontal cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissolution, in particular, coupled with convection, can be of great relevance in the fields of pharmaceuticals, food science, chemical engineering, and environmental science, having applications in drug release into the bloodstream, ingredient dissolution in liquids, metal extraction from ores, and pollutant dispersion in water. We study the combined effects of natural convection and rotation on the dissolution of a solute in a solvent-filled circular cylinder. The density of the fluid increases with the increasing concentration of the dissolved solute, and we model this using the Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation. The underlying moving-boundary problem has been modelled by combining Navier-Stokes equations with the advection-diffusion equation and a Stefan condition for the evolving solute-fluid interface. We use highly resolved numerical simulations to investigate the flow regimes, dissolution rates, and mixing of the dissolved solute for $Sc = 1$, $Ra = [10^5, 10^8]$ and $\Omega = [0, 2.5]$. In the absence of rotation and buoyancy, the distance of the interface from its initial position follows a square root relationship with time ($r_d \propto \sqrt{t}$), which ceases to exist at a later time due to the finite-size effect of the liquid domain. We then explore the rotation parameter, considering a range of rotation frequency -- from smaller to larger, relative to the inverse of the buoyancy-induced timescale -- and Rayleigh number. We show that the area of the dissolved solute varies nonlinearly with time depending on $Ra$ and $\Omega$. The symmetry breaking of the interface is best described in terms of $Ra/\Omega^2$.</description>

      <title>Monte-Carlo based model for the extraction of oil from oil-water mixtures using wetting and surface acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a Monte Carlo (MC) based microscopic model for simulating the extraction of oil from oil-in-water emulsions under the influence of surface acoustic waves (SAWs). The proposed model is a two-dimensional Ising-lattice gas model that employs Kawasaki dynamics to mimic the interactions between oil, water, and air, as well as external forces such as gravity and acoustic stress. By incorporating both acoustic streaming and acoustic radiation pressure, the model captures key experimental observations, including selective oil extraction and droplet motion under SAW excitation. The results highlight the critical role of acoustic radiation pressure in enabling oil film formation and detachment, governed by the balance between capillary and acoustic stresses. The study provides qualitative agreement with experimental findings and offers insights into the essential mechanisms driving acoustowetting-induced phase separation, demonstrating the utility of discrete modeling for complex fluid dynamics problems.</description>

      <title>Residual U-Net for accurate and efficient prediction of hemodynamics in two-dimensional asymmetric stenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents residual U-Net (U-ResNet), a deep learning surrogate model for predicting hemodynamic fields in two-dimensional asymmetric stenotic channels at Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 800. By integrating residual connections with multi-scale feature extraction, U-ResNet achieves exceptional accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. Comprehensive evaluation against U-Net, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator demonstrates U-ResNet's superior performance in capturing sharp hemodynamic gradients and complex flow features. Notably, U-ResNet demonstrates robust generalization to interpolated Reynolds numbers without retraining - a capability rarely achieved in existing models. The model's non-dimensional formulation ensures scalability across vessel sizes and anatomical locations, enhancing its applicability to diverse clinical scenarios. Statistical analysis of prediction errors reveals that U-ResNet maintains substantially narrower error distributions compared to spectral methods, confirming its reliability for critical hemodynamic assessment. These advances position U-ResNet as a promising tool for real-time clinical decision support, treatment planning, and medical device optimization, with future work focusing on extension to three-dimensional geometries and integration with patient-specific data.</description>

      <title>Elongation-Induced Segregation in Periodically Textured Microfluidic Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the motion of elongated microparticles in microfluidic channels at low Reynolds numbers. In channels with smooth walls, asymmetric initial conditions -- including particle orientation and lateral position -- lead to continuous variations in particle trajectories, potentially exhibiting repeated behavior depending on the channel geometry and initial conditions. However, we find that introducing periodically textured walls induces alignment of the particle with the channel centerline within a specific range of texture wavelengths. This occurs as the textured pattern disrupts the uniformity of the flow, creating localized high-velocity nodes that repeatedly guide the particle toward the centerline as it moves downstream. Notably, the characteristic length scale over which this alignment forms reduces with increasing particle elongation and diverges with increasing Reynolds number. Our findings reveal that elongation-induced alignment can be leveraged for microfluidic filtering applications, enabling the efficient separation of microparticles based on their geometric properties. This work opens new avenues for designing microfluidic devices tailored for high-precision particle sorting, with broad implications for biomedical and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Local Thermal Non-Equilibrium Models in Porous Media: A Comparative Study of Conduction Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instantaneous heat transfer between different phases is a common assumption for modeling heat transfer in porous media, known as Local Thermal Equilibrium (LTE). This assumption may not hold in certain technical and environmental applications, especially in systems with large temperature gradients, large differences in thermal properties, or high velocities. Local Thermal Non-Equilibrium (LTNE) models aim to describe heat transfer processes when the LTE assumption may fail. In this work, we compare three continuum-scale models from the pore to the representative elementary volume (REV) scale. Specifically, dual-network and REV-scale models are evaluated against a pore-resolved model, which we perceive as a reference in the absence of experimental results. Different effective models are used to obtain upscaled properties on the REV scale and to compare resulting temperature profiles. The systems investigated are fully saturated, consisting of one fluid and one solid phase. This study focuses on purely conductive systems without significant differences in thermal properties. Results show that LTE holds then for low interfacial resistances. However, for large interfacial resistances, solid and fluid temperatures differ. The REV-scale model with effective parameters obtained by homogenization leads to similar results as the pore-resolved model, whereas the dual-network model shows greater deviation due to its fixed spatial resolution. Among the evaluated effective parameter formulations for the REV-scale model, only the homogenization-based approach captures the LTNE behavior, as it incorporates the interfacial heat transfer coefficient. Convection is relevant for most practical applications, and its impact will be addressed in a follow-up article.</description>

      <title>Radiatively-Cooled Moist Convection under an Idealised Climate Change Scenario: Linear Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to explore the effects of climate change on atmospheric convection and the water cycle, we develop and analyse an extension of the Rainy-B\'enard model, which is itself a moist version of the Rayleigh-B\'enard model of dry convection. Including moisture changes the character of the convection, with condensation providing a source of buoyancy via latent heating. The climate change model is set up by imposing a variable radiative cooling rate, prescribing surface temperature and relative humidity, and imposing a moist-pseudoadiabatic profile at the top boundary (a flux boundary condition). The model is analysed across the climate parameter space by examining diagnostics of the model's basic state, and its stability, with Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) calculations and a linear stability analysis. We use the linear stability results to identify new parameters relevant for this moist convective system, and to understand how the linear instability responds to the climate parameters. In particular, we define the "Rainy number" as a scaled ratio of positive-area CAPE and diffusion parameters. An alternative radiative-based Rainy number also is shown to describe the parameter space, especially for problems relating to changes in flux conditions. The analysis provides a novel theoretical understanding of how the dynamics and scales of moist convection and hence precipitation will change under climate change.</description>

      <title>A data-driven convergence booster for accelerating and stabilizing pseudo time-stepping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel data-driven convergence booster that not only accelerates convergence but also stabilizes solutions in cases where obtaining a steady-state solution is otherwise challenging. The method constructs a reduced-order model (ROM) of the solution residual using intermediate solutions and periodically solves a least-square problem in the low-dimensional ROM subspace. The second-order approximation of the residual and the use of normal equation distinguish this work from similar approaches in the literature from the methodology perspective. From the application perspective, in contrast to prior studies that focus on linear systems or idealized problems, we rigorously assess the method's performance on realistic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications. In addition to reducing the time complexity of point-iterative solvers for linear systems, we demonstrate substantial reductions in the number of pseudo-time steps required for implicit schemes solving the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations. Across a range of two- and three-dimensional flows-including subsonic inviscid and transonic turbulent cases-the method consistently achieves a 3 to 4 times speedup in wall-clock time. Lastly, the proposed method acts as a robust stabilizer, capable of converging to steady solutions in flows that would otherwise exhibit persistent unsteadiness-such as vortex shedding or transonic buffet-without relying on symmetry boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>New concept to measure the Poiseuille coefficient of rarefied gas flow driven by a large pressure drop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Poiseuille coefficient, which relates the mass flow rate through a long capillary to the local pressure gradient, is an important characteristic in designing various technological processes that include vacuum systems as part. This quantity is usually calculated by solving numerically the linearized Boltzmann equation assuming a small pressure gradient and, therefore, the mass flow rate is small too. As a result, to extract accurately this coefficient from experimental measurements, the mass flow rate must remain small. The present paper proposes a novel approach to extract the Poiseuille coefficient from a measurement of mass flow rate driven by a large pressure drop. Under these conditions, the flow rate increases significantly and, hence, the experimental error is reduced. The proposed method will help experimentalists in designing measurement devices to determine the Poiseuille coefficient with a higher accuracy.</description>

      <title>Differential diffusion effects and super-adiabatic local temperature in lean hydrogen-air turbulent flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzed in this paper are three-dimensional Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data obtained from seven statistically planar and one-dimensional, lean complex-chemistry hydrogen-air flames propagating in a box with forced turbulence. The simulation conditions cover a wide range of non-dimensional turbulent combustion characteristics. Specifically, root-mean-square turbulent velocity is varied from 2.2 to 54 laminar flame speeds, integral length scale of turbulence is varied from 0.5 to 2.2 laminar flame thicknesses, Damk\"ohler and Karlovitz number are varied from 0.01 to 0.53 and from 10 to 1315, respectively. Two equivalence ratios, 0.5 and 0.35, are explored. Turbulent burning velocities are evaluated for these seven low Lewis number flames and equidiffusion counterparts to six of them. Moreover, conditioned profiles of temperature, fuel consumption and heat release rates and probabilities of finding superadiabatic temperature are sampled from all seven low Lewis number flames. Analyses of obtained results show that both magnitude of superadiabatic temperature and probability of finding it are decreased with increasing Karlovitz number Ka. However, significant influence of differential diffusion effects on local structure of flame reaction zones and bulk burning velocity is well pronounced in all cases, even at Ka as high as 1315. Therefore, a decrease in magnitude of superadiabatic local temperature with increasing Karlovitz number or even negligible probability of finding such a high temperature at high Ka is not an evidence that differential diffusion effects play a minor role under such conditions. The simulated mitigation of phenomenon of superadiabatic temperature at high Ka is attributed to intensification of turbulent mixing in local flame oxidation zones, rather than weakening differential diffusion effects in local flame reaction zones.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Models for Unpaired Super-resolution in Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity, high-resolution numerical simulations are crucial for studying complex multiscale phenomena in fluid dynamics, such as turbulent flows and ocean waves. However, direct numerical simulations with high-resolution solvers are computationally prohibitive. As an alternative, super-resolution techniques enable the enhancement of low-fidelity, low-resolution simulations. However, traditional super-resolution approaches rely on paired low-fidelity, low-resolution and high-fidelity, high-resolution datasets for training, which are often impossible to acquire in complex flow systems. To address this challenge, we propose a novel two-step approach that eliminates the need for paired datasets. First, we perform unpaired domain translation at the low-resolution level using an Enhanced Denoising Diffusion Implicit Bridge. This process transforms low-fidelity, low-resolution inputs into high-fidelity, low-resolution outputs, and we provide a theoretical analysis to highlight the advantages of this enhanced diffusion-based approach. Second, we employ the cascaded Super-Resolution via Repeated Refinement model to upscale the high-fidelity, low-resolution prediction to the high-resolution result. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across three fluid dynamics problems. Moreover, by incorporating a neural operator to learn system dynamics, our method can be extended to improve evolutionary simulations of low-fidelity, low-resolution data.</description>

      <title>Motion of a rigid sphere penetrating a deep pool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we experimentally examine the behavior of a free-falling rigid sphere penetrating a quiescent liquid pool. Observations of the sphere trajectory in time are made using two orthogonally placed high-speed cameras, yielding the velocity and acceleration vector through repeated differentiation of the time-resolved trajectories.
  The novelty of this study is twofold. On the one hand, a methodology is introduced by which the instantaneous forces acting on the sphere can be derived by tracking the sphere trajectory. To do this, we work in a natural coordinate system aligned with the pathline of the sphere. In particular, the instantaneous lift and drag forces can be separately estimated.
  On the other hand, the results reveal that when decelerating, the sphere experiences a very high drag force compared with steady flow. This is attributed to an upstream shift of the mean boundary-layer separation. The sphere also experiences significant lift force fluctuations, attributed to unsteady and asymmetric wake fluctuations. The trajectories can be reduced to three stages, common in duration for all initial Reynolds numbers and density ratios when expressed in dimensionless time. In addition, the sphere velocity and deceleration magnitude for different initial parameters exhibit a high degree of uniformity when expressed in dimensionless form. This offers prediction capability of how far a sphere penetrates in time and the forces acting on it.</description>

      <title>LESnets (Large-Eddy Simulation nets): Physics-informed neural operator for large-eddy simulation of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acquisition of large datasets for three-dimensional (3D) partial differential equations (PDE) is usually very expensive. Physics-informed neural operator (PINO) eliminates the high costs associated with generation of training datasets, and shows great potential in a variety of partial differential equations. In this work, we employ physics-informed neural operator, encoding the large-eddy simulation (LES) equations directly into the neural operator for simulating three-dimensional incompressible turbulent flows. We develop the LESnets (Large-Eddy Simulation nets) by adding large-eddy simulation equations to two different data-driven models, including Fourier neural operator (FNO) and implicit Fourier neural operator (IFNO) without using label data. Notably, by leveraging only PDE constraints to learn the spatio-temporal dynamics, LESnets models retain the computational efficiency of data-driven approaches while obviating the necessity for data. Meanwhile, using LES equations as PDE constraints makes it possible to efficiently predict complex turbulence at coarse grids. We investigate the performance of the LESnets models with two standard three-dimensional turbulent flows: decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence and temporally evolving turbulent mixing layer. In the numerical experiments, the LESnets models show similar accuracy as compared to traditional large-eddy simulation and data-driven models including FNO and IFNO, and exhibits a robust generalization ability to unseen regime of flow fields. By integrating a single set of flow data, the LESnets models can automatically learn the coefficient of the subgrid scale (SGS) model during the training of the neural operator. Moreover, the well-trained LESnets models are significantly faster than traditional LES, and exhibits comparable computational efficiency to the data-driven FNO and IFNO models.</description>

      <title>Rarefied xenon flow in orificed hollow cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A parametric study is conducted to quantify the effect of the keeper electrode geometry on the neutral flow quantities within orificed hollow cathodes, prior to cathode ignition. The keeper impinges directly on the flow out of the cathode orifice and its geometry strongly influences the product between the pressure in the orifice-keeper region and the distance between cathode and keeper, $P_{ko}\cdot D_{ko}$, a key parameter for successful cathode ignition. A representative cathode equipped with a keeper is simulated using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method. The numerical model is first validated with computational results from the literature, and a parametric study is then conducted. Parameters include the cathode pressure-diameter in the range of 1-5 Torr-cm and the following geometric ratios: cathode orifice-to-cathode inner radii in the range of 0.1-0.7, keeper orifice-to-cathode orifice radii in the range of 1-5, and keeper distance-to-cathode-orifice diameter, in the range of 0.5-10. If both keeper and cathode have identical orifice radii, the flow remains subsonic in the cathode orifice-to-keeper region. In most cases, however, the flow becomes underexpanded and supersonic, and the static pressure within the cathode orifice-keeper region is, on average, 4% that of the upstream pressure value. The orifice-keeper region pressure increases with either a decrease in the keeper orifice diameter or an increase in the distance between the cathode orifice plate and the keeper plate, in agreement with literature data. Trends are explained through control-volume-based conservation laws. The ratio of ignition-to-nominal mass flow rates is found to be in the range of 9-120, with a most probable value of 40, in agreement with literature data. This suggests that heater-less cathode ignition at a minimum DC voltage may be achieved by increasing the input mass flow rate by a factor of 40.</description>

      <title>Computational Modeling and Analysis of the Coupled Aero Structural Dynamics in Bat Inspired Wings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a novel computational modeling framework to perform high-fidelity direct numerical simulations of aero-structural interactions in bat-inspired membrane wings. The wing of a bat consists of an elastic membrane supported by a highly articulated skeleton, enabling localized control over wing movement and deformation during flight. By modeling these complex deformations, along with realistic wing movements and interactions with the surrounding airflow, we expect to gain new insights into the performance of these unique wings. Our model achieves a high degree of realism by incorporating experimental measurements of the skeleton's joint movements to guide the fluid-structure interaction simulations. The simulations reveal that different segments of the wing undergo distinct aeroelastic deformations, impacting flow dynamics and aerodynamic loads. Specifically, the simulations show significant variations in the effectiveness of the wing in generating lift, drag, and thrust forces across different segments and regions of the wing. We employ a force partitioning method to analyze the causality of pressure loads over the wing, demonstrating that vortex-induced pressure forces are dominant while added mass contributions to aerodynamic loads are minimal. This approach also elucidates the role of various flow structures in shaping pressure distributions. Finally, we compare the fully articulated, flexible bat wing to equivalent stiff wings derived from the same kinematics, demonstrating the critical impact of wing articulation and deformation on aerodynamic efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laboratory experiments and theoretical modelling are conducted to determine the raindrop size distribution (DSD) resulting from distinct fragmentation processes under various upward airstreams. Since weather radar echoes are proportional to the sixth power of the average droplet diameter, understanding the fragmentation mechanisms that lead to different breakup sizes is crucial for accurate rainfall predictions. We utilize a two-parameter gamma distribution for theoretical modelling and estimate the average droplet diameter from the theoretically obtained characteristic sizes, often treated as assumed input parameters for different rain conditions in rainfall modelling. Our experimental and theoretical findings demonstrate a close agreement with the DSD predicted by the Marshall and Palmer relationship for steady rain conditions. Additionally, in situ DSD measurements at different altitudes were obtained through research flights equipped with advanced sensors, further validating our rainfall model. This study underscores the effectiveness of laboratory-scale experiments and the critical importance of accurately characterizing DSD to enhance rainfall predictions.</description>

      <title>REMIX SPH -- improving mixing in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations using a generalised, material-independent approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present REMIX, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme designed to alleviate effects that typically suppress mixing and instability growth at density discontinuities in SPH simulations. We approach this problem by directly targeting sources of kernel smoothing error and discretisation error, resulting in a generalised, material-independent formulation that improves the treatment both of discontinuities within a single material, for example in an ideal gas, and of interfaces between dissimilar materials. This approach also leads to improvements in capturing wider hydrodynamic behaviour unrelated to mixing. We demonstrate marked improvements in three-dimensional test scenarios, focusing on cases with particles of equal mass across the simulation. This choice is particularly relevant for use cases in astrophysics and engineering -- specifically those in which particles are free to evolve over a large range of density scales -- where bespoke choices of unequal particle masses in the initial conditions cannot easily be used to address emergent and evolving density discontinuities. We achieve these improvements while maintaining sharp discontinuities; without introducing additional equation of state dependence in, for example, particle volume elements; and without contrived or targeted corrections. Our methods build upon a fully compressible and thermodynamically consistent core-SPH construction, retaining Galilean invariance as well as conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. REMIX is integrated in the open-source, state-of-the-art SWIFT code and is designed with computational efficiency also in mind, meaning that its improved hydrodynamic treatment can be used for high-resolution simulations without prohibitive cost to run-speed.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned FEM-based Neural Networks for Solving Incompressible Fluid Flows and Related Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The numerical simulation and optimization of technical systems described by partial differential equations is expensive, especially in multi-query scenarios in which the underlying equations have to be solved for different parameters. A comparatively new approach in this context is to combine the good approximation properties of neural networks (for parameter dependence) with the classical finite element method (for discretization). However, instead of considering the solution mapping of the PDE from the parameter space into the FEM-discretized solution space as a purely data-driven regression problem, so-called physically informed regression problems have proven to be useful. In these, the equation residual is minimized during the training of the neural network, i.e., the neural network "learns" the physics underlying the problem. In this paper, we extend this approach to saddle-point and non-linear fluid dynamics problems, respectively, namely stationary Stokes and stationary Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, we propose a modification of the existing approach: Instead of minimizing the plain vanilla equation residual during training, we minimize the equation residual modified by a preconditioner. By analogy with the linear case, this also improves the condition in the present non-linear case. Our numerical examples demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces the training effort and greatly increases accuracy and generalizability. Finally, we show the application of the resulting parameterized model to a related inverse problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Waves propagating through weakly disordered smooth linear media undergo a universal phenomenon called branched flow. Branched flow has been observed and studied experimentally in various systems by considering coherent waves. Recent experiments have reported the observation of optical branched flow by using an incoherent light source, thus revealing the key role of coherent phase-sensitive effects in the development of incoherent branched flow. By considering the paraxial wave equation as a generic representative model, we elaborate a stochastic theory of both coherent and incoherent branched flow. We derive closed-form equations that determine the evolution of the intensity correlation function, as well as the value and the propagation distance of the maximum of the scintillation index, which characterize the dynamical formation of incoherent branched flow. We report accurate numerical simulations that are found in quantitative agreement with the theory without free parameters. Our theory highlights the important impact of coherence and interference on branched flow, thereby providing a framework for exploring branched flow in nonlinear media, in relation with the formation of freak waves in oceans.</description>
