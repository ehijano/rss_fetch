      <title>Dielectric permittivity of electron plasma with laser beat waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the kinetic method, the process of interaction of a rarefied electron plasma with laser beat waves is investigated taking into account the initial spread in the velocities of plasma particles. Using the expression for the spectral distribution function of plasma particles in the presence of laser beat waves, an anisotropic tensor of the plasma dielectric permittivity is obtained. In this case, an expression for the nonequilibrium current density induced by the perturbed field and the constitutive equation connecting the conductivity tensor with the dielectric permittivity are determined. Assuming that in equilibrium the particle distribution function has the form of the Maxwellian distribution function, the dielectric tensor is diagonalized. Analytical expressions are obtained for the longitudinal and transverse components of the dielectric permittivity.</description>

      <title>Modelling of warm dense hydrogen via explicit real time electron dynamics: Dynamic structure factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two methods for computing the dynamic structure factor for warm dense hydrogen without invoking either the Born-Oppenheimer approximation or the Chihara decomposition, by employing a wave packet description which resolves the electron dynamics during ion evolution. Firstly, a semiclassical method is discussed which is corrected based on known quantum constraints, and secondly, a direct computation of the density-density response function within the molecular dynamics. The wave packet models are compared to PIMC and DFT-MD for the static and low-frequency behaviour. For the high-frequency behaviour the models recover the expected behaviour in the limits of small and large momentum transfers and show the characteristic flattening of the plasmon dispersion for intermediate momentum transfers due to interactions, in agreement with commonly used models for X-ray Thomson scattering. By modelling the electrons and ions on an equal footing, both the ion and free electron part of the spectrum can now be treated within a single framework where we simultaneously resolve the ion-acoustic and plasmon mode, with a self-consistent description of collisions and screening.</description>

      <title>On the quadruple Beltrami fields in thermally relativistic electron-positron-ion plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thermally relativistic electron-positron-ion (EPI) plasma self-organizes into a quadruple Beltrami (QB) field. The QB field, which is the combination of four Beltrami fields, is described by four scale parameters. These scale parameters are often either real or both real and complex in nature. The values of the scale parameters are determined by Beltrami parameters, relativistic temperatures, and the densities of plasma species. It is demonstrated that all the scale parameters become real at higher relativistic temperatures and ion densities, which naturally lead to paramagnetic structures. It is also shown that the scale separation in the QB state provides the possibility of field and flow generation in such thermally relativistic plasmas. The present study may have implications for space, astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.</description>

      <title>Multiscale structures in three species magnetoplasmas with two positive ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-organization in a multi-ion plasma composed of electrons and two species of positively charged ions is investigated. It is shown that when canonical vorticities and velocities of all the plasma fluids are aligned, the magnetic field self-organizes to Quadruple Beltrami state (superposition of four Beltrami fields). The self-organized magnetic and velocity fields strongly depend on the relative strengths of the generalized vorticities, flows, inertia and densities of the plasma species. Thus, it is possible to generate a wide variety of multiscale magnetic field and flow structures. It is also shown that relaxed magnetic fields and velocities can vary on vastly different length scales simultaneously and are coupled together through singular perturbation generated by Hall effect. In this multi Beltrami self-organized states, then, the dynamo mechanism emerges naturally. The scale separation also suggests the heating of the plasma through a dissipative process. The work could be useful to study the dynamics and morphology of the multiscale magnetic field configurations in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline a method of beamed power for propulsion that utilizes relativistic electron beams. The physics of charged particle beam propagation in the space plasma environment is discussed and the long-range (&gt;100 A.U.) advantage of relativistic electron beams is emphasized. A preliminary statite based beam emitter for powering probes to ~0.1c is proposed and the challenges in beam-power uses are explored.</description>

      <title>Self-organized multiscale structures in thermally relativistic electron-positron-ion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-organization of a thermally relativistic magnetized plasma comprising of electrons, positrons and static ions is investigated. The self-organized state is found to be the superposition of three distinct Beltrami fields known as triple Beltrami (TB) state. In general, the eigenvalues associated with the multiscale self-organized vortices may be a pair of complex conjugate and real one. It is shown that all the eigenvalues become real when thermal energy increases or the positron density decreases. The impact of relativistic temperature and positron density on the formation of self-organized structures is investigated. The self-organized field and flow vortices may vary simultaneously on vastly different length scales. The disparate variation of self-organized vortices is important in the context of dynamo theory. The present work is useful to study the formation of multiscale vortices and dynamo mechanisms in multi-species thermally relativistic plasmas.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired information entropy in multi-field turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel information entropy of turbulence systems with multiple field quantities is formulated. Inspired by quantum mechanics, the von Neumann entropy (vNE) and the entanglement entropy(EE) are derived from a density matrix for the turbulence state in terms of the multi-field singular value decomposition (MFSVD). Applying the information-theoretic entropy analyses to spatio-temporal dynamics in turbulent plasmas with phase-transition-like behavior, we discover a new nontrivial transition threshold regarding the vNE, which significantly deviates from the transition threshold of the field energy considered in the conventional approaches. These findings provide us with new classifications of the turbulence state in terms of combined energy and information. It is also shown that the EE for nonlinear interactions in turbulence simultaneously describes not only the information for the strength of nonlinear mode couplings but also the direction of net energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of energetic particles scattered in the solar wind: numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propagate relativistic test particles in the field of a steady three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the solar wind. We use the MPI-AMRVAC code for the wind simulations and integrate the relativistic guiding center equations using a new third-order accurate predictor-corrector time integration scheme. Turbulence induced scattering of the particles' trajectory in velocity space is mimicked by a constant magnetic field aligned mean free path $\lambda_\parallel$. We comment the particular case of $81\:{\rm keV}$ electrons injected in the solar wind at 0.139 AU heliocentric distance and $24^{\circ}$ of magnetic latitude. For $\lambda_\parallel =0.5\:{\rm AU}$, the simulated velocity pitch angle distributions are in good qualitative agreement with in situ measurements at 1 AU. More generally, for $\lambda_\parallel$ in the range 0.5 to 3\:AU, a velocity drift associated energy loss rate of the order of $10\%$ per day is observed. The energy loss is attributable to the magnetic curvature and gradient induced poleward drifts of the electrons, against the dominant component of the electric field.</description>
