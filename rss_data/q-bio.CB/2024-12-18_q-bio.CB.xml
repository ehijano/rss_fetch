      <title>A model for the dynamics of COVID-19 infection transmission in human with latent delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, we have derived a mathematical model for within human dynamics of COVID-19 infection using delay differential equations. The new model considers a 'latent period' and 'the time for immune response' as delay parameters, allowing us to study the effects of time delays in human COVID-19 infection. We have determined the equilibrium points and analyzed their stability. The disease-free equilibrium is stable when the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is below unity. Stability switch of the endemic equilibrium occurs through Hopf-bifurcation. This study shows that the effect of latent delay is stabilizing whereas immune response delay has a destabilizing nature.</description>

      <title>Interplay of damage and repair in the control of epithelial tissue integrity in response to cyclic loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epithelial tissues are continuously exposed to cyclic stretch. Physiological stretching has been found to regulate soft tissue function at the molecular, cellular, and tissue scales, allowing tissues to preserve their homeostasis and adapt to challenges. In contrast, dysregulated or pathological stretching can induce damage and tissue fragilisation. Many mechanisms have been described for the repair of epithelial tissues across a range of time-scales. In this review, we present the timescales of (i) physiological cyclic loading regimes, (ii) strain-regulated remodelling and damage accumulation, and (iii) repair mechanisms in epithelial tissues. We discuss how fatigue in biological tissues differs from synthetic materials, in that damage can be partially or fully reversed by repair mechanisms acting on timescales shorter than cyclic loading. We highlight that timescales are critical to understanding the interplay between damage and repair in tissues that experience cyclic loading, opening up new avenues for exploring soft tissue homeostasis.</description>
