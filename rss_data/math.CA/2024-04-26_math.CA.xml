      <title>Bounds on the dimension of lineal extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a union of line segments and $F \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ the set obtained from $E$ by extending each line segment in $E$ to a full line. Keleti's \textit{line segment extension conjecture} posits that the Hausdorff dimension of $F$ should equal that of $E$. Working in $\mathbb{R}^2$, we use effective methods to prove a strong packing dimension variant of this conjecture, from which the generalized Kakeya conjecture for packing dimension immediately follows. This is followed by several doubling estimates in higher dimensions and connections to related problems.</description>

      <title>Confluent functions, Laguerre polynomials and their (generalized) bilinear integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review properties of confluent functions and the closely related Laguerre polynomials, and determine their bilinear integrals. As is well-known, these integrals are convergent only for a limited range of parameters. However, when one uses the generalized integral they can be computed essentially without restricting the parameters. This gives the (generalized) Gram matrix of Laguerre polynomials. If the parameters are not negative integers, then Laguerre polynomials are orthogonal, or at least pseudo-orthogonal in the case of generalized integrals. For negative integer parameters, the orthogonality relations are more complicated.</description>

      <title>Matrix-weighted estimates beyond Calder\'on-Zygmund theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate matrix-weighted bounds for the sublinear non-kernel operators considered by F. Bernicot, D. Frey, and S. Petermichl. We extend their result to sublinear operators acting upon vector-valued functions. First, we dominate these operators by bilinear convex body sparse forms, adapting a recent general principle due to T. Hyt\"onen. Then we use this domination to derive matrix-weighted bounds, adapting arguments of F. Nazarov, S. Petermichl, S. Treil, and A. Volberg. Our requirements on the weight are formulated in terms of two-exponent matrix Muckenhoupt conditions, which surprisingly exhibit a rich structure that is absent in the scalar case. Consequently, we deduce that our matrix-weighted bounds improve the ones that were recently obtained by A. Laukkarinen.
  The methods we use are flexible, which allows us to complement our results with a limited range extrapolation theorem for matrix weights, extending the results of P. Auscher and J. M. Martell, as well as M. Bownik and D. Cruz-Uribe.</description>

      <title>Coloring and density theorems for configurations of a given volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a treatise on finite point configurations spanning a fixed volume to be found in a single color-class of an arbitrary finite (measurable) coloring of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, or in a single large measurable subset $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. More specifically, we study vertex-sets of simplices, rectangular boxes, and parallelotopes, attempting to make progress on several open problems posed in the 1970s and the 1980s. As one of the highlights, we give the negative answer to a question of Erd\H{o}s and Graham, by coloring the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ in $25$ colors without creating monochromatic rectangles of unit area. More generally, we construct a finite coloring of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that no color-class contains the $2^m$ vertices of any (possibly rotated) $m$-dimensional rectangular box of volume $1$. A positive result is still possible if rectangular boxes of merely sufficiently large volumes are sought in a single color-class of a finite measurable coloring of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and we establish it under an additional assumption $n\geq m+1$. Also, motivated by a question of Graham on reasonable bounds in his result on monochromatic axes-aligned right-angled $m$-dimensional simplices, we establish its measurable coloring and density variants with polylogarithmic bounds, again in dimensions $n\geq m+1$. Next, we generalize a result of Erd\H{o}s and Mauldin, by constructing an infinite measure set $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ such that every $n$-parallelotope with vertices in $A$ has volume strictly smaller than $1$. Finally, some results complementing the literature on isometric embeddings of hypercube graphs and on the hyperbolic analogue of the Hadwiger--Nelson problem also follow as byproducts of our approaches.</description>

      <title>Euler-Maruyama approximation for stochastic fractional neutral integro-differential equations with weakly singular kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript examines the problem of nonlinear stochastic fractional neutral integro-differential equations with weakly singular kernels. Our focus is on obtaining precise estimates to cover all possible cases of Abel-type singular kernels. Initially, we establish the existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on the initial value of the true solution, assuming a local Lipschitz condition and linear growth condition. Additionally, we develop the Euler-Maruyama method for the numerical solution of the equation and prove its strong convergence under the same conditions as the well-posedness. Moreover, we determine the accurate convergence rate of this method under global Lipschitz conditions and linear growth conditions.</description>
