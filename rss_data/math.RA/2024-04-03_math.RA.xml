      <title>From the Albert algebra to Kac's ten-dimensional Jordan superalgebra via tensor categories in characteristic 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kac's ten-dimensional simple Jordan superalgebra over a field of characteristic 5 is obtained from a process of semisimplification, via tensor categories, from the exceptional simple Jordan algebra (or Albert algebra), together with a suitable order 5 automorphism. This explains McCrimmon's 'bizarre result' asserting that, in characteristic 5, Kac's superalgebra is a sort of 'degree 3 Jordan superalgebra'. As an outcome, the exceptional simple Lie superalgebra el(5;5), specific of characteristic 5, is obtained from the simple Lie algebra of type $E_8$ and an order 5 automorphism. In the process, precise recipes to obtain superalgebras from algebras in the category of representations of the cyclic group $C_p$, over a field of characteristic $p&gt;2$, are given.</description>

      <title>On the rings whose injective right modules are max-projective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the rings whose injective right modules are R-projective (respectively, max-projective) were investigated and studied in [2]. Such ring are called right almost-QF (respectively, max-QF). In this paper, our aim is to give some further characterization of these rings over more general classes of rings, and address several questions about these rings. We obtain characterizations of max-QF rings over several classes of rings including local, semilocal right semihereditary, right nonsingular right noetherian and right nonsingular right finite dimensional rings. We prove that for a ring R being right almost-QF and right max-QF are not left-right symmetric. We also show that right almost-QF and right max-QF rings are not closed under factor rings. This leads to consider the rings all of whose factor rings are almost-QF and max-QF.</description>

      <title>Depolarization and distributive laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a vector space with two multiplications, one commutative the other anticommutative, possibly connected by a distributive law, the depolarization principle allows to look at this triplet through a single nonassociative multiplication. This is the case of Poisson algebras. We are interested here in the cases of transposed Poisson algebras and we show in this case that depolarization cannot be done with a single multiplication. We also examine the depolarization for Hom-Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>On the Algorithmic Recovering of Coefficients in Linearizable Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of recovering coefficients in scalar nonlinear ordinary differential equations that can be exactly linearized. This contribution builds upon prior work by Lyakhov, Gerdt, and Michels, which focused on obtaining a linearizability certificate through point transformations. Our focus is on quasi-linear equations, specifically those solved for the highest derivative with a rational dependence on the variables involved. Our novel algorithm for coefficient recovery relies on basic operations on Lie algebras, such as computing the derived algebra and the dimension of the symmetry algebra. This algorithmic approach is efficient, although finding the linearization transformation necessitates computing at least one solution of the corresponding Bluman-Kumei equation system.</description>

      <title>Root Graded Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and study root graded groups, that is, groups graded by finite root systems. This notion generalises several existing concepts in the literature, including in particular Jacques Tits' notion of RGD-systems. The most prominent examples of root graded groups are Chevalley groups over commutative associative rings. Our main result is that every root graded group of rank at least 3 is coordinatised by some algebraic structure satisfying a variation of the Chevalley commutator formula. This result can be regarded as a generalisation of Tits' classification of thick irreducible spherical buildings of rank at least 3 to the case of non-division algebraic structures. All coordinatisation results in this book are proven in a characteristic-free way. This is made possible by a new computational method that we call the blueprint technique.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Bernstein-type Polynomials of Finitely Generated D-Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the Gr\"obner basis method for free D-modules to the case of several term orderings induced by a partition of the set of basic variables. Using this generalized Gr\"obner basis technique we prove the existence and give a method of computation of a dimension polynomial in several variables associated with a finitely generated D-module. We show that this dimension polynomial carries more invariants of a D-module than the classical (univariate) Bernstein polynomial. We also show that the introduced multivariate dimension polynomial can be used for characterization of holonomic D-modules.</description>

      <title>Topology and monoid representations I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to use topological methods to compute $\mathrm{Ext}$ between an irreducible representation of a finite monoid inflated from its group completion and one inflated from its group of units, or more generally coinduced from a maximal subgroup, via a spectral sequence that collapses on the $E_2$-page over fields of good characteristic.
  As an application, we determine the global dimension of the algebra of the monoid of all affine transformations of a vector space over a finite field. We provide a topological characterization of when a monoid homomorphism induces a homological epimorphism of monoid algebras and apply it to semidirect products. Topology is used to construct projective resolutions of modules inflated from the group completion for sufficiently nice monoids. A sequel paper will use these results to study the representation theory Hsiao's monoid of ordered $G$-partitions (connected to the Mantaci-Reutenauer descent algebra for the wreath product $G\wr S_n$).</description>
