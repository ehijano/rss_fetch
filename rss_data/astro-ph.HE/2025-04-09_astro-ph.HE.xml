      <title>The slowest spinning Galactic-field spider PSR J1932+2121: A history of inefficient mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope is discovering hundreds of new pulsars, including a slowly spinning compact binary millisecond pulsar (spin period $P_{\rm spin}=14.2$ ms) which showed radio eclipses and evidence of ablation of its companion: PSR J1932+2121. Its orbital period is $P_{\rm orb}=0.08$ d and the minimum companion mass is estimated as 0.12 $M_{\odot}$. Hence, this pulsar is classified as part of the Galactic-field spider (redback) population. However, it spins almost an order of magnitude slower than other Galactic-field spiders. Using detailed evolutionary calculations with MESA, we model the formation, mass-transfer and radio-pulsar phases, in order to explain the observed properties of PSR J1932+2121. We find that PSR J1932+2121 is a redback that has experienced an inefficient mass-transfer phase resulting in a lower accretion efficiency (in the range of 0.3 to 0.5) and subsequently slower spin compared to other spiders. We narrow down the initial range of $P_{\rm orb}$ that best reproduces its properties, to 2.0 to 2.6\,d. Current models of accretion-induced magnetic field decay are not able to explain its unusually high surface magnetic field of $2\times 10^{9}$ G. Hence, PSR J1932+2121 provides a unique opportunity to study inefficient accretion-induced spin up and surface magnetic field decay of pulsars.</description>

      <title>A persistent disk wind and variable jet outflow in the neutron-star low-mass X-ray binary GX 13+1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), accretion flows are often associated with either jet outflows or disk winds. Studies of LMXBs with luminosities up to roughly 20% of the Eddington limit indicate that these outflows generally do not co-occur, suggesting that disk winds might inhibit jets. However, previous observations of LMXBs accreting near or above the Eddington limit show that jets and winds can potentially coexist. To investigate this phenomenon, we carried out a comprehensive multi-wavelength campaign (using VLA, Chandra/HETG, and NICER) on the near-Eddington neutron-star Z source LMXB GX 13+1. NICER and Chandra/HETG observations tracked GX 13+1 across the entire Z-track during high Eddington rates, detecting substantial resonance absorption features originating from the accretion disk wind in all X-ray spectra, which implies a persistent wind presence. Simultaneous VLA observations captured a variable radio jet, with radio emission notably strong during all flaring branch observations-contrary to typical behavior in Z-sources-and weaker when the source was on the normal branch. Interestingly, no clear correlation was found between the radio emission and the wind features. Analysis of VLA radio light curves and simultaneous Chandra/HETG spectra demonstrates that an ionized disk wind and jet outflow can indeed coexist in GX 13+1, suggesting that their launching mechanisms are not necessarily linked in this system.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Role of Intrinsic Variability in Black Hole Parameter Inference using Multi-Epoch EHT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87* provide a means of constraining parameters of both the black hole and its surrounding plasma. However, intrinsic variability of the emitting material introduces a major source of systematic uncertainty, complicating parameter inference. The precise origin and structure of this variability remain uncertain, and previous studies have largely relied on general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations to estimate its effects. Here, we fit a semi-analytic, dual-cone model of the emitting plasma to multiple years of EHT observations to empirically assess the impact of intrinsic variability and improved array coverage on key measurements including the black hole mass-to-distance ratio, spin, and viewing inclination. Despite substantial differences in the images of the two epochs, we find that the inferred mass-to-distance ratio remains stable and mutually consistent. The black hole spin is unconstrained for both observations, despite the improved baseline coverage in 2018. The inferred position angle and inclination of the black hole spin axis are discrepant between the two years, suggesting that variability and model misspecification contribute significantly to the total error budget for these quantities. Our findings highlight both the promise and challenges of multi-epoch EHT observations: while they can refine parameter constraints, they also reveal the limitations of simple parametric models in capturing the full complexity of the source. Our analysis -- the first to fit semi-analytic emission models to 2018 EHT observations -- underscores the importance of systematic uncertainty quantification from intrinsic variability in future high-resolution imaging studies of black hole environments and the role of repeated observations in quantifying these uncertainties.</description>

      <title>A universal natal spin in stellar-mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stellar mass black hole (BH) is believed to be formed as the result of the core collapse of a massive star at the end of its evolution. For a class of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), it is widely believed that their centre engines are just these stellar-mass BHs, which accrete the collapsing matter in hyper-accretion mode. In such systems, a popular scenario is that the magnetic field supported in the accretion disk extracts the rotational energy of the spinning BH and launch a jet on one hand, and the accretion of the infalling matter of the collapse will increase the BH's rotational energy on the other hand. However, the detailed physical processes of the above scenario are still not well understood. Here we report that when the accretion process is dominated by a Magnetically-Arrested-Disk (MAD), the above mentioned two competing processes link to each other, so that the spin evolution of the BH can be written in a simple form. Most interestingly, when the total accreted mass is enough, the BH spin will always reach to an equilibrium value peaked at $\chi\sim0.88$. This value does not depend on the initial mass and spin of the BH, as well as the history of accretion. This model predicts that there is a population of stellar-mass BH which possess a universal spin at the end of the collapsing accretion. We test this prediction against the 3rd gravitational wave (GW) catalogue (GWTC-3) and found that the distribution of the spin of the secondary BH is centred narrowly around $0.85\pm 0.05$ as predicted. Applying this model to the parameters of observed parameters in GWTC-3 and further GW catalogues, it is possible to infer the initial mass and spin distributions of the binary BHs detected with GW.</description>

      <title>On the evidence of a dark matter density spike around the primary black hole in OJ 287</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central engine of blazar OJ~287 is arguably the most notable supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary candidate that emits nano-Hertz (nHz) gravitational waves. This inference is mainly due to our ability to predict and successfully monitor certain quasi-periodic doubly peaked high brightness flares with a period of $\sim$12 years from this blazer. The use of post-Newtonian accurate SMBH binary orbital description that includes the effects of higher order GW emission turned out to be a crucial ingredient for accurately predicting the epochs of such Bremsstrahlung flares in our SMBH binary central engine description for OJ~287. It was very recently argued that one should include the effects of dynamical friction, induced by certain dark matter density spikes around the primary SMBH, to explain the {\it observed} decay of SMBH binary orbit in OJ~287. Invoking binary pulsar timing-based arguments, measurements, and OJ~287's orbital description, we show that observationally relevant SMBH binary orbital dynamics in OJ~287 are insensitive to dark matter-induced dynamical friction effects. This implies that we could only provide an upper bound on the spike index parameter rather than obtaining an observationally derived value, as argued by \cite{Chan2024}.</description>

      <title>Searching for quasi periodic oscillations in optical and $\gamma$-ray emissions $\&amp;$ black hole mass estimation of blazar ON 246</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of a potential quasi-periodic signal with a period of $\sim2$ years in the blazar ON 246, based on Fermi-LAT ($\gamma$-rays) and ASAS-SN (optical) observations spanning 11.5 years (MJD 55932-60081). We applied various techniques to investigate periodic signatures in the light curves, including the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), and REDFIT. The significance of the signals detected in LSP and WWZ was assessed using two independent approaches: Monte Carlo simulations and red noise modeling. Our analysis revealed a dominant peak in the $\gamma$-ray and optical light curves, with a significance level exceeding 3$\sigma$ in both LSP and WWZ, consistently persisting throughout the observation period. Additionally, the REDFIT analysis confirmed the presence of a quasi-periodic signal at $\sim$0.00134 $day^{-1}$ with a 99% confidence threshold. To explain the observed quasi-periodic variations in $\gamma$-ray and optical emissions, we explored various potential physical mechanisms. Our analysis suggests that the detected periodicity could originate from a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) system or the jet-induced orbital motion within such a system. Based on variability characteristics, we estimated the black hole mass of ON 246. The study suggests that the mass lies within the range of approximately $(0.142 - 8.22) \times 10^9 \ M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>The Ultraviolet Spectra of 2003fg-like Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2003fg-like Type Ia supernovae (03fg-like SNe Ia) are a rare subtype of SNe Ia, photometrically characterized by broader optical light curves and bluer ultraviolet (UV) colors compared to normal SNe Ia. In this work, we study four 03fg-like SNe Ia using Swift UltraViolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) grism observations to understand their unique UV properties and progenitor scenario(s). We report 03fg-like SNe Ia to have similar UV features and elemental compositions as normal SNe Ia, but with higher UV flux relative to optical. Previous studies have suggested that the UV flux levels of normal SNe Ia could be influenced by their progenitor properties, such as metallicity, with metal-poor progenitors producing higher UV flux levels. While 03fg-like SNe were previously reported to occur in low-mass and metal-poor host environments, our analysis indicates that their UV excess cannot be explained by their host-galaxy parameters. Instead, we demonstrate that the addition of a hot blackbody component, likely arising from the interaction with the circumstellar material (CSM), to the normal SN Ia spectrum, can reproduce their distinctive UV excess. This supports the hypothesis that 03fg-like SNe Ia could explode in a CSM-rich environment.</description>

      <title>Optical and X-ray timing analysis of the 2018-2020 outburst and rebrightening of the black-hole transient MAXI J1820+070</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of a comprehensive analysis of the multiwavelength (in optical and X-rays) and multitimescale (from months to tenths of a second) variability of the 2018-2020 outburst of the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070. During the first outburst episode, a detailed analysis of the optical photometry shows a periodicity that evolves over time and stabilises at a frequency of $1.4517(1)$ $1/d$ ($\sim0.5\%$ longer than the orbital period). This super-orbital modulation is also seen in the X-rays for a few days soon after the transition to the high-soft state. We also observed optical Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs), which correspond to some of the QPOs observed in X-rays at three different epochs when the source was in the low-hard state. In two epochs, optical QPOs with a centroid consistent with half the frequency of the most prominent X-ray QPO can be seen. If the lowest modulation frequency is the one observed in the optical, the characteristic precession frequency of MAXI J1820+070 is lower than that inferred from the `fundamental' QPO in the X-rays. Assuming that QPOs can be generated by Lense-Thirring precession, we calculate the spin of the black hole in the case where the fundamental precession frequency is tracked by the optical emission. We find a relatively slowly spinning black hole with a spin parameter $\lesssim 0.15$. The super-orbital optical and X-ray modulations observed after the disappearance of the QPOs may be triggered by the self-irradiation of the outer disc by a standard inner disc truncated at a few gravitational radii.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray transport and acceleration with magnetic mirroring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the transport of cosmic rays (CR) in magnetic fields that are structured on scales greater than the CR Larmor radius. We solve the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equation for various mixes of mirroring and small-angle scattering and show that relatively small deviations from a uniform magnetic field can induce mirroring and inhibit CR transport to levels that mimic Bohm diffusion in which the CR mean free path is comparable with the CR Larmor radius. Our calculations suggest that shocks may accelerate CR to the Hillas (1984) energy without the need for magnetic field amplification on the Larmor scale. This re-opens the possibility, subject to more comprehensive simulations, that young supernova remnants may be accelerating CR to PeV energies, and maybe even to higher energies beyond the knee in the energy spectrum. We limit our discussion of CR acceleration to shocks that are non-relativistic.</description>

      <title>Observing radio transients with Phased ALMA: Pulses from the Galactic Centre magnetar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06234v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio transients, such as pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), are primarily detected at centimetre radio wavelengths, where higher luminosities are found. However, observations of sources in dense environments are heavily affected by propagation effects which may hinder a detection. Millimetre wave observations bypass this complication but require the largest radio telescopes to compensate for the lower flux densities. When used in phased mode, the ALMA radio telescope provides an equivalent dish size of 84m, being the most sensitive instrument at mm/sub mm. With its high time resolution it offers a unique opportunity to study radio transients in an unexplored window. We study the Galactic Centre (GC) magnetar, PSR J1745$-$2900, as a laboratory for magnetars in complex magneto-turbulent environments and to link with FRBs. We showcase the potential of ALMA in phased mode to observe radio transients and to achieve, for some sources, the first ever detections outside the cm wave range. We studied the GC magnetar using ALMA archival data of Sgr A* at Band 3 from the 2017 GMVA campaign. We searched in intensity and classified the pulses based on their circular and linear polarisation properties and arrival phase. We detected eight pulses with energies in the range of 10$^{29}$ erg. We constructed its cumulative energy distribution and we fit a power law, where the event rate scales with energy as $R \propto E^{\gamma}$. The result is an exponent of $\gamma = -2.4 \pm 0.1$. With the $\gamma -$value and the system properties of phased ALMA, we estimate that over 160 known pulsars could be detected by ALMA. For repeating FRBs, observing during their peak activity window could lead to several detections. We expect that ALMA's lower frequency bands with polarisation capabilities, will serve as a pioneer on mm wave searches for pulsars and to study complex environments involving radio transients.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillations as a Probe of Macrorealism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlations between successive measurements of a quantum system can violate a family of Leggett-Garg Inequalities (LGIs) that are analogous to the violation of Bell's inequalities of measurements performed on spatially separated quantum systems. These LGIs follow from a macrorealistic point of view, imposing that a classical system is at all times in a definite state and that a measurement can, at least in principle, leave this state undisturbed. Violations of LGIs can be probed by neutrino flavour oscillations if the correlators of consecutive flavour measurements are approximately stationary. We discuss here several improvements of the methodology used in previous analyses based on accelerator and reactor neutrino data. We argue that the strong claims of LGI violations made in previous studies are based on an unsuitable modelling of macrorealistic systems in statistical hypothesis tests. We illustrate our improved methodology via the example of the MINOS muon-neutrino survival data, where we find revised statistical evidence for violations of LGIs at the $(2-3)\sigma$ level, depending on macrorealistic background models.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation Precision with Geocentric Gravitational Wave Interferometers: Monochromatic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Fisher information matrix study of the parameter estimation precision achievable by a class of future space-based, "mid-band", gravitational wave (GW) interferometers observing monochromatic signals. The mid-band is the frequency region between that accessible by LISA and ground-based interferometers. We analyze monochromatic signals from TianQin, gLISA, and gLISA$_d$, a descoped gLISA which has acceleration noise three orders of magnitude worse than gLISA. We find that all three missions achieve their best angular source reconstruction precision in the higher part of their accessible frequency band, with an error box better than $10^{-10}$ sr in the frequency band [$10^{-1},10$] Hz when observing a monochromatic GW signal of amplitude $h_0=10^{-21}$ that is incoming from a given direction. In terms of their reconstructed frequencies and amplitudes, TianQin achieves its best precision values in both quantities in the frequency band [$10^{-2}, 4\times 10^{-1}$] Hz, with a frequency precision $\sigma_{f_{gw}}=2\times 10^{-11}$ Hz and an amplitude precision $\sigma_{h_0}=2\times 10^{-24}$. gLISA matches these precisions in a frequency band slightly higher than that of TianQin, [$3\times 10^{-2},1$] Hz, as a consequence of its smaller arm length. gLISA$_d$, on the other hand, matches the performance of gLISA only over the narrower frequency region, [$7\times 10^{-1},1$] Hz, as a consequence of its higher acceleration noise at lower frequencies. The angular, frequency, and amplitude precisions as functions of the source sky location are derived assuming an average SNR of 10 at selected GW frequencies within TianQin and gLISA's bands. The same is done for gLISA$_d$ using amplitudes yielding an SNR of 10 for gLISA. We find that, for any given source location, all three missions display a marked precision improvement in the three reconstructed parameters at higher GW frequencies.</description>

      <title>Rainbow gravity effects on Klein-Gordon particles in a quantized nonuniform external magnetic field in the Bonnor-Melvin domain walls background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of rainbow gravity on Klein-Gordon (KG) bosons in a quantized nonuniform magnetic field in the background of Bonnor-Melvin (BM) spacetime with a cosmological constant. In the process, we show that the BM spacetime introduces domain walls (i.e., infinitely impenetrable hard walls) at \(r = 0\) and \(r = \pi/\sqrt{2\Lambda}\), as a consequence of the effective gravitational potential field generated by such a magnetized BM spacetime. As a result, the motion of KG particles/antiparticles is restricted indefinitely within the range \(r \in [0, \pi/\sqrt{2\Lambda}]\), and the particles and antiparticles cannot be found elsewhere. Next, we provide a conditionally exact solution in the form of the general Heun function \(H_G(a, q, \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, z)\). Within the BM domain walls and under the condition of exact solvability, we study the effects of rainbow gravity on KG bosonic fields in a quantized nonuniform external magnetic field in the BM spacetime background. We use three pairs of rainbow functions: \( f(u) = (1 - \tilde{\beta} |E|)^{-1}, \, h(u) = 1 \); and \( f(u) = 1, \, h(u) = \sqrt{1 - \tilde{\beta} |E|^\upsilon} \), with \(\upsilon = 1,2\), where \(u = |E| / E_p\), \(\tilde{\beta} = \beta / E_p\), and \(\beta\) is the rainbow parameter. We find that such pairs of rainbow functions, \((f(u), h(u))\), fully comply with the theory of rainbow gravity, ensuring that \(E_p\) is the maximum possible energy for particles and antiparticles alike. Moreover, we show that the corresponding bosonic states form magnetized, rotating vortices, as intriguing consequences of such a magnetized BM spacetime background.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive UV and Optical spectral analysis of Cygnus X-1: Stellar and wind parameters, abundances, and evolutionary implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of Cyg X-1, utilizing archival high-resolution UV and optical spectra in conjunction with sophisticated atmospheric models. Notably, this is the first investigation to simultaneously analyze UV and optical spectra of Cyg X-1 along with incorporating X-rays to constrain the stellar and wind parameters. Our analysis yields notably lower masses for both the donor (29$\,M_\odot$) and the black hole (12.7 to 17.8$\,M_\odot$, depending on inclination), and confirms that the donor's radius is close to reaching the inner Lagrangian point. We find super-solar Fe, Si, and Mg abundances (1.3-1.8 times solar) at the surface of the donor star, while the total CNO abundance remains solar despite evidence of CNO processing (N enrichment, O depletion) and He enrichment. This abundance pattern is distinct from the surrounding Cyg OB3 association. We observe a clear difference in wind parameters between X-ray states: $v_\infty \approx 1200\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ and $\dot{M} \approx 3\times 10^{-7}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the high/soft state, increasing to $v_\infty\lesssim 1800\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ and $\dot{M}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-7}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the low/hard state. The observed X-ray luminosity is consistent with wind-fed accretion. Evolutionary models show that Cyg X-1 will undergo Roche lobe overflow in the near future. Under a fully conservative mass accretion scenario, our models predict a future binary black hole merger for Cyg X-1 within $\sim5$ Gyr. Our comprehensive analysis provides refined stellar and wind parameters of the donor star in Cyg X-1, highlighting the importance of using advanced atmospheric models and considering X-ray ionization and wind clumping. The observed abundances suggest a complex formation history involving a high initial metallicity.</description>

      <title>Sleeping Giants Arise: Monitoring the Return of Three Changing-Look Quasars to Their High States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Changing-look quasars challenge many models of the quasar central engine. Their extreme variability in both the continuum and broad emission-line fluxes on timescales on the order of years is difficult to explain. To investigate the cause of the observed transitions, we present new contemporaneous optical and X-ray observations of three faded changing-look quasars as they return to the high state. Two of these three faded changing-look quasars remained in a quiescent state for more than ten years before returning to a new high state. We find that before, during, and after transition, the spectral energy distributions of all three follow predictions for quasars based on X-ray binary outbursts, suggesting that the mechanism for the change is likely a changing accretion rate causing changes in the accretion flow structure. We also find that, in two of the three cases, the transition between the initial high and low state and the transition between the low and new high state took nearly identical amounts of time, on the order of hundreds of days. This transition timescale is useful for testing theoretical models that attempt to explain the short time scale for the state transition.</description>

      <title>Black hole quasinormal mode resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole quasinormal mode frequencies can be very close to each other ("avoided crossings") or even completely degenerate ("exceptional points") when the system is characterized by more than one parameter. We investigate this resonant behavior and demonstrate that near exceptional points, the two modes are just different covers of the same complex function on a Riemann surface. We also study the characteristic time domain signal due to the resonance in the frequency domain, illustrating the analogy between black hole signals at resonance and harmonic oscillators driven by a resonant external force. We carry out a numerical study of resonances between the fundamental mode and the first overtone in a specific toy model. We find that quasinormal mode frequencies will not be accurately constrained unless we take into account the effect of resonances.</description>

      <title>Interface modes in inspiralling neutron stars: A gravitational-wave probe of first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the extreme densities in neutron stars, a phase transition to deconfined quark matter is anticipated. Yet masses, radii and tidal deformabilities offer only indirect measures of a first-order phase transition, requiring many detections to resolve or being ineffective observables if the discontinuity exists at lower densities. We report on a smoking-gun gravitational-wave signature of a first-order transition: the resonant tidal excitation of an interface mode. Using relativistic perturbation theory with an equation-of-state family informed by chiral effective field theory, we show that such a resonance may be detectable with next-generation interferometers and possibly already with LIGO A+ for sufficiently loud events.</description>

      <title>Parameter constraints for accreting millisecond pulsars with synthetic NICER data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulse profile modelling (PPM) is a technique for inferring mass, radius and hotspot properties of millisecond pulsars. PPM is now regularly used for analysis of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars (RMPs) with data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER). Extending PPM to accreting millisecond pulsars (AMPs) is attractive, because they are a different source class featuring bright X-ray radiation from hotspots powered by accretion. In this paper, we present a modification of one of the PPM codes, X-PSI, so that it can be used for AMPs. In particular, we implement a model of an accretion disc and atmosphere model appropriate for the hotspots of AMPs, and improve the overall computational efficiency. We then test parameter recovery with synthetic NICER data in two scenarios with reasonable parameters for AMPs. We find in the first scenario, where the hotspot is large, that we are able to tightly and accurately constrain all parameters including mass and radius. In the second scenario, which is a high inclination system with a smaller hotspot, we find degeneracy between a subset of model parameters and a slight bias in the inferred mass and radius. This analysis of synthetic data lays the ground work for future analysis of AMPs with NICER data. Such an analysis could be complemented by future (joint) analysis of polarization data from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE).</description>

      <title>Late-time Evolution and Instabilities of Tidal Disruption Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) on a timescale of years after the main flare show evidence of continued activity in the form of optical/UV emission, quasi-periodic eruptions, and delayed radio flares. Motivated by this, we explore the time evolution of these disks using semi-analytic models to follow the changing disk properties and feeding rate to the central black hole (BH). We find that thermal instabilities typically begin $\sim100\,{\rm days}$ after the TDE, causing the disk to cycle between high and low accretion states for up to $\sim10\,{\rm yrs}$. The high state is super-Eddington, which may be associated with outflows that eject $\sim10^{-3}-10^{-1}\,M_\odot$ over $\sim1-2\,{\rm days}$ with a range of velocities of $\sim0.03-0.3c$. Collision between these mass ejections may cause radio flares. In the low state, the accretion rate slowly grows over months to years as continued fallback accretion builds the disk's mass. In this phase, the disk has a luminosity of $\sim10^{41}-10^{42}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ in the optical/UV as seen in some late-time observations. Although the accretion cycles we find occur for a typical $\alpha$-disk, in nature the disk could be stabilized by other effects such as the disk's magnetic field or heating from fallback accretion, the latter of which we explore. Thus higher cadence optical/UV observations along with joint radio monitoring will be key for following the disk state and testing these models.</description>

      <title>The multiwavelength correlations quest for central engines of GRB plateaus: magnetar vs black hole spin-down</title>

Abstract: This manuscript presents a multilevel analysis of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We focus on the plateau phase, which is often observed in the light curves (LCs) of GRBs. We discuss its observational properties and then thoroughly examine possible theoretical models to explain them. Inspired by the limitations of many currently known models, we introduce a novel scenario of an LC powered by the kinetic energy of a rotating black hole (BH). We investigate observational correlations between the properties of GRBs across the gamma, X-ray, and optical bands during the prompt and plateau phases of their LCs. Our analysis includes all GRBs with known redshifts detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift) and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi), as well as ground-based optical telescopes. We identify a tight correlation with the R^2 coefficient of ~0.89 for the three-dimensional Dainotti relation between the luminosity at the end of the plateau, its duration measured by Swift, and the peak luminosity measured by Fermi in the 10-1000 keV band. When accounting for redshift evolution, we achieve very small intrinsic scatter $\sigma_{int}=0.25\pm0.04$ (~43% reduction compared to the previous results). Additionally, we explore correlations involving the optical luminosity at the end of the plateau, yielding promising results. We investigate the clustering of different classes of GRBs in the investigated parameter space and discuss its impact on the aforementioned correlations as well as $E_{iso}$-$E^*_{peak}$ correlation. Notably, we demonstrate how to use the correlations as a powerful class discriminator. Finally, we discuss the theory supporting the evidence of the plateau emission. We present a new paradigm for the GRB plateau: energy extraction from a quickly rotating black hole (BH) via spin-down by a magnetically arrested disk (MAD). The abstract is continued in the comments.</description>

      <title>On the progenitor of the type Ia supernova remnant 0509-67.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the iron and hydrogen similar elliptical morphologies of the type Ia supernova (SN Ia) remnant (SNR) 0509-67.5, I suggest that the ambient gas shaped the SN ejecta, that it is a remnant of an old planetary nebula, and that the explosion was spherical. Adding that there is no observed stellar survivor in this SNR, known to be an SN Ia, I conclude that the SN Ia scenarios that best account for the explosion of this SN inside a planetary nebula (SNIP) are the lonely white dwarf scenarios, i.e., the core-degenerate (CD) and the double degenerate (DD) with merger to explosion delay (MED) time, i.e., the DD-MED scenario. Other scenarios encounter challenges, but I cannot completely rule them out. If true, the suggestion of SNR 0509-67.5 being an SNIP implies that the fraction of SNIPs might be higher than the previously estimated 50 percent of all normal SNe Ia. In the frame of the CD and the DD-MED scenarios, I attribute the observed double-shell structure in calcium to Rayleigh-Taylor instability during the explosion process: the caps of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability mushrooms form the outer shell. Instabilities during the explosion process might form clumps of some elements moving much faster than their mean velocity, possibly explaining fast-moving intermediate-mass elements.</description>

      <title>Analytical description for light propagation with the source inside the black hole photon sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The photon sphere defines the unstable circular orbit of photons in a black hole spacetime. Photons emitted by a source located inside the photon sphere can be gravitationally lensed by the black hole and have time delays when reaching the observer. These delays may lead to light echoes produced in the light curve if an accretion event in the vicinity of the horizon can be observed. In this work, we present fully analytical formulas with high accuracy to describe the change of the azimuthal angle and the travel time of those photons. By employing the analytical approaches, we find that the time delay between photons emitted from the interior of the photon sphere has a typical time scale of $2(\pi - \phi_\mathrm{S}) u_\mathrm{m}$ with $\phi_\mathrm{S}$ and $u_\mathrm{m}$ being respectively the azimuthal angle of the source and the impact parameter evaluated at the photon sphere, which can provide some clues on the future search for gravitational lensing signatures in the accretion inflow event.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hard X-ray Properties of $\gamma$-ray Emitting Narrow Line Seyfert-I Galaxies through NuSTAR Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the launch of the Fermi-LAT observatory in 2008, more new gamma-ray objects were discovered, mostly dominated by blazars. In addition, some of the narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies were observed in gamma-ray but in less number, making them different from other NLSy1 galaxies. We studied the six gamma-ray-detected NLSy1 galaxies using the hard X-ray observations from NuSTAR and optical g- &amp; r-band from ZTF. The X-ray spectra corresponding to all objects are well-fitted with a power-law spectral model, and a strong "brighter-when-redder" trend is seen, which is the properties mostly seen in Blazars. The X-ray light curves were produced for all the available observations, and the F$_{var}$ is estimated for all the observations. In 1H 0323+342, we found that F$_{var}$ lies between 9-22%, suggesting significant variability in the same source. Similarly, for PKS 2004-447, we found F$_{var}$ lies between 10-21%. We see a strong X-ray and gamma-ray spectral index correlation among these objects, suggesting that X-rays and gamma-rays are produced through a similar process. Comparing the X-ray spectral index with other class objects, we see that NLSy1 galaxies are similar to LBL and IBL types. We see a negative trend of X-ray flux with the gamma-ray luminosity in these objects, suggesting an anti-correlation between X-ray and gamma-ray luminosity. A similar trend is seen between the X-ray flux, total jet power, and disk luminosity. The X-ray spectral index also shows a negative trend with total jet power and disk luminosity. The optical variability amplitude lies between 0.90 to 2.32, and the fractional variability varies from 13-40%. The color-magnitude plot shows mostly the brighter-when-redder trend, suggesting $\gamma$-NLSy1 are much closer to FSRQs than BL Lacs. Our results, overall, summarize how the various parameters in gamma-ray-detected NLSy1 are connected.</description>

      <title>Supernovae at Distances &lt; 40 Mpc: II. Supernova Rate in the Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context.This is the second paper of a series aiming to determine the birth rates of supernovae in the local Universe. Aims. In this paper, we aim to estimate the SN rates in the local universe and fit the delay-time distribution of SNe Ia to put constraints on their progenitor scenarios. Methods.We performed a Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the volumetric rates with the nearby SN sample introduced in Paper I of the series. The rate evolution of core-collapse SNe well traces the evolution of cosmic star formation history; while that of SNe Ia involves the convolution of cosmic star-formation history and a two-component delay-time distribution including a power law and a Gaussian component. Results.The volumetric rates of type Ia, Ibc and II SNe are derived as $0.325\pm0.040^{+0.016}_{-0.010}$, $0.160\pm0.028^{+0.044}_{-0.014}$, and $0.528\pm0.051^{+0.162}_{-0.013}$ (in unit of $10^{-4} yr^{-1} Mpc^{-3} h^3_{70}$), respectively. The rate of CCSNe is consistent with previous estimates. The newly derived local SN Ia rate is larger than existing results given at redshifts 0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.1, favoring an increased rate from the universe at z ~ 0.1 to the local universe. A two-component model can well fit the rate variation, with the power law component accounting for the rate evolution at larger redshifts and the Gaussian component with a delay time of 12.63$\pm$0.38 Gyr accounting for the local rate evolution. This delayed component with such a longer delay time suggests that the progenitors of these SNe Ia were formed at around 1 Gyr after the birth of the universe, which could only be explained by a double-degenerate progenitor scenario. This is evidenced by the comparison with the PTF sample of SNe Ia at z = 0.073, which reveals that the increase in SN Ia rate at z &lt; 0.01 is primarily due to the SNe Ia of massive E and S0 galaxies with old stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Resonant Excitation of Quasinormal Modes of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate that a distinctive resonant excitation between quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes emerges as a universal phenomenon at an avoided crossing near the exceptional point through high-precision numerical analysis and theory of QNMs based on the framework of non-Hermitian physics. This resonant phenomenon not only allows us to decipher a long-standing mystery concerning the peculiar behaviors of QNMs but also stands as a novel beacon for characterizing black hole spacetime geometry. Our findings pave the way for rigorous examinations of black holes and the exploration of new physics in gravity.</description>

      <title>Masquerading hybrid stars with dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of dark matter on hybrid stars. Using a two-fluid approach, where normal and dark matter components interact only gravitationally, we explore how dark matter can trigger the appearance of quark matter in neutron stars for unprecedented low masses. Our findings reveal that dark matter increases the central pressure of neutron stars, potentially leading to the formation of hybrid stars with quark cores even at very low compact star masses. The critical mass for the appearance of quark matter decreases with increasing dark matter content. We introduce the concept of "masquerading hybrid stars", where dark matter admixed stars exhibit similar mass-radius relations to purely hadronic stars, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on these parameters. Additionally, we identify a unique class of objects termed "dark oysters", characterized by a large dark matter halo and a small normal matter core, highlighting the diverse structural possibilities for compact stars influenced by dark matter.</description>

      <title>Regularizing the Pulsar Timing Array likelihood: A path towards Fourier Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has piqued interest across the scientific community. A combined analysis of all currently available data holds the promise of confirming the announced evidence as a solid detection of a GWB. However, the complexity of individual pulsar noise models and the variety of modeling tools used for different types of pulsars present significant challenges for a truly unified analysis. In this work we propose a novel approach to the analysis of PTA data: first a posterior distribution over Fourier modes is produced for each pulsar individually. Then, in a global analysis of all pulsars these posterior distributions can be re-used for a GWB search, which retains all information regarding the signals of interest without the added complexity of the underlying noise models or implementation differences. This approach facilitates combining radio and gamma-ray pulsar data, while reducing the complexity of the model and of its implementations when carrying out a GWB search with PTA data.</description>

      <title>Notes on Quasinormal Modes of charged de Sitter Blackholes from Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>

      <title>Ball Lightning as a profound manifestation of the Dark Matter physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ball lighting (BL) has been observed for centuries. There are large number of books, review articles, and original scientific papers devoted to different aspects of BL phenomenon. Yet, the basic features of this phenomenon have never been explained by known physics. The main problem is the source which could power the dynamics of the BL. We advocate an idea that the dark matter (DM) in form of the axion quark nuggets (AQN) made of standard model quarks and gluons (similar to the old idea of the Witten's strangelets) could internally generate the required power. The AQN model was invented long ago without any relation to the BL physics. It was invented with a single motivation to explain the observed similarity $\Omega_{\rm DM}\sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ between visible and DM components. This relation represents a very generic feature of this framework, not sensitive to any parameters of the construction. However, with the same set of parameters being fixed long ago this model is capable to address the key elements of the BL phenomenology, including the source of the energy powering the BL events.
  In particular, we argue that the visible size of BL, its typical life time, the frequency of appearance, etc are all consistent with suggested proposal when BL represents a profound manifestation of the DM physics represented by the AQN objects. We also argue that some of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) might be closely related to BL events, and therefore also represent profound manifestations of the DM physics within AQN framework. We also formulate a number of specific possible tests which can refute or unambiguously substantiate this unorthodox proposal on nature of BL and UAP.</description>

      <title>Optimal Follow-Up of Gravitational-Wave Events with the UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX) is a wide-field ultraviolet space telescope selected as a NASA Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) mission for launch in 2030. UVEX will undertake deep, cadenced surveys of the entire sky to probe low mass galaxies and explore the ultraviolet (UV) time-domain sky, and it will carry the first rapidly deployable UV spectroscopic capability for a broad range of science applications. One of UVEX's prime objectives is to follow up gravitational wave (GW) binary neutron star mergers as targets of opportunity (ToOs), rapidly scanning across their localization regions to search for their kilonova (KN) counterparts. Early-time multiband ultraviolet light curves of KNe are key to explaining the interplay between jet and ejecta in binary neutron star mergers. Owing to high Galactic extinction in the ultraviolet and the variation of GW distance estimates over the sky, the sensitivity to kilonovae can vary significantly across the GW localization and even across the footprint of a single image given UVEX's large field of view. Good ToO observing strategies to trade off between area and depth are neither simple nor obvious. We present an optimal strategy for GW follow-up with UVEX in which exposure time is adjusted dynamically for each field individually to maximize the overall probability of detection. We model the scheduling problem using the expressive and powerful mathematical framework of mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and employ a state-of-the-art MILP solver to automatically generate observing plan timelines that achieve high probabilities of kilonova detection. We have implemented this strategy in an open-source astronomical scheduling software package called the Multi-Mission Multi-Messenger Observation Planning Toolkit (M4OPT), on GitHub at https://github.com/m4opt/m4opt.</description>

      <title>Detectability of gravitational atoms in black hole binaries with the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating black holes can amplify ultralight bosonic fields through superradiance, forming macroscopic clouds known as gravitational atoms. When the cloud forms around one of the components of a binary system, it can undergo a series of distinctive interactions, comprising both secular effects, such as dynamical friction or accretion, and resonant behaviour. These processes are expected to leave a distinctive signature on the gravitational waveform emitted by the binary, whose detectability we investigate in this paper. To do so, we implement a numerical code that integrates these effects, computed within a Newtonian approximation, for intermediate-to-high mass-ratio binaries on circular equatorial orbits. Realistic waveforms incorporating these environmental influences are generated and analyzed using the Fisher matrix formalism to evaluate the detectability of bosonic clouds with current and next-generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories. Our results demonstrate the potential for gravitational wave astronomy to probe the existence and properties of ultralight bosons.</description>
