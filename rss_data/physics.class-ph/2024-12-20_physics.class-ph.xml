      <title>Elastic waves in bearing raceways: the forward and inverse problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbines are crucial to our energy infrastructure, and ensuring their bearings function with minimal friction while often supporting heavy loads is vital. Vibrations within a bearing can signal the presence of defects, friction, or misalignment. However, current detection methods are neither robust nor easy to automate. We propose a more quantitative approach by modelling the elastic waves within bearing raceways. By approximating the raceway as a hollow cylinder, we derive straightforward 4x4 systems for its vibrational modes, enabling both forward and inverse problem-solving. We also demonstrate how to significantly reduce the number of required sensors by using a simple prior: the known number of rollers and their angular speed. We present numerical examples showcasing the full recovery of contact traction between bearings and the raceway, as well as the detection of elastic emissions.</description>

      <title>On material-uniform elastic bodies with disclinations and their homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we define material-uniform hyperelastic bodies (in the sense of Noll) containing discrete disclinations and dislocations, and study their properties. We show in a rigorous way that the size of a disclination is limited by the symmetries of the constitutive relation; in particular, if the symmetry group of the body is discrete, it cannot admit arbitrarily small, yet non-zero, disclinations. We then discuss the application of these observations to the derivations of models of bodies with continuously-distributed defects.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Symmetry Discovery for Classical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a data-driven, deep-learning-based Machine-Learning Symmetry Discovery (MLSD) algorithm to automate the discovery of continuous Lie group symmetries in classical mechanical systems from their time-evolution trajectory data. MLSD uses neural networks (NNs) to predict conserved physical quantities that implement symmetry transformations of the phase space coordinates. After training, MLSD is able to identify the Lie algebra, particularly non-abelian ones, as indicated by the Lie algebra structure coefficients. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the MLSD method, we applied it to simulated data from the classical three-dimensional Kepler problem and the harmonic oscillator. The results show that the algorithm successfully identified the hidden symmetry groups of both systems.</description>
