      <title>Resonances in reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high dimensions, reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with inexact reflections exhibits slow mixing when the particle ensemble is initialised from a Dirac delta distribution and the uniform distribution is targeted. By quantifying the instantaneous non-uniformity of the distribution with the Sinkhorn divergence, we elucidate the principal mechanisms underlying the mixing problems. In spheres and cubes, we show that the collective motion transitions between fluid-like and discretisation-dominated behaviour, with the critical step size scaling as a power law in the dimension. In both regimes, the particles can spontaneously unmix, leading to resonances in the particle density and the aforementioned problems. Additionally, low-dimensional toy models of the dynamics are constructed which reproduce the dominant features of the high-dimensional problem. Finally, the dynamics is contrasted with the exact Hamiltonian particle flow and tuning practices are discussed.</description>

      <title>Robust and Scalable Variational Bayes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a robust and scalable framework for variational Bayes (VB) that effectively handles outliers and contamination of arbitrary nature in large datasets. Our approach divides the dataset into disjoint subsets, computes the posterior for each subset, and applies VB approximation independently to these posteriors. The resulting variational posteriors with respect to the subsets are then aggregated using the geometric median of probability measures, computed with respect to the Wasserstein distance. This novel aggregation method yields the Variational Median Posterior (VM-Posterior) distribution. We rigorously demonstrate that the VM-Posterior preserves contraction properties akin to those of the true posterior, while accounting for approximation errors or the variational gap inherent in VB methods. We also provide provable robustness guarantee of the VM-Posterior. Furthermore, we establish a variational Bernstein-von Mises theorem for both multivariate Gaussian distributions with general covariance structures and the mean-field variational family. To facilitate practical implementation, we adapt existing algorithms for computing the VM-Posterior and evaluate its performance through extensive numerical experiments. The results highlight its robustness and scalability, making it a reliable tool for Bayesian inference in the presence of complex, contaminated datasets.</description>

      <title>Spectral Algorithms under Covariate Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral algorithms leverage spectral regularization techniques to analyze and process data, providing a flexible framework for addressing supervised learning problems. To deepen our understanding of their performance in real-world scenarios where the distributions of training and test data may differ, we conduct a rigorous investigation into the convergence behavior of spectral algorithms under distribution shifts, specifically within the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our study focuses on the case of covariate shift. In this scenario, the marginal distributions of the input data differ between the training and test datasets, while the conditional distribution of the output given the input remains unchanged. Under this setting, we analyze the generalization error of spectral algorithms and show that they achieve minimax optimality when the density ratios between the training and test distributions are uniformly bounded. However, we also identify a critical limitation: when the density ratios are unbounded, the spectral algorithms may become suboptimal. To address this limitation, we propose a weighted spectral algorithm that incorporates density ratio information into the learning process. Our theoretical analysis shows that this weighted approach achieves optimal capacity-independent convergence rates. Furthermore, by introducing a weight clipping technique, we demonstrate that the convergence rates of the weighted spectral algorithm can approach the optimal capacity-dependent convergence rates arbitrarily closely. This improvement resolves the suboptimality issue in unbounded density ratio scenarios and advances the state-of-the-art by refining existing theoretical results.</description>

      <title>When do Random Forests work?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effectiveness of randomizing split-directions in random forests. Prior literature has shown that, on the one hand, randomization can reduce variance through decorrelation, and, on the other hand, randomization regularizes and works in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments. First, we bring together and revisit decorrelation and regularization by presenting a systematic analysis of out-of-sample mean-squared error (MSE) for different SNR scenarios based on commonly-used data-generating processes. We find that variance reduction tends to increase with the SNR and forests outperform bagging when the SNR is low because, in low SNR cases, variance dominates bias for both methods. Second, we show that the effectiveness of randomization is a question that goes beyond the SNR. We present a simulation study with fixed and moderate SNR, in which we examine the effectiveness of randomization for other data characteristics. In particular, we find that (i) randomization can increase bias in the presence of fat tails in the distribution of covariates; (ii) in the presence of irrelevant covariates randomization is ineffective because bias dominates variance; and (iii) when covariates are mutually correlated randomization tends to be effective because variance dominates bias. Beyond randomization, we find that, for both bagging and random forests, bias can be significantly reduced in the presence of correlated covariates. This last finding goes beyond the prevailing view that averaging mostly works by variance reduction. Given that in practice covariates are often correlated, our findings on correlated covariates could open the way for a better understanding of why random forests work well in many applications.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Chaos in One-hidden-layer Neural Networks beyond Logarithmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the approximation gap between the dynamics of a polynomial-width neural network and its infinite-width counterpart, both trained using projected gradient descent in the mean-field scaling regime. We demonstrate how to tightly bound this approximation gap through a differential equation governed by the mean-field dynamics. A key factor influencing the growth of this ODE is the local Hessian of each particle, defined as the derivative of the particle's velocity in the mean-field dynamics with respect to its position. We apply our results to the canonical feature learning problem of estimating a well-specified single-index model; we permit the information exponent to be arbitrarily large, leading to convergence times that grow polynomially in the ambient dimension $d$. We show that, due to a certain ``self-concordance'' property in these problems -- where the local Hessian of a particle is bounded by a constant times the particle's velocity -- polynomially many neurons are sufficient to closely approximate the mean-field dynamics throughout training.</description>

      <title>TransST: Transfer Learning Embedded Spatial Factor Modeling of Spatial Transcriptomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Spatial transcriptomics have emerged as a powerful tool in biomedical research because of its ability to capture both the spatial contexts and abundance of the complete RNA transcript profile in organs of interest. However, limitations of the technology such as the relatively low resolution and comparatively insufficient sequencing depth make it difficult to reliably extract real biological signals from these data. To alleviate this challenge, we propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as TransST, to adaptively leverage the cell-labeled information from external sources in inferring cell-level heterogeneity of a target spatial transcriptomics data.
  Results: Applications in several real studies as well as a number of simulation settings show that our approach significantly improves existing techniques. For example, in the breast cancer study, TransST successfully identifies five biologically meaningful cell clusters, including the two subgroups of cancer in situ and invasive cancer; in addition, only TransST is able to separate the adipose tissues from the connective issues among all the studied methods.
  Conclusions: In summary, the proposed method TransST is both effective and robust in identifying cell subclusters and detecting corresponding driving biomarkers in spatial transcriptomics data.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Archetypal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Archetypal analysis (AA) was originally proposed in 1994 by Adele Cutler and Leo Breiman as a computational procedure to extract the distinct aspects called archetypes in observations with each observational record approximated as a mixture (i.e., convex combination) of these archetypes. AA thereby provides straightforward, interpretable, and explainable representations for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, facilitating the understanding of the structure of high-dimensional data with wide applications throughout the sciences. However, AA also faces challenges, particularly as the associated optimization problem is non-convex. This survey provides researchers and data mining practitioners an overview of methodologies and opportunities that AA has to offer surveying the many applications of AA across disparate fields of science, as well as best practices for modeling data using AA and limitations. The survey concludes by explaining important future research directions concerning AA.</description>

      <title>Can Moran Eigenvectors Improve Machine Learning of Spatial Data? Insights from Synthetic Data Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moran Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (ESF) approaches have shown promise in accounting for spatial effects in statistical models. Can this extend to machine learning? This paper examines the effectiveness of using Moran Eigenvectors as additional spatial features in machine learning models. We generate synthetic datasets with known processes involving spatially varying and nonlinear effects across two different geometries. Moran Eigenvectors calculated from different spatial weights matrices, with and without a priori eigenvector selection, are tested. We assess the performance of popular machine learning models, including Random Forests, LightGBM, XGBoost, and TabNet, and benchmark their accuracies in terms of cross-validated R2 values against models that use only coordinates as features. We also extract coefficients and functions from the models using GeoShapley and compare them with the true processes. Results show that machine learning models using only location coordinates achieve better accuracies than eigenvector-based approaches across various experiments and datasets. Furthermore, we discuss that while these findings are relevant for spatial processes that exhibit positive spatial autocorrelation, they do not necessarily apply when modeling network autocorrelation and cases with negative spatial autocorrelation, where Moran Eigenvectors would still be useful.</description>

      <title>Geometric Generality of Transformer-Based Gr\"obner Basis Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intersection of deep learning and symbolic mathematics has seen rapid progress in recent years, exemplified by the work of Lample and Charton. They demonstrated that effective training of machine learning models for solving mathematical problems critically depends on high-quality, domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we address the computation of Gr\"obner basis using Transformers. While a dataset generation method tailored to Transformer-based Gr\"obner basis computation has previously been proposed, it lacked theoretical guarantees regarding the generality or quality of the generated datasets. In this work, we prove that datasets generated by the previously proposed algorithm are sufficiently general, enabling one to ensure that Transformers can learn a sufficiently diverse range of Gr\"obner bases. Moreover, we propose an extended and generalized algorithm to systematically construct datasets of ideal generators, further enhancing the training effectiveness of Transformer. Our results provide a rigorous geometric foundation for Transformers to address a mathematical problem, which is an answer to Lample and Charton's idea of training on diverse or representative inputs.</description>

      <title>Meta-Dependence in Conditional Independence Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery algorithms utilize many statistical tests for conditional independence to uncover networks of causal dependencies. These approaches to causal discovery rely on an assumed correspondence between the graphical properties of a causal structure and the conditional independence properties of observed variables, known as the causal Markov condition and faithfulness. Finite data yields an empirical distribution that is "close" to the actual distribution. Across these many possible empirical distributions, the correspondence to the graphical properties can break down for different conditional independencies, and multiple violations can occur at the same time. We study this "meta-dependence" between conditional independence properties using the following geometric intuition: each conditional independence property constrains the space of possible joint distributions to a manifold. The "meta-dependence" between conditional independences is informed by the position of these manifolds relative to the true probability distribution. We provide a simple-to-compute measure of this meta-dependence using information projections and consolidate our findings empirically using both synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Density-Density Regression with Application to Cell-Cell Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a scalable framework for regressing multivariate distributions onto multivariate distributions, motivated by the application of inferring cell-cell communication from population-scale single-cell data. The observed data consist of pairs of multivariate distributions for ligands from one cell type and corresponding receptors from another. For each ordered pair $e=(l,r)$ of cell types $(l \neq r)$ and each sample $i = 1, \ldots, n$, we observe a pair of distributions $(F_{ei}, G_{ei})$ of gene expressions for ligands and receptors of cell types $l$ and $r$, respectively. The aim is to set up a regression of receptor distributions $G_{ei}$ given ligand distributions $F_{ei}$. A key challenge is that these distributions reside in distinct spaces of differing dimensions. We formulate the regression of multivariate densities on multivariate densities using a generalized Bayes framework with the sliced Wasserstein distance between fitted and observed distributions. Finally, we use inference under such regressions to define a directed graph for cell-cell communications.</description>

Abstract: We propose a clustering method, funWeightClustSkew, based on mixtures of functional linear regression models and three skewed multivariate distributions: the variance-gamma distribution, the skew-t distribution, and the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution. Our approach follows the framework of the functional high dimensional data clustering (funHDDC) method, and we extend to functional data the cluster weighted models based on skewed distributions used for finite dimensional multivariate data. We consider several parsimonious models, and to estimate the parameters we construct an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. We illustrate the performance of funWeightClustSkew for simulated data and for the Air Quality dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ALT, an open-source Python package created for efficient and accurate time series classification (TSC). The package implements the adaptive law-based transformation (ALT) algorithm, which transforms raw time series data into a linearly separable feature space using variable-length shifted time windows. This adaptive approach enhances its predecessor, the linear law-based transformation (LLT), by effectively capturing patterns of varying temporal scales. The software is implemented for scalability, interpretability, and ease of use, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. Extensive benchmarking on real-world datasets demonstrates the utility of ALT for diverse TSC tasks in physics and related domains.</description>

      <title>Why Ask One When You Can Ask $k$? Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer to a Set of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables decision-making systems to improve reliability by selectively deferring uncertain predictions to more competent agents. However, most existing approaches focus exclusively on single-agent deferral, which is often inadequate in high-stakes scenarios that require collective expertise. We propose Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer, a generalization of the classical two-stage L2D framework that allocates each query to the $k$ most confident agents instead of a single one. To further enhance flexibility and cost-efficiency, we introduce Top-$k(x)$ Learning-to-Defer, an adaptive extension that learns the optimal number of agents to consult for each query, based on input complexity, agent competency distributions, and consultation costs. For both settings, we derive a novel surrogate loss and prove that it is Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$-consistent, ensuring convergence to the Bayes-optimal allocation. Notably, we show that the well-established model cascades paradigm arises as a restricted instance of our Top-$k$ and Top-$k(x)$ formulations. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on both classification and regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Variance-Reduced Fast Operator Splitting Methods for Stochastic Generalized Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop two classes of variance-reduced fast operator splitting methods to approximate solutions of both finite-sum and stochastic generalized equations. Our approach integrates recent advances in accelerated fixed-point methods, co-hypomonotonicity, and variance reduction. First, we introduce a class of variance-reduced estimators and establish their variance-reduction bounds. This class covers both unbiased and biased instances and comprises common estimators as special cases, including SVRG, SAGA, SARAH, and Hybrid-SGD. Next, we design a novel accelerated variance-reduced forward-backward splitting (FBS) algorithm using these estimators to solve finite-sum and stochastic generalized equations. Our method achieves both $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ and $o(1/k^2)$ convergence rates on the expected squared norm $\mathbb{E}[ \| G_{\lambda}x^k\|^2]$ of the FBS residual $G_{\lambda}$, where $k$ is the iteration counter. Additionally, we establish, for the first time, almost sure convergence rates and almost sure convergence of iterates to a solution in stochastic accelerated methods. Unlike existing stochastic fixed-point algorithms, our methods accommodate co-hypomonotone operators, which potentially include nonmonotone problems arising from recent applications. We further specify our method to derive an appropriate variant for each stochastic estimator -- SVRG, SAGA, SARAH, and Hybrid-SGD -- demonstrating that they achieve the best-known complexity for each without relying on enhancement techniques. Alternatively, we propose an accelerated variance-reduced backward-forward splitting (BFS) method, which attains similar convergence rates and oracle complexity as our FBS method. Finally, we validate our results through several numerical experiments and compare their performance.</description>

      <title>An Empirically Grounded Identifiability Theory Will Accelerate Self-Supervised Learning Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The Platonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH), suggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all representations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon lacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However, current IT cannot explain SSL's empirical success. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and optimizers.</description>

      <title>Learning from Similar Linear Representations: Adaptivity, Minimaxity, and Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17765v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Representation multi-task learning (MTL) has achieved tremendous success in practice. However, the theoretical understanding of these methods is still lacking. Most existing theoretical works focus on cases where all tasks share the same representation, and claim that MTL almost always improves performance. Nevertheless, as the number of tasks grows, assuming all tasks share the same representation is unrealistic. Furthermore, empirical findings often indicate that a shared representation does not necessarily improve single-task learning performance. In this paper, we aim to understand how to learn from tasks with \textit{similar but not exactly the same} linear representations, while dealing with outlier tasks. Assuming a known intrinsic dimension, we propose a penalized empirical risk minimization method and a spectral method that are \textit{adaptive} to the similarity structure and \textit{robust} to outlier tasks. Both algorithms outperform single-task learning when representations across tasks are sufficiently similar and the proportion of outlier tasks is small. Moreover, they always perform at least as well as single-task learning, even when the representations are dissimilar. We provide information-theoretic lower bounds to demonstrate that both methods are nearly \textit{minimax} optimal in a large regime, with the spectral method being optimal in the absence of outlier tasks. Additionally, we introduce a thresholding algorithm to adapt to an unknown intrinsic dimension. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Active Feature Acquisition Methods for Time-varying Feature Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01530v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning methods often assume that input features are available at no cost. However, in domains like healthcare, where acquiring features could be expensive or harmful, it is necessary to balance a feature's acquisition cost against its predictive value. The task of training an AI agent to decide which features to acquire is called active feature acquisition (AFA). By deploying an AFA agent, we effectively alter the acquisition strategy and trigger a distribution shift. To safely deploy AFA agents under this distribution shift, we present the problem of active feature acquisition performance evaluation (AFAPE). We examine AFAPE under i) a no direct effect (NDE) assumption, stating that acquisitions do not affect the underlying feature values; and ii) a no unobserved confounding (NUC) assumption, stating that retrospective feature acquisition decisions were only based on observed features. We show that one can apply missing data methods under the NDE assumption and offline reinforcement learning under the NUC assumption. When NUC and NDE hold, we propose a novel semi-offline reinforcement learning framework. This framework requires a weaker positivity assumption and introduces three new estimators: A direct method (DM), an inverse probability weighting (IPW), and a double reinforcement learning (DRL) estimator.</description>

      <title>Dynamic angular synchronization under smoothness constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an undirected measurement graph $\mathcal{H} = ([n], \mathcal{E})$, the classical angular synchronization problem consists of recovering unknown angles $\theta_1^*,\dots,\theta_n^*$ from a collection of noisy pairwise measurements of the form $(\theta_i^* - \theta_j^*) \mod 2\pi$, for all $\{i,j\} \in \mathcal{E}$. This problem arises in a variety of applications, including computer vision, time synchronization of distributed networks, and ranking from pairwise comparisons. In this paper, we consider a dynamic version of this problem where the angles, and also the measurement graphs evolve over $T$ time points. Assuming a smoothness condition on the evolution of the latent angles, we derive three algorithms for joint estimation of the angles over all time points. Moreover, for one of the algorithms, we establish non-asymptotic recovery guarantees for the mean-squared error (MSE) under different statistical models. In particular, we show that the MSE converges to zero as $T$ increases under milder conditions than in the static setting. This includes the setting where the measurement graphs are highly sparse and disconnected, and also when the measurement noise is large and can potentially increase with $T$. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>ScoreFusion: Fusing Score-based Generative Models via Kullback-Leibler Barycenters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce ScoreFusion, a theoretically grounded method for fusing multiple pre-trained diffusion models that are assumed to generate from auxiliary populations. ScoreFusion is particularly useful for enhancing the generative modeling of a target population with limited observed data. Our starting point considers the family of KL barycenters of the auxiliary populations, which is proven to be an optimal parametric class in the KL sense, but difficult to learn. Nevertheless, by recasting the learning problem as score matching in denoising diffusion, we obtain a tractable way of computing the optimal KL barycenter weights. We prove a dimension-free sample complexity bound in total variation distance, provided that the auxiliary models are well-fitted for their own task and the auxiliary tasks combined capture the target well. The sample efficiency of ScoreFusion is demonstrated by learning handwritten digits. We also provide a simple adaptation of a Stable Diffusion denoising pipeline that enables sampling from the KL barycenter of two auxiliary checkpoints; on a portrait generation task, our method produces faces that enhance population heterogeneity relative to the auxiliary distributions.</description>

      <title>Sequential Kernelized Stein Discrepancy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a sequential version of the kernelized Stein discrepancy goodness-of-fit test, which allows for conducting goodness-of-fit tests for unnormalized densities that are continuously monitored and adaptively stopped. That is, the sample size need not be fixed prior to data collection; the practitioner can choose whether to stop the test or continue to gather evidence at any time while controlling the false discovery rate. In stark contrast to related literature, we do not impose uniform boundedness on the Stein kernel. Instead, we exploit the potential boundedness of the Stein kernel at arbitrary point evaluations to define test martingales, that give way to the subsequent novel sequential tests. We prove the validity of the test, as well as an asymptotic lower bound for the logarithmic growth of the wealth process under the alternative. We further illustrate the empirical performance of the test with a variety of distributions, including restricted Boltzmann machines.</description>

      <title>Training a neural netwok for data reduction and better generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the time of environmental concerns about artificial intelligence, in particular its need for greedy storage and computation, sparsity inducing neural networks offer a promising path towards frugality and solution for less waste.
  Sparse learners compress the inputs (features) by selecting only the ones needed for good generalization. A human scientist can then give an intelligent interpretation to the few selected features. If genes are the inputs and cancer type is the output, then the selected genes give the cancerologist clues on what genes have an effect on certain cancers. LASSO-type regularization leads to good input selection for linear associations, but few attempts have been made for nonlinear associations modeled as an artificial neural network. A stringent but efficient way of testing whether a feature selection method works is to check if a phase transition occurs in the probability of retrieving the relevant features, as observed and mathematically studied for linear models. Our method achieves just so for artificial neural networks, and, on real data, it has the best compromise between number of selected features and generalization performance.
  Our method is flexible, applying to complex models ranging from shallow to deep artificial neural networks and supporting various cost functions and sparsity-promoting penalties. It does not rely on cross-validation or on a validation set to select its single regularization parameter making it user-friendly. Our approach can be seen as a form of compressed sensing for complex models, allowing to distill high-dimensional data into a compact, interpretable subset of meaningful features, just the opposite of a black box.

Abstract: Deep learning algorithms have made incredible strides in the past decade, yet due to their complexity, the science of deep learning remains in its early stages. Being an experimentally driven field, it is natural to seek a theory of deep learning within the physics paradigm. As deep learning is largely about learning functions and distributions over functions, statistical field theory, a rich and versatile toolbox for tackling complex distributions over functions (fields) is an obvious choice of formalism. Research efforts carried out in the past few years have demonstrated the ability of field theory to provide useful insights on generalization, implicit bias, and feature learning effects. Here we provide a pedagogical review of this emerging line of research.</description>

      <title>Second-order Conditional Gradient Sliding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.08907v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constrained second-order convex optimization algorithms are the method of choice when a high accuracy solution to a problem is needed, due to their local quadratic convergence. These algorithms require the solution of a constrained quadratic subproblem at every iteration. We present the \emph{Second-Order Conditional Gradient Sliding} (SOCGS) algorithm, which uses a projection-free algorithm to solve the constrained quadratic subproblems inexactly. When the feasible region is a polytope the algorithm converges quadratically in primal gap after a finite number of linearly convergent iterations. Once in the quadratic regime the SOCGS algorithm requires $\mathcal{O}(\log(\log 1/\varepsilon))$ first-order and Hessian oracle calls and $\mathcal{O}(\log (1/\varepsilon) \log(\log1/\varepsilon))$ linear minimization oracle calls to achieve an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution. This algorithm is useful when the feasible region can only be accessed efficiently through a linear optimization oracle, and computing first-order information of the function, although possible, is costly.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Non-Conjugate Gaussian Processes By Trading Off Computation For Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-conjugate Gaussian processes (NCGPs) define a flexible probabilistic framework to model categorical, ordinal and continuous data, and are widely used in practice. However, exact inference in NCGPs is prohibitively expensive for large datasets, thus requiring approximations in practice. The approximation error adversely impacts the reliability of the model and is not accounted for in the uncertainty of the prediction. We introduce a family of iterative methods that explicitly model this error. They are uniquely suited to parallel modern computing hardware, efficiently recycle computations, and compress information to reduce both the time and memory requirements for NCGPs. As we demonstrate on large-scale classification problems, our method significantly accelerates posterior inference compared to competitive baselines by trading off reduced computation for increased uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperspherical Prototypical Learning (HPL) is a supervised approach to representation learning that designs class prototypes on the unit hypersphere. The prototypes bias the representations to class separation in a scale invariant and known geometry. Previous approaches to HPL have either of the following shortcomings: (i) they follow an unprincipled optimisation procedure; or (ii) they are theoretically sound, but are constrained to only one possible latent dimension. In this paper, we address both shortcomings. To address (i), we present a principled optimisation procedure whose solution we show is optimal. To address (ii), we construct well-separated prototypes in a wide range of dimensions using linear block codes. Additionally, we give a full characterisation of the optimal prototype placement in terms of achievable and converse bounds, showing that our proposed methods are near-optimal.</description>

      <title>Systems with Switching Causal Relations: A Meta-Causal Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most work on causality in machine learning assumes that causal relationships are driven by a constant underlying process. However, the flexibility of agents' actions or tipping points in the environmental process can change the qualitative dynamics of the system. As a result, new causal relationships may emerge, while existing ones change or disappear, resulting in an altered causal graph. To analyze these qualitative changes on the causal graph, we propose the concept of meta-causal states, which groups classical causal models into clusters based on equivalent qualitative behavior and consolidates specific mechanism parameterizations. We demonstrate how meta-causal states can be inferred from observed agent behavior, and discuss potential methods for disentangling these states from unlabeled data. Finally, we direct our analysis towards the application of a dynamical system, showing that meta-causal states can also emerge from inherent system dynamics, and thus constitute more than a context-dependent framework in which mechanisms emerge only as a result of external factors.</description>

      <title>RegMixMatch: Optimizing Mixup Utilization in Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling have significantly advanced semi-supervised learning (SSL). Prior works have effectively employed Mixup for consistency regularization in SSL. However, our findings indicate that applying Mixup for consistency regularization may degrade SSL performance by compromising the purity of artificial labels. Moreover, most pseudo-labeling based methods utilize thresholding strategy to exclude low-confidence data, aiming to mitigate confirmation bias; however, this approach limits the utility of unlabeled samples. To address these challenges, we propose RegMixMatch, a novel framework that optimizes the use of Mixup with both high- and low-confidence samples in SSL. First, we introduce semi-supervised RegMixup, which effectively addresses reduced artificial labels purity by using both mixed samples and clean samples for training. Second, we develop a class-aware Mixup technique that integrates information from the top-2 predicted classes into low-confidence samples and their artificial labels, reducing the confirmation bias associated with these samples and enhancing their effective utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that RegMixMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance across various SSL benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Unifying Feature-Based Explanations with Functional ANOVA and Cooperative Game Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature-based explanations, using perturbations or gradients, are a prevalent tool to understand decisions of black box machine learning models. Yet, differences between these methods still remain mostly unknown, which limits their applicability for practitioners. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for local and global feature-based explanations using two well-established concepts: functional ANOVA (fANOVA) from statistics, and the notion of value and interaction from cooperative game theory. We introduce three fANOVA decompositions that determine the influence of feature distributions, and use game-theoretic measures, such as the Shapley value and interactions, to specify the influence of higher-order interactions. Our framework combines these two dimensions to uncover similarities and differences between a wide range of explanation techniques for features and groups of features. We then empirically showcase the usefulness of our framework on synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

Abstract: In image fusion tasks, the absence of real fused images as priors presents a fundamental challenge. Most deep learning-based fusion methods rely on large-scale paired datasets to extract global weighting features from raw images, thereby generating fused outputs that approximate real fused images. In contrast to previous studies, this paper explores few-shot training of neural networks under the condition of having prior knowledge. We propose a novel fusion framework named GBFF, and a Granular Ball Significant Extraction algorithm specifically designed for the few-shot prior setting. All pixel pairs involved in the fusion process are initially modeled as a Coarse-Grained Granular Ball. At the local level, Fine-Grained Granular Balls are used to slide through the brightness space to extract Non-Salient Pixel Pairs, and perform splitting operations to obtain Salient Pixel Pairs. Pixel-wise weights are then computed to generate a pseudo-supervised image. At the global level, pixel pairs with significant contributions to the fusion process are categorized into the Positive Region, while those whose contributions cannot be accurately determined are assigned to the Boundary Region. The Granular Ball performs modality-aware adaptation based on the proportion of the positive region, thereby adjusting the neural network's loss function and enabling it to complement the information of the boundary region. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed algorithm and the underlying theory. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach shows strong competitiveness in terms of both fusion time and image expressiveness. Our code is publicly available at:</description>
