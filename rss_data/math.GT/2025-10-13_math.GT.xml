      <title>Polyhedral surfaces in anti-de Sitter (2+1)-spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that given a Fuchsian representation $\rho_\circ: \pi_1S \rightarrow {\rm PSL}(2,\mathbb R)$, where $S$ is a closed oriented surface of genus $\geq 2$, any hyperbolic cone-metric on $S$ with cone-angles $&gt;2\pi$ isometrically embeds as a future-convex bent Cauchy surface in a globally hyperbolic maximal Cauchy compact anti-de Sitter (2+1)-spacetime whose left representation is $\rho_\circ$. Furthermore, we show that such a spacetime and an embedding are unique provided that $d$ is sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>Cobordism maps in Khovanov homology and singular instanton homology II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our previous work, where we defined an embedded cobordism map on the instanton cube complex that recovers the cobordism maps both in Khovanov homology and singular instanton theory. In this paper, we extend this construction to immersed cobordisms. As an application, we show that, for any smooth, oriented (not necessarily ribbon) concordance $C$ from a two-bridge torus knot, the induced map $\widetilde{Kh}(C)$ on reduced Khovanov homology is injective, with the left inverse given by the reversal of $C$.</description>

      <title>The Hurwitz problem for abelian differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix $g \geq 2$. Let $\mathsf{t}(g)$ be the maximal order of the translation group among all genus-$g$ abelian differentials. By work of Schlage-Puchta and Weitze-Schmith\"usen, $\mathsf{t}(g) \leq 4(g - 1)$. They also classify the $g$ attaining this bound. We assume $g$ is outside this class.
  We first prove that either $\mathsf{t}(g) = (2(m + 1) / m) (g - 1)$ for some $m \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, when regular genus-$g$ origamis exist, or $\mathsf{t}(g) = 2(g - 1)$, when they do not exist.
  In the former case, only some values of $m &gt; 1$ are realizable; $m = 5$ is the smallest. The resulting set of genera, those satisfying $\mathsf{t}(g) = (12/5)(g - 1)$, contains infinitely long arithmetic progressions. The same holds for any odd prime $m$ congruent to $2$ modulo $3$.
  In the latter case, "many" strata of the form $\mathcal{H}(g - 1, g - 1)$, $\mathcal{H}(2k^q)$ or $\mathcal{H}(k^{2q})$, where $k \geq 1$ is an integer and $q$ is prime, contain no regular origamis; we derive a complete classification. As an application, we exhibit infinite families of genera $g$ for which $\mathsf{t}(g) = 2(g - 1)$: $g = p + 1$ for prime $p \geq 5$; $g = p^2 + 1$ for prime, but not Sophie Germain prime, $p$; and $g = pq + 1$, for distinct primes $p, q \geq 5$.</description>

      <title>The translation geometry of P\'olya's shires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his shire theorem, G. P\'olya proves that the zeros of iterated derivatives of a meromorphic function in the complex plane accumulate on the union of edges of the Voronoi diagram of the poles of this function. By recasting the local arguments of P\'olya into the language of translation surfaces, we prove its generalisation describing the asymptotic distribution of the zeros of a meromorphic function on a compact Riemann surface under the iterations of a linear differential operator $T_\omega: f \mapsto \frac{df}{\omega}$ where $\omega$ is a given meromorphic $1$-form. The accumulation set of these zeros is the union of edges of a generalised Voronoi diagram defined by the initial function $f$ together with the singular flat metric on the Riemann surface induced by $\omega$. This result provides the ground for a novel approach to the problem of finding a flat geometric presentation of a translation surface initially defined in terms of algebraic or complex-analytic data.</description>

      <title>Global fixed point in low-dimensional surface group deformation space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under the natural action of the pure mapping class group of a surface, we show that any global fixed point in the low-dimensional deformation space of the fundamental group of the surface corresponds to the trivial representation, assuming the surface has genus greater than two. This result provides an alternative proof for a special case of a theorem by Landesman and Litt with a slight refinement. We also discuss a similar approach that may potentially lead to an alternative proof of the entirety of the theorem.</description>

      <title>A study of 2-periodic weft-knitted textiles using the theory of knots and links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we use a correspondence between two-periodic weft-knitted textiles and links in the thickened torus to study the former using link invariants. We establish a criterion to identify the set of links whose elements are realized through techniques of weft-knitting leading to new, unconventional types of weft-knitting stitch patterns. A crucial topological underpinning of these links is shown to be their correspondence with ribbon knots and links in Euclidean three-space and equivalently in the three-sphere. Using the mechanics of weft-knitting, we propose a protocol for constructing and enumerating links in the thickened torus that can be knitted as a motif of a weft-knitted textile, and we call such links \emph{swatches}. Based on our analysis of link invariants of swatches, we propose conjectures on hyperbolic structure of the link complements of swatches and their multivariable Alexander polynomials.</description>

      <title>On a construction of some homology $d$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $g$-vector of a simplicial complex contains a lot of information about the combinatorial and topological structure of that complex. Several classification results regarding the structure of normal pseudomanifolds and homology manifolds have been established concerning the value of $g_2$. It is known that when $g_2=0$, all normal pseudomanifolds of dimensions at least three are stacked spheres. In the cases of $g_2=1$ and $2$, all homology manifolds are polytopal spheres and can be obtained through retriangulation or join operations from the previous ones. In this article, we provide a combinatorial characterization of the homology $d$-manifolds, where $d\geq 3$ and $g_2=3$. These are spheres and can be obtained through operations such as joins, some retriangulations, and connected sums from spheres with $g_2\leq 2$. Furthermore, we have presented a structural result on prime normal $d$-pseudomanifolds with $g_2=3$.</description>

      <title>Smooth functions which are Morse on preimages of values not being local extrema and constructing natural functions of the class on connected sums of manifolds admitting these functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss smooth functions which are Morse on preimages of values not being local extrema. We call such a function internally Morse or I-Morse.
  The Reeb graph of a smooth function is the space of all connected components of preimages of single points of it topologized with the natural quotient topology of the manifolds and a vertex of it is a point corresponding to a preimage with critical points. A smooth function is neat with respect to the Reeb graph or N-Reeb if the preimages of the vertices are the closed subsets in the manifolds of the domains with interiors being empty.
  We discuss I-Morse and N-Reeb functions, IN-Morse-Reeb functions. Our main result presents an IN-Morse-Reeb function respecting two such functions, on a connected sum of these given manifolds.</description>

      <title>$\pi_1$ of trigonal loci of strata of abelian differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate locally closed subspaces of projectivized strata of abelian differentials which classify trigonal curves with canonical divisor a multiple of a trigonal divisor. We describe their orbifold structure using linear systems on Segre-Hirzebruch surfaces and obtain results for their orbifold fundamental groups.
  Most notable among these orbifolds is the connected component $\mathbf P\mathcal H^{ev}_4(6)$, the projectivisation of the space $\mathcal H^{ev}_4(6)$ of abelian differentials on non-hyperelliptic genus $4$ curves with a single zero of multiplicity 6 providing an even spin structure. Its orbifold fundamental group is identified with the quotient of the Artin group of type $E_8$ by its maximal central subgroup.</description>
