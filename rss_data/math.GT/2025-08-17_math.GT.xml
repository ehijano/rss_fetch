      <title>The arc complex is not quasi-isometric to the sphere complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the arc complex $\mathcal{A}(S_{g,1})$ is not quasi-isometric to the sphere complex $\mathcal S_{2g}$ associated to the double of a genus $2g$ handlebody. Along the way, we present a simple proof that $\mathcal{A}(S_{g,1})$ is quasi-isometrically rigid.</description>

      <title>Isotopy versus equivariant isotopy in dimensions three and higher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite group action on a smooth manifold, we study the following question: if two equivariant diffeomorphisms are isotopic, must they be equivariantly isotopic? Birman-Hilden and Maclachlan-Harvey proved the answer is "yes" for most surfaces. By contrast, we give a general criterion in higher dimensions under which there are many equivariant diffeomorphisms which are isotopic but not equivariantly isotopic. Examples satisfying this criterion include branched covers of split links and "stabilized" branched covers. We prove the result by constructing an invariant valued in the homology of a certain infinite cover of the manifold. We give applications to outer automorphism groups of free products and to group actions on manifolds which fiber over the circle.</description>

      <title>Efficient calculations of $S$-invariants for links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an algorithm that can effectively calculate the $s$-invariant of a link as defined by Beliakova and Wehrli. Our computations show that this cannot be done by merely calculating the $E_\infty$-page of the Bar-Natan--Lee--Turner spectral sequence. Our methods also work for $s$-invariants coming from sl(3)-link homology.</description>

      <title>Involutive bordered Floer homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:1706.06557v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a bordered extension of involutive HF-hat and use it to give an algorithm to compute involutive HF-hat for general 3-manifolds. We also explain how the mapping class group action on HF-hat can be computed using bordered Floer homology. As applications, we prove that involutive HF-hat satisfies a surgery exact triangle and compute HFI-hat of the branched double covers of all 10-crossing knots.</description>

      <title>Loops, Holonomy and Signature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there is a topology on the group of loops in euclidean space such that this group is embedded in a Lie group which is simple relative to the loops. An extension of this Lie group gives the structural group of a principal bundle with connection whose holonomy coincides with the Chen signature map. We also give an alternative geometric new proof of Chen signature Theorem.</description>

      <title>On Variations of s-invariants from sl(3)-link homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Mackaay-Vaz universal $sl(3)$-link homology to deepen the study of $s$-invariants on Khovanov's link homology associated to $sl(3)$. Such $s$-invariants have already been studied by Lobb and Wu in characteristic 0 and we show how to extend this to other characteristics, particularly to $p=3$. We also use Bar-Natan's scanning algorithm for efficient calculations of these invariants, and exhibit more examples of unusual behaviour that has been previously observed by Lewark-Lobb.</description>

      <title>New Polynomial Decategorifications of the Quandle Coloring Quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two new families of polynomial invariants of oriented classical and virtual knots and links defined as decategorfications of the quandle coloring quiver. We provide examples to illustrate the computation of the invariants, show that they are not determined by the quandle counting invariant, and compute tables of invariants values for some small quandles.</description>

      <title>Weakly Mixing Polygonal Billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.00890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that there exists a residual set of (non-rational) polygons such the billiard flow is weakly mixing with respect to the Liouville measure (on the unit tangent bundle to the billiard). This follows, via a Baire category argument, from showing that for any translation surface the product of the flows in almost every pair of directions is ergodic with respect to Lebesgue measure. This in turn is proven by showing that for every translation surface the flows in almost every pair of directions do not share non-trivial common eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Graded character sheaves, HOMFLY-PT homology, and Hilbert schemes of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a geometric argument building on our new theory of graded sheaves, we compute the categorical trace and Drinfel'd center of the (graded) finite Hecke category $\mathsf{H}_W^\mathsf{gr} = \mathsf{Ch}^b(\mathsf{SBim}_W)$ in terms of the category of (graded) unipotent character sheaves, upgrading results of Ben-Zvi-Nadler and Bezrukavninov-Finkelberg-Ostrik. In type $A$, we relate the categorical trace to the category of $2$-periodic coherent sheaves on the Hilbert schemes $\mathsf{Hilb}_n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$ (equivariant with respect to the natural $\mathbb{C}^* \times \mathbb{C}^*$ action), yielding a proof of (a $2$-periodized version of) a conjecture of Gorsky-Negut-Rasmussen which relates HOMFLY-PT link homology and the spaces of global sections of certain coherent sheaves on $\mathsf{Hilb}_n(\mathbb{C}^2)$. As an important computational input, we also establish a conjecture of Gorsky-Hogancamp-Wedrich on the formality of the Hochschild homology of $\mathsf{H}_W^\mathsf{gr}$.</description>

      <title>Random quotients of mapping class groups are quasi-isometrically rigid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove several rigidity properties for random quotients of mapping class groups of surfaces, namely whose kernel is normally generated by the n-th steps of finitely many independent random walks. Firstly, we generalise a celebrated theorem of Ivanov's: every automorphism of the corresponding quotient of the curve graph is induced by a mapping class. Next, we show that, if a finitely generated group is quasi-isometric to a random quotient, then the two groups are weakly commensurable. This uses techniques from the world of hierarchically hyperbolic groups: indeed, in the process we clarify a proof of Behrstock, Hagen, and Sisto on the quasi-isometric rigidity of mapping class groups, which might possibly be applied to other hierarchically hyperbolic groups. Finally, we show that the automorphisms groups of our quotients, as well as their abstract commensurators, coincide with the groups themselves. Our results hold for a wider family of quotients, namely those whose kernel act by sufficiently large translations on the curve graph. This class also includes quotients by suitable powers of a pseudo-Anosov element.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide conditions under which a Riemann surface $X$ is the asymptotic boundary of a convex co-compact hyperbolic manifold, homeomorphic to a handlebody, of negative renormalized volume. We prove that this is the case when there are on $X$ enough closed curves of short enough hyperbolic length.</description>

      <title>$c_\text{eff}$ from Surgery and Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\widehat{Z}$ invariants, rigorously defined for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds, are expected--on physical grounds--to exist for every closed, oriented 3-manifold. Several prescriptions have been proposed to extend their definition to generic plumbings by reversing the orientation of a negative definite plumbing, thus turning it into a positive definite one. Two existing proposals are relevant for this paper: (i) the regularized $+1/r$-surgery conjecture combined with the false-mock modular conjecture, and (ii) a construction based on resurgence and a false theta function duality. In this note, we compare these proposals on the class of Brieskorn homology spheres $\Sigma\left(s,t,rst\pm1\right)$ and find that they are incompatible in general. Our diagnostic is the effective central charge, $c_{\text{eff}}$, which governs the asymptotic growth of coefficients of $\widehat{Z}$. First, we prove that the upper bound on $c_{\text{eff}}$ from prescription (i) is governed by the Ramanujan theta function, which regularizes the surgery formula. Second, we develop numerical and modular tools that deliver the lower bounds as well as exact values via mixed mock-modular analysis. Complementing this, we also study $c_{\text{eff}}$ for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds which allow for a better comparison of pairs of 3-manifolds related by orientation reversal. As a result, we find that for some Brieskorn spheres the surgery and false-mock prescriptions violate the expected relation between $c_{\text{eff}}$, Chern-Simons invariants and non-abelian flat connections. These findings underscore $\widehat{Z}$ as a sensitive probe of the "positive side" of $\widehat{Z}$-theory.</description>
