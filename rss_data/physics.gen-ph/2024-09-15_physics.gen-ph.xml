      <title>Advanced Mathematical Approaches to Symmetry Breaking in High-Dimensional Field Theories: The Roles of Laurent Series, Residues, and Winding Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the advanced mathematical frameworks used to analyze symmetry breaking in high-dimensional field theories, emphasizing the roles of Laurent series, residues, and winding numbers. Symmetry breaking is fundamental in various physical contexts, such as high-energy physics, condensed matter physics, and cosmology. The study addresses how these mathematical tools enable the decomposition of complex field behaviors near singularities, revealing the intricate dynamics of symmetry breaking. Laurent series facilitate the expansion of fields into manageable terms, particularly around critical points. Residues provide a direct link between local field behavior and global physical properties, playing a crucial role in effective action formulations and renormalization processes. Winding numbers offer a topological perspective, quantifying how fields wrap around singularities and identifying stable topological structures like vortices, solitons, and monopoles. Extending these methods to (3+1) dimensions highlights the complexity of symmetry breaking in higher-dimensional scenarios, where advanced group theory and topological invariants are necessary to describe non-linear interactions. The findings underscore the importance of integrating these mathematical techniques into modern theoretical physics, with potential applications in quantum gravity, string theory, and the study of topological phases of matter. Future directions include further exploration of higher-dimensional extensions and their implications for understanding the fundamental nature of symmetry, topology, and field dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Role of Fractional Dimension in Study Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12898</link>

Abstract: In this study, we explore the field of physics through the lens of fractional dimensionality. We propose that space is not confined to integer dimensions alone but can also be understood as a superposition of spaces that exist between these integer dimensions. The concept of fractional dimensional space arises from the idea that the space between integer dimensions is filled, which occurs through the application of a fractional derivative operator (the local part) that rotates the integer dimension to encompass all spaces between two integers. We introduce five foundational axioms that provide a mathematical framework for studying physics from this fractional dimensional perspective. To illustrate the framework's utility, we present three scenarios: static systems, linear trajectories, and quadratic trajectories. In this context, motion along linear or quadratic trajectories within a fractional dimensional space corresponds to an inertial reference frame or an accelerated system, respectively, in classical physics. Moreover, we propose that the coupling of space and time, commonly referred to as space-time, is better understood as space-dimension-time within this framework, where the dimension serves as an interconnecting platform. Finally, we derive the wave equation from the perspective of fractional dimensions, focusing on linear trajectories in fractional dimensional space. This approach provides new insights into the behavior of electromagnetic waves in both lossless and lossy media, and it offers a fresh interpretation of the Doppler effect and gravitational redshift (or blueshift) phenomena from the standpoint of fractional dimensionality.</description>
