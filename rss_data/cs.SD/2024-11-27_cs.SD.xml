      <title>DiM-Gestor: Co-Speech Gesture Generation with Adaptive Layer Normalization Mamba-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech-driven gesture generation using transformer-based generative models represents a rapidly advancing area within virtual human creation. However, existing models face significant challenges due to their quadratic time and space complexities, limiting scalability and efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce DiM-Gestor, an innovative end-to-end generative model leveraging the Mamba-2 architecture. DiM-Gestor features a dual-component framework: (1) a fuzzy feature extractor and (2) a speech-to-gesture mapping module, both built on the Mamba-2. The fuzzy feature extractor, integrated with a Chinese Pre-trained Model and Mamba-2, autonomously extracts implicit, continuous speech features. These features are synthesized into a unified latent representation and then processed by the speech-to-gesture mapping module. This module employs an Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN)-enhanced Mamba-2 mechanism to uniformly apply transformations across all sequence tokens. This enables precise modeling of the nuanced interplay between speech features and gesture dynamics. We utilize a diffusion model to train and infer diverse gesture outputs. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations conducted on the newly released Chinese Co-Speech Gestures dataset corroborate the efficacy of our proposed model. Compared with Transformer-based architecture, the assessments reveal that our approach delivers competitive results and significantly reduces memory usage, approximately 2.4 times, and enhances inference speeds by 2 to 4 times. Additionally, we released the CCG dataset, a Chinese Co-Speech Gestures dataset, comprising 15.97 hours (six styles across five scenarios) of 3D full-body skeleton gesture motion performed by professional Chinese TV broadcasters.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of ASR Methods for Speech Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent techniques for speech deepfake detection often rely on pre-trained self-supervised models. These systems, initially developed for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), have proved their ability to offer a meaningful representation of speech signals, which can benefit various tasks, including deepfake detection. In this context, pre-trained models serve as feature extractors and are used to extract embeddings from input speech, which are then fed to a binary speech deepfake detector. The remarkable accuracy achieved through this approach underscores a potential relationship between ASR and speech deepfake detection. However, this connection is not yet entirely clear, and we do not know whether improved performance in ASR corresponds to higher speech deepfake detection capabilities. In this paper, we address this question through a systematic analysis. We consider two different pre-trained self-supervised ASR models, Whisper and Wav2Vec 2.0, and adapt them for the speech deepfake detection task. These models have been released in multiple versions, with increasing number of parameters and enhanced ASR performance. We investigate whether performance improvements in ASR correlate with improvements in speech deepfake detection. Our results provide insights into the relationship between these two tasks and offer valuable guidance for the development of more effective speech deepfake detectors.</description>

      <title>Scaling Speech-Text Pre-training with Synthetic Interleaved Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech language models (SpeechLMs) accept speech input and produce speech output, allowing for more natural human-computer interaction compared to text-based large language models (LLMs). Traditional approaches for developing SpeechLMs are constrained by the limited availability of unsupervised speech data and parallel speech-text data, which are significantly less abundant than text pre-training data, thereby limiting their scalability as LLMs. We propose a novel approach to scaling speech-text pre-training by leveraging large-scale synthetic interleaved data derived from text corpora, eliminating the need for parallel speech-text datasets. Our method efficiently constructs speech-text interleaved data by sampling text spans from existing text corpora and synthesizing corresponding speech spans using a text-to-token model, bypassing the need to generate actual speech. We also employ a supervised speech tokenizer derived from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model by incorporating a vector-quantized bottleneck into the encoder. This supervised training approach results in discrete speech tokens with strong semantic preservation even at lower sampling rates (e.g. 12.5Hz), while still maintaining speech reconstruction quality. Starting from a pre-trained language model and scaling our pre-training to 1 trillion tokens (with 600B synthetic interleaved speech-text data), we achieve state-of-the-art performance in speech language modeling and spoken question answering, improving performance on spoken questions tasks from the previous SOTA of 13% (Moshi) to 31%. We further demonstrate that by fine-tuning the pre-trained model with speech dialogue data, we can develop an end-to-end spoken chatbot that achieves competitive performance comparable to existing baselines in both conversational abilities and speech quality, even operating exclusively in the speech domain.</description>

      <title>Visatronic: A Multimodal Decoder-Only Model for Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new task -- generating speech from videos of people and their transcripts (VTTS) -- to motivate new techniques for multimodal speech generation. This task generalizes the task of generating speech from cropped lip videos, and is also more complicated than the task of generating generic audio clips (e.g., dog barking) from videos and text. Multilingual versions of the task could lead to new techniques for cross-lingual dubbing. We also present a decoder-only multimodal model for this task, which we call Visatronic. This model embeds vision, text and speech directly into the common subspace of a transformer model and uses an autoregressive loss to learn a generative model of discretized mel-spectrograms conditioned on speaker videos and transcripts of their speech. By embedding all modalities into a common subspace, Visatronic can achieve improved results over models that use only text or video as input. Further, it presents a much simpler approach for multimodal speech generation compared to prevailing approaches which rely on lip-detectors and complicated architectures to fuse modalities while producing better results. Since the model is flexible enough to accommodate different ways of ordering inputs as a sequence, we carefully explore different strategies to better understand the best way to propagate information to the generative steps. To facilitate further research on VTTS, we will release (i) our code, (ii) clean transcriptions for the large-scale VoxCeleb2 dataset, and (iii) a standardized evaluation protocol for VTTS incorporating both objective and subjective metrics.</description>

      <title>Video-Guided Foley Sound Generation with Multimodal Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating sound effects for videos often requires creating artistic sound effects that diverge significantly from real-life sources and flexible control in the sound design. To address this problem, we introduce MultiFoley, a model designed for video-guided sound generation that supports multimodal conditioning through text, audio, and video. Given a silent video and a text prompt, MultiFoley allows users to create clean sounds (e.g., skateboard wheels spinning without wind noise) or more whimsical sounds (e.g., making a lion's roar sound like a cat's meow). MultiFoley also allows users to choose reference audio from sound effects (SFX) libraries or partial videos for conditioning. A key novelty of our model lies in its joint training on both internet video datasets with low-quality audio and professional SFX recordings, enabling high-quality, full-bandwidth (48kHz) audio generation. Through automated evaluations and human studies, we demonstrate that MultiFoley successfully generates synchronized high-quality sounds across varied conditional inputs and outperforms existing methods.

      <title>Learning Spatially-Aware Language and Audio Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans can picture a sound scene given an imprecise natural language description. For example, it is easy to imagine an acoustic environment given a phrase like "the lion roar came from right behind me!". For a machine to have the same degree of comprehension, the machine must know what a lion is (semantic attribute), what the concept of "behind" is (spatial attribute) and how these pieces of linguistic information align with the semantic and spatial attributes of the sound (what a roar sounds like when its coming from behind). State-of-the-art audio foundation models which learn to map between audio scenes and natural textual descriptions, are trained on non-spatial audio and text pairs, and hence lack spatial awareness. In contrast, sound event localization and detection models are limited to recognizing sounds from a fixed number of classes, and they localize the source to absolute position (e.g., 0.2m) rather than a position described using natural language (e.g., "next to me"). To address these gaps, we present ELSA a spatially aware-audio and text embedding model trained using multimodal contrastive learning. ELSA supports non-spatial audio, spatial audio, and open vocabulary text captions describing both the spatial and semantic components of sound. To train ELSA: (a) we spatially augment the audio and captions of three open-source audio datasets totaling 4,738 hours of audio, and (b) we design an encoder to capture the semantics of non-spatial audio, and the semantics and spatial attributes of spatial audio using contrastive learning. ELSA is competitive with state-of-the-art for both semantic retrieval and 3D source localization. In particular, ELSA achieves +2.8% mean audio-to-text and text-to-audio R@1 above the baseline, and outperforms by -11.6{\deg} mean-absolute-error in 3D source localization over the baseline.</description>

      <title>Tiny-Align: Bridging Automatic Speech Recognition and Large Language Model on the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combination of Large Language Models (LLM) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), when deployed on edge devices (called edge ASR-LLM), can serve as a powerful personalized assistant to enable audio-based interaction for users. Compared to text-based interaction, edge ASR-LLM allows accessible and natural audio interactions. Unfortunately, existing ASR-LLM models are mainly trained in high-performance computing environments and produce substantial model weights, making them difficult to deploy on edge devices. More importantly, to better serve users' personalized needs, the ASR-LLM must be able to learn from each distinct user, given that audio input often contains highly personalized characteristics that necessitate personalized on-device training. Since individually fine-tuning the ASR or LLM often leads to suboptimal results due to modality-specific limitations, end-to-end training ensures seamless integration of audio features and language understanding (cross-modal alignment), ultimately enabling a more personalized and efficient adaptation on edge devices. However, due to the complex training requirements and substantial computational demands of existing approaches, cross-modal alignment between ASR audio and LLM can be challenging on edge devices. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient cross-modal alignment framework that bridges ASR and LLMs on edge devices to handle personalized audio input. Our framework enables efficient ASR-LLM alignment on resource-constrained devices like NVIDIA Jetson Orin (8GB RAM), achieving 50x training time speedup while improving the alignment quality by more than 50\%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study efficient ASR-LLM alignment on resource-constrained edge devices.</description>

      <title>DeltaKWS: A 65nm 36nJ/Decision Bio-inspired Temporal-Sparsity-Aware Digital Keyword Spotting IC with 0.6V Near-Threshold SRAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces DeltaKWS, to the best of our knowledge, the first $\Delta$RNN-enabled fine-grained temporal sparsity-aware KWS IC for voice-controlled devices. The 65 nm prototype chip features a number of techniques to enhance performance, area, and power efficiencies, specifically: 1) a bio-inspired delta-gated recurrent neural network ($\Delta$RNN) classifier leveraging temporal similarities between neighboring feature vectors extracted from input frames and network hidden states, eliminating unnecessary operations and memory accesses; 2) an IIR BPF-based FEx that leverages mixed-precision quantization, low-cost computing structure and channel selection; 3) a 24 kB 0.6 V near-$V_\text{TH}$ weight SRAM that achieves 6.6X lower read power than the foundry-provided SRAM. From chip measurement results, we show that the DeltaKWS achieves an 11/12-class GSCD accuracy of 90.5%/89.5% respectively and energy consumption of 36 nJ/decision in 65 nm CMOS process. At 87% temporal sparsity, computing latency and energy/inference are reduced by 2.4X/3.4X, respectively. The IIR BPF-based FEx, $\Delta$RNN accelerator, and 24 kB near-$V_\text{TH}$ SRAM blocks occupy 0.084 mm$^{2}$, 0.319 mm$^{2}$, and 0.381 mm$^{2}$ respectively (0.78 mm$^{2}$ in total).</description>

      <title>The ParlaSpeech Collection of Automatically Generated Speech and Text Datasets from Parliamentary Proceedings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent significant improvements in speech and language technologies come both from self-supervised approaches over raw language data as well as various types of explicit supervision. To ensure high-quality processing of spoken data, the most useful type of explicit supervision is still the alignment between the speech signal and its corresponding text transcript, which is a data type that is not available for many languages. In this paper, we present our approach to building large and open speech-and-text-aligned datasets of less-resourced languages based on transcripts of parliamentary proceedings and their recordings. Our starting point are the ParlaMint comparable corpora of transcripts of parliamentary proceedings of 26 national European parliaments. In the pilot run on expanding the ParlaMint corpora with aligned publicly available recordings, we focus on three Slavic languages, namely Croatian, Polish, and Serbian. The main challenge of our approach is the lack of any global alignment between the ParlaMint texts and the available recordings, as well as the sometimes varying data order in each of the modalities, which requires a novel approach in aligning long sequences of text and audio in a large search space. The results of this pilot run are three high-quality datasets that span more than 5,000 hours of speech and accompanying text transcripts. Although these datasets already make a huge difference in the availability of spoken and textual data for the three languages, we want to emphasize the potential of the presented approach in building similar datasets for many more languages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Album sequencing is a critical part of the album production process. Recently, a data-driven approach was proposed that sequences general collections of independent media by extracting the narrative essence of the items in the collections. While this approach implies an album sequencing technique, it is not widely accessible to a less technical audience, requiring advanced knowledge of machine learning techniques to use. To address this, we introduce a new user-friendly web-based tool that allows a less technical audience to upload music tracks, execute this technique in one click, and subsequently presents the result in a clean visualization to the user. To both increase the number of templates available to the user and address shortcomings of previous work, we also introduce a new direct transformer-based album sequencing method. We find that our more direct method outperforms a random baseline but does not reach the same performance as the narrative essence approach. Both methods are included in our web-based user interface, and this -- alongside a full copy of our implementation -- is publicly available at https://github.com/dylanashley/automatic-album-sequencing</description>

      <title>ESARM: 3D Emotional Speech-to-Animation via Reward Model from Automatically-Ranked Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel 3D speech-to-animation (STA) generation framework designed to address the shortcomings of existing models in producing diverse and emotionally resonant animations. Current STA models often generate animations that lack emotional depth and variety, failing to align with human expectations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel STA model coupled with a reward model. This combination enables the decoupling of emotion and content under audio conditions through a cross-coupling training approach. Additionally, we develop a training methodology that leverages automatic quality evaluation of generated facial animations to guide the reinforcement learning process. This methodology encourages the STA model to explore a broader range of possibilities, resulting in the generation of diverse and emotionally expressive facial animations of superior quality. We conduct extensive empirical experiments on a benchmark dataset, and the results validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in generating high-quality, emotionally rich 3D animations that are better aligned with human preferences.</description>

      <title>WavChat: A Survey of Spoken Dialogue Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in spoken dialogue models, exemplified by systems like GPT-4o, have captured significant attention in the speech domain. Compared to traditional three-tier cascaded spoken dialogue models that comprise speech recognition (ASR), large language models (LLMs), and text-to-speech (TTS), modern spoken dialogue models exhibit greater intelligence. These advanced spoken dialogue models not only comprehend audio, music, and other speech-related features, but also capture stylistic and timbral characteristics in speech. Moreover, they generate high-quality, multi-turn speech responses with low latency, enabling real-time interaction through simultaneous listening and speaking capability. Despite the progress in spoken dialogue systems, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys that systematically organize and analyze these systems and the underlying technologies. To address this, we have first compiled existing spoken dialogue systems in the chronological order and categorized them into the cascaded and end-to-end paradigms. We then provide an in-depth overview of the core technologies in spoken dialogue models, covering aspects such as speech representation, training paradigm, streaming, duplex, and interaction capabilities. Each section discusses the limitations of these technologies and outlines considerations for future research. Additionally, we present a thorough review of relevant datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmarks from the perspectives of training and evaluating spoken dialogue systems. We hope this survey will contribute to advancing both academic research and industrial applications in the field of spoken dialogue systems.

      <title>Gotta Hear Them All: Sound Source Aware Vision to Audio Generation</title>

Abstract: Vision-to-audio (V2A) synthesis has broad applications in multimedia. Recent advancements of V2A methods have made it possible to generate relevant audios from inputs of videos or still images. However, the immersiveness and expressiveness of the generation are limited. One possible problem is that existing methods solely rely on the global scene and overlook details of local sounding objects (i.e., sound sources). To address this issue, we propose a Sound Source-Aware V2A (SSV2A) generator. SSV2A is able to locally perceive multimodal sound sources from a scene with visual detection and cross-modality translation. It then contrastively learns a Cross-Modal Sound Source (CMSS) Manifold to semantically disambiguate each source. Finally, we attentively mix their CMSS semantics into a rich audio representation, from which a pretrained audio generator outputs the sound. To model the CMSS manifold, we curate a novel single-sound-source visual-audio dataset VGGS3 from VGGSound. We also design a Sound Source Matching Score to measure localized audio relevance. This is to our knowledge the first work to address V2A generation at the sound-source level. Extensive experiments show that SSV2A surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both generation fidelity and relevance. We further demonstrate SSV2A's ability to achieve intuitive V2A control by compositing vision, text, and audio conditions. Our SSV2A generation can be tried and heard at https://ssv2a.github.io/SSV2A-demo .</description>
