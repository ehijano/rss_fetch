      <title>Matrix Scaling: a New Heuristic for the Feedback Vertex Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a digraph $G$, a set $F\subseteq V(G)$ is said to be a feedback vertex set (FVS) if $G-F$ is acyclic. The problem of finding a smallest FVS is NP-hard. We present a matrix scaling technique for finding feedback vertex sets in un-weighted directed graphs that runs in $O(|F|\log(|V|)|V|^{2})$ time. Our technique is empirically shown to produce smaller feedback vertex sets than other known heuristics and in a shorter amount of time.</description>

      <title>A Caro-Wei bound for induced linear forests in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A well-known result due to Caro (1979) and Wei (1981) states that every graph $G$ has an independent set of size at least $\sum_{v\in V(G)} \frac{1}{d(v) + 1}$, where $d(v)$ denotes the degree of vertex $v$. Alon, Kahn, and Seymour (1987) showed the following generalization: For every $k\geq 0$, every graph $G$ has a $k$-degenerate induced subgraph with at least $\sum_{v \in V(G)}\min\{1, \frac {k+1}{d(v)+1}\}$ vertices. In particular, for $k=1$, every graph $G$ with no isolated vertices has an induced forest with at least $\sum_{v\in V(G)} \frac{2}{d(v) + 1}$ vertices. Akbari, Amanihamedani, Mousavi, Nikpey, and Sheybani (2019) conjectured that, if $G$ has minimum degree at least $2$, then one can even find an induced linear forest of that order in $G$, that is, a forest where each component is a path.
  In this paper, we prove this conjecture and show a number of related results. In particular, if there is no restriction on the minimum degree of $G$, we show that there are infinitely many ``best possible'' functions $f$ such that $\sum_{v\in V(G)} f(d(v))$ is a lower bound on the maximum order of a linear forest in $G$, and we give a full characterization of all such functions $f$.</description>

      <title>Treewidth 2 in the Planar Graph Product Structure Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every planar graph is contained in $H_1\boxtimes H_2\boxtimes K_2$ for some graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$ both with treewidth 2. This resolves a question of Liu, Norin and Wood [arXiv:2410.20333]. We also show this result is best possible: for any $c \in \mathbb{N}$, there is a planar graph $G$ such that for any tree $T$ and graph $H$ with $\text{tw}(H) \leqslant 2$, $G$ is not contained in $H \boxtimes T \boxtimes K_c$.</description>

      <title>The Beginner's Textbook for Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a cryptographic scheme that enables computations to be performed directly on encrypted data, as if the data were in plaintext. After all computations are performed on the encrypted data, it can be decrypted to reveal the result. The decrypted value matches the result that would have been obtained if the same computations were applied to the plaintext data.
  FHE supports basic operations such as addition and multiplication on encrypted numbers. Using these fundamental operations, more complex computations can be constructed, including subtraction, division, logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, XOR, NAND, MUX), and even advanced mathematical functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, and trigonometric functions (e.g., sin, cos). These functions can be implemented either as exact formulas or as approximations, depending on the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy.
  Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables privacy-preserving machine learning by allowing a server to process the client's data in its encrypted form through an ML model. With FHE, the server learns neither the plaintext version of the input features nor the inference results. Only the client, using their secret key, can decrypt and access the results at the end of the service protocol.FHE can also be applied to confidential blockchain services, ensuring that sensitive data in smart contracts remains encrypted and confidential while maintaining the transparency and integrity of the execution process. Other applications of FHE include secure outsourcing of data analytics, encrypted database queries, privacy-preserving searches, efficient multi-party computation for digital signatures, and more.
  This article is designed to help the reader understand how FHE works from the mathematical level.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Number of Pieces in Continuous Piecewise Affine Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity of continuous piecewise affine (CPA) functions can be measured by the number of pieces $p$ or the number of distinct affine functions $n$. For CPA functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$, this paper shows an upper bound of $p=O(n^{d+1})$ and constructs a family of functions achieving a lower bound of $p=\Omega(n^{d+1-\frac{c}{\sqrt{\log_2(n)}}})$.</description>
