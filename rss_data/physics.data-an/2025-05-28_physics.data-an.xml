      <title>Bayesian Learning in Structural Dynamics: A Comprehensive Review and Emerging Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian learning has emerged as a compelling and vital research direction in the field of structural dynamics, offering a probabilistic lens to understand and refine the analysis of complex dynamical systems. This review meticulously traces the three-decade evolution of Bayesian learning in structural dynamics, illuminating core principles, groundbreaking methodologies, and diverse applications that have significantly influenced the field. The narrative commences by delving into the basics of Bayesian theory, clarifying essential concepts, and introducing primary methods for deriving posterior distributions, with an in-depth exploration of three types: Laplace approximation, stochastic sampling, and variational inference. Subsequently, the text explores the implementation of two types of Bayesian learning in structural dynamics: physical model learning and data-centric statistical model learning. Physical model learning emphasizes inferring physical model parameters within a Bayesian framework for system identification and prediction, while statistical model learning integrates Bayesian learning methodologies into data-centric statistical modeling within probabilistic machine learning. Both types resonate across various applications, such as modal analysis, model updating, damage detection, and reliability updating, highlighting their pivotal role in enhancing comprehension of dynamical systems and decision-making. The paper also navigates obstacles by proposing ways to enhance existing Bayesian inference strategies. Distinguished from previous research, this study offers a thorough examination of both traditional and cutting-edge Bayesian methods. It not only underscores the transformative influence of Bayesian approaches but also serves as a beacon, guiding researchers in the judicious selection and refinement of suitable methods for various challenges in structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Brightify: A tool for calculating brightness in neutron sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brightness is a critical metric for optimizing the design of neutron sources and beamlines, yet there is no direct way to calculate brightness within most Monte Carlo packages used for neutron source simulation. In this paper, we present Brightify, an open-source Python-based tool designed to calculate brightness from Monte Carlo Particle List (MCPL) files, which can be extracted from several Monte Carlo simulation packages. Brightify provides an efficient computational approach to calculate brightness for any particle type and energy spectrum recorded in the MCPL file. It enables localized, directionally-resolved brightness evaluations by scanning across both spatial and angular domains, facilitating the identification of positions and directions corresponding to maximum brightness. This functionality is particularly valuable for identifying brightness hotspots and helping fine-tune the design of neutron sources for optimal performance. We validate Brightify against standard methods, such as surface current tally and point estimator tally, and demonstrate its accuracy and adaptability, particularly in high-resolution analyses. By overcoming the limitations of traditional methods, Brightify streamlines neutron source re-optimization, reduces computational burden, and accelerates source development workflows. The full code is available on the Brightify GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann-Informed Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional interpretations of probability, whether frequentist or subjective, make no reference to the concept of energy. In this paper, we propose that assigning hypothetical energy levels to the outcomes of a random variable can yield improved probability estimates. We apply this Boltzmann-informed approach to the context of sports betting and analyze five seasons of the English Premier League data. It was found that when used to compute the Kelly criterion, Boltzmann-informed probabilities consistently outperform probabilities derived from the original betting odds. These findings demonstrate the value of integrating energy-informed probabilities into studying complex social systems.</description>

      <title>Prospect of Constraining the EoS of Neutron Stars Using Post-Merger Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-merger gravitational-wave emission from a binary neutron star merger carries crucial information about the equation of state (EoS) of matter at high temperatures. Current gravitational wave detectors have limited sensitivities at post-merger frequencies in the range [1.5, 4] kHz. Therefore, valuable inferences can only be made after combining information from multiple (BNS) events. Criswell et al. [Phys. Rev. D 107, 043021 (2023)] carries out an injection study to infer the radius posterior for a $1.6 M_{\odot}$ NS by combining the information from injected BNS events via the hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) formulation. This formulation utilizes empirical relations that connect the peak frequency of the post-merger remnant with the chirp mass of the system, and the EoS proxy parameter $R_{1.6}$. In this work, we extend the HBI formulation to other EoS proxy parameters (i.e., the radius of (NS), $R_{1.X}$, with masses 1.2, 1.4, and 1.8 $M_{\odot}$) and combine the four $R_{1.X}$ posteriors through the piecewise polytropic EoS model to obtain measurable constraints on the EoS of the NS. We show that the NS radii can be constrained to within $\sim$1 km ( $\sim$0.55 km) assuming uniform (astrophysical) prior on $R_{1.X}$ for injections in the A+ noise. We also study systematic biases in the analysis coming from the limitations of empirical relations.</description>

      <title>Limits of absolute vector magnetometry with NV centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has become a widely used platform for quantum sensing. The four NV axes in mono-crystalline diamond specifically allow for vector magnetometry, with magnetic-field sensitivities reaching down to $\mathrm{fT}/ \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. The current literature primarily focuses on improving the precision of NV-based magnetometers. Here, we study the experimental accuracy of determining the magnetic field from measured spin-resonance frequencies via solving the NV Hamiltonian. We derive exact, analytical, and fast-to-compute formulas for calculating resonance frequencies from a known magnetic-field vector, and vice versa, formulas for calculating the magnetic-field vector from measured resonance frequencies. Additionally, the accuracy of often-used approximations is assessed. Finally, we promote using the Voigt profile as a fit model to determine the linewidth of measured resonances accurately. An open-source Python package accompanies our analysis.</description>

      <title>Nature-inspired optimization, the Philippine Eagle, and cosmological parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise and accurate estimation of cosmological parameters is crucial for understanding the Universe's dynamics and addressing cosmological tensions. In this methods paper, we explore bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, including the Improved Multi-Operator Differential Evolution scheme and the Philippine Eagle Optimization Algorithm (PEOA), alongside the relatively known genetic algorithm, for cosmological parameter estimation. Using mock data that underlay a true fiducial cosmology, we test the viability of each optimization method to recover the input cosmological parameters with confidence regions generated by bootstrapping on top of optimization. We compare the results with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in terms of accuracy and precision, and show that PEOA performs comparably well under the specific circumstances provided. Understandably, Bayesian inference and optimization serve distinct purposes, but comparing them highlights the potential of nature-inspired algorithms in cosmological analysis, offering alternative pathways to explore parameter spaces and validate standard results.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy at Late Time $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical properties of dark energy through a detailed analysis of its equation of state parameter $w(z)$ as a function of redshift. We derive a general expression for $w(z)$ from the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) equations, establishing a direct relationship between the dark energy equation of state and the observable Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and its derivative. Using the relation $w(z) = -1 + \frac{2(1+z)}{3H(z)} \frac{dH}{dz}$, we develop an approximation method valid for $z \lesssim 1$ that accounts for the changing balance between matter and dark energy contributions to cosmic expansion. We compare our theoretical framework with recent observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2, analysing how well the commonly used Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization $w(z) = -1 + w_a \frac{z}{1+z}$ captures the evolution of dark energy. Our results indicate that the dark energy equation of state exhibits a monotonic evolution with redshift, transitioning from deceleration to acceleration around $z \approx 0.7$. Notably, our predicted $w_{\mathrm{DE}}$ remains greater than $-1$ across all redshifts, avoiding phantom energy scenarios that would violate the null energy condition. This work demonstrates how precise measurements of the cosmic expansion history can constrain the nature of dark energy and provides a framework for testing dynamical dark energy models against current and future cosmological observations.</description>
