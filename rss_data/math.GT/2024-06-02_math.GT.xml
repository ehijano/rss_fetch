      <title>The bounded cohomology of transformation groups of Euclidean spaces and discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the groups of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are boundedly acyclic, in all regularities. This is the first full computation of the bounded cohomology of a transformation group that is not compactly supported, and it implies that many characteristic classes of flat $\mathbb{R}^n$- and $S^n$-bundles are unbounded. We obtain the same result for the group of homeomorphisms of the disc that restrict to the identity on the boundary, and for the homeomorphism group of the non-compact Cantor set. In the appendix, Alexander Kupers proves a controlled version of the annulus theorem which we use to study the bounded cohomology of the homeomorphism group of the discs.</description>

      <title>Relatively hyperbolic groups with planar boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we prove a version of Martin and Skora's conjecture that convergence groups on the $2$-sphere are covered by Kleinian groups. Given a relatively hyperbolic group pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$ with planar boundary and no Sierpinski carpet or cut points in its boundary, and with $G$ one ended and virtually having no $2$-torsion, we show that $G$ is virtually Kleinian. We also give applications to various versions of the Cannon conjecture and to convergence groups acting on $S^2$.</description>

      <title>Gorenstein contractions of multiscale differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiscale differentials arise as limits of holomorphic differentials with prescribed orders of zeros on nodal curves. In this paper, we address the conjecture concerning Gorenstein contractions of multiscale differentials, initially proposed by Ranganathan and Wise and further elaborated upon by Battistella and Bozlee. Specifically, we show that multiscale differentials can be contracted into Gorenstein singularities level by level from the top down. At each level, these differentials can descend to become generators of the dualizing bundle at the singularities. Additionally, the global residue condition, which governs the smoothability of multiscale differentials, is a special case of the residue condition for descent differentials.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Homology and 3-dimensional Besse Manifolds with vanishing first Chern class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we will show that one can use certain types of symplectic homology as an invariant of 3-dimensional Besse manifolds, which are contact manifolds admitting a periodic Reeb flow and hence allow Seifert fibration structure. For simplicity, we will assume our contact structures to be trivial plane bundles. We will also compute Robbin-Salamon indices of periodic Reeb orbits in Besse manifolds and obtain more precise information about the symplectic homology. In the computations, invariants of the Seifert fibration such as the Euler number and the orbifold Euler characteristic play an important role.</description>

      <title>Modular knots obey the Chebotarev law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.10745v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We refine McMullen's construction of sequences of knots in $S^3$ obeying the Chebotarev law by invoking the notion of rational Fried surgeries, and improve the argument for the planetary links. Furthermore, we point out that the set of modular knots around any torus knot in $S^3$ together with the missing torus knot also obey the Chebotarev law, and deduce an equidistribution theorem for the classical Rademacher symbol.</description>
