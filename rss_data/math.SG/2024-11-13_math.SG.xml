      <title>Open enumerative mirror symmetry for lines in the mirror quintic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mirror symmetry gives predictions for the genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of a closed Calabi-Yau variety in terms of period integrals on a mirror family of Calabi-Yau varieties. We deduce an analogous mirror theorem for the open Gromov-Witten invariants of a certain Lagrangian immersion in the quintic threefold from homological mirror symmetry, assuming the existence of a negative cyclic open-closed map. The open Gromov-Witten (OGW) invariants of this immersed Lagrangian coincide with relative period integrals on the mirror quintic calculated by Walcher. The immersed Lagrangian in question supports a one-dimensional family of objects in the Fukaya category mirror to coherent sheaves supported on lines in the mirror quintic. Its OGW invariants are irrational numbers contained in a nontrivial algebraic extension of the rationals, and admit an expression similar to the Ooguri-Vafa multiple cover formula involving special values of a Dirichlet L-function. This field also arises as the invariant trace field of the hyperbolic pieces in the JSJ decomposition of the domain of the immersion. These results are consistent with predictions on the existence of hyperbolic Lagrangian submanifolds in the quintic put forward by Jockers-Morrison-Walcher.</description>

      <title>Topological entropy of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms: a persistence homology and Floer theory perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.03983v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study topological entropy of compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms from a perspective of persistence homology and Floer theory. We introduce barcode entropy, a Floer-theoretic invariant of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism, measuring exponential growth under iterations of the number of not-too-short bars in the barcode of the Floer complex. We prove that the barcode entropy is bounded from above by the topological entropy and, conversely, that the barcode entropy is bounded from below by the topological entropy of any hyperbolic invariant set, e.g., a hyperbolic horseshoe. As a consequence, we conclude that for Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of surfaces the barcode entropy is equal to the topological entropy.</description>

      <title>Counting bare curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a class of perturbations of the Cauchy-Riemann equations for maps from curves to a Calabi-Yau threefold. Our perturbations vanish on components of zero symplectic area. For generic 1-parameter families of perturbations, the locus of solution curves without zero-area components is compact, transversely cut out, and satisfies certain natural coherence properties.
  For curves without boundary, this yields a reduced Gromov-Witten theory in the sense of Zinger. That is, we produce a well defined invariant given by counting only maps without components of zero symplectic area, and we show that this invariant is related to the usual Gromov-Witten invariant by the expected change of variables.
  For curves with boundary on Maslov zero Lagrangians, our construction provides an `adequate perturbation scheme' with the needed properties to set up the skein-valued curve counting, as axiomatized in our previous work.
  The main technical content is the construction, over the Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder Gromov-Witten configuration spaces, of perturbations to which the `ghost bubble censorship' argument can be applied. Certain local aspects of this problem were resolved in our previous work. The key remaining difficulty is to ensure inductive compatibilities, despite the non-existence of marked-point-forgetting maps for the configuration spaces.</description>

      <title>The number of periodic points of surface symplectic diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use symplectic tools to establish a smooth variant of Franks theorem for a closed orientable surface of positive genus $g$; it implies that a symplectic diffeomorphism isotopic to the identity with more than $2g-2$ fixed points, counted homologically, has infinitely many periodic points. Furthermore, we present examples of symplectic diffeomorphisms with a prescribed number of periodic points. In particular, we construct symplectic flows on surfaces possessing only one fixed point and no other periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Filtrations on equivariant quantum cohomology and Hilbert-Poincar\'e series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Floer theory induces a filtration by ideals on equivariant quantum cohomology of symplectic manifolds equipped with a $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. In particular, this gives rise to Hilbert-Poincar\'e polynomials on ordinary cohomology that depend on Floer theory. En route, the paper develops structural properties of filtrations on three versions of equivariant Floer cohomology. We obtain an explicit presentation for equivariant symplectic cohomology in the Calabi-Yau and Fano settings.</description>
