      <title>Sampling Density Compensation using Fast Fourier Deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density Compensation Function (DCF) is widely used in non-Cartesian MRI reconstruction, either for direct Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT) reconstruction or for iterative undersampled reconstruction. Current state-of-the-art methods involve time-consuming tens of iterations, which is one of the main hurdles for widespread application of the highly efficient non-Cartesian MRI. In this paper, we propose an efficient, non-iterative method to calculate DCF for arbitrary non-Cartesian $k$-space trajectories using Fast Fourier Deconvolution. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is able to yield DCF for 3D non-Cartesian reconstruction in around 20 seconds, achieving orders of magnitude speed improvement compared to the state-of-the-art method while achieving similar reconstruction quality.</description>

      <title>Distributional Consistency Loss: Beyond Pointwise Data Terms in Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing. Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal (regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity). Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements, often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses, and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional fidelity losses for inverse problems.</description>

      <title>CURE: Confidence-driven Unified Reasoning Ensemble Framework for Medical Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA (95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Deep Few-view High-resolution Photon-counting CT at Halved Dose for Extremity Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) for extremity allows multi-energy high-resolution (HR) imaging but its radiation dose can be further improved. Despite the great potential of deep learning techniques, their application in HR volumetric PCCT reconstruction has been challenged by the large memory burden, training data scarcity, and domain gap issues. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for PCCT image reconstruction at halved dose and doubled speed validated in a New Zealand clinical trial. Specifically, we design a patch-based volumetric refinement network to alleviate the GPU memory limitation, train network with synthetic data, and use model-based iterative refinement to bridge the gap between synthetic and clinical data. Our results in a reader study of 8 patients from the clinical trial demonstrate a great potential to cut the radiation dose to half that of the clinical PCCT standard without compromising image quality and diagnostic value.</description>

      <title>Advanced X-rays techniques for research-oriented high-resolution imaging of articular cartilage: a scoping review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Articular cartilage is a musculoskeletal soft tissue renowned for its unique mechanical properties. Understanding both its hierarchical structure and the interplay between its constituents could shed light on the mechanical competence of the tissue. Therefore, rheologic approaches based on high-resolution non-destructive imaging techniques are desired. In this context, X-ray imaging could ideally accomplish this task. Nevertheless, the nature of articular cartilage translates into poor contrast using conventional absorption modality. To overcome this limitation, several approaches can be embraced. X-ray visibility of articular cartilage can be increased with the use of radiopaque contrast agents. Therefore, further discrimination of structures could be provided by spectral techniques, pivoting on either multi-energy acquisitions or photon-counting technology. Alternatively, phase-contrast techniques unveil details typically undetected with conventional approaches. Phase-contrast imaging, based on the intrinsic decrement in the refractive index of the tissue, can be achieved with different configurations and implementations, including distinct X-ray sources and optical elements. Additionally, some phase-contrast techniques retrieve the small-angle scattering-based dark-field signal, relatable to sub-pixel structures. This scoping review aims to catalogue the application of these advanced X-ray techniques to articular cartilage imaging, following PRISMA guidelines. It discusses their advantages, limitations, and includes an overview of rheologic applications to articular cartilage.</description>

      <title>Towards polarization-enhanced PET: Study of random background in polarization-correlated Compton events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a medical imaging modality that utilizes positron-emitting isotopes, such as Ga-68 and F-18, for many diagnostic purposes. The positron annihilates with an electron from the surrounding area, creating two photons of 511 keV energy and opposite momenta, entangled in their orthogonal polarizations. When each photon undergoes a Compton scattering process, the difference of their azimuthal scattering angles reflects the initial orthogonality of their polarizations, peaking at $\pm$90$^{\circ}$. This type of correlation is not yet utilized in conventional PET scanners, but could potentially offer an energy-independent method for background reduction. Measurements of these kinds of correlations can be achieved using Compton polarimeters, built from a single layer of segmented scintillating crystals such as Gadolinium Aluminium Gallium Garnet doped with Cerium (GAGG:Ce), read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). In this paper, we study the signal-to-random background ratios in measurements of these correlated annihilation photons from coincidence time spectra across clinically relevant source activities, from $\sim$200 MBq to $\sim$378 MBq. These are then compared to the standard single-pixel (photoelectric) measurements. We find that the signal-to-random background ratios (SBRs) obtained from the polarization-correlated events for Compton scattering angles $\theta_{1,2}\in[72^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}]$ and azimuthal angle difference $\Delta\phi=90^{\circ}\pm20^{\circ}$ are consistently higher than those from single-pixel events, with the ratio of their SBR values of 1.23. The SBR of the selected events also increases with the polarimetric modulation factor $\mu$, gaining $\sim$50\% in value during the experiment.</description>
