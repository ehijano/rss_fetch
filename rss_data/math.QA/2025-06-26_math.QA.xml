      <title>Faithful Burau-like representations of some rank two Garside groups and torus knot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a method to produce faithful representations of the groups $G(n,m)=\langle X, Y \ \vert \ X^m = Y^n \rangle$ in $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{C}[t^{\pm 1}, q^{\pm 1}])$. These groups are Garside groups and the Garside normal forms of elements of the corresponding monoid can be explicitly recovered from the matrices, in the spirit of Krammer's proof of the linearity of Artin's braid groups. We use this method to construct several explicit faithful representations of the above groups, among which a representation which generalizes the reduced Burau representation of $B_3 \cong G(2,3)$ to a large family of groups of the form $G(n,m)$ with $n$, $m$ coprime (which are torus knot groups). Like the Burau representation, this representation specializes to a representation of a reflection-like quotient that we previously introduced, called \textit{$2$-toric reflection group}. As a byproduct we get a "Burau representation" for some exceptional complex braid groups, which also shows that the latter embed into their Hecke algebra.</description>

      <title>2-categorical affine symmetries of quantum enveloping algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We produce 2-representations of the positive part of affine quantum enveloping algebras on their finite-dimensional counterparts in type $A_n$. These 2-representations naturally extend the right-multiplication 2-representation of $U_q^+(\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1})$ on itself and are closely related to evaluation morphisms of quantum groups. We expect that our 2-representation exists in all simple types and show that the corresponding 1-representation exists in types $D_4$ and $C_2$. We also show that a certain quotient of our 1-representation in type $A_n$ is isomorphic to a prefundamental representation. We use this to provide a new proof of the prefundamental representation character formulas in these cases.</description>

      <title>Canonical bases of tensor products of integrable highest weight modules arising from framed constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a quantum group, we prove that the canonical bases of the tensor products of its integrable highest weight modules can be obtained from the canonical bases of the simple integrable highest modules of a bigger quantum group. As a result, based on the positivity of the canonical bases of the simple integrable highest modules due to Lusztig, we prove that the canonical bases of the tensor products have the positivity.</description>

      <title>Formal extension of noncommutative tensor-triangular support varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a support variety theory defined on the compact part of a monoidal triangulated category, we define an extension to the non-compact part following the blueprint of Benson--Carlson--Rickard, Benson--Iyengar--Krause, Balmer--Favi, and Stevenson. We generalize important aspects of the theory of extended support varieties to the noncommutative case, and give characterizations of when an extended support theory detects the zero object, under certain assumptions. In particular, we show that when the original support variety theory is based on a Noetherian topological space, detects the zero object, satisfies a generalized tensor product property, and comes equipped with a comparison map, then the extended support variety also detects the zero object. In the case of stable categories of finite tensor categories, this gives conditions under which the central cohomological support admits an extension that detects the zero object, confirming part of a recent conjecture made by the second author together with Nakano and Yakimov.</description>

      <title>A family of orthogonal functions on the unit circle and a new multilateral matrix inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Bailey's very-well-poised $_6\psi_6$ summation, we show that a specific sequence of well-poised bilateral basic hypergeometric $_3\psi_3$ series form a family of orthogonal functions on the unit circle. We further extract a bilateral matrix inverse from Dougall's ${}_2H_2$ summation which we use, in combination with the Pfaff--Saalsch\"utz summation, to derive a summation for a particular bilateral hypergeometric $_3H_3$ series. We finally provide multivariate extensions of the bilateral matrix inverse and the $_3H_3$ summation in the setting of hypergeometric series associated to the root system $A_r$.</description>

      <title>Anti-pre-Novikov algebras, quasi-triangular and factorizable anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Firstly, we introduce a notion of anti-pre-Novikov algebras as a new framework for decomposing Novikov algebras. Anti-O-operators on Novikov algebras are developed to provide an algebraic framework for constructing anti-pre-Novikov algebras. Secondly, we introduce a notion of anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras as the bialgebra structures corresponding to a double construction of symmetric quasi-Frobenius Novikov algebras, which is characterized by certain matched pairs of Novikov algebras as well as the compatible anti-pre-Novikov algebras. The study of the coboundary case induces the anti-pre-Novikov Yang-Baxter equation (APN-YBE), whose skew-symmetric solutions yield coboundary anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras. The notion of O-operators on anti-pre-Novikov algebras is studied to construct skew-symmetric solutions of the APN-YBE. Thirdly, we investigate quasi-triangular and factorizable anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras as a special class of coboundary anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras. The solutions of the APN-YBE whose symmetric parts are invariant give rise to a quasi-triangular anti-pre-Novikov bialgebra. Moreover, relative Rota-Baxter operators with weights are introduced to demonstrate solutions of the APN-YBE whose symmetric parts are invariant. Finally, we introduce a notion of quadratic Rota-Baxter anti-pre-Novikov algebras, which is one to one correspondence to a factorizable anti-pre-Novikov bialgebra.</description>
