      <title>Thin-Shell-SfT: Fine-Grained Monocular Non-rigid 3D Surface Tracking with Neural Deformation Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction of highly deformable surfaces (e.g. cloths) from monocular RGB videos is a challenging problem, and no solution provides a consistent and accurate recovery of fine-grained surface details. To account for the ill-posed nature of the setting, existing methods use deformation models with statistical, neural, or physical priors. They also predominantly rely on nonadaptive discrete surface representations (e.g. polygonal meshes), perform frame-by-frame optimisation leading to error propagation, and suffer from poor gradients of the mesh-based differentiable renderers. Consequently, fine surface details such as cloth wrinkles are often not recovered with the desired accuracy. In response to these limitations, we propose ThinShell-SfT, a new method for non-rigid 3D tracking that represents a surface as an implicit and continuous spatiotemporal neural field. We incorporate continuous thin shell physics prior based on the Kirchhoff-Love model for spatial regularisation, which starkly contrasts the discretised alternatives of earlier works. Lastly, we leverage 3D Gaussian splatting to differentiably render the surface into image space and optimise the deformations based on analysis-bysynthesis principles. Our Thin-Shell-SfT outperforms prior works qualitatively and quantitatively thanks to our continuous surface formulation in conjunction with a specially tailored simulation prior and surface-induced 3D Gaussians.

      <title>Zero-Shot Human-Object Interaction Synthesis with Multimodal Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) synthesis is important for various applications, ranging from virtual reality to robotics. However, acquiring 3D HOI data is challenging due to its complexity and high cost, limiting existing methods to the narrow diversity of object types and interaction patterns in training datasets. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot HOI synthesis framework without relying on end-to-end training on currently limited 3D HOI datasets. The core idea of our method lies in leveraging extensive HOI knowledge from pre-trained Multimodal Models. Given a text description, our system first obtains temporally consistent 2D HOI image sequences using image or video generation models, which are then uplifted to 3D HOI milestones of human and object poses. We employ pre-trained human pose estimation models to extract human poses and introduce a generalizable category-level 6-DoF estimation method to obtain the object poses from 2D HOI images. Our estimation method is adaptive to various object templates obtained from text-to-3D models or online retrieval. A physics-based tracking of the 3D HOI kinematic milestone is further applied to refine both body motions and object poses, yielding more physically plausible HOI generation results. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating open-vocabulary HOIs with physical realism and semantic diversity.</description>

      <title>Perceptually Accurate 3D Talking Head Generation: New Definitions, Speech-Mesh Representation, and Evaluation Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in speech-driven 3D talking head generation have made significant progress in lip synchronization. However, existing models still struggle to capture the perceptual alignment between varying speech characteristics and corresponding lip movements. In this work, we claim that three criteria -- Temporal Synchronization, Lip Readability, and Expressiveness -- are crucial for achieving perceptually accurate lip movements. Motivated by our hypothesis that a desirable representation space exists to meet these three criteria, we introduce a speech-mesh synchronized representation that captures intricate correspondences between speech signals and 3D face meshes. We found that our learned representation exhibits desirable characteristics, and we plug it into existing models as a perceptual loss to better align lip movements to the given speech. In addition, we utilize this representation as a perceptual metric and introduce two other physically grounded lip synchronization metrics to assess how well the generated 3D talking heads align with these three criteria. Experiments show that training 3D talking head generation models with our perceptual loss significantly improve all three aspects of perceptually accurate lip synchronization. Codes and datasets are available at https://perceptual-3d-talking-head.github.io/.</description>

      <title>PGC: Physics-Based Gaussian Cloth from a Single Pose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to reconstruct simulation-ready garments with intricate appearance. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often struggle to balance the need for accurate garment reconstruction with the ability to generalize to new poses and body shapes or require large amounts of data to achieve this. In contrast, our method only requires a multi-view capture of a single static frame. We represent garments as hybrid mesh-embedded 3D Gaussian splats, where the Gaussians capture near-field shading and high-frequency details, while the mesh encodes far-field albedo and optimized reflectance parameters. We achieve novel pose generalization by exploiting the mesh from our hybrid approach, enabling physics-based simulation and surface rendering techniques, while also capturing fine details with Gaussians that accurately reconstruct garment details. Our optimized garments can be used for simulating garments on novel poses, and garment relighting. Project page: https://phys-gaussian-cloth.github.io .</description>

      <title>PhysAnimator: Physics-Guided Generative Cartoon Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating hand-drawn animation sequences is labor-intensive and demands professional expertise. We introduce PhysAnimator, a novel approach for generating physically plausible meanwhile anime-stylized animation from static anime illustrations. Our method seamlessly integrates physics-based simulations with data-driven generative models to produce dynamic and visually compelling animations. To capture the fluidity and exaggeration characteristic of anime, we perform image-space deformable body simulations on extracted mesh geometries. We enhance artistic control by introducing customizable energy strokes and incorporating rigging point support, enabling the creation of tailored animation effects such as wind interactions. Finally, we extract and warp sketches from the simulation sequence, generating a texture-agnostic representation, and employ a sketch-guided video diffusion model to synthesize high-quality animation frames. The resulting animations exhibit temporal consistency and visual plausibility, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in creating dynamic anime-style animations.

      <title>B\'ezier Splatting for Fast and Differentiable Vector Graphics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentiable vector graphics (VGs) are widely used in image vectorization and vector synthesis, while existing representations are costly to optimize and struggle to achieve high-quality rendering results for high-resolution images. This work introduces a new differentiable VG representation, dubbed B\'ezier splatting, that enables fast yet high-fidelity VG rasterization. B\'ezier splatting samples 2D Gaussians along B\'ezier curves, which naturally provide positional gradients at object boundaries. Thanks to the efficient splatting-based differentiable rasterizer, B\'ezier splatting achieves over 20x and 150x faster per forward and backward rasterization step for open curves compared to DiffVG. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive pruning and densification strategy that dynamically adjusts the spatial distribution of curves to escape local minima, further improving VG quality. Experimental results show that B\'ezier splatting significantly outperforms existing methods with better visual fidelity and 10x faster optimization speed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing attention for 3D reconstruction due to their high temporal resolution, low latency, and high dynamic range. They capture per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously, allowing accurate reconstruction under fast motion and challenging lighting conditions. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of event-driven 3D reconstruction methods, including stereo, monocular, and multimodal systems. We further categorize recent developments based on geometric, learning-based, and hybrid approaches. Emerging trends, such as neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian splatting with event data, are also covered. The related works are structured chronologically to illustrate the innovations and progression within the field. To support future research, we also highlight key research gaps and future research directions in dataset, experiment, evaluation, event representation, etc.</description>

      <title>MARVEL-40M+: Multi-Level Visual Elaboration for High-Fidelity Text-to-3D Content Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D content from text prompts remains a significant challenge in computer vision due to the limited size, diversity, and annotation depth of the existing datasets. To address this, we introduce MARVEL-40M+, an extensive dataset with 40 million text annotations for over 8.9 million 3D assets aggregated from seven major 3D datasets. Our contribution is a novel multi-stage annotation pipeline that integrates open-source pretrained multi-view VLMs and LLMs to automatically produce multi-level descriptions, ranging from detailed (150-200 words) to concise semantic tags (10-20 words). This structure supports both fine-grained 3D reconstruction and rapid prototyping. Furthermore, we incorporate human metadata from source datasets into our annotation pipeline to add domain-specific information in our annotation and reduce VLM hallucinations. Additionally, we develop MARVEL-FX3D, a two-stage text-to-3D pipeline. We fine-tune Stable Diffusion with our annotations and use a pretrained image-to-3D network to generate 3D textured meshes within 15s. Extensive evaluations show that MARVEL-40M+ significantly outperforms existing datasets in annotation quality and linguistic diversity, achieving win rates of 72.41% by GPT-4 and 73.40% by human evaluators.

      <title>Sensitivity to Redirected Walking Considering Gaze, Posture, and Luminance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the correlations between redirected walking (RDW) rotation gains and patterns in users' posture and gaze data during locomotion in virtual reality (VR). To do this, we conducted a psychophysical experiment to measure users' sensitivity to RDW rotation gains and collect gaze and posture data during the experiment. Using multilevel modeling, we studied how different factors of the VR system and user affected their physiological signals. In particular, we studied the effects of redirection gain, trial duration, trial number (i.e., time spent in VR), and participant gender on postural sway, gaze velocity (a proxy for gaze stability), and saccade and blink rate. Our results showed that, in general, physiological signals were significantly positively correlated with the strength of redirection gain, the duration of trials, and the trial number. Gaze velocity was negatively correlated with trial duration. Additionally, we measured users' sensitivity to rotation gains in well-lit (photopic) and dimly-lit (mesopic) virtual lighting conditions. Results showed that there were no significant differences in RDW detection thresholds between the photopic and mesopic luminance conditions.</description>
