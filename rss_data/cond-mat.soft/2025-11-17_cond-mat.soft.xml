      <title>Solid-angle based nearest-neighbor algorithm adapted for systems with low coordination number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearest-neighbor identification is central to the analysis of local structure in condensed matter systems. The solid-angle-based nearest-neighbor (SANN) algorithm is widely used offering a parameter-free and computationally efficient alternative to cutoff- or Voronoi-based methods. Unfortunately, however, in systems with low coordination numbers, SANN tends to identify many particles as neighbors that are outside the nearest neighbor shell. Here, we propose a solution to this problem. Specifically, we propose a geometric modification, the ``inscribed circle modification'', that resolves systematic overcounting in low-coordination lattices without introducing free parameters. We benchmark the modified algorithm (mSANN) against Voronoi and the original SANN algorithm in crystalline, quasicrystalline, and heterogeneous systems, and demonstrate that it provides robust and low-cost neighbor identification across both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Mastering Rheology: A Strategic and practical guide for empowering all users</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rheology, the study of flow, plays a vital role in diverse industries such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and food. In this work, we provide a comprehensive introduction to fundamental rheological experiments and offer a strategic approach to understand the rheological behavior of any soft condensed material. We emphasize the importance of design of a good rheological experiment, input parameter and analysis of the obtained output parameter. Through the standard design of the experiment and systematic conduction of rheological experiments, we can estimate a broad range of rheological parameters such as viscosity, modulus, stability, yield stress, nonlinear behavior of the material. Furthermore, we also discuss methods for detecting and good practices for reducing some of the common experimental errors that may arise. We also present a comprehensive range of advanced rheological characterization techniques that can be pursued to gain deeper insights into the mechanical behavior and structural evolution of soft materials. Through this work, we attempt to make rheology more accessible to researchers from various domains to incorporate rheology into their characterization study and enable them to confidently navigate rheological studies and contribute to material development.</description>

      <title>Sliding of cylindrical shell into a rigid hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fitting two different materials is a versatile methodology in manufacturing complex structures. One of the canonical models for fitting is the snap-fit model, in which flexible materials and rigid structures are assembled by pushing their interlocking components together. The assembly via snap-fit is often accompanied by large deformations of flexible structures and abrupt force drops, highlighting the role of elasticity, geometry, and contact friction. Despite several model studies revealing fundamental mechanics for snap-fit, the current snap-fit design relies on prototyping and empirical rules. In this paper, we analyze a snap-fit model in which a naturally curved beam slips into a rigid hole. We construct an analytical model based on the theory of elastica with contact friction and demonstrate that its predictions are in excellent quantitative agreement with both simulations and experiments. We find three distinct sliding modes: Folding, Pinning, and Unfolding. The classification is systematically organized in a phase diagram based on the geometric parameters of the shells and the hole. Our study complements existing approaches by providing a predictive framework for contact-based structures that involve friction, elasticity, and geometry, and sheds light on a unified understanding of the interactions between an elastic and a rigid body.</description>

      <title>Chiral active gyrator: Memory induced direction reversal of rotational motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the dynamics of a chiral active Ornstein Uhlenbeck particle confined in a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic trap. The particle is driven by chirality and is coupled to two orthogonal heat baths, potentially at two different temperatures. Using both analytical approach and numerical simulation, we explore the rotational dynamics of the particle in both viscous and viscoelastic environments. While the particle is suspended in a viscoelastic bath, characterized by a finite memory time scale, we interestingly observe that even in the absence of a temperature gradient, the angular momentum changes its sign as a function of the memory timescale, reflecting the direction reversal of rotational motion of the particle, and it is solely due to the interplay between memory and chirality. This direction reversal is a distinct memory-induced phenomenon and does not occur in the viscous limit. Moreover, increasing (or decreasing) the temperature gradient shifts the magnitude of the angular momentum further into the negative (or positive) direction, selecting a unique direction of rotation for the particle throughout the activity-memory parameter space. However, in the viscous limit, the direction reversal of the rotational motion is still possible but occurs only across a neutral line in parameter space, along which the contributions from both chirality and thermal anisotropy to the net angular momentum exactly cancel. These results highlight a distinct mechanism for directional control in active systems, with memory enabling reversal phenomena unique to viscoelastic media.</description>

      <title>Emergent Synchronization and Defect Dynamics in Confined Chiral Active Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic interactions can generate rich emergent structures in active matter systems. Using large-scale hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that hydrodynamic coupling alone can drive spontaneous self-organization across a hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales in confined suspensions of torque-driven particles at moderate Reynolds numbers. Spinners first self-assemble into dimers, which crystallize into a hexatic lattice and subsequently undergo a collective tilting instability. The resulting tilted dimers rotate and synchronize through hydrodynamic repulsion, which can be tuned by the Reynolds number. Upon synchronization, the polar director develops splay and bend deformations and nucleates topological defects with charges of $\pm1$. These defects induce long-wavelength concentration gradients and drive crystal vortex dynamics spanning hundreds of particle diameters. Our results reveal a purely hydrodynamic route to synchronization and defect-mediated dynamics in chiral active matter, without explicit alignment rules or interparticle forces.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity-induced enhanced target-finding dynamics of confined colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The encounter of diffusing entities underlies a wide range of natural phenomena. The dynamics of these first-passage processes are strongly influenced by the geometry of the system, for example through confining boundaries. Confinement, which alters the diffusion of microscopic particles through both conservative and hydrodynamic interactions, emerges as a key ingredient for modeling realistic environments. In this Letter, we investigate the impact of confinement on the first-passage statistics of a diffusing particle. This diffusive motion is probed, with nanometric precision, by combining \textit{state-of-the-art} holographic microscopy with advanced statistical inference methods. Our experimental and numerical results provide a comprehensive understanding of this process, which is governed by the coupling between gravitational, screened electrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, as well as thermal fluctuations. We further show that confinement can either slow down or enhance the typical first-passage kinetics, depending on the experimental parameters and considered direction of space. In particular, the observed boost in wall-normal target-finding efficiency appears to be a direct consequence of the non-Gaussian displacement distribution induced by the near-surface effects, and the associated increased probability of large displacements. As the latter are rare events, our findings may be of relevance to rationalize confined chemical reactions, or biological \textit{winners-take-all} stochastic processes near boundaries.</description>

      <title>Models for active particles: common features and differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems of active particles can show a large variety of collective behavior. In theory, two aspects determine the collective behavior: the model at the particle level and the parameter regime. While many studies consider a single model and study its parameter regime, here, we focus on the former aspect. Motivated by experiments that study dilute suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in a self-generated oxygen gradient, we compare various models with external field-dependent motility to understand how the collective behavior changes between models. We vary the particle-particle interaction from no interactions to steric interactions, the particle shape from round disks to dumbbells, the self-propulsion mechanism from constant speed to rocking motion, and the particle's center of mass from the geometric center to off-center. We find that changes in the model of the active agents can lead to similar statistics in the dilute regime and different collective behavior in the dense regime. We conclude that active particle models do not easily generalize for different real active agents, but instead require a clear understanding of the agents' microscopic properties.</description>

      <title>From LRO to Disorder via QLRO in Spatially Inhomogeneous Polar Flock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collective behavior of a polar flock in an inhomogeneous environment in two-dimensions. The inhomogeneity is modelled by introducing regions at random locations on the substrate with higher noise but accessible for the flock to move. Hence inside such regions the particles orientation get randomised. Such inhomogeneities are different from the physical disorder, which obstructs the space for the incoming particles. The study focuses on how the phase behavior of polar flock changes by tuning the packing fraction of inhomogeneity. As packing fraction increases, the system crosses over from long-range to quasi long range order and ultimately to a disordered phase, while the order disorder transition for flocking changes from discontinuous to continuous. The resultant phase behavior of polar flock patterns here is comparable to that exhibited in the presence of physical disorder.</description>

      <title>Terradynamics and design of tip-extending robotic anchors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most engineered pilings require substantially more force to be driven into the ground than they can resist during extraction. This requires relatively heavy equipment for insertion, which is problematic for anchoring in hard-to-access sites, including in extraterrestrial locations. In contrast, for tree roots, the external reaction force required to extract is much greater than required to insert--little more than the weight of the seed initiates insertion. This is partly due to the mechanism by which roots insert into the ground: tip extension. Proof-of-concept robotic prototypes have shown the benefits of using this mechanism, but a rigorous understanding of the underlying granular mechanics and how they inform the design of a robotic anchor is lacking. Here, we study the terradynamics of tip-extending anchors compared to traditional piling-like intruders, develop a set of design insights, and apply these to create a deployable robotic anchor. Specifically, we identify that to increase an anchor's ratio of extraction force to insertion force, it should: (i) extend beyond a critical depth; (ii) include hair-like protrusions; (iii) extend near-vertically, and (iv) incorporate multiple smaller anchors rather than a single large anchor. Synthesizing these insights, we developed a lightweight, soft robotic, root-inspired anchoring device that inserts into the ground with a reaction force less than its weight. We demonstrate that the 300 g device can deploy a series of temperature sensors 45 cm deep into loose Martian regolith simulant while anchoring with an average of 120 N, resulting in an anchoring-to-weight ratio of 40:1.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength transparent microfluidics for UV-visible spectroscopy and X-ray scattering studies of photoactive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microfluidic devices are increasingly used in synchrotron-based experiments to deliver and probe liquid samples, offering advantages such as minimal sample consumption and reduced radiation damage. Despite their growing use, few devices have been specifically designed for monitoring liquids under photoexcitation, a promising approach for fast structural transitions. Here, a microfluidic device that is transparent to X-rays in one direction, and simulaneously transmits UV and visible light in the perpendicular direction is presented. The device is fabricated using lamination and UV lithography on a dry-film resist, eliminating the need for cleanroom facilities and simplifying production. Its multi-wavelength transparency was validated through UV-visible spectroscopy, where photoexcitation at different wavelengths induced reversible trans-to-cis isomerization of azobenzene and fluoro-azobenzene. X-ray transparency was validated through Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) measurements on hemoglobin and CO-ligated hemoglobin sensitive to quaternary structural changes. These resusts confirm the suitability of the device for resolving protein structures and photoinduced conformational dynamics. The design further supports, as some proof of concept results show, temperature-jump and time resolved pump-probe experiments, providing a versatile platform for studying structural evolution in liquid samples using synchrotron SAXS.</description>

Abstract: We report on an experimental active matter system with motion restricted to four cardinal directions. Our particles are magnetite-doped colloidal spheres driven by the Quincke electrorotational instability. The absence of a magnetic field (|B| = 0) leads to circular trajectories interspersed with short spontaneous runs. Intermediate fields (|B| &lt; 20 mT) linearize the motion along the axis perpendicular to B. At high magnetic fields, we observe the surprising emergence of a second, distinct linearization along the axis parallel to B. With numerical simulations, we show that this behavior can be explained by anisotropic magnetic susceptibility</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study, through discrete element simulations, the discharge of granular materials through a circular orifice on the base of a cylindrical silo forced by a surcharge. At the beginning of the discharge, for a high granular column, the flow rate $Q_{\rm ini}$ scales as in the Beverloo equation for free discharge. However, we find that the flow rate $Q_{\rm end}$ attained at the end of the forced discharge scales as $\sqrt{\rho_b P}D_o^3/D_s$, with $\rho_b$ the bulk density, $P$ the pressure applied by the overweight, $D_o$ the orifice diameter and $D_s$ the silo diameter. We use the work$-$energy theorem to formulate an equation for the flow rate $Q_{\rm end}$ that predicts the scalings only in part. We discuss the new challenges offered by the phenomenology of strongly forced granular flows.</description>

      <title>Self-organization, Memory and Learning: From Driven Disordered Systems to Living Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disordered systems subject to a fluctuating environment can self-organize into a complex history-dependent response, retaining a memory of the driving. In sheared amorphous solids, self-organization is established by the emergence of a persistent system of mechanical instabilities that can repeatedly be triggered by the driving, leading to a state of high mechanical reversibility. As a result of self-organization, the response of the system becomes correlated with the dynamics of its environment, which can be viewed as a sensing mechanism of the system's environment. Such phenomena emerge across a wide variety of soft matter systems, suggesting that they are generic and hence may depend very little on the underlying specifics. We review self-organization in driven amorphous solids, concluding with a discussion of what self-organization in driven disordered systems can teach us about how simple organisms sense and adapt to their changing environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large deformations play a central role in the shape transformations of slender active and biological structures. A classical example is the eversion of the Volvox embryo, which demonstrates the need for shell theories that can describe large strains, rotations, and the presence of incompatible stimuli. In this work, a reduced two-dimensional morphoelastic energy is derived from a fully nonlinear three-dimensional formulation. The resulting model describes the mechanics of naturally curved shells subjected to non-elastic stimuli acting through the thickness, thereby extending previous morphoelastic theories developed for flat plates to curved geometries. Two representative constitutive laws, corresponding to incompressible Neo-Hookean and compressible Ciarlet-Geymonat materials, are examined to highlight the influence of both geometric and constitutive nonlinearities. The theory is applied to the eversion of open and closed spherical shells and to vesiculation processes in biological systems. The results clarify how compressibility, curvature, and through-the-thickness kinematics govern snap-through and global deformation, extending classical morphoelastic shell models. The framework provides a consistent basis for analyzing large deformations in elastic and biological shells driven by non-mechanical stimuli.</description>

Abstract: Vascular networks exhibit a remarkable diversity of architectures and transport mechanisms across biological systems. Inspired by embolism propagation in plant xylem, where air invades water-filled conduits under negative pressure, we study air penetration in compliant one-dimensional hydrodynamic networks experiencing mass loss by pervaporation. Using a theoretical framework grounded in biomimetic models, we show that embolism dynamics are shaped by the interplay between network compliance and viscous dissipation. In particular, the competition between two timescales (the pressure diffusion time, $\tau_\mathrm{diff}$, and the pervaporation time, $\tau_\mathrm{pv}$) governs the emergence of complex, history-dependent behaviors. When $\tau_\mathrm{diff} \sim \tau_\mathrm{pv}$, we uncover a nonlinear feedback between the internal pressure field and the embolism front, leading to transient depressurization and delayed interface motion. These results offer a minimal framework for understanding embolism dynamics in slow-relaxing vascular systems and provide design principles for soft microfluidic circuits with tunable, nonlinear response.</description>

      <title>Glassy dynamics in active epithelia emerge from an interplay of mechanochemical feedback and crowding</title>

Abstract: Glassy dynamics in active biological cells remain a subject of debate, as cellular activity rarely slows enough for true glassy features to emerge. In this study, we address this paradox of glassy dynamics in epithelial cells by integrating experimental observations with an active vertex model. We demonstrate that while crowding is essential, it is not sufficient for glassy dynamics to emerge. A mechanochemical feedback loop (MCFL), mediated by cell shape changes through the contractile actomyosin network, is required to drive glass transition in dense epithelial tissues, as revealed via a crosstalk between actin-based cell clustering and dynamic heterogeneity in experiments. Incorporating MCFL into the vertex model reveals contrasting results from those previously predicted by theories -- that glassy dynamics can emerge even at high cellular activity if the strength of the MCFL remains high. We show that the MCFL can counteract cell division-induced fluidisation and enable glassy dynamics to emerge through active cell-to-cell communication. Furthermore, our analysis reveals, for the first time, the existence of novel collective mechanochemical oscillations that arise from the crosstalk of two MCFLs. Together, we demonstrate that an interplay between crowding and active mechanochemical feedback enables the emergence of glass-like traits and collective biochemical oscillations in epithelial tissues with active cell-cell contacts.</description>
