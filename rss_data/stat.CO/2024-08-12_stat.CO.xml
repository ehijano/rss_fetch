      <title>Identification of the parameters of complex constitutive models: Least squares minimization vs. Bayesian updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study the common least-squares minimization approach is compared to the Bayesian updating procedure. In the content of material parameter identification the posterior parameter density function is obtained from its prior and the likelihood function of the measurements. By using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm \cite{Hastings1970}, the global density function including local peaks can be computed. Thus this procedure enables an accurate evaluation of the global parameter quality. However, the computational effort is remarkable larger compared to the minimization approach. Thus several methodologies for an efficient approximation of the likelihood function are discussed in the present study.</description>

      <title>When Pearson $\chi^2$ and other divisible statistics are not goodness-of-fit tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thousands of experiments are analyzed and papers are published each year involving the statistical analysis of grouped data. While this area of statistics is often perceived - somewhat naively - as saturated, several misconceptions still affect everyday practice, and new frontiers have so far remained unexplored. Researchers must be aware of the limitations affecting their analyses and what are the new possibilities in their hands. Motivated by this need, the article introduces a unifying approach to the analysis of grouped data which allows us to study the class of divisible statistics - that includes Pearson's $\chi^2$, the likelihood ratio as special cases - with a fresh perspective. The contributions collected in this manuscript span from modeling and estimation to distribution-free goodness-of-fit tests. Perhaps the most surprising result presented here is that, in a sparse regime, all tests proposed in the literature are dominated by a class of weighted linear statistics.</description>
