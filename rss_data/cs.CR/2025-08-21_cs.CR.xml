      <title>CCFC: Core &amp; Core-Full-Core Dual-Track Defense for LLM Jailbreak Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious challenge to the safe deployment of large language models (LLMs). We introduce CCFC (Core &amp; Core-Full-Core), a dual-track, prompt-level defense framework designed to mitigate LLMs' vulnerabilities from prompt injection and structure-aware jailbreak attacks. CCFC operates by first isolating the semantic core of a user query via few-shot prompting, and then evaluating the query using two complementary tracks: a core-only track to ignore adversarial distractions (e.g., toxic suffixes or prefix injections), and a core-full-core (CFC) track to disrupt the structural patterns exploited by gradient-based or edit-based attacks. The final response is selected based on a safety consistency check across both tracks, ensuring robustness without compromising on response quality. We demonstrate that CCFC cuts attack success rates by 50-75% versus state-of-the-art defenses against strong adversaries (e.g., DeepInception, GCG), without sacrificing fidelity on benign queries. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-level defenses, offering a practical and effective solution for safer LLM deployment.</description>

      <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Multi-Task Detection and Attribution of LLM-Generated Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have demonstrated remarkable abilities in generating natural language. However, they also pose security and integrity challenges. Existing countermeasures primarily focus on distinguishing AI-generated content from human-written text, with most solutions tailored for English. Meanwhile, authorship attribution--determining which specific LLM produced a given text--has received comparatively little attention despite its importance in forensic analysis. In this paper, we present DA-MTL, a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously addresses both text detection and authorship attribution. We evaluate DA-MTL on nine datasets and four backbone models, demonstrating its strong performance across multiple languages and LLM sources. Our framework captures each task's unique characteristics and shares insights between them, which boosts performance in both tasks. Additionally, we conduct a thorough analysis of cross-modal and cross-lingual patterns and assess the framework's robustness against adversarial obfuscation techniques. Our findings offer valuable insights into LLM behavior and the generalization of both detection and authorship attribution.</description>

      <title>A Taxonomy and Methodology for Proof-of-Location Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital societies increasingly rely on trustworthy proofs of physical presence for services such as supply-chain tracking, e-voting, ride-sharing, and location-based rewards. Yet, traditional localization methods often lack cryptographic guarantees of where and when an entity was present, leaving them vulnerable to spoofing, replay, or collusion attacks. In response, research on Proof-of-Location (PoL) has emerged, with recent approaches combining distance bounding, distributed consensus, and privacy-enhancing techniques to enable verifiable, tamper-resistant location claims.
  As the design space for PoL systems grows in complexity, this paper provides a unified framework to help practitioners navigate diverse application needs. We first propose a taxonomy identifying four core domains: (1) cryptographic guarantees, (2) spatio-temporal synchronization, (3) trust and witness models, and (4) interaction and overhead. Building on this, we introduce a methodology to map application-specific requirements onto appropriate PoL architectures. We illustrate this process through three use cases (retail e-coupons, supply chain auditing, and physical e-voting), each showing how different constraints shape protocol choices. Overall, this work offers a structured approach to building secure, scalable, and interoperable PoL systems.</description>

      <title>SaMOSA: Sandbox for Malware Orchestration and Side-Channel Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-attacks on operational technology (OT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS) have increased tremendously in recent years with the proliferation of malware targeting Linux-based embedded devices of OT and CPS systems. Comprehensive malware detection requires dynamic analysis of execution behavior in addition to static analysis of binaries. Safe execution of malware in a manner that captures relevant behaviors via side-channels requires a sandbox environment. Existing Linux sandboxes are built for specific tasks, only capture one or two side-channels, and do not offer customization for different analysis tasks. We present the SaMOSA Linux sandbox that allows emulation of Linux malwares while capturing time-synchronized side-channels from four sources. SaMOSA additionally provides emulation of network services via FakeNet, and allows orchestration and customization of the sandbox environment via pipeline hooks. In comparison to existing Linux sandboxes, SaMOSA captures more side-channels namely system calls, network activity, disk activity, and hardware performance counters. It supports three architectures predominantly used in OT and CPS namely x86-64, ARM64, and PowerPC 64. SaMOSA fills a gap in Linux malware analysis by providing a modular and customizable sandbox framework that can be adapted for many malware analysis tasks. We present three case studies of three different malware families to demonstrate the advantages of SaMOSA.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private aggregate hints in mev-share</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flashbots recently released mev-share to empower users with control over the amount of information they share with searchers for extracting Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). Searchers require more information to maintain on-chain exchange efficiency and profitability, while users aim to prevent frontrunning by withholding information. After analyzing two searching strategies in mev-share to reason about searching techniques, this paper introduces Differentially-Private (DP) aggregate hints as a new type of hints to disclose information quantitatively. DP aggregate hints enable users to formally quantify their privacy loss to searchers, and thus better estimate the level of rebates to ask in return. The paper discusses the current properties and privacy loss in mev-share and lays out how DP aggregate hints could enhance the system for both users and searchers. We leverage Differential Privacy in the Trusted Curator Model to design our aggregate hints. Additionally, we explain how random sampling can defend against sybil attacks and amplify overall user privacy while providing valuable hints to searchers for improved backrunning extraction and frontrunning prevention.</description>

      <title>MultiFuzz: A Dense Retrieval-based Multi-Agent System for Network Protocol Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional protocol fuzzing techniques, such as those employed by AFL-based systems, often lack effectiveness due to a limited semantic understanding of complex protocol grammars and rigid seed mutation strategies. Recent works, such as ChatAFL, have integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide protocol fuzzing and address these limitations, pushing protocol fuzzers to wider exploration of the protocol state space. But ChatAFL still faces issues like unreliable output, LLM hallucinations, and assumptions of LLM knowledge about protocol specifications. This paper introduces MultiFuzz, a novel dense retrieval-based multi-agent system designed to overcome these limitations by integrating semantic-aware context retrieval, specialized agents, and structured tool-assisted reasoning. MultiFuzz utilizes agentic chunks of protocol documentation (RFC Documents) to build embeddings in a vector database for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling agents to generate more reliable and structured outputs, enhancing the fuzzer in mutating protocol messages with enhanced state coverage and adherence to syntactic constraints. The framework decomposes the fuzzing process into modular groups of agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically adapt fuzzing strategies based on the retrieved contextual knowledge. Experimental evaluations on the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) demonstrate that MultiFuzz significantly improves branch coverage and explores deeper protocol states and transitions over state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers such as NSFuzz, AFLNet, and ChatAFL. By combining dense retrieval, agentic coordination, and language model reasoning, MultiFuzz establishes a new paradigm in autonomous protocol fuzzing, offering a scalable and extensible foundation for future research in intelligent agentic-based fuzzing systems.</description>

      <title>Precision over Noise: Tailoring S3 Public Access Detection to Reduce False Positives in Cloud Security Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excessive and spurious alert generation by cloud security solutions is a root cause of analyst fatigue and operational inefficiencies. In this study, the long-standing issue of false positives from publicly accessible alerts in Amazon S3, as generated by a licensed cloud-native security solution, is examined. In a simulated production test environment, which consisted of over 1,000 Amazon S3 buckets with diverse access configurations, it was discovered that over 80\% of the alerts generated by default rules were classified as false positives, thus demonstrating the severity of the detection issue. This severely impacted detection accuracy and generated a heavier workload for analysts due to redundant manual triage efforts. For addressing this problem, custom detection logic was created as an exercise of the native rule customization capabilities of the solution. A unified titled ``S3 Public Access Validation and Data Exposure'' was created in an effort to consolidate different forms of alerts into one, context-aware logic that systematically scans ACL configurations, bucket policies, indicators of public exposure, and the presence of sensitive data, and then marks only those S3 buckets that indeed denote security risk and are publicly exposed on the internet with no authentication. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in false positives, more precise alert fidelity, and significant time saving for security analysts, thus demonstrating an actionable and reproducible solution to enhance the accuracy of security alerting in compliance-focused cloud environments.</description>

      <title>CoFacS -- Simulating a Complete Factory to Study the Security of Interconnected Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the digitization of industrial factories provides tremendous improvements for the production of goods, it also renders such systems vulnerable to serious cyber-attacks. To research, test, and validate security measures protecting industrial networks against such cyber-attacks, the security community relies on testbeds to simulate industrial systems, as utilizing live systems endangers costly components or even human life. However, existing testbeds focus on individual parts of typically complex production lines in industrial factories. Consequently, the impact of cyber-attacks on industrial networks as well as the effectiveness of countermeasures cannot be evaluated in an end-to-end manner. To address this issue and facilitate research on novel security mechanisms, we present CoFacS, the first COmplete FACtory Simulation that replicates an entire production line and affords the integration of real-life industrial applications. To showcase that CoFacS accurately captures real-world behavior, we validate it against a physical model factory widely used in security research. We show that CoFacS has a maximum deviation of 0.11% to the physical reference, which enables us to study the impact of physical attacks or network-based cyber-attacks. Moreover, we highlight how CoFacS enables security research through two cases studies surrounding attack detection and the resilience of 5G-based industrial communication against jamming.</description>

      <title>DOPA: Stealthy and Generalizable Backdoor Attacks from a Single Client under Challenging Federated Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is increasingly adopted for privacy-preserving collaborative training, but its decentralized nature makes it particularly susceptible to backdoor attacks. Existing attack methods, however, often rely on idealized assumptions and fail to remain effective under real-world constraints, such as limited attacker control, non-IID data distributions, and the presence of diverse defense mechanisms. To address this gap, we propose DOPA (Divergent Optimization Path Attack), a novel framework that simulates heterogeneous local training dynamics and seeks consensus across divergent optimization trajectories to craft universally effective and stealthy backdoor triggers. By leveraging consistency signals across simulated paths to guide optimization, DOPA overcomes the challenge of heterogeneity-induced instability and achieves practical attack viability under stringent federated constraints. We validate DOPA on a comprehensive suite of 12 defense strategies, two model architectures (ResNet18/VGG16), two datasets (CIFAR-10/TinyImageNet), and both mild and extreme non-IID settings. Despite operating under a single-client, black-box, and sparsely participating threat model, DOPA consistently achieves high attack success, minimal accuracy degradation, low runtime, and long-term persistence. These results demonstrate a more practical attack paradigm, offering new perspectives for designing robust defense strategies in federated learning systems</description>

      <title>Leuvenshtein: Efficient FHE-based Edit Distance Computation with Single Bootstrap per Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to calculating the Levenshtein (edit) distance within the framework of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), specifically targeting third-generation schemes like TFHE. Edit distance computations are essential in applications across finance and genomics, such as DNA sequence alignment. We introduce an optimised algorithm that significantly reduces the cost of edit distance calculations called Leuvenshtein. This algorithm specifically reduces the number of programmable bootstraps (PBS) needed per cell of the calculation, lowering it from approximately 94 operations -- required by the conventional Wagner-Fisher algorithm -- to just 1. Additionally, we propose an efficient method for performing equality checks on characters, reducing ASCII character comparisons to only 2 PBS operations. Finally, we explore the potential for further performance improvements by utilising preprocessing when one of the input strings is unencrypted. Our Leuvenshtein achieves up to $278\times$ faster performance compared to the best available TFHE implementation and up to $39\times$ faster than an optimised implementation of the Wagner-Fisher algorithm. Moreover, when offline preprocessing is possible due to the presence of one unencrypted input on the server side, an additional $3\times$ speedup can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Foe for Fraud: Transferable Adversarial Attacks in Credit Card Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Credit card fraud detection (CCFD) is a critical application of Machine Learning (ML) in the financial sector, where accurately identifying fraudulent transactions is essential for mitigating financial losses. ML models have demonstrated their effectiveness in fraud detection task, in particular with the tabular dataset. While adversarial attacks have been extensively studied in computer vision and deep learning, their impacts on the ML models, particularly those trained on CCFD tabular datasets, remains largely unexplored. These latent vulnerabilities pose significant threats to the security and stability of the financial industry, especially in high-value transactions where losses could be substantial. To address this gap, in this paper, we present a holistic framework that investigate the robustness of CCFD ML model against adversarial perturbations under different circumstances. Specifically, the gradient-based attack methods are incorporated into the tabular credit card transaction data in both black- and white-box adversarial attacks settings. Our findings confirm that tabular data is also susceptible to subtle perturbations, highlighting the need for heightened awareness among financial technology practitioners regarding ML model security and trustworthiness. Furthermore, the experiments by transferring adversarial samples from gradient-based attack method to non-gradient-based models also verify our findings. Our results demonstrate that such attacks remain effective, emphasizing the necessity of developing robust defenses for CCFD algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Incentive-Based Privacy-Preserving Smart Metering Protocol for Value-Added Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of smart grids and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) has revolutionized energy management. Unlike traditional power grids, smart grids benefit from two-way communication through AMI, which surpasses earlier automated meter reading (AMR). AMI enables diverse demand- and supply-side utilities such as accurate billing, outage detection, real-time grid control, load forecasting, and value-added services. Smart meters play a key role by delivering consumption values at predefined intervals to the utility provider (UP). However, such reports may raise privacy concerns, as adversaries can infer lifestyle patterns, political orientations, and the types of electrical devices in a household, or even sell the data to third parties (TP) such as insurers. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, privacy-preserving smart metering protocol for incentive-based value-added services. The scheme employs local differential privacy, hash chains, blind digital signatures, pseudonyms, temporal aggregation, and anonymous overlay networks to report coarse-grained values with adjustable granularity to the UP. This protects consumers' privacy while preserving data utility. The scheme prevents identity disclosure while enabling automatic token redemption. From a performance perspective, our results show that with a 1024-bit RSA key, a 7-day duration, and four reports per day, our protocol runs in approximately 0.51s and consumes about 4.5 MB of memory. From a privacy perspective, the protocol resists semi-trusted and untrusted adversaries.</description>

      <title>A Collusion-Resistance Privacy-Preserving Smart Metering Protocol for Operational Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern grids have adopted advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to facilitate bidirectional communication between smart meters and control centers. This enables smart meters to report consumption values at predefined intervals to utility providers for purposes including demand balancing, load forecasting, dynamic billing, and operational efficiency. Compared to traditional power grids, smart grids offer advantages such as enhanced reliability, improved energy efficiency, and increased security. However, utility providers can compromise user privacy by analyzing fine-grained readings and extracting individuals' daily activities from this time-series data. To address this concern, we propose a collusion-resistant, privacy-preserving aggregation protocol for smart metering in operational services. Our protocol ensures privacy by leveraging techniques such as partially additive homomorphic encryption, aggregation, data perturbation, and data minimization. The scheme aggregates perturbed readings using the additive homomorphic property of the Paillier cryptosystem to provide results for multiple operational purposes. We evaluate the protocol in terms of both performance and privacy. Computational, memory, and communication overhead were examined. The total execution time with 1024-bit key size is about 2.21 seconds. We also evaluated privacy through the normalized conditional entropy (NCE) metric. Higher NCE values, closer to 1, indicate stronger privacy. By increasing noise scale, the NCE value rises, showing perturbed values retain minimal information about the original, thereby reducing risks. Overall, evaluation demonstrates the protocol's efficiency while employing various privacy-preserving techniques.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Stakeholder Analysis for Cybersecurity Researchers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stakeholder-based ethics analysis is now a formal requirement for submissions to top cybersecurity research venues. This requirement reflects a growing consensus that cybersecurity researchers must go beyond providing capabilities to anticipating and mitigating the potential harms thereof. However, many cybersecurity researchers may be uncertain about how to proceed in an ethics analysis. In this guide, we provide practical support for that requirement by enumerating stakeholder types and mapping them to common empirical research methods. We also offer worked examples to demonstrate how researchers can identify likely stakeholder exposures in real-world projects. Our goal is to help research teams meet new ethics mandates with confidence and clarity, not confusion.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Privacy-Preserving Smart Metering Billing Protocol with Dynamic Tariff Policy Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of information and communication technology (ICT) with traditional power grids has led to the emergence of smart grids. Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) plays a crucial role in smart grids by facilitating two-way communication between smart meters and the utility provider. This bidirectional communication allows intelligent meters to report fine-grained consumption data at predefined intervals, enabling accurate billing, efficient grid monitoring and management, and rapid outage detection. However, the collection of detailed consumption data can inadvertently disclose consumers' daily activities, raising privacy concerns and potentially leading to privacy violations. To address these issues and preserve individuals' privacy, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving smart metering protocol specifically designed to support real-time tariff billing service with dynamic policy adjustment. Our scheme employs an efficient data perturbation technique to obscure precise energy usage data from internal adversaries, including the intermediary gateways and the utility provider. Subsequently, we validate the efficiency and security of our protocol through comprehensive performance and privacy evaluations. We examined the computational, memory, and communication overhead of the proposed scheme. The execution time of our secure and privacy-aware billing system is approximately 3.94540 seconds for a complete year. Furthermore, we employed the Jensen-Shannon divergence as a privacy metric to demonstrate that our protocol can effectively safeguard users' privacy by increasing the noise scale.</description>

      <title>Online Incident Response Planning under Model Misspecification through Bayesian Learning and Belief Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL: Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available, which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and robustness to model misspecification.</description>

      <title>Markov Chain-based Model of Blockchain Radio Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Security has always been a priority, for researchers, service providers and network operators when it comes to radio access networks (RAN). One wireless access approach that has captured attention is blockchain enabled RAN (B-RAN) due to its secure nature. This research introduces a framework that integrates blockchain technology into RAN while also addressing the limitations of state-of-the-art models. The proposed framework utilizes queuing and Markov chain theory to model the aspects of B-RAN. An extensive evaluation of the models performance is provided, including an analysis of timing factors and a focused assessment of its security aspects. The results demonstrate reduced latency and comparable security making the presented framework suitable for diverse application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Boosting Payment Channel Network Liquidity with Topology Optimization and Transaction Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Payment channel networks (PCNs) are a promising technology that alleviates blockchain scalability by shifting the transaction load from the blockchain to the PCN. Nevertheless, the network topology has to be carefully designed to maximise the transaction throughput in PCNs. Additionally, users in PCNs also have to make optimal decisions on which transactions to forward and which to reject to prolong the lifetime of their channels. In this work, we consider an input sequence of transactions over $p$ parties. Each transaction consists of a transaction size, source, and target, and can be either accepted or rejected (entailing a cost). The goal is to design a PCN topology among the $p$ cooperating parties, along with the channel capacities, and then output a decision for each transaction in the sequence to minimise the cost of creating and augmenting channels, as well as the cost of rejecting transactions. Our main contribution is an $\mathcal{O}(p)$ approximation algorithm for the problem with $p$ parties. We further show that with some assumptions on the distribution of transactions, we can reduce the approximation ratio to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{p})$. We complement our theoretical analysis with an empirical study of our assumptions and approach in the context of the Lightning Network.</description>

      <title>Is The Watermarking Of LLM-Generated Code Robust?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17983v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first in depth study on the robustness of existing watermarking techniques applied to code generated by large language models (LLMs). As LLMs increasingly contribute to software development, watermarking has emerged as a potential solution for detecting AI generated code and mitigating misuse, such as plagiarism or the automated generation of malicious programs. While previous research has demonstrated the resilience of watermarking in the text setting, our work reveals that watermarking techniques are significantly more fragile in code-based contexts. Specifically, we show that simple semantic-preserving transformations, such as variable renaming and dead code insertion, can effectively erase watermarks without altering the program's functionality. To systematically evaluate watermark robustness, we develop an algorithm that traverses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of a watermarked program and applies a sequence of randomized, semantics-preserving transformations. Our experimental results, conducted on Python code generated by different LLMs, indicate that even minor modifications can drastically reduce watermark detectability, with true positive rates (TPR) dropping below 50% in many cases. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/uiuc-arc/llm-code-watermark.</description>

      <title>It Takes Two: A Peer-Prediction Solution for Blockchain Verifier's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01794v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The security of blockchain systems is fundamentally based on the decentralized consensus in which the majority of parties behave honestly, and the content verification process is essential to maintaining the robustness of blockchain systems. However, the phenomenon that a rational verifier may not have the incentive to honestly perform the costly verification, referred to as the Verifier's Dilemma, could incentivize lazy reporting and undermine the fundamental security of blockchain systems, particularly for verification-expensive decentralized AI applications.
  In this paper, we initiate the research with the development of a Byzantine-robust peer prediction framework towards the design of one-phase Bayesian truthful mechanisms for the decentralized verification games among multiple verifiers, incentivizing all verifiers to perform honest verification without access to the ground truth even in the presence of noisy observations, malicious players and inaccurate priors in the verification process, proposing the compactness criteria that ensures such robustness guarantees. With robust incentive guarantees and budget efficiency, our study provides a framework of incentive design for decentralized verification protocols that enhances the security and robustness of the blockchain, decentralized AI, and potentially other decentralized systems.</description>

      <title>BLACKOUT: Data-Oblivious Computation with Blinded Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lack of memory-safety and exposure to side channels are two prominent, persistent challenges for the secure implementation of software. Memory-safe programming languages promise to significantly reduce the prevalence of memory-safety bugs, but make it more difficult to implement side-channel-resistant code. We aim to address both memory-safety and side-channel resistance by augmenting memory-safe hardware with the ability for data-oblivious programming. We describe an extension to the CHERI capability architecture to provide blinded capabilities that allow data-oblivious computation to be carried out by userspace tasks. We also present BLACKOUT, our realization of blinded capabilities on a FPGA softcore based on the speculative out-of-order CHERI-Toooba processor and extend the CHERI-enabled Clang/LLVM compiler and the CheriBSD operating system with support for blinded capabilities. BLACKOUT makes writing side-channel-resistant code easier by making non-data-oblivious operations via blinded capabilities explicitly fault. Through rigorous evaluation we show that BLACKOUT ensures memory operated on through blinded capabilities is securely allocated, used, and reclaimed and demonstrate that, in benchmarks comparable to those used by previous work, BLACKOUT imposes only a small performance degradation (1.5% geometric mean) compared to the baseline CHERI-Toooba processor.</description>

      <title>Security Concerns for Large Language Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18889v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and its competitors have caused a revolution in natural language processing, but their capabilities also introduce new security vulnerabilities. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of these emerging concerns, categorizing threats into several key areas: prompt injection and jailbreaking; adversarial attacks, including input perturbations and data poisoning; misuse by malicious actors to generate disinformation, phishing emails, and malware; and the worrisome risks inherent in autonomous LLM agents. Recently, a significant focus is increasingly being placed on the latter, exploring goal misalignment, emergent deception, self-preservation instincts, and the potential for LLMs to develop and pursue covert, misaligned objectives, a behavior known as scheming, which may even persist through safety training. We summarize recent academic and industrial studies from 2022 to 2025 that exemplify each threat, analyze proposed defenses and their limitations, and identify open challenges in securing LLM-based applications. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of advancing robust, multi-layered security strategies to ensure LLMs are safe and beneficial.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Protocol: Unveiling Attack Vectors in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging standard designed to enable seamless interaction between Large Language Model (LLM) applications and external tools or resources. Within a short period, thousands of MCP services have already been developed and deployed. However, the client-server integration architecture inherent in MCP may expand the attack surface against LLM Agent systems, introducing new vulnerabilities that allow attackers to exploit by designing malicious MCP servers. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of attack vectors targeting the MCP ecosystem. Our analysis identifies four categories of attacks, i.e., Tool Poisoning Attacks, Puppet Attacks, Rug Pull Attacks, and Exploitation via Malicious External Resources. To evaluate the feasibility of these attacks, we conduct experiments following the typical steps of launching an attack through malicious MCP servers: upload-download-attack. Specifically, we first construct malicious MCP servers and successfully upload them to three widely used MCP aggregation platforms. The results indicate that current audit mechanisms are insufficient to identify and prevent the proposed attack methods. Next, through a user study and interview with 20 participants, we demonstrate that users struggle to identify malicious MCP servers and often unknowingly install them from aggregator platforms. Finally, we demonstrate that these attacks can trigger harmful behaviors within the user's local environment-such as accessing private files or controlling devices to transfer digital assets-by deploying a proof-of-concept (PoC) framework against five leading LLMs. Additionally, based on interview results, we discuss four key challenges faced by the current security ecosystem surrounding MCP servers. These findings underscore the urgent need for robust security mechanisms to defend against malicious MCP servers.</description>

      <title>The Man Behind the Sound: Demystifying Audio Private Attribute Profiling via Multimodal Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our research uncovers a novel privacy risk associated with multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the ability to infer sensitive personal attributes from audio data -- a technique we term audio private attribute profiling. This capability poses a significant threat, as audio can be covertly captured without direct interaction or visibility. Moreover, compared to images and text, audio carries unique characteristics, such as tone and pitch, which can be exploited for more detailed profiling. However, two key challenges exist in understanding MLLM-employed private attribute profiling from audio: (1) the lack of audio benchmark datasets with sensitive attribute annotations and (2) the limited ability of current MLLMs to infer such attributes directly from audio. To address these challenges, we introduce AP^2, an audio benchmark dataset that consists of two subsets collected and composed from real-world data, and both are annotated with sensitive attribute labels. Additionally, we propose Gifts, a hybrid multi-agent framework that leverages the complementary strengths of audio-language models (ALMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance inference capabilities. Gifts employs an LLM to guide the ALM in inferring sensitive attributes, then forensically analyzes and consolidates the ALM's inferences, overcoming severe hallucinations of existing ALMs in generating long-context responses. Our evaluations demonstrate that Gifts significantly outperforms baseline approaches in inferring sensitive attributes. Finally, we investigate model-level and data-level defense strategies to mitigate the risks of audio private attribute profiling. Our work validates the feasibility of audio-based privacy attacks using MLLMs, highlighting the need for robust defenses, and provides a dataset and framework to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>BadBlocks: Low-Cost and Stealthy Backdoor Attacks Tailored for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the field of image generation. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which attackers can manipulate the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or textual phrases into the training dataset. Fortunately, with the continuous advancement of defense techniques, defenders have become increasingly capable of identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and neural network-based detection methods. However, in this paper, we identify a novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing approaches, which we name BadBlocks, requires only about 30% of the computational resources and 20% GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor attacks, yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced defense frameworks. BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components. Experimental results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate and low perceptual quality loss , even under extremely constrained computational resources and GPU time. Moreover, BadBlocks is able to bypass existing defense frameworks, especially the attention-based backdoor detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat. Ablation studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural network layers in backdoor mapping. Overall, BadBlocks significantly reduces the barrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects. It enables attackers to inject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade GPUs.</description>

      <title>Six-CD: Benchmarking Concept Removals for Benign Text-to-image Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in generating images that closely correspond to textual prompts. However, the advancement of T2I diffusion models presents significant risks, as the models could be exploited for malicious purposes, such as generating images with violence or nudity, or creating unauthorized portraits of public figures in inappropriate contexts. To mitigate these risks, concept removal methods have been proposed. These methods aim to modify diffusion models to prevent the generation of malicious and unwanted concepts. Despite these efforts, existing research faces several challenges: (1) a lack of consistent comparisons on a comprehensive dataset, (2) ineffective prompts in harmful and nudity concepts, (3) overlooked evaluation of the ability to generate the benign part within prompts containing malicious concepts. To address these gaps, we propose to benchmark the concept removal methods by introducing a new dataset, Six-CD, along with a novel evaluation metric. In this benchmark, we conduct a thorough evaluation of concept removals, with the experimental observations and discussions offering valuable insights in the field.</description>

      <title>When Good Sounds Go Adversarial: Jailbreaking Audio-Language Models with Benign Inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models become increasingly integrated into daily life, audio has emerged as a key interface for human-AI interaction. However, this convenience also introduces new vulnerabilities, making audio a potential attack surface for adversaries. Our research introduces WhisperInject, a two-stage adversarial audio attack framework that can manipulate state-of-the-art audio language models to generate harmful content. Our method uses imperceptible perturbations in audio inputs that remain benign to human listeners. The first stage uses a novel reward-based optimization method, Reinforcement Learning with Projected Gradient Descent (RL-PGD), to guide the target model to circumvent its own safety protocols and generate harmful native responses. This native harmful response then serves as the target for Stage 2, Payload Injection, where we use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to optimize subtle perturbations that are embedded into benign audio carriers, such as weather queries or greeting messages. Validated under the rigorous StrongREJECT, LlamaGuard, as well as Human Evaluation safety evaluation framework, our experiments demonstrate a success rate exceeding 86% across Qwen2.5-Omni-3B, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, and Phi-4-Multimodal. Our work demonstrates a new class of practical, audio-native threats, moving beyond theoretical exploits to reveal a feasible and covert method for manipulating AI behavior.</description>
