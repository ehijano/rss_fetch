      <title>Static manifolds with boundary: Their geometry and some uniqueness theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static manifolds with boundary were recently introduced to mathematics. This kind of manifolds appears naturally in the prescribed scalar curvature problem on manifolds with boundary, when the mean curvature of the boundary is also prescribed. They are also interesting from the point of view of General Relativity. For example, the (time-slice of the) photon sphere on the Riemannian Schwarzschild manifold splits it into static manifolds with boundary. In this paper we prove a number of theorems, which relate the topology and geometry of a given static manifold with boundary to some properties of the zero-level set of its potential (such as connectedness and closedness). Also, we characterize the round ball in the Euclidean 3-space with standard potential as the only scalar-flat static manifold with mean-convex boundary, whose zero-level set of the potential has Morse index one. This result follows from a general isoperimetric inequality for 3-dimensional static manifolds with boundary, whose zero-level set of the potential has Morse index one. Finally, we prove some uniqueness theorem for the domains bounded by the photon sphere on the Riemannian Schwarzschild manifold.</description>

      <title>Born geometry via K\"unneth structures and recursion operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple definition of a Born geometry in the framework of K\"unneth geometry. While superficially different, this new definition is equivalent to the known definitions in terms of para-quaternionic or generalized geometries. We discuss integrability of Born structures and their associated connections. In particular we find that for integrable Born geometries the Born connection is obtained by a simple averaging under a conjugation from the K\"unneth connection. We also give examples of integrable Born geometries on nilmanifolds.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic geometry at infinity of quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an approach developed by Melrose to study the geometry at infinity of the Nakajima metric on the reduced Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$, we show that the Nakajima metric on a quiver variety is quasi-asymptotically conical (QAC) whenever its defining parameters satisfy an appropriate genericity assumption. As such, it is of bounded geometry and of maximal volume growth. Being QAC is one of two main ingredients allowing us to use the work of Kottke and the second author to compute its reduced $L^2$-cohomology and prove the Vafa-Witten conjecture. The other is a spectral gap for the Hodge-deRham operator associated with an exact $3$-Sasakian wedge metric that we obtain using the Weitzenb\"ock formula of Semmelmann and Weingart on quaternionic-K\"ahler manifolds. This yields in particular a generalization and a different proof of the vanishing theorem in cohomology originally obtained by Galicki and Salamon for closed $3$-Sasakian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Left-invariant distributions and metric Hamiltonians on ${\rm SL}(n,{\mathbb R})$ induced by its Killing form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the classical theory of Lie algebras, it is well-known that the bilinear form $B(X,Y)={\rm tr}(XY)$ defines a non-degenerate scalar product on the simple Lie algebra ${\mathfrak{sl}}(n,{\mathbb R})$. Diagonalizing the Gram matrix $Gr$ associated with this scalar product we find a basis of ${\mathfrak{sl}}(n,{\mathbb R})$ of eigenvectors of $Gr$ which produces a family of bracket generating distributions on ${\rm SL}(n,{\mathbb R})$. Consequently, the bilinear form $B$ defines sub-pseudo-Riemannian structures on these distributions. Each of these geometric structures naturally carries a metric quadratic Hamiltonian. In the present paper, we construct in detail these manifolds, study Poisson-commutation relations between different Hamiltonians, and present some explicit solutions of the corresponding Hamiltonian system for $n=2$.</description>

      <title>On the topology of manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and linear volume growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationships between geometry and topology is a central theme in Riemannian geometry. We establish two results on the fundamental groups of open (complete and noncompact) $n$-manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and linear volume growth. First, we show that the fundamental group of such a manifold contains a subgroup $\mathbb{Z}^k$ of finite index, where $0\le k\le n-1$. Second, we prove that if the Ricci curvature is positive everywhere, then the fundamental group is finite. The proofs are based on an analysis of the equivariant asymptotic geometry of successive covering spaces and a plane/halfplane rigidity result for RCD spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove, for a class of first order differential operators that contains the Stein-Weiss, Dirac and Penrose twistor operators, a family of Kato inequalities that interpolates between the classical and the refined Kato. For the Hodge-de-Rham operator we get a more detailed result. As a corollary, we get various Kato inequalities from the literature.</description>

      <title>Morse index of y-singular minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the Morse index of rotationally symmetric minimal Y-singular surfaces under assumption that the Y-singularities form a single circle. This computation is carried out by utilizing information from two simpler problems: the first deals with the fixed boundary problem on singularities, and the second focuses on the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated with the stability operator. Notably, our findings reveal that the index of the Y -catenoid is one.</description>

      <title>On the area of immersed minimal annuli in a slab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we organize minimal annuli in a slab based on the winding number of the circles that foliate them and study the area of minimal annuli with given winding number. Specifically, we deduce some results regarding the convexity of the length function of corresponding level curves, and apply them to estimate the area of the annui by comparing to the area of waist of covers of catenoids.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a direct log-epiperimetric inequality for Yang--Mills fields in arbitrary dimension and we leverage on it to prove uniqueness of tangent cones with isolated singularity for energy minimizing Yang--Mills fields and $\omega$-ASD connections (where $\omega$ is not necessarily closed) satisfying some suitable regularity assumptions. En route to this we establish a Luckhaus type lemma for Yang--Mills connections to exclude curvature concentration along blow-up sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Dirichlet energy of some smooth maps appearing in a collapsing family of hyper-K\"ahler metrics on the $K3$ surface constructed by Foscolo. We introduce an invariant for homotopy classes of smooth maps from the $K3$ surface with a hyper-K\"ahler metric to a flat Riemannian orbifold of dimension $3$, then show that it gives a lower bound of the energy. Moreover, we show that the ratio of the energy to the invariant converges to $1$ for Foscolo's collapsing families.</description>

      <title>Global Homotopies for Differential Hochschild Cohomologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct global homotopies to compute differential Hochschild cohomologies in differential geometry. This relies on two different techniques: a symbol calculus from differential geometry and a coalgebraic version of the van Est theorem. Not only do we obtain an improved version of the Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem but we also compute Hochschild cohomologies for related scenarios, e.g. for principal bundles, and invariant versions.</description>

      <title>Orbifold singularity formation along ancient and immortal Ricci flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In stark contrast to lower dimensions, we produce a plethora of ancient and immortal Ricci flows in real dimension $4$ with Einstein orbifolds as tangent flows at infinity. For instance, for any $k\in\mathbb{N}_0$, we obtain continuous families of non-isometric ancient Ricci flows on $\#k(\mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^2)$ depending on a number of parameters growing linearly in $k$, and a family of half-PIC ancient Ricci flows on $\mathbb{CP}^2\#\mathbb{CP}^2$.
  The ancient/immortal dichotomy is determined by a notion of linear stability of orbifold singularities with respect to the expected way for them to appear along Ricci flow: by bubbling off Ricci-flat ALE metrics. We discuss the case of Ricci solitons orbifolds and motivate a conjecture that spherical and cylindrical solitons with orbifold singularities, which are unstable in our sense, should not appear along Ricci flow by bubbling off Ricci-flat ALE metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to study the residual Monge-Amp\`{e}re mass of a plurisubharmonic function with an isolated unbounded locus. A general decomposition formula for the residual mass is obtained, under the Sasakian structure of the unit sphere. In complex dimension two, we further obtain an upper-bound estimate, provided with the uniform directional Lipschitz continuity. As an application, the zero mass conjecture is confirmed, if the function further has a single frequency on its alternating part.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the framework of localization algebras to compute the equivariant K-homology class of the Euler characteristic operator, a central object in studying equivariant index theory on manifolds. This approach provides a powerful algebraic language for analyzing differential operators on equivariant structures and allows for the application of Witten deformation techniques in a K-homological context. Utilizing these results, we establish an equivariant version of the Poincar\'e-Hopf theorem, extending classical topological insights to the equivariant case, inspired by the results of L\"uck-Rosenberg. This work thus offers a new perspective on the localization techniques in the equivariant K-homology, highlighting their utility in deriving explicit formulas for index-theoretic invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present some aspects of the theory of finite element exterior calculus as applied to partial differential equations on manifolds, especially manifolds endowed with an approximate metric called a Regge metric. Our treatment is intrinsic, avoiding wherever possible the use of preferred coordinates or a preferred embedding into an ambient space, which presents some challenges but also conceptual and possibly computational advantages. As an application, we analyze and implement a method for computing an approximate Levi-Civita connection form for a disc whose metric is itself approximate.</description>

Abstract: We prove the transitivity of real Anosov diffeomorphisms, which are Anosov diffeomorphisms where stable and unstable spaces decompose into a continuous sum of invariant one-dimensional sub-spaces with uniform contraction/expansion over the ambient manifold. We analyze how the stable/unstable holonomies of Anosov diffeomorphisms behave on Artigue's self-similar hyperbolic metric and prove that if a stable/unstable curve has a well-defined length in a self-similar hyperbolic metric, then it has a globally defined holonomy. We exhibit a self-similar hyperbolic metric with well-defined length of curves for each real Anosov diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Direct derivation of gauged $\mathcal N=1$ supergravity in ten dimensions to all orders in fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been known for some time that generalised geometry provides a particularly elegant rewriting of the action and symmetries of 10-dimensional supergravity theories, up to the lowest nontrivial order in fermions. By exhibiting the full symmetry calculations in the second-order formalism, we show in the $\mathcal N=1$ case that this analysis can be upgraded to all orders in fermions and we obtain a strikingly simple form of the action as well as of the supersymmetry transformations, featuring overall only five higher-fermionic terms. Surprisingly, even after expressing the action in terms of classical (non-generalised geometric) variables one obtains a simplification of the usual formulae. This in particular confirms that generalised geometry provides the natural set of variables for studying (the massless level of) string theory. We also show how this new reformulation implies the compatibility of the Poisson-Lie T-duality with the equations of motion of the full supergravity theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the reconstruction of a certain type of length spaces from their travel time data on a closed subset is Lipschitz stable. The travel time data is the set of distance functions from the entire space, measured on the chosen closed subset. The case of a Riemannian manifold with boundary with the boundary as the measurement set appears is a classical geometric inverse problem arising from Gel'fand's inverse boundary spectral problem. Examples of spaces satisfying our assumptions include some non-simple Riemannian manifolds, Euclidean domains with non-trivial topology, and metric trees.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the codimension-one nonlinear asymptotic stability of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family of black holes in the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-neutral scalar field model, up to and including the event horizon. More precisely, we show that there exists a teleologically defined, codimension-one "submanifold" $\mathfrak M_\mathrm{stab}$ of the moduli space of spherically symmetric characteristic data for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system lying close to the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family, such that any data in $\mathfrak M_\mathrm{stab}$ evolve into a solution with the following properties as time goes to infinity: (i) the metric decays to a member of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family uniformly up to the event horizon, (ii) the scalar field decays to zero pointwise and in an appropriate energy norm, (iii) the first translation-invariant ingoing null derivative of the scalar field is approximately constant on the event horizon $\mathcal H^+$, (iv) for "generic" data, the second translation-invariant ingoing null derivative of the scalar field grows linearly along the event horizon. Due to the coupling of the scalar field to the geometry via the Einstein equations, suitable components of the Ricci tensor exhibit non-decay and growth phenomena along the event horizon. Points (i) and (ii) above reflect the "stability" of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family and points (iii) and (iv) verify the presence of the celebrated "Aretakis instability" for the linear wave equation on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in the full nonlinear Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field model.</description>

      <title>Quasi-fibered boundary pseudodifferential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.16650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a pseudodifferential calculus for differential operators associated to quasi-fibered boundary metrics (QFB metrics), a class of metrics including the quasi-asymptotically conical metrics (QAC metrics) of Degeratu-Mazzeo and the quasi-asymptotically locally Euclidean metrics (QALE metrics) of Joyce. Introducing various principal symbols, we introduce the notion of fully elliptic QFB operators and show that those are Fredholm when acting on QFB Sobolev spaces. For QAC metrics, we also develop a pseudodifferential calculus for the conformally related class of Qb metrics. We use these calculi to construct a parametrix for the Hodge-deRham operator of certain QFB metrics, allowing us to show that it is Fredholm on suitable Sobolev spaces and that the space of $L^2$ harmonic forms is finite dimensional. Our parametrix is obtained by inverting certain model operators at infinity, inversions that we achieve in part through a fine understanding of the low energy limit of the resolvent of the Hodge-deRham operator. Our parametrix also implies that $L^2$ harmonic forms decay faster at infinity than an arbitrary $L^2$ form, the extra decay being quantified in terms of a small negative power of the distance function. This decay of $L^2$ harmonic forms is used in a companion paper to study the $L^2$ cohomology of some $QFB$ metrics.</description>

      <title>The Weyl problem for unbounded convex domains in $\HH^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.02101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K\subset \HH^3$ be a convex subset in $\HH^3$ with smooth, strictly convex boundary. The induced metric on $\partial K$ then has curvature $K&gt;-1$. It was proved by Alexandrov that if $K$ is bounded, then it is uniquely determined by the induced metric on the boundary, and any smooth metric with curvature $K&gt;-1$ can be obtained.
  We propose here an extension of the existence part of this result to unbounded convex domains in $\HH^3$. The induced metric on $\partial K$ is then clearly not sufficient to determine $K$. However one can consider a richer data on the boundary including the ideal boundary of $K$. Specifically, we consider the data composed of the full conformal structure on the boundary of $K$ (in the Poincar\'e model of $\HH^3$), together with the induced metric on $\partial K$. We show that a wide range of "reasonable" data of this type, satisfying mild curvature conditions, can be realized on the boundary of a convex subset in $\HH^3$.</description>

      <title>Construction of higher-dimensional ALF Calabi-Yau metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Roughly speaking, an ALF metric of real dimension 4n should be a metric such that it has a (4n-1)-dimensional asymptotic cone, the volume growth of this metric is of order 4n-1 and its sectional curvature tends to 0 at infinity. In this paper, we first show that the Taub-NUT deformation of a hyperk\"ahler cone with respect to a locally free S1-symmetry is ALF hyperk\"ahler. Using this metric at infinity, we establish the existence of ALF Calabi-Yau metric on certain crepant resolutions. In particular, we prove that there exist ALF Calabi-Yau metrics on canonical bundles of classical homogeneous Fano contact manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We express the $q$-th Gauss--Bonnet--Chern mass of an immersed submanifold of Euclidean space as a linear combination of two terms: the total $(2q)$-th mean curvature and the integral, over the entire manifold, of the inner product between the $(2q+1)$-th mean curvature vector and the position vector of the immersion. As a consequence, we obtain, for each $q$, a geometric inequality that holds whenever the positive mass theorem (for the $q$-th Gauss--Bonnet--Chern mass) holds.</description>

      <title>Willmore-type inequalities for closed hypersurfaces in weighted manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16286v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove some Willmore-type inequalities for closed hypersurfaces in weighted manifolds with nonnegative Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature. In particular, we get a sharp Willmore type inequality steady gradient Ricci solitons. We also prove a sharp Willmore-like inequality in shrinking gradient Ricci solitons. Moreover, we characterize the equality cases of our Willmore-type inequalities. These results can be regarded as generalizations of Agostiniani-Fogagnolo-Mazzieri's Willmore-type inequality to weighted manifolds. As applications, we derive some isoperimetric type inequalities under certain existence assumptions of isoperimetric regions in weighted manifolds.</description>

Abstract: This is a continuation of the authors' earlier work on deformations of cuspidal edges. We give a representation formula for swallowtails in the Euclidean 3-space. Using this, we investigate map germs of generic swallowtails in 3-dimensional space from, and show some important properties of them. In particular, we give a representation formula giving all map germs of swallowtails in the Euclidean 3-space whose Gaussian curvatures are bounded from below by a positive constant or by a negative constant from above. Using this, we show that any swallowtails are deformed into a swallowtail of constant Gaussian curvature preserving the sign of their Gaussian curvatures.</description>

      <title>Ricci curvature bounds and rigidity for non-smooth Riemannian and semi-Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06762v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study rigidity problems for Riemannian and semi-Riemannian manifolds with metrics of low regularity. Specifically, we prove a version of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem \cite{CheegerGromoll72splitting} for Riemannian metrics and the flatness criterion for semi-Riemannian metrics of regularity $C^1$. With our proof of the splitting theorem, we are able to obtain an isometry of higher regularity than the Lipschitz regularity guaranteed by the $\mathsf{RCD}$-splitting theorem \cite{gigli2013splitting, gigli2014splitoverview}. Along the way, we establish a Bochner-Weitzenb\"ock identity which permits both the non-smoothness of the metric and of the vector fields, complementing a recent similar result in \cite{mondino2024equivalence}. The last section of the article is dedicated to the discussion of various notions of Sobolev spaces in low regularity, as well as an alternative proof of the equivalence (see \cite{mondino2024equivalence}) between distributional Ricci curvature bounds and $\mathsf{RCD}$-type bounds, using in part the stability of the variable $\mathsf{CD}$-condition under suitable limits \cite{ketterer2017variableCD}.</description>

      <title>Prescribed mean curvature problems on homogeneous vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a detailed and systematic study of weak (singular) Hermite-Einstein structures on homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles over rational homogeneous varieties. We use standard tools from spectral geometry, Harmonic analysis, and Cartan's highest weight theory to provide a sufficient condition in terms of Fourier series and intersection numbers under which an $L^{2}$-function can be realized as mean curvature of a singular Hermitian structure on an irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundle. We prove that the condition provided is necessary and sufficient for functions that belong to certain interpolation spaces. In the particular case of line bundles over irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type, we describe explicitly in terms of representation theory the solutions of the underlying geometric PDE. Also, we establish a sufficient condition in terms of Fourier coefficients and intersection numbers for solvability and convergence of the weak Hermite-Einstein flow on irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles. As an application of our methods, we describe the first explicit examples in the literature of solutions to several geometric flows, including Donaldson's heat flow, Yang-Mills heat flow, and the gradient flow of Donaldson's Lagrangian, on line bundles over irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type. Additionally, we show that every polynomial central charge function gives rise to a weak Donaldson's Lagrangian $\mathcal{M}$. In the particular case of irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles, we prove that the gradient flow of $\mathcal{M}$ converges to a Hermitian structure which is, up to a gauge transformation, a $Z$-critical Hermitian structure in the large volume limit.</description>

Abstract: In [2], it is observed that if in the twistor space associated with an oriented vector bundle of rank $4$ over $T^2$ with a positive-definite metric and a metric connection, the horizontality has infinite complexity derived from one of the cases studied in [1], then the complexity is expressed by a dense subset of $S^2$. In the present paper, it is observed that in such a situation, the topological holonomy group is dense in $SO(3)$.</description>

      <title>On the Focal Locus of Submanifolds of a Finsler Manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the focal locus of closed (not necessarily compact) submanifolds in a forward complete Finsler manifold. The main goal is to show that the associated normal exponential map is \emph{regular} in the sense of F.W. Warner (\textit{Am. J. of Math.}, 87, 1965). As a consequence, we show that the normal exponential is non-injective near any tangent focal point. Extending the ideas of Warner, we study the connected components of the regular focal locus. This allows us to identify an open and dense subset, on which the focal time maps are smooth, provided they are finite. We explicitly compute the derivative at a point of differentiability. As an application of the local form of the normal exponential map, following R.L. Bishop's work (\textit{Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.}, 65, 1977), we express the tangent cut locus as the closure of a certain set of points, called the separating tangent cut points. This strengthens the results from the present authors' previous work (\textit{J. Geom. Anal.}, 34, 2024).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A rigid cohomology class on a complex manifold is a class that is represented by a unique closed positive current. The positive current representing a rigid class is also called rigid. For a compact Kahler manifold $X$ all eigenvectors of hyperbolic automorphisms acting on $H^{1,1}(X)$ that have non-unit eigenvalues are rigid classes. Such classes are always parabolic, namely, they belong to the boundary of the Kahler cone and have vanishing volume. We study parabolic $(1,1)$-classes on compact hyperkahler manifolds with $b_2 \geq 7$. We show that a parabolic class is rigid if it is not orthogonal to a rational vector with respect to the BBF form. This implies that a general parabolic class on a hyperkahler manifold is rigid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we elaborate on some notions of surface area for discrete graphs which are closely related to the inverse degree. These notions then naturally lead to associated connectivity measures of graphs and to the definition of a special class of large graphs, called social graphs, that might prove interesting for applications. In addition, we derive spectral estimates involving the surface area and, as a main result, present an upper bound on the second eigenvalue for planar graphs which in some cases improves upon existing bounds from D. A. Spielman and S.-H. Teng, Spectral partitioning works: Planar graphs and finite element meshes, and M. Pl\"umer, Upper eigenvalue bounds for the Kirchhoff Laplacian on embedded metric graphs.</description>

Abstract: We study the Rumin differentials of the 5-dimensional graded nilpotent Lie group that appears as osculating group of generic rank two distributions in dimension five. In irreducible unitary representations of this group, the Rumin differentials provide intriguing generalizations of the classical quantum harmonic oscillator. For the Schrodinger representations, we compute the spectrum and the zeta regularized determinant of each Rumin differential. In the generic representations, we evaluate their alternating product, i.e., the analytic torsion of the Rumin complex.</description>

      <title>Metric Flows with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of flows in the space of Riemannian metrics induced by neural network gradient descent. This is motivated in part by recent advances in approximating Calabi-Yau metrics with neural networks and is enabled by recent advances in understanding flows in the space of neural networks. We derive the corresponding metric flow equations, which are governed by a metric neural tangent kernel, a complicated, non-local object that evolves in time. However, many architectures admit an infinite-width limit in which the kernel becomes fixed and the dynamics simplify. Additional assumptions can induce locality in the flow, which allows for the realization of Perelman's formulation of Ricci flow that was used to resolve the 3d Poincar\'e conjecture. We demonstrate that such fixed kernel regimes lead to poor learning of numerical Calabi-Yau metrics, as is expected since the associated neural networks do not learn features. Conversely, we demonstrate that well-learned numerical metrics at finite-width exhibit an evolving metric-NTK, associated with feature learning. Our theory of neural network metric flows therefore explains why neural networks are better at learning Calabi-Yau metrics than fixed kernel methods, such as the Ricci flow.</description>

      <title>Logifold: A Geometrical Foundation of Ensemble Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a local-to-global and measure-theoretical approach to understanding datasets. The core idea is to formulate a logifold structure and to interpret network models with restricted domains as local charts of datasets. In particular, this provides a mathematical foundation for ensemble machine learning. Our experiments demonstrate that logifolds can be implemented to identify fuzzy domains and improve accuracy compared to taking average of model outputs. Additionally, we provide a theoretical example of a logifold, highlighting the importance of restricting to domains of classifiers in an ensemble.</description>

      <title>Classification of Horikawa surfaces with T-singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify all projective surfaces with only T-singularities, $K^2=2p_g-4$, and ample canonical class. In this way, we identify all surfaces, smoothable or not, with only T-singularities in the Koll\'ar--Shepherd-Barron--Alexeev (KSBA) moduli space of Horikawa surfaces. We also prove that they are not smoothable when $p_g \geq 10$, except for the Lee-Park (Fintushel-Stern) examples, which we show to have only one deformation type unless $p_g=6$ (in which case they have two). This demonstrates that the challenging Horikawa problem cannot be addressed through complex T-degenerations, and we propose new questions regarding diffeomorphism types based on our classification. Furthermore, the techniques developed in this paper enable us to classify all KSBA surfaces with only T-singularities and $K^2=2p_g-3$, e.g. quintic surfaces and I-surfaces.</description>

      <title>Variational autoencoders with latent high-dimensional steady geometric flows for dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop Riemannian approaches to variational autoencoders (VAEs) for PDE-type ambient data with regularizing geometric latent dynamics, which we refer to as VAE-DLM, or VAEs with dynamical latent manifolds. We redevelop the VAE framework such that manifold geometries, subject to our geometric flow, embedded in Euclidean space are learned in the intermediary latent space developed by encoders and decoders. By tailoring the geometric flow in which the latent space evolves, we induce latent geometric properties of our choosing, which are reflected in empirical performance. We reformulate the traditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss with a considerate choice of prior. We develop a linear geometric flow with a steady-state regularizing term. This flow requires only automatic differentiation of one time derivative, and can be solved in moderately high dimensions in a physics-informed approach, allowing more expressive latent representations. We discuss how this flow can be formulated as a gradient flow, and maintains entropy away from metric singularity. This, along with an eigenvalue penalization condition, helps ensure the manifold is sufficiently large in measure, nondegenerate, and a canonical geometry, which contribute to a robust representation. Our methods focus on the modified multi-layer perceptron architecture with tanh activations for the manifold encoder-decoder. We demonstrate, on our datasets of interest, our methods perform at least as well as the traditional VAE, and oftentimes better. Our methods can outperform this and a VAE endowed with our proposed architecture by up to 25% reduction in out-of-distribution (OOD) error and potentially greater. We highlight our method on ambient PDEs whose solutions maintain minimal variation in late times. We provide empirical justification towards how we can improve robust learning for external dynamics with VAEs.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Generative Autoencoders for Warped Riemannian Metric Learning and Generative Modeling on Data Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid growth of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial genomics has led to unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery, but it also presents unique computational and statistical challenges. Traditional methods struggle with geometry-aware data generation, interpolation along meaningful trajectories, and transporting populations via feasible paths. To address these issues, we introduce Geometry-Aware Generative Autoencoder (GAGA), a novel framework that combines extensible manifold learning with generative modeling. GAGA constructs a neural network embedding space that respects the intrinsic geometries discovered by manifold learning and learns a novel warped Riemannian metric on the data space. This warped metric is derived from both the points on the data manifold and negative samples off the manifold, allowing it to characterize a meaningful geometry across the entire latent space. Using this metric, GAGA can uniformly sample points on the manifold, generate points along geodesics, and interpolate between populations across the learned manifold using geodesic-guided flows. GAGA shows competitive performance in simulated and real-world datasets, including a 30% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in single-cell population-level trajectory inference.</description>
