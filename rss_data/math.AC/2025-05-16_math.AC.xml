      <title>Symbolic Powers of Toric Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the symbolic powers of toric ideals. We first describe them in terms of the kernel of certain linear maps derived from the lattice structure of the toric ideal. Furthermore, we apply our results to show that symbolic powers of a toric ideal can also be expressed as saturations of regular powers with the monomial given by the product of all the variables. Finally, we conclude with a computationally significant result for computing symbolic powers of toric ideals.</description>

      <title>$z^\circ$-submodules of a reduced multiplication module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let R be a commutative ring with identity and M be an R-module. A proper ideal I of R is said to be a $z^\circ$-ideal if for each $a \in I$ the intersection of all minimal prime ideals containing a is contained in I. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the notion of $z^\circ$-submodules of M as an extension of $z^\circ$-ideals of R. Moreover, we investigate some properties of this class of submodules when M is a reduced multiplication R-module.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let R be a semiring. We say that a non-zero subsemimodule S of an R-semimodule M is second if for each a \in R, we have aS = S or aS = 0. The aim of this paper is to study the notion of second subsemimodules of semimodules over commutative semirings.</description>

      <title>A Structural Analysis of Infinity in Set Theory and Modern Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a self-contained analysis of infinity from two mathematical perspectives: set theory and algebra. We begin with cardinal and ordinal numbers, examining deep questions such as the continuum hypothesis, along with foundational results such as the Schr\"oder-Bernstein theorem, multiple proofs of the well-ordering of cardinals, and various properties of infinite cardinals and ordinals. Transitioning to algebra, we analyze the interplay between finite and infinite algebraic structures, including groups, rings, and $R$-modules. Major results, such as the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, Krull's Theorem, Hilbert's basis theorem, and the equivalence of free and projective modules over principal ideal domains, highlight the connections and differences between finite and infinite structures, as well as demonstrating the relationship between set-theoretic and algebraic treatments of infinity. Through this approach, we provide insights into how key results about infinity interact with and inform one another across set-theoretic and algebraic mathematics.</description>

      <title>Strong uniqueness of enhancements for the dual numbers: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the bounded and bounded below derived categories of (all) modules over the dual numbers have strongly unique (dg) enhancements. To this end we relate those categories to the category of sequences of vector spaces, which allows a complete classification of indecomposable objects. Along the way we also prove that all the derived categories of any hereditary category have strongly unique enhancements.</description>

      <title>Some algebraic properties of ASM varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fulton's matrix Schubert varieties are affine varieties that arise in the study of Schubert calculus in the complete flag variety. Weigandt showed that arbitrary intersections of matrix Schubert varieties, now called ASM varieties, are indexed by alternating sign matrices (ASMs), objects with a long history in enumerative combinatorics. It is very difficult to assess Cohen-Macaulayness of ASM varieties or to compute their codimension, though these properties are well understood for matrix Schubert varieties due to work of Fulton. In this paper we study these properties of ASM varieties with a focus on the relationship between a pair of ASMs and their direct sum. We also consider ASM pattern avoidance from an algebro-geometric perspective.</description>

      <title>The reflection invariant bispectrum: signal recovery in the dihedral model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of signal recovery in the dihedral multi-reference alignment (MRA) model, where a signal is observed under random actions of the dihedral group and corrupted by additive noise. While previous has shown that cyclic invariants of degree three (the bispectrum) suffice to recover generic signals up to circular shift, the dihedral setting introduces new challenges due to the groups non-abelian structure. In particular reflections prevent the diagonalization of the third moment tensor in the Fourier basis, making classical bispectrum techniques inapplicable.
  In this work we prove that the orbit of the generic signal in the $n$-dimensional standard representation of the then $2n$-element dihedral group $D_{n}$ is uniquely determined by invariant tensors of degree at most three. This resolves an open question in the literature and establishes that the sample complexity for dihedral MRA with uniform distribution is $\omega(\sigma^6)$ matching the cyclic case. While frequency marching becomes computationally impractical in the dihedral setting, we show numerically that a simple optimization algorithm reliably recovers the signal from third order moments, even with random initialization.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster algebras are subquotients of cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized Cluster Algebras (GCA) are generalizations of Cluster Algebras (CA) with higher-order exchange relations. Previously, Chekhov-Shapiro conjectured that every GCA can be embedded into a CA. In this paper, we prove a modified version of this conjecture by providing a construction that realizes a given GCA as subquotient of some CA, as an algebra over the ground ring of the GCA via restriction of scalars.</description>
