      <title>Computability of Initial Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that techniques of Weihrauch complexity can be used to get easy and elegant proofs of known and new results on initial value problems. Our main result is that solving continuous initial value problems is Weihrauch equivalent to weak K\H{o}nig's lemma, even if only solutions with maximal domains of existence are considered. This result simultaneously generalizes negative and positive results by Aberth and by Collins and Gra\c{c}a, respectively. It can also be seen as a uniform version of a Theorem of Simpson. Beyond known techniques we exploit for the proof that weak K\H{o}nig's lemma is closed under infinite loops. One corollary of our main result is that solutions with maximal domain of existence of continuous initial value problems can be computed non-deterministically, and for computable instances there are always solutions that are low as points in the function space. Another corollary is that in the case that there is a fixed finite number of solutions, these solutions are all computable for computable instances and they can be found uniformly in a finite mind-change computation.</description>

      <title>A Binary Quantifier for Definite Descriptions in Nelsonian Free Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method K\"urbis used to formalise definite descriptions with a binary quantifier I, such that I$x[F,G]$ indicates `the F is G', is examined and improved upon in this work. K\"urbis first looked at I in intuitionistic logic and its negative free form. It is well-known that intuitionistic reasoning approaches truth constructively. We also want to approach falsehood constructively, in Nelson's footsteps. Within the context of Nelson's paraconsistent logic N4 and its negative free variant, we examine I. We offer an embedding function from Nelson's (free) logic into intuitionistic (free) logic, as well as a natural deduction system for Nelson's (free) logic supplied with I and Kripke style semantics for it. Our method not only yields constructive falsehood, but also provides an alternate resolution to an issue pertaining to Russell's interpretation of definite descriptions. This comprehension might result in paradoxes. Free logic, which is often used to solve this issue, is insufficiently powerful to produce contradictions. Instead, we employ paraconsistent logic, which is made to function in the presence of contradicting data without devaluing the process of reasoning.</description>

      <title>Twist Sequent Calculi for S4 and its Neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two Gentzen-style twist sequent calculi for the normal modal logic S4 are introduced and investigated. The proposed calculi, which do not employ the standard logical inference rules for the negation connective, are characterized by several twist logical inference rules for negated logical connectives. Using these calculi, short proofs can be generated for provable negated modal formulas that contain numerous negation connectives. The cut-elimination theorems for the calculi are proved, and the subformula properties for the calculi are also obtained. Additionally, Gentzen-style twist (hyper)sequent calculi for other normal modal logics including S5 are considered.

      <title>Nested-sequent Calculus for Modal Logic MB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum logic (QL) is a non-classical logic for analyzing the propositions of quantum physics. Modal logic MB, which is a logic that handles the value of the inner product that appears in quantum mechanics, was constructed with the development of QL. Although the basic properties of this logic have already been analyzed in a previous study, some essential parts still need to be completed. They are concerned with the completeness theorem and the decidability of the validity problem of this logic. This study solves those problems by constructing a nested-sequent calculus for MB. In addition, new logic MB+ with the addition of new modal symbols is discussed.

      <title>Two Cases of Deduction with Non-referring Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal reasoning with non-denoting terms, esp. non-referring descriptions such as "the King of France", is still an under-investigated area. The recent exception being a series of papers e.g. by Indrzejczak, Zawidzki and K\"rbis. The present paper offers an alternative to their approach since instead of free logic and sequent calculus, it's framed in partial type theory with natural deduction in sequent style. Using a Montague- and Tich\'y-style formalization of  natural language, the paper successfully handles deduction with intensional transitives whose complements are non-referring descriptions, and derives Strawsonian rules for existential presuppositions of sentences with such descriptions.</description>

      <title>Semantic Incompleteness of Liberman et al. (2020)'s Hilbert-style System for Term-modal Logic K with Equality and Non-rigid Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the semantic incompleteness of the Hilbert-style system for the minimal normal term-modal logic with equality and non-rigid terms that was proposed in Liberman et al. (2020) "Dynamic Term-modal Logics for First-order Epistemic Planning." Term-modal logic is a family of first-order modal logics having term-modal operators indexed with terms in the first-order language. While some first-order formula is valid over the class of all frames in the Kripke semantics for the term-modal logic proposed there, it is not derivable in Liberman et al. (2020)'s Hilbert-style system. We show this fact by introducing a non-standard Kripke semantics which makes the meanings of constants and function symbols relative to the meanings of relation symbols combined with them.</description>

      <title>Syntactic Cut-Elimination for Provability Logic GL via Nested Sequents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cut-elimination procedure for the provability logic is known to be problematic: a L\"ob-like rule keeps cut-formulae intact on reduction, even in the principal case, thereby complicating the proof of termination. In this paper, we present a syntactic cut-elimination proof based on nested sequents, a generalization of sequents that allows a sequent to contain other sequents as single elements. A similar calculus was developed by Poggiolesi (2009), but there are certain ambiguities in the proof. Adopting the idea of Kushida (2020) into nested sequents, our proof does not require an extra measure on cuts or error-prone, intricate rewriting on derivations, but only straightforward inductions, thus leading to less ambiguity and confusion.</description>

      <title>Incomplete Descriptions and Qualified Definiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Russell, strict uses of the definite article 'the' in a definite description 'the F' involve uniqueness; in case there is more than one F, 'the F' is used somewhat loosely, and an indefinite description 'an F' should be preferred. We give an account of constructions of the form 'the F is G' in which the definite article is used loosely (and in which 'the F' is, therefore, incomplete), essentially by replacing the usual notion of identity in Russell's uniqueness clause with the notion of qualified identity, i.e., 'a is the same as b in all Q-respects', where Q is a subset of the set of predicates P. This modification gives us qualified notions of uniqueness and definiteness. A qualified definiteness statement 'the Q-unique F is G' is strict in case Q = P and  loose in case Q is a proper subset of P. The account is made formally precise in terms of proof theory and proof-theoretic semantics. </description>

      <title>Many-Valued Modal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the concepts of modal logics and many-valued logics in a general and comprehensive way. Namely, given any finite linearly ordered set of truth values and any set of propositional connectives defined by truth tables, we define the many-valued minimal normal modal logic, presented as a Gentzen-like sequent calculus, and prove its soundness and strong completeness with respect to many-valued Kripke models. The logic treats necessitation and possibility independently, i.e., they are not defined by each other, so that the duality between them is reflected in the proof system itself. We also prove the finite model property (that implies strong decidability) of this logic and consider some of its extensions. Moreover, we show that there is exactly one way to define negation such that De Morgan's duality between necessitation and possibility holds. In addition, we embed many-valued intuitionistic logic into one of the extensions of our many-valued modal logic.</description>

      <title>Modal Logics -- RNmatrices vs. Nmatrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short paper we will discuss the similarities and differences between two semantic approaches to modal logics - non-deterministic semantics and restricted non-deterministic semantics. Generally speaking, both kinds of semantics are similar in the sense that they employ non-deterministic matrices as a starting point but differ significantly in the way extensions of the minimal modal logic M are constructed. Both kinds of semantics are many-valued and truth-values are typically expressed in terms of tuples of 0s and 1s, where each dimension of the tuple represents either truth/falsity, possibility/non-possibility, necessity/non-necessity etc.  And while non-deterministic semantics for modal logic offers an intuitive interpretation of the truth-values and the concept of modality, with restricted non-deterministic semantics are more general in terms of providing extensions of M, including normal ones, in an uniform way. On the example of three modal logics, MK, MKT and MKT4, we will show the differences and similarities of those two approaches. Additionally, we will briefly discuss (current) restrictions of both approaches.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Nonassociative Lambek Calculus with classical logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nonassociative Lambek Calculus (NL) represents a logic devoid of the structural rules of exchange, weakening, and contraction, and it does not presume the associativity of its connectives. Its finitary consequence relation is decidable in polynomial time. However, the addition of classical connectives conjunction and disjunction (FNL) makes the consequence relation undecidable. Interestingly, if these connectives are distributive, the consequence relation is decidable in exponential time. This paper provides the proof that we can merge classical logic and NL (i.e. BFNL), and still the consequence relation is decidable in exponential time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified Gentzen-style framework for until-free propositional linear-time temporal logic is introduced. The proposed framework, based on infinitary rules and rules for primitive negation, can handle uniformly both a single-succedent sequent calculus and a natural deduction system. Furthermore, an equivalence between these systems, alongside with proofs of cut-elimination and normalization theorems, is established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is not uncommon for a logic to be invented multiple times, hinting at its robustness. This trend is followed also by the expansion BD+ of Belnap-Dunn logic by Boolean negation. Ending up in the same logic, however, does not mean that the semantic interpretations are always the same as well. In particular, different interpretations can bring us to different logics, once the basic setting is moved from a classical one to an intuitionistic one. For BD+, two such paths seem to have been taken; one (BDi) by N. Kamide along the so-called American plan, and another (HYPE) by G. Moisil and H. Leitgeb along the so-called Australian plan. The aim of this paper is to better understand this divergence. This task is approached mainly by (i) formulating a semantics for first-order BD+ that provides an Australian view of the system; (ii) showing connections of the less explored (first-order) BDi with neighbouring systems, including an intermediate logic and variants of Nelson's logics.</description>

      <title>Unified Gentzen Approach to Connexive Logics over Wansing's C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gentzen-style sequent calculi and Gentzen-style natural deduction systems are introduced for a family (C-family) of connexive logics over Wansing's basic connexive logic C. The C-family is derived from C by incorporating the Peirce law, the law of excluded middle, and the generalized law of excluded middle. Theorems establishing equivalence between the proposed sequent calculi and natural deduction systems are demonstrated. Cut-elimination and normalization theorems are established for the proposed sequent calculi and natural deduction systems, respectively.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we elaborate on the ordered-pair semantics originally presented by Matthew Clemens for LP (Priest's Logic of Paradox). For this purpose, we build on a generalization of Clemens semantics to the case of n-tuple semantics, for every n. More concretely, i) we deal with the case of a language with quantifiers, and ii) we consider philosophical implications of the semantics. The latter includes, first, a reading of the semantics in epistemic terms, involving multiple agents. Furthermore, we discuss the proper understanding of many-valued logics, namely LP  and K3 (Kleene strong 3-valued logic), from the perspective of classical logic, along the lines suggested by Susan Haack. We will also discuss some applications of the semantics to issues related to informative contradictions, i.e. contradictions involving quantification over different respects a vague predicate may have, as advanced by Paul \'Egr\'e, and also to the mixed consequence relations, promoted by Pablo Cobreros, Paul \'Egr\'e, David Ripley and Robert van Rooij.</description>

      <title>A note on Grigoriev and Zaitsev's system CNL$^2_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present article examines a system of four-valued logic recently introduced by Oleg Grigoriev and Dmitry Zaitsev. In particular, besides other interesting results, we will clarify the connection of this system to related systems developed by Paul Ruet and Norihiro Kamide. By doing so, we discuss two philosophical problems that arise from making such connections quite explicit: first, there is an issue with how to make intelligible the meaning of the connectives and the nature of the truth values involved in the many-valued setting employed -- what we have called `the Haackian theme'. We argue that this can be done in a satisfactory way, when seen according to the classicist's light.  Second, and related to the first problem, there is a complication arising from the fact that the proof system advanced may be made sense of by advancing at least four such different and incompatible readings  -- a sharpening of the so-called `Carnap problem'. We make explicit how the problems connect with each other precisely and argue that what results is a kind of underdetermination by the deductive apparatus for the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the disjunction-free fragment of Ja\'skowski's discussive logic D2 in the language of classical logic is shown to be complete with respect to three- and four-valued semantics. As a byproduct, a rather simple axiomatization of the disjunction-free fragment of D2 is obtained. Some implications of this result are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Formalization of Biological Circuit Block Diagrams for formally analyzing Biomedical Control Systems in pHRI Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of Biomedical Systems in Physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) plays a pivotal role in achieving the desired behavior by ensuring the intended transfer function and stability of subsystems within the overall system. Traditionally, the control aspects of biomedical systems have been analyzed using manual proofs and computer based analysis tools. However, these approaches provide inaccurate results due to human error in manual proofs and unverified algorithms and round-off errors in computer-based tools. We argue using Interactive reasoning, or frequently called theorem proving, to analyze control systems of biomedical engineering applications, specifically in the context of Physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI). Our methodology involves constructing mathematical models of the control components using Higher-order Logic (HOL) and analyzing them through deductive reasoning in the HOL Light theorem prover. We propose to model these control systems in terms of their block diagram representations, which in turn utilize the corresponding differential equations and their transfer function-based representation using the Laplace Transform (LT). These formally represented block diagrams are then analyzed through logical reasoning in the trusted environment of a theorem prover to ensure the correctness of the results. For illustration, we present a real-world case study by analyzing the control system of the ultrafilteration dialysis process.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{FORM}$: Learning Expressive and Transferable First-Order Logic Reward Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) are an effective approach for addressing non-Markovian rewards in reinforcement learning (RL) through finite-state machines. Traditional RMs, which label edges with propositional logic formulae, inherit the limited expressivity of propositional logic. This limitation hinders the learnability and transferability of RMs since complex tasks will require numerous states and edges. To overcome these challenges, we propose First-Order Reward Machines ($\texttt{FORM}$s), which use first-order logic to label edges, resulting in more compact and transferable RMs. We introduce a novel method for $\textbf{learning}$ $\texttt{FORM}$s and a multi-agent formulation for $\textbf{exploiting}$ them and facilitate their transferability, where multiple agents collaboratively learn policies for a shared $\texttt{FORM}$. Our experimental results demonstrate the scalability of $\texttt{FORM}$s with respect to traditional RMs. Specifically, we show that $\texttt{FORM}$s can be effectively learnt for tasks where traditional RM learning approaches fail. We also show significant improvements in learning speed and task transferability thanks to the multi-agent learning framework and the abstraction provided by the first-order language.</description>

      <title>Semi-Substructural Logics \`a la Lambek</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the proof theory of left (right) skew monoidal closed categories and skew monoidal bi-closed categories from the perspective of  non-associative Lambek calculus. Skew monoidal closed categories represent a relaxed version of monoidal closed categories, where the structural laws are not invertible; instead, they are natural transformations with a specific orientation. Uustalu et al. used sequents with stoup (the leftmost position of an antecedent that can be either empty or a single formula) to deductively model left skew monoidal closed categories, yielding results regarding proof identities and categorical coherence. However, their syntax does not work well when modeling right skew monoidal closed and skew monoidal bi-closed categories.
  We solve the problem by constructing cut-free sequent calculi for left skew monoidal closed and skew monoidal bi-closed categories, reminiscent of non-associative Lambek calculus, with trees as antecedents. Each calculus is respectively equivalent to the sequent calculus with stoup (for left skew monoidal categories) and the axiomatic calculus (for skew monoidal bi-closed categories). Moreover, we prove that the latter calculus is sound and complete with respect to its relational models. We also prove a correspondence between frame conditions and structural laws, providing an algebraic way to understand the relationship between the left and right skew monoidal (closed) categories.</description>

Abstract: I propose a model of aggregation of intervals relevant to the study of legal standards of tolerance. Seven axioms: responsiveness, anonymity, continuity, strategyproofness, and three variants of neutrality are then used to prove several important results about a new class of aggregation methods called endpoint rules. The class of endpoint rules includes extreme tolerance (allowing anything permitted by anyone) and a form of majoritarianism (the median rule).</description>

      <title>Discounted-Sum Automata with Multiple Discount Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discounting the influence of future events is a key paradigm in economics and it is widely used in computer-science models, such as games, Markov decision processes (MDPs), reinforcement learning, and automata. While a single game or MDP may allow for several different discount factors, discounted-sum automata (NDAs) were only studied with respect to a single discount factor. It is known that every class of NDAs with an integer as the discount factor has good computational properties: It is closed under determinization and under the algebraic operations min, max, addition, and subtraction, and there are algorithms for its basic decision problems, such as automata equivalence and containment. Extending the integer discount factor to an arbitrary rational number, loses most of these good properties.
  We define and analyze nondeterministic discounted-sum automata in which each transition can have a different integral discount factor (integral NMDAs). We show that integral NMDAs with an arbitrary choice of discount factors are not closed under determinization and under algebraic operations and that their containment problem is undecidable. We then define and analyze a restricted class of integral NMDAs, which we call tidy NMDAs, in which the choice of discount factors depends on the prefix of the word read so far. Among their special cases are NMDAs that correlate discount factors to actions (alphabet letters) or to the elapsed time. We show that for every function $\theta$ that defines the choice of discount factors, the class of $\theta$-NMDAs enjoys all of the above good properties of NDAs with a single integral discount factor, as well as the same complexity of the required decision problems. Tidy NMDAs are also as expressive as deterministic integral NMDAs with an arbitrary choice of discount factors.</description>

      <title>The Sigma-max System Induced from Randomness &amp; Fuzziness and its Application in Time Series Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.07722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper managed to induce probability theory (sigma system) and possibility theory (max system) respectively from the clearly-defined randomness and fuzziness, while focusing the question why the key axiom of "maxitivity" is adopted for possibility measure. Such an objective is achieved by following three steps: a) the establishment of mathematical definitions of randomness and fuzziness; b) the development of intuitive definition of possibility as measure of fuzziness based on compatibility interpretation; c) the abstraction of the axiomatic definitions of probability/ possibility from their intuitive definitions, by taking advantage of properties of the well-defined randomness and fuzziness. We derived the conclusion that "max" is the only but un-strict disjunctive operator that is applicable across the fuzzy event space, and is an exact operator for extracting the value from the fuzzy sample space that leads to the largest possibility of one. Then a demonstration example of stock price prediction is presented, which confirms that max inference indeed exhibits distinctive performance, with an improvement up to 18.99%, over sigma inference for the investigated application. Our work provides a physical foundation for the axiomatic definition of possibility for the measure of fuzziness, which hopefully would facilitate wider adoption of possibility theory in practice.</description>

Abstract: Today, the vast majority of the world's digital information is represented using the fundamental assumption, introduced by Claude Shannon in 1948, that ``...the semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem (of the design of communication systems)...''. Consider, nonetheless, the observation that we often combine a message with other information in order to deduce new facts, thereby expanding the value of such a message. It is noteworthy that to-date, no rigorous theory of communication has been put forth which postulates the existence of deductive capabilities on the receiver's side.
  The purpose of this paper is to present such a theory. We formally model such deductive capabilities using logic reasoning, and present a rigorous theory which covers the following generic scenario: Alice and Bob each have knowledge of some logic sentence, and they wish to communicate as efficiently as possible with the shared goal that, following their communication, Bob should be able to deduce a particular logic sentence that Alice knows to be true, but that Bob currently cannot prove. Many variants of this general setup are considered in this article; in all cases we are able to provide sharp upper and lower bounds. Our contribution includes the identification of the most fundamental requirements that we place on a logic and associated logical language for all of our results to apply. Practical algorithms that are in some cases asymptotically optimal are provided, and we illustrate the potential practical value of the design of communication systems that incorporate the assumption of deductive capabilities at the receiver using experimental results that suggest significant possible gains compared to classical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epistemic logic is known as a logic that captures the knowledge and beliefs of agents and has undergone various developments since Hintikka (1962). In this paper, we propose a new logic called agent-knowledge logic by taking the product of individual knowledge structures and the set of relationships among agents. This logic is based on the Facebook logic proposed by Seligman et al. (2011) and the Logic of Hide and Seek Game proposed by Li et al. (2021). We show two main results; one is that this logic can embed the standard epistemic logic, and the other is that there is a proof system of tableau calculus that works in finite time. We also discuss various sentences and inferences that this logic can express.</description>

      <title>FLARE: Faithful Logic-Aided Reasoning and Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more granular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However, such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. We introduce $\textbf{F}$aithful $\textbf{L}$ogic-$\textbf{A}$ided $\textbf{R}$easoning and $\textbf{E}$xploration ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our method allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t. the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without relying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on $\mathbf{7}$ out of $\mathbf{9}$ diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further demonstrate that $\textbf{FLARE}$ allows pinpointing the decisive factors sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during the multi-hop search.</description>

      <title>Constrained LTL Specification Learning from Examples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal logic specifications play an important role in a wide range of software analysis tasks, such as model checking, automated synthesis, program comprehension, and runtime monitoring. Given a set of positive and negative examples, specified as traces, LTL learning is the problem of synthesizing a specification, in linear temporal logic (LTL), that evaluates to true over the positive traces and false over the negative ones. In this paper, we propose a new type of LTL learning problem called constrained LTL learning, where the user, in addition to positive and negative examples, is given an option to specify one or more constraints over the properties of the LTL formula to be learned. We demonstrate that the ability to specify these additional constraints significantly increases the range of applications for LTL learning, and also allows efficient generation of LTL formulas that satisfy certain desirable properties (such as minimality). We propose an approach for solving the constrained LTL learning problem through an encoding in first-order relational logic and reduction to an instance of the maximal satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that ATLAS, an implementation of our proposed approach, is able to solve new types of learning problems while performing better than or competitively with the state-of-the-art tools in LTL learning.</description>
