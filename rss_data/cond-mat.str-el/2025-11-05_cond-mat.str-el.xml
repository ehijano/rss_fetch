      <title>Marginal Fermi liquids from Fermi surfaces coupled via matrix boson gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model of metallic critical point which we study at $T=0$ in the large-$N$ limit. We start with two species of fermions $c_i, f_i$, each with $N$ flavors and matrix bosons $b_{ij}$ with $N^2$ components. They interact with each other via slave-boson like interaction $\int b_{ij}^{\dagger} \, c_i^{\dagger}f_j$. The bosons have a bare dispersion of $\varepsilon_{\textbf{q}}^b = \lambda_z |\textbf{q}|^z$ and we study the problem in $d$ spatial dimensions. We show that for $d = z+1,$ the electronic self energy shows marginal Fermi liquid behavior. We first evaluate the fermionic self energy $\Sigma(i\omega)$ using the standard approximate boson self energy $\Pi(\textbf{q}, i\nu) \propto |\nu|/|\textbf{q}|$ and find that $\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega \ln(N/|\omega|)$ which shows a much weaker dependence on $N$ when compared with similar results from non-SYK large-$N$ Ising-nematic models. Then we evaluate $\Sigma(i\omega)$ again using a more precise form of $\Pi$ which allows us to study the interplay between $N \rightarrow \infty$ limit for which $\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega \ln(1/|\omega|)$, and the $\omega \rightarrow 0$ limit where we recover $\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega \ln(N/|\omega|)$. We also use the full bosonic self energy to obtain the correction to the bosonic specific heat as $\frac{T}{N} \ln(1/T)$. Since there are $N^2$ bosons and $N$ fermions, the bulk heat capacity for both fermions and bosons show nearly similar functional form $NVT \ln(N/T)$ and $NVT \ln(1/T)$ respectively for $T \rightarrow 0$.</description>

      <title>Role of on-site Coulomb energy and negative-charge transfer in a Dirac semi-metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in combination with band structure calculations have shown that the layered transition metal dichalcogenide NiTe$_2$ is a type-II Dirac semimetal. However, there are conflicting conclusions in the literature regarding the role of electron correlations in NiTe$_2$. We study the core-level and valence band electronic structure of single crystal NiTe$_2$ using soft and hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPES, HAXPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Ni $2p-3d$ resonant photoemission spectroscopy(resonant-PES) to quantify electronic parameters in NiTe$_2$. The on-site Coulomb energy ($U_{dd}$) in the Ni $3d$ states is quantified from measurements of the Ni $3d$ single particle density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite. The Ni $2p$ core level and $L$-edge XAS spectra are analyzed by charge transfer cluster model calculations using the experimentally estimated $U_{dd}$ (= 3.7 eV), and the results show that NiTe$_2$ exhibits a negative charge-transfer energy ($\Delta$ = -2.8 eV). The same type of cluster model analysis of NiO $L$-edge XAS confirms its well-known strongly correlated charge-transfer insulator character, with $U_{dd}$ = 7.0 eV and $\Delta$ = 6.0 eV. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for NiTe$_2$$&lt;$NiO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in NiTe\textsubscript{2} compared to NiO is not due to an increase in $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$ count on the Ni site in NiTe$_{2}$ by nearly one electron is attributed to negative-$\Delta$ and a reduced $U_{dd}$. However, since $U_{dd}$$&gt;$$|\Delta|$, the results indicate the important role of a finite repulsive $U_{dd}$ in making NiTe$_{2}$ a moderately correlated $p$-type Dirac semi-metal.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Non-perturbative Many-Body Approaches in the Exactly Solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate simulation of strongly correlated electron systems remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics, motivating the development of various non-perturbative many-body methods. Such methods are typically benchmarked against the numerical exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) in the Hubbard model; however, DQMC is limited by the fermionic sign problem and the uncertainties of numerical analytic continuation. To address these issues, we use the exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model as a benchmarking platform to evaluate three many-body approximations: $GW$, $HGW$, and $SGW$. We compare the Green's functions, spectral functions, and response functions obtained from these approximations with the exact solutions. Our analysis shows that the $GW$ approximation, often considered insufficient for describing strong correlation, exhibits a previously unreported solution branch that accurately reproduces Mott physics in the HK model. In addition, using a covariant formalism, we find that $HGW$ provides an accurate description of charge response, while $SGW$ performs well for spin correlations. Overall, our work demonstrates that the HK model can effectively benchmark many-body approximations and helps refine the understanding of $GW$ methods in strongly correlated regimes.</description>

      <title>The two-dimensional optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model: ground state and thermodynamic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, in which the electron hopping amplitude is modulated by the difference between neighboring phonon coordinates. Using sign-problem-free auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by mean-field analysis, we determine the long-range ordered phases as a function of the electron-phonon coupling and phonon frequency. By examining both adiabatic and antiadiabatic regimes, we reveal the emergence of staggered and armchair valence bond solid (VBS) phases, as well as the O(4) antiferromagnetic phase. In addition, finite-temperature simulations show that the VBS transition occurs at critical temperatures significantly higher than in models with local electron-phonon coupling, consistent with the presence of lighter polarons in the metallic regime. These findings establish the ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams of the optical SSH model, which emphasize its similarities and contrasts with other electron-phonon systems.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic NISPT Phases, igNISPT Phases, and Mixed Anomalies of Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A bosonic non-invertible Symmetry Protected Topological (NISPT) phase in (1+1)-dim is referred to as $\textit{intrinsic}$ if it cannot be mapped, under discrete gauging, to a gapped phase with any invertible symmetry, that is, if it is protected by a non-group-theoretical fusion category symmetry. We construct the intrinsic NISPT phases by performing discrete gauging in a partial SSB phase with a fusion category symmetry that has a certain mixed anomaly. Sometimes, the anomaly of that symmetry category can be alternatively understood as a self-anomaly of a proper categorical sub-symmetry; when this is the case, the same gauging provides an anomaly resolution of this anomalous categorical sub-symmetry. This allows us to construct intrinsic gapless SPT (igSPT) phases, where the anomalous faithfully acting symmetry is non-invertible; and we refer to such igSPT phases as igNISPT phases. We provide two concrete lattice models realizing an intrinsic NISPT phase and an igNISPT phase, respectively. We also generalize the construction of intrinsic NISPT phases to (3+1)-dim.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the collective modes in a non-centrosymmetric superconductor with Rashba spin-orbit coupling under laser irradiation. The concept of Anderson Pseudospin Resonance allows to reveal how laser driving gives rise not only to the established resonant enhancement of the third harmonic response, but also to a resonant enhancement in the second harmonic response of the spin current. We propose a theory which explains the phenomenon without including interband transitions. The theory is corroborated by numerical simulations which incorporate interband effects and allow us to clarify the signatures of the collective modes in the long-time dynamics of the superconductor.</description>

      <title>Superconducting pairing correlations on a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character-which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements-and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum\'s Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Origin of sublattice particle-hole asymmetry in monolayer FeSe superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In iron-based superconductors, the two Fe atoms in the unit cell are typically related by crystal symmetries; therefore, we expect no intra-unit cell variations in the superconducting gap. However, recent experiments have challenged this expectation, reporting intra-unit cell variations in the gap with an unusual particle-hole asymmetry. Here, we examine the origin of this asymmetry between the two Fe sublattices in monolayer FeSe grown on SrTiO$_3$. We reveal that, in addition to the substrate-induced broken inversion symmetry, substrate nematic symmetry breaking is key to observing this asymmetry. We further identify two possible mechanisms through which this can occur. The first is through an odd-parity gap function that coexists with an extended $s$-wave function. The second is via a nodeless $d$-wave gap function that develops in the presence of a symmetry-breaking substrate. We argue that the latter mechanism is more physical. To test our theory, we performed scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements across the nematic domain walls, which exhibit a clear enhancement of the asymmetry between the two Fe sublattices. In addition, we reveal that the observed sublattice particle-hole asymmetry is associated with odd-frequency pairing correlations, providing an experimental realization of this unusual pairing correlation.</description>

      <title>Charge glass from supercooling topological-ordered liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological order characterizes a class of quantum and classical many-body liquid states that escape the conventional classification by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Many properties of the topological-ordered states still await a clear understanding, and nature of phase transition dynamics is one of them. Normally, when a liquid freezes into a solid, crystallization starts with nucleation and a solid domain quickly grows on the surface of the expanding nucleus, and the domains evolve into macroscopic size. In this work, we reveal that the crystallization of the topological-ordered liquid proceeds in a fundamentally different way. The topological-ordered phase is characterized by a global conserved quantity and its conjugate fractional charge, which we call a flux and a triplet in our working system of the charge Ising model on a triangular lattice. In contrast to the normal crystallization process, the phase transition is driven by the diffusive motion of triplets, which is required to change the value of conserved fluxes to exit the topological-ordered phase. In order to complete crystallization, triplets must spend a divergently long time to diffuse over a macroscopic distance across the system, which results in glassy behavior. Reflecting the diffusive motion of triplets, the initial crystallization process shows slowing down with unusually small Avrami exponent $\sim0.5$. These anomalous dynamics are specific to the crystallization from topological-ordered liquid, and well account for the main features of charge glass behavior exhibited by the organic conductors, $\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X(SCN)$_4$.</description>

      <title>Spin and orbital excitations in undoped infinite layers: a comparison between superconducting PrNiO2 and insulating CaCuO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02448v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infinite-layer nickelates are among the most promising cuprate-akin superconductors, although relevant differences from copper oxides have been reported. Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinitelayer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta.</description>

      <title>Mean field magnetism and spin frustration in a double perovskite oxide with compositional complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of high-entropy oxides as a major functional materials design principle in recent years has prompted us to investigate how compositional disorder affects long-range magnetic ordering in double perovskite oxides. Since ferromagnetic insulators are emerging as an important platform for lossless spintronics, we consider the $RE_2$NiMnO$_6$ ($RE$ : rare-earth) family and investigate single-crystalline films of (La$_{0.4}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sm$_{0.4}$Gd$_{0.4}$Y$_{0.4}$)NiMnO$_{6}$ grown on SrTiO$_3$ (001) substrates in this work. Despite configurational disorder and high cationic size variance at the $RE$ site, the material exhibits robust ferromagnetic ordering with a Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) of approximately 150 K. This $T_\mathrm{c}$ is consistent with the expectation based on consideration of the average ionic radii of the rare-earth ($RE$) sites in the bulk $RE_2$NiMnO$_6$. Below $T_\mathrm{c}$, Raman spectroscopy measurement finds a deviation from anharmonic behavior, where the phonon renormalization aligns with a mean-field approximation of spin-spin correlation. At lower temperature, magnetic $RE$ ions also contributed to the magnetic behavior and the system displays a reentrant spin-glass-like behavior. This study demonstrates that while a mean-field approach serves as a viable starting point for predicting the long-range transition temperature, microscopic details of the complex magnetic interactions are essential for understanding the low-temperature phase.</description>

      <title>Noises in a two-channel charge Kondo model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate fluctuations of electric and heat currents, along with their cross-correlations, in a two-channel charge Kondo circuit driven by either a voltage bias or a temperature gradient applied across the weak link. The ratios of voltage-driven electric/heat noise to the applied voltage $V$ exhibit oscillations with the gate voltage $N$, resembling the behavior of the thermoelectric coefficient $G_T$. In contrast, the ratios of temperature-driven electric/heat noise to the temperature difference $\Delta T$ vary with $N$ in a manner analogous to the thermal coefficient $G_H$ or the electric conductance $G$. The mixed noise, which is defined as the correlation function between electric and heat currents, displays behavior opposite to that of the above noises. The logarithmic temperature dependence of these noises signals non-Fermi-liquid behavior, while their oscillations with gate voltage reflect the roles of particle-hole and time-reversal symmetries in thermoelectric transport. Our results demonstrate that the fundamental relations linking voltage- and temperature-induced noises to thermoelectric transport across a tunnel junction persist beyond the Fermi-liquid paradigm.</description>

      <title>Generalized Witt and Morita equivalences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a family of new equivalence relations among fusion categories that are less refined than the usual Morita equivalence. We obtain abelian groups by quotienting these new equivalence relations from the commutative monoids of the equivalence classes of all fusion categories. Moreover, we upgrade them to equivalence relations among nondegenerate braided fusion categories that are more refined than the usual Witt equivalence. As a consequence, we obtain new abelian groups that are more refined than the usual Witt group. These new groups allow us to access the internal structures within Witt classes. We expect that they are useful in the classification program of (braided) fusion (higher) categories and in the study of gapless edges of 2+1D topological orders.</description>

      <title>Exciton dynamics, Fano quantum interference and d-d excitation in the single crystal of two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Fe2P2S6</title>

Abstract: Excitonic quasiparticle and their interactions with phonons, magnons and charge carriers may play a pivotal role in governing the optical properties and their correlation with magnetic interactions in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors. Further, in transition metal compounds, d-d electronic transitions, arising from excitations between crystal-field split d-orbitals, significantly influence the optical and magnetic properties, particularly in strongly correlated and low-dimensional systems. Fe2P2S6, a layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor, offers a rich platform for studying the interplay between spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom in these 2D systems. In this work, we investigate the photoluminescence (PL) properties of Fe2P2S6 to probe the exciton dynamics, intra-atomic transitions, and their temperature evolution. Two prominent d-d emission peaks are observed at ~ 1.63 eV (D1) and ~ 1.80 eV (D2), attributed to the crystal field-split Fe2+ states. An excitonic emission near the band edge is also identified, which exhibits a characteristic Fano asymmetric line shape. This asymmetry is attributed to the quantum interference between the discrete excitonic state and the d-d transition induced continuum (D2), revealing a Fano resonance behaviour. This exciton peak disappears well before the Neel temperature, indicating its faster destabilization than magnetic ordering. Temperature-dependent PL measurements show a quenching of the excitonic peak with increasing temperature. Our findings provide detailed insight into the optical excitation pathways in Fe2P2S6.</description>

      <title>From Densities to Potentials: Benchmarking Local Exchange-Correlation Approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Kohn-Sham (KS) inversion method of Hollins et al. [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 29, 04LT01 (2017)], we invert densities from variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations to obtain benchmark QMC-KS potentials for a range of insulators and semiconductors, which we then compare to the KS potentials of popular density functional approximations (DFAs). Our results show that different DFAs yield similar electron densities, despite differences in their KS potentials, which originate primarily from the exchange and correlation contribution. We also find that the KS gap from the QMC density is typically larger than the KS gaps of most DFAs, with the exception of Hartree-Fock. Finally, the KS gap is sensitive to the inclusion of semicore states in the pseudopotentials, such that comparison with experiment should be done with caution.</description>

      <title>Majorana string simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics in two-dimensional lattice fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of real-time dynamics of fermions remains one of the last frontiers beyond the reach of classical simulations and is key to our understanding of quantum behavior in chemistry and materials, with implications for quantum technology. Here we introduce a Heisenberg-picture algorithm that propagates observables expressed in a Majorana-string basis using a truncation scheme that preserves Trotter accuracy and aims at maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is exact for quadratic Hamiltonians--remaining restricted to a fixed low-weight sector determined by the physical observable--admits variational initial states, and can be extended to interacting regimes via systematically controlled truncations. We benchmark our approach on one- and two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard quenches, comparing against tensor network methods (MPS and fPEPS) and recent experimental data. The method achieves high accuracy on timescales comparable to state-of-the-art variational techniques and experiments, demonstrating that controlled Majorana-string truncation is a practical tool for simulating two-dimensional fermionic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general representation for solving problems in many-body perturbation theory. By projecting the single-particle Green's function to an auxiliary space we show how one can convert an arbitrary Feynman graph to a universal kernel representation. Once constructed, the computation kernel contains no problem specific information yet contains all explicit temperature and frequency dependence of the diagram. This computation kernel is problem agnostic, and valid for any physical problem that would normally leverage the Matsubara formalism of many-body perturbation theory. The result of any diagram can be written as a linear combination of these computation kernel elements with coefficients given by a sum over products of known tensor elements that are themselves problem specific and represent spatial degrees of freedom. We probe the efficacy of this approach by generating the computation kernel for a low order self-energy diagram which we then use to construct solutions to distinct problems.</description>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Ising models on frustrated lattices can realize classical spin liquids, with highly degenerate ground states and, possibly, fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. Motivated by the recent interest in many-body system in negatively curved space, we study hyperbolic frustrated Ising models. Specifically, we consider nearest-neighbor Ising models on tesselations with odd-length loops in two-dimensional hyperbolic space. For finite systems with open boundaries we determine the ground-state degeneracy exactly, and we perform extensive finite-temperature Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain thermodynamic data as well as correlation functions. We show that the shape of the boundary, constituting an extensive part of the system, can be used to control low-energy states: Depending on the boundary, we find ordered or disordered ground states. Our results demonstrate how geometric frustration acts in curved space to produce classical spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Quasiconservation Laws and Suppressed Transport in Weakly Interacting Localized Models</title>

Abstract: The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.</description>

      <title>Static treatment of dynamic interactions in the single-orbital Anderson impurity model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlated electron physics is intrinsically a multiscale problem, since high-energy electronic states screen the interactions between the correlated electrons close to the Fermi level, thereby reducing the magnitude of the interaction strength and dramatically shortening its range. Thus, the handling of screening is an essential ingredient in the first-principles modelling of correlated electron systems. Screening is an intrinsically dynamic process and the corresponding downfolding methods such as the constrained Random Phase Approximation indeed produce a dynamic interaction. However, many low-energy methods require an instantaneous interaction as input, which makes it necessary to map the fully dynamic interaction to an effective instantaneous interaction strength. It is a priori not clear if and when such an effective model can capture the physics of the one with dynamic interaction and how to best perform the mapping. Here, we provide a systematic benchmark relevant to correlated materials, in the form of the Anderson impurity model. Overall, we find that a static approximation can be valid and that the moment-based approach recently proposed by Scott and Booth can be a good tool to find the value of the static interaction. We also identify physical regimes, especially under doping, where an instantaneous interaction cannot capture all of the relevant physics.</description>

Abstract: Recent works on the scaling behaviors of entanglement entropy at the SO(5) deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) sparked a huge controversy. Different bipartitions gave out totally different conclusions for whether the DQCP is consistent with a unitary conformal field theory. In this work, we connect two previously disconnected fields -- the many-body entanglement and the surface criticality -- to reveal the behaviors of entanglement entropy in various bipartite scenarios, and point out that only the ordinary bipartition purely reflects the criticality of the bulk; otherwise, the extra gapless edge mode will also contribute to the entanglement. We have demonstrated that the correspondence between the entanglement spectrum and the edge energy spectrum still approximately persists even at a bulk-gapless point, thereby influencing the behavior of entanglement entropy. Our results establish that boundary conditions induced by the cut are decisive for entanglement-based probes and provide practical protocols to separate bulk from boundary contributions.</description>

Abstract: Infinite-layer (IL) nickelates have rapidly emerged as a new class of superconductors. However, due to the technical challenges of their topotactic synthesis, they have so far been realized primarily as thin films or polycrystalline powder samples, limiting comprehensive investigations of fundamental physical properties such as the lattice dynamics. Here, we present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study on a sample composed of a large number of co-aligned bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$. We observe several dispersive phonon branches, which are in good agreement with lattice dynamical calculations based on density-functional perturbation theory. In addition, we compare the characteristics of selected LaNiO$_2$ phonon modes to those of isostructural cuprate superconductors. Our findings provide a reference point for future experimental and theoretical efforts aimed at understanding the interplay between lattice dynamics and electronic properties in IL nickelates.</description>

Abstract: The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) encapsulates the essential entanglement properties of a quantum many-body system and serves as a powerful theoretical construct. From the EH, one can extract a variety of entanglement quantities, such as entanglement entropies, negativity, and the entanglement spectrum. However, its general analytical form remains largely unknown. While the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem gives an exact EH form for Lorentz-invariant field theories, its validity on lattice systems is limited, especially when Lorentz invariance is absent. In this work, we propose a general scheme based on the lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann (LBW) ansatz and multi-replica-trick quantum Monte Carlo methods to numerically reconstruct the entanglement Hamiltonian in two-dimensional systems and systematically explore its applicability to systems without translational invariance, going beyond the original scope of the primordial Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Various quantum phases--including gapped and gapless phases, critical points, and phases with either discrete or continuous symmetry breaking--are investigated, demonstrating the versatility of our method in reconstructing entanglement Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find that when the entanglement boundary of a system is ordinary (i.e., free from surface anomalies), the LBW ansatz provides an accurate approximation well beyond Lorentz-invariant cases. Our work thus establishes a general framework for investigating the analytical structure of entanglement in complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Following Hollins et al. [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 29, 04LT01 (2017)], we invert the electronic ground state densities for various semiconducting and insulating solids calculated using several density functional approximations within the generalised Kohn-Sham (GKS) scheme, Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and the LDA+$U$ method, and benchmark against standard (semi-)local functionals. The band structures from the resulting local exchange-correlation (LXC) Kohn-Sham potential for these densities are then compared with the band structures of the original GKS method. We find the LXC potential obtained from the HF density systematically predicts band gaps in good agreement with experiment, even in strongly correlated transition metal monoxides (TMOs). Furthermore, we find that the HSE06 and PBE0 hybrid functionals yield similar densities and LXC potentials, and in weakly correlated systems, these potentials are similar to PBE. For LDA+$U$ densities, the LXC potential effectively reverses the flattening of bands caused by over-localisation by a large Hubbard-$U$ value, while for meta-GGAs, we find only small differences between the GKS and LXC results demonstrating that the non-locality of meta-GGAs is weak.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics in non-Hermitian systems has attracted significant interest, particularly due to the skin effect and its associated anomalous phenomena. Previous studies have primarily focused on initial states with a definite particle number. Here, we present a systematic study of non-reciprocal quench dynamics in the pairing states with indefinite particle number. Our study uncovers a range of novel behaviors. Firstly, we demonstrate a universal tendency towards half-filling of particle density at late times. At early times for certain initial states, we observe a chiral wavefront in both particle number distribution and charge inflow, associated with a sharp decrease in particle number. Furthermore, we find that non-Hermiticity could enhance the growth of entanglement in the initial stages of evolution. In the intermediate time regime, the characteristic skin effect leads to particle accumulation on one side, leading to a pronounced reduction in entanglement entropy. Moreover, our results reveal the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect during the restoration of U(1) symmetry. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic dynamic phenomena in quantum many-body systems arising from the interplay of symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we theoretically discuss thermal Hall effect of magnons in insulating N\'{e}el ordered antiferromagnets at zero external magnetic field. We show that for compensated N\'{e}el order the non-zero thermal Hall effect will occur inthe absence of any symmetry between the two magnetic sublattices, thus making the system ferrimagnetic. The thermal Hall effect of magnons will be non-zero by a virtue of the spin-momentum splitting of the magnon spectrum due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as well as anisotropic second-nearest exchange interaction different in the two magnetic sublattices, both corresponding to the broken symmetry. We construct a theoretical model in which an external electric field may change the symmetry of the antiferromagnetic system thus altering the thermal Hall effect of magnons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated electrons is a formidable challenge in condensed matter physics and computational chemistry. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some of the correlated behavior using an impurity model, but it is limited by the need to calculate the impurity Green's function. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins state preparation with time evolution to compute Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 qubits, 1 ancilla). We discuss potential paths toward realizing this quantum computing use case in materials science.</description>

Abstract: Experiments on twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide have demonstrated that moir'e semiconductors can realize a relativistic Mott transition, i.e., a quantum phase transition from a Dirac semimetal to a correlated insulating state, by twist-angle tuning. In addition, signatures of van Hove singularities were observed in the material's moir'e valence bands, suggesting further potential for the emergence of strongly-correlated states. Based on a continuum model, we provide a detailed analysis of the twist-angle dependence of the system's band structure, focusing on the evolution of the Dirac excitations and the Fermi-surface structure with its Lifshitz transitions across the van Hove fillings. We exhibit that the twist angle can be used to band engineer a high-order van Hove singularity, which can be accessed by gate tuning. We then study the magnetic phase diagram of an effective Hubbard model for twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide on the effective honeycomb superlattice with tight-binding parameters fitted to the two topmost bands of the continuum model. To that end, we employ a self-consistent Hartree-Fock mean-field approach in real space. Fixing the angle-dependent Hubbard interaction based on the experimental findings, we explore a broad parameter range of twist angle, filling, and temperature. We find a rich variety of magnetic states that we expect to be accessible in future experiments, including, e.g., a non-coplanar spin-density wave with non-zero spin chirality and a half-metallic uniaxial spin-density wave. Finally, we employ a functional renormalization group approach to also study the competition between density-wave and superconducting instabilities. For twist angles of $\theta=2.0^\circ, 2.5^\circ$, as well as $\theta\approx 3.5^\circ$ -- where the high-order van Hove-singularity is found -- we find clear indications for unconventional superconductivity.</description>
