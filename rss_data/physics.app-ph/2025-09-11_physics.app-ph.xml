      <title>A Planetary Cooling Hose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geoengineering may offer a way to pause global warming, providing the time for more permanent solutions to become effective. Erection of a high-altitude hose offers an affordable and near-term approach to deliver sulfur-bearing fluids to the stratosphere in order to perform geoengineering via solar radiation management. We discuss the design of a hose extending to an altitude of 20 km and sized to deliver 100 ktons of sulfur per year. The sulfur, in the form of H$_2$S, is pushed up the hose by a pump on the ground and then sprayed out at the top, forming H$_2$SO$_4$ aerosols which scatter enough sunlight to perform geoengineering. Because the hose operates continuously, it only has to deliver about 50 gallons/minute (little more than a garden hose). The flux from a single hose is not sufficient to stop global warming by itself, but is enough to test the effect of the aerosols, and, once replicated to about 20 sites across the planet, can offset all the warming caused by atmospheric CO$_2$.
  Two varieties of hose are presented here, one delivering H$_2$S as a liquid and the other as a gas. Pumping liquid H$_2$S through a narrow 20 km hose requires high pressure, which can be handled by strong and lightweight hose walls or by placing intermediate pumps along the hose. The hose is held up by a suite of balloons, either all at its top, or with some placed along its length as well. The greatest challenge in suspending such a hose is wind, which if not dealt with properly (by streamlining both the balloons and the hose) will collapse the hose. The wide hoses needed to deliver gaseous H$_2$S are particularly susceptible to wind, so must be enclosed within lightweight aero-shrouds to reduce wind forces.
  After treating the design of these two hoses, we lay out the steps needed to develop and fabricate them, and conclude with some thoughts on how the hoses might be fielded.</description>

      <title>A DEM-driven machine learning framework for abrasive wear prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-induced wear is a critical concern in bulk material handling systems, where abrasive interactions accelerate equipment degradation, increase maintenance needs, and raise operational costs. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) and Archard's wear model are widely adopted for predicting particle-surface wear processes. However, DEM is computationally prohibitive for real-time design and predictive maintenance, often requiring hours to days for a single parametric analysis. We propose a DEM-machine learning (ML) framework to address this limitation that combines physics-based simulations with data-driven efficiency. A dataset of 200 DEM simulations is generated by systematically varying particle size, material, and contacting plate geometric parameters. A few ML models -- linear regression, Lasso and Ridge regularization, decision trees, and a genetic algorithm-optimized artificial neural network (GA-ANN) -- were trained and evaluated. Feature selection revealed that Archard's wear constant, particle size, plate angle, and impingement velocity are the dominant predictors of wear. While linear models offered interpretability, their accuracy was limited. The GA-ANN achieved the highest performance $(R^2 = 0.91)$, effectively capturing nonlinear wear dynamics while reducing computational cost by orders of magnitude. This study demonstrates that physics-informed ML provides a scalable pathway for accurate, real-time wear prediction, enabling predictive maintenance and optimized design in bulk material handling industries.</description>

      <title>The-Bodega: A Matlab Toolbox for Biologically Dynamic Microbubble Simulations on Realistic Hemodynamic Microvascular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The-Bodega is a Matlab-based toolbox for simulating ground-truth datasets for Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM)-a super resolution imaging technique that resolves microvessels by systematically tracking microbubbles flowing through the microvasculature. The-Bodega enables open-source simulation of stochastic microbubble dynamics through anatomically complex vascular graphs and features a quasi-automated pipeline for generating ground-truth ultrasound data from simple vascular inputs. It incorporates sequential Monte Carlo simulations augmented with Poiseuille flow distributions and dynamic pulsatile flow. A key novelty of our framework is its flexibility to accommodate arbitrary vascular architectures and benchmark common ULM algorithms, such as Fourier Ring Correlation and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) spatiotemporal filtering, on realistic hemodynamic digital phantoms. The-Bodega supports consistent microbubble-to-ultrasound simulations across domains ranging from mouse brains to human hearts and automatically leverages available CPU/GPU parallelization to improve computational efficiency. We demonstrate its versatility in applications including image quality assessment, motion artifact analysis, and the simulation of novel ULM modalities, such as capillary imaging, myocardial reconstruction under beating heart motion, and simulating neurovascular evoked responses.</description>

      <title>Highly tunable Gilbert damping in two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2: From bilayer to the twisted bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 possesses both a high Curie temperature and robust perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, holding promise for practical spintronic applications. In particular, understanding and engineering its Gilbert damping which determines magnetization dynamics are crucial for its applications. Here, we investigate the Gilbert damping of bilayer and the twisted bilayer Fe3GaTe2 through first-principles calculations. For the bilayer Fe3GaTe2, we obtain a quite low Gilbert damping when its magnetization is along the z axis at room temperature. In addition, the bilayer Fe3GaTe2 exhibits a large orientational anisotropy of Gilbert damping when its magnetization is rotated from the magnetic easy axis to the hard one. Such anisotropy is attributed to the distinct band structures caused by the anisotropic spin-orbit coupling. Surprisingly, we find that twisting the bilayer Fe3GaTe2 can effectively reduce the Gilbert damping for the perpendicular magnetization, and enhance the orientational anisotropy of Gilbert damping up to 635% when rotating the magnetization from the magnetic easy axis to the hard one. These findings open up an entirely new avenue for the manipulation of Gilbert damping and its anisotropy in two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>How Does Incubation Affect Laser Material Processing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decades, the subject of laser-induced damage (LID) moved from a topic of scientific interest toward laser material processing for technical applications. When using pulsed lasers, the cumulative effect known as incubation is one of the most fundamental features of the processing event. Incubation manifests by the fact that the critical fluence for LID (known as laser-induced damage threshold, LIDT) depends on the number of pulses N exciting one spot on the sample. In most cases, the threshold fluence decreases with N starting from the single-shot ablation threshold and remains constant for large N. No ablation or damage occurs for any N, if the fluence is kept below the multiple-pulse threshold. In contrast, examples where the LIDT increases with N have been reported. The latter effect is known as laser conditioning and is advantageously used when ramping up the power of high-power laser systems. Incubation has been described for many types of solids; the motivation for these comprehensive efforts is twofold. Firstly, one tries to prevent the damage of optical materials in the beam path of high-energy or high-peak-power lasers. Secondly, one deliberately uses this damage for the sculpting of components. In this chapter, we introduce the reader to the mechanisms of incubation. We are going to look at the parameters controlling LID and highlight the peculiarity of the parameter "number of pulses". We will give an overview of the experimental work done in a variety of materials. There are several physical and chemical mechanisms proposed that govern incubation, and there are several mathematical models to describe the behavior of threshold fluence and ablation rate in dependence on the number of pulses. In a few cases, the two classes of mechanisms are even related to each other. Eventually, we will show the implications that incubation has on real-world laser machining.</description>

      <title>Vortex controlled heat transfer in eight row plate fin and tube exchangers: CFD derived air side Nusselt correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates and characterizes the row dependent thermal performance of an 8 row finned tube heat exchanger (HEX) with an offset tube arrangement and continuous flat fins. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations reveal distinct hydraulic thermal behavior across the tube rows, with the first, second, and eighth rows exhibiting significantly higher heat transfer efficiency than the average for the entire HEX under specific flow conditions. At air velocities below 3 ms-1, the first rows exhibit increased efficiency, while the eighth row exhibits comparatively better efficiency at velocities exceeding 6 ms-1. In the fitted range (2.5 to 10 ms-1), orders 1, 2, and 8 outperform orders 3 to 7 by approximately 15 to 25% in Nusselt number, indicating that orders 1, 2, and 8 operate under distinct flow and thermal conditions. The study also determined individual Nusselt number correlations for each order through systematic simulations over the velocity range from 2.5 to 10 ms-1. The analysis further linked these changes to specific flow mechanisms, such as boundary layer development, wake interference, and vortex shedding, which govern the distinct thermal behavior of the first, second, and last orders. These findings can enable dual optimization: lower capital costs by minimizing the number of orders for the target thermal performance, and lower operating costs by reducing pressure drop (reducing fan power).</description>

      <title>Above and beyond the laser induced anti Stokes broadband white light emission in rare earth manganese perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Herein, an experimental and theoretical analysis of broadband laser-induced white light emission (LIWE) in lead-free perovskite under near-infrared excitation is reported. LIWE is a tunable emission influenced by excitation wavelength, power density, pressure, and temperature. The radiance profile presented in this work closely resembles the solar spectral distribution, suggesting potential for solid-state lighting and photovoltaic applications. Based on theoretical modelling, along with photophysical and photoconductivity characterisations, a mathematical description of the LIWE generation is presented. This model describes LIWE as a dynamical process that explains the supralinear dependence of the integrated emission intensity on laser power density, pressure, photophysical kinetics, and photocurrent associated with the emission phenomena under excitation at high laser power densities.</description>

      <title>A Beam-Steering Reflectarray Antenna with Arbitrary Linear-Polarization Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a beam-steering reflectarray antenna that achieves arbitrary linear polarization (LP) reconfiguration. This antenna employs a dual-circular polarization (CP) reconfigurable reflectarray and an LP feed horn to generate an LP beam. The incident LP wave is decomposed into two CP components, whose reflection phases are independently adjusted. By re-combining these reflected CP beams with different phase constants, arbitrary LP states can be synthesized. Experimental validation is performed using a 16$\times$16 1-bit reconfigurable reflectarray operating at Ku band, demonstrating reconfigurable LP states of LP(0$^\circ$), LP(45$^\circ$), LP(90$^\circ$) and LP(135$^\circ$), as well as dynamic beam scanning functionality from 0$^\circ$ to 60$^\circ$. This polarization-reconfigurable, beam-steering reflectarray has potential for applications in satellite and mobile communications, where both beam patterns and polarization alignment are crucial.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of domain wall current in MgO-doped lithium niobate single crystals up to 400 {\deg}C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conductive ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) represent a promising topical system for the development of nanoelectronic components and device sensors to be operational at elevated temperatures. DWs show very different properties as compared to their hosting bulk crystal, in particular with respect to the high local electrical conductivity. The objective of this work is to demonstrate DW conductivity up to temperatures as high as \SI{400}{\degreeCelsius} which extends previous studies significantly. Experimental investigation of the DW conductivity of charged, inclined DWs is performed using \SI{5}{\mole\percent} MgO-doped lithium niobate single crystals. \CR{Current-voltage (\IV) curves are determined by DC electrometer measurements and impedance spectroscopy and found to be identical. Moreover, impedance spectroscopy enables to recognize artifacts such as damaged electrodes. Temperature dependent measurements} over repeated heating cycles reveal two distinct thermal activation energies for a given DW, with the higher of the activation energies only measured at higher temperatures. Depending on the specific sample, the higher activation energy is found above \SI{160}{\degreeCelsius}~to~\SI{230}{\degreeCelsius}. This suggests, in turn, that more than one type of defect/polaron is involved, and that the dominant transport mechanism changes with increasing temperature. First principles atomistic modelling suggests that the conductivity of inclined domain walls cannot be solely explained by the formation of a 2D carrier gas and must be supported by hopping processes. This holds true even at temperatures as high as \SI{400}{\degreeCelsius}. Our investigations underline the potential to extend \DWC based nanoelectronic and sensor applications even into the so-far unexplored temperature range up to \SI{400}{\degreeCelsius}.</description>

      <title>An Innovative Photon-Driven Subcritical Reactor Concept Powered by Synchrotron Radiation Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the conceptual design of a Photon Driven Reactor (PDR), an innovative subcritical reactor designed for energy generation driven by a synchrotron radiation. The PDR concept overcomes key technological challenges of conventional accelerator-driven systems, particularly the target's structural durability and its thermal management, by employing synchrotron photons directly interacting with fissile material to induce photonuclear reactions. Computational analyses involved criticality and fixed-source simulation using MCNPx and SERPENT Monte Carlo codes, providing robust evaluation of the neutron production, moderation, and multiplication mechanisms. The main focus of this study was to evaluate the system's capability to achieve a positive net energy gain, specifically assessing the thermal power output agains the electrical power absorbed from the grid. Furthermore, the adoption of spent nuclear fuel for the subcritical reactor core loading has been investigated, highlighting the sustainability and environmental benefits of the proposed PDR design. The proposed system is able to exploit a modularity feature. For each large synchrotron, up to fifty beam lines may be operated simultaneously, each delivering photons to an independent subcritical reactor core. With a photon flux on the order of $8.8 \times 10^{17}$ photons per second in each beamline, the results indicate that each individual reactor can achieve a thermal output up to 8 MW, while requiring about 435-660 kW of electrical input from the grid, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of energy amplification in the PDR.</description>
