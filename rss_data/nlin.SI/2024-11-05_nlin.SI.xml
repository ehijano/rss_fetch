      <title>The Painlev\'e equivalence problem for a constrained 3D system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a geometric approach to study Painlev\'e equations appearing as constrained systems of three first-order ordinary differential equations. We illustrate this approach on a system of three first-order differential equations arising in the theory of semi-classical orthogonal polynomials. We show that it can be restricted to a system of two first-order differential equations in two different ways on an invariant hypersurface. We build the space of initial conditions for each of these restricted systems and verify that they exhibit the Painlev\'e property from a geometric perspective. Utilising the Painlev\'e identification algorithm we also relate this system to the Painlev\'e VI equation and we build its global Hamiltonian structure. Finally, we prove that the autonomous limit of the original system is Liouville integrable, and the level curves of its first integrals are elliptic curves, which leads us to conjecture that the 3D system itself also possesses the Painlev\'e property without the need to restrict it to the invariant hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Duality of the Navier-Stokes dynamics and lack of finite-time explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the duality of incompressible Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics in three dimensions, leading to its reformulation in terms of a one-dimensional momentum loop equation. \textbf{The momentum loop equation does not have finite-time blow-up solutions.} The decaying turbulence is a solution of this equation equivalent to a string theory with discrete target space made of regular star polygons and Ising degrees of freedom on the sides. This string theory is solvable in the turbulent limit, equivalent to the quasiclassical approximation in a nontrivial calculable background. \textbf{As a result, the spectrum of decay indexes is analytically computed, and it agrees very well with real and numerical experiments. } Among the decay indexes, there are complex conjugate pairs related to zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The Kolmogorov scaling laws are replaced by certain number theory functions, which are nonlinear in the log-log scale.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum curves of 5d Seiberg's theories and their 4d limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the classical and quantum Seiberg-Witten curves of 5d N = 1 SCFTs and their 4d limits. The 5d theories we consider are Seiberg's theories of type $E_{6,7,8}$, which serve as the UV completions of 5d SU(2) gauge theories with 5, 6, or 7 flavors. Their classical curves can be constructed using the five-brane web construction [1]. We also use it to re-derive their quantum curves [2], by employing a q-analogue of the Frobenius method in the style of [3]. This allows us to compare the reduction of these 5d curves with the 4d curves, i.e. Seiberg-Witten curves of the Minahan-Nemeschansky theories and their quantization, which have been identified in [4] with the spectral curves of rank-1 complex crystallographic elliptic Calogero-Moser systems.</description>

      <title>Exact periodic solutions of the generalized Constantin-Lax-Majda equation with dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present exact pole dynamics solutions to the generalized Constantin-Lax-Majda (gCLM) equation in a periodic geometry with dissipation $-\Lambda^\sigma$, where its spatial Fourier transform is $\widehat{\Lambda^\sigma}=|k|^\sigma$. The gCLM equation is a simplified model for singularity formation in the 3D incompressible Euler equations. It includes an advection term with parameter $a$, which allows different relative weights for advection and vortex stretching. There has been intense interest in the gCLM equation, and it has served as a proving ground for the development of methods to study singularity formation in the 3D Euler equations. Several exact solutions for the problem on the real line have been previously found by the method of pole dynamics, but only one such solution has been reported for the periodic geometry. We derive new periodic solutions for $a=0$ and $1/2$ and $\sigma=0$ and $1$, for which a closed collection of (periodically repeated) poles evolve in the complex plane. Self-similar finite-time blow-up of the solutions is analyzed and compared for the different values of $\sigma$, and to a global-in-time well-posedness theory for solutions with small data presented in a previous paper of the authors. Motivated by the exact solutions, the well-posedness theory is extended to include the case $a=0$, $\sigma \geq 0$. Several interesting features of the solutions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Potentials with finite-band spectrum and finite-dimensional reductions of BKM systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We repeat, using methods developed for BKM systems, the famous results of S. Novikov (1974), J. Moser (1981, 1982) , and A. Veselov (1980) that relate Schr\"odinger-Hill operators with finite-band spectra, solutions of the Neumann system, and certain solutions of the KdV equations. Our general motivation is to determine whether it is possible to apply inverse scattering methods to BKM systems, and in the conclusion, we indicate initial observations in this direction.</description>

      <title>Exact solitary wave solutions for a coupled gKdV-Schrodinger system by a new ODE reduction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new method is developed for finding exact solitary wave solutions of a generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation with p-power nonlinearity coupled to a linear Schr\"odinger equation arising in many different physical applications. This method yields 22 solution families, with p=1,2,3,4. No solutions for p&gt;1 were known previously in the literature. For p=1, four of the solution families contain bright/dark Davydov solitons of the 1st and 2nd kind, obtained in recent work by basic ansatze applied to the ODE system for travelling waves. All of the new solution families have interesting features, including bright/dark peaks with (up to) p symmetric pairs of side peaks in the amplitude and a kink profile for the nonlinear part in the phase. The present method is fully systematic and involves several novel steps which reduce the travelling wave ODE system to a single nonlinear base ODE for which all polynomial solutions are found by symbolic computation. It is applicable more generally to other coupled nonlinear dispersive wave equations as well as to nonlinear ODE systems of generalized H\'enon-Heiles form.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Field Sigma Models and Yang-Baxter Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine the Yang-Baxter (YB) and bi-Yang-Baxter (bi-YB) deformations with higher-spin auxiliary field deformations to construct multi-parameter families of integrable deformations of the principal chiral model on a Lie group $G$ with semi-simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. In the YB case, our construction produces one integrable deformation for each pair $(\mathcal{R}, E)$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is an antisymmetric bilinear operator on $\mathfrak{g}$ obeying the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation and $E$ is a function of several variables. In the bi-YB case, the pair becomes a triplet $(\mathcal{R},\tilde{\mathcal{R}}, E)$, where $\tilde{\mathcal{R}}$ is another antisymmetric bilinear operator on $\mathfrak{g}$ and obeys the non-split inhomogeneous modified classical Yang-Baxter equation. We show that every model in these families is (weakly) classically integrable by exhibiting a Lax representation for their equations of motion.</description>
