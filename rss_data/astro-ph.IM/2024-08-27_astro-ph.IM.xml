      <title>Enhanced Astronomical Source Classification with Integration of Attention Mechanisms and Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate classification of celestial objects is essential for advancing our understanding of the universe. MargNet is a recently developed deep learning-based classifier applied to SDSS DR16 dataset to segregate stars, quasars, and compact galaxies using photometric data. MargNet utilizes a stacked architecture, combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image modelling and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for modelling photometric parameters. In this study, we propose enhancing MargNet's performance by incorporating attention mechanisms and Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models for processing image data. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features and capture intricate patterns within images, effectively distinguishing between different classes of celestial objects. Additionally, we leverage ViTs, a transformer-based deep learning architecture renowned for exceptional performance in image classification tasks. We enhance the model's understanding of complex astronomical images by utilizing ViT's ability to capture global dependencies and contextual information. Our approach uses a curated dataset comprising 240,000 compact and 150,000 faint objects. The models learn classification directly from the data, minimizing human intervention. Furthermore, we explore ViT as a hybrid architecture that uses photometric features and images together as input to predict astronomical objects. Our results demonstrate that the proposed attention mechanism augmented CNN in MargNet marginally outperforms the traditional MargNet and the proposed ViT-based MargNet models. Additionally, the ViT-based hybrid model emerges as the most lightweight and easy-to-train model with classification accuracy similar to that of the best-performing attention-enhanced MargNet.</description>

      <title>DIES: Parallel dust radiative transfer program with the immediate re-emission method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative transfer (RT) modelling is a necessary tool in the interpretation of observations of the thermal emission of interstellar dust. It is also often part of multi-physics modelling. In this context, the efficiency of radiative transfer calculations is important, even for one-dimensional models. We investigate the use of the so-called immediate re-emission (IRE) method for fast calculation of one-dimensional spherical cloud models. We wish to determine whether weighting methods similar to those used in traditional Monte Carlo simulations can speed up the estimation of dust temperature. We present the program DIES, a parallel implementation of the IRE method, which makes it possible to do the calculations also on graphics processing units (GPUs). We tested the program with externally and internally heated cloud models, and examined the potential improvements from the use of different weighted sampling schemes. The execution times of the program compare favourably with previous programs, especially when run on GPUs. On the other hand, weighting schemes produce only limited improvements. In the case of an internal radiation source, the basic IRE method samples the re-emission well, while traditional Monte Carlo requires the use of spatial importance sampling. Some noise reduction could be achieved for externally heated models by weighting the initial photon directions. Only in optically very thin models does weighting - such as the proposed method of forced first interaction - result in noise reduction by a factor of several. The IRE method performs well for both internally and externally heated models, typically without the need for any additional weighting schemes. With run times of the order of one second for our test models, the DIES program is suitable even for larger parameter studies.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Borde-Traub focal plane wavefront estimation technique for exoplanet direct imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct imaging of exoplanets relies on complex wavefront sensing and control architectures. In addition to fast adaptive optics systems, most of the future high-contrast imaging instruments will soon be equipped with focal plane wavefront sensing algorithms. These techniques use the science detector to estimate the static and quasi-static aberrations induced by optical manufacturing defects and system thermal variations. Pair-wise probing (PWP) has been the most widely used, especially for space-based application and will be tested at contrast levels of ~1e-9 on-sky along with the future coronagraph instrument onboarding the Roman Space Telescope. This algorithm leans on phase diversities applied on the deformable mirror that are recorded in pairs. A minimum of two pairs of probes are required per bandwidth. An additional unprobed image is also recorded to verify the convergence rate of the correction. Before PWP, Borde &amp; Traub proposed a similar algorithm that takes advantage of the unprobed image in the estimation process to get rid of the pair diversity requirement. In this work, we theoretically show that this latter technique should be more efficient than PWP when the convergence time is not limited by photon noise. We then present its performance and practical limitations on coronagraphic testbeds at JPL and exhibit a first on-sky control of non-common path aberrations with such method on VLT/SPHERE.</description>

      <title>Bayesian functional data analysis in astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic demographics -- the statistical study of populations of astrophysical objects -- has long relied on *multivariate statistics*, providing methods for analyzing data comprising fixed-length vectors of properties of objects, as might be compiled in a tabular astronomical catalog (say, with sky coordinates, and brightness measurements in a fixed number of spectral passbands). But beginning with the emergence of automated digital sky surveys, ca. ~2000, astronomers began producing large collections of data with more complex structure: light curves (brightness time series) and spectra (brightness vs. wavelength). These comprise what statisticians call *functional data* -- measurements of populations of functions. Upcoming automated sky surveys will soon provide astronomers with a flood of functional data. New methods are needed to accurately and optimally analyze large ensembles of light curves and spectra, accumulating information both along and across measured functions. Functional data analysis (FDA) provides tools for statistical modeling of functional data. Astronomical data presents several challenges for FDA methodology, e.g., sparse, irregular, and asynchronous sampling, and heteroscedastic measurement error. Bayesian FDA uses hierarchical Bayesian models for function populations, and is well suited to addressing these challenges. We provide an overview of astronomical functional data, and of some key Bayesian FDA modeling approaches, including functional mixed effects models, and stochastic process models. We briefly describe a Bayesian FDA framework combining FDA and machine learning methods to build low-dimensional parametric models for galaxy spectra.</description>

      <title>Earths within Reach: Evaluation of Strategies for Mitigating Solar Variability using 3.5 years of NEID Sun-as-a-Star Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of Sun-as-a-star observations by the NEID Solar Telescope at WIYN Observatory, spanning January 1, 2021 through June 30, 2024. We identify 117,060 observations which are unlikely to be significantly affected by weather, hardware or major calibration issues. We describe several high-level data products being made available to the community to aid in the interpretation and inter comparisons of NEID solar observations. Solar observations demonstrate excellent performance of NEID, including radial velocity (RV) accuracy and long-term stability of better than $\simeq 0.37$ m s$^{-1}$ over $\simeq 3.5$ years, even though NEID was not originally designed or optimized for daytime observations of the Sun. Currently, intrinsic stellar variability is the primary barrier to detecting Earth-analog planets for most nearby, Sun-like stars. We present a comparison of the effectiveness of several methods proposed to mitigate the effects of solar variability on the Sun's estimated RV. We find that the Scalpels algorithm performs particularly well and substantially reduces the RMS RV of solar spectra from over 2 m s$^{-1}$ to 0.277 m s$^{-1}$. Even when training on a subset of days with NEID solar observations and testing on a held-out sample, the RMS of cleaned RV is 0.34-0.42 m s$^{-1}$. This is significantly better than previous attempts at removing solar variability and suggests that the current generation of EPRV instruments are technically capable of detecting Earth-mass planets orbiting a solar twin if provided with sufficient observing time allocations ($\sim 10^3$ nights of observations).</description>

      <title>Advancing Gamma-Ray Burst Identification through Transfer Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rapid and accurate identification of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is crucial for unraveling their origins. However, current burst search algorithms frequently miss low-threshold signals or lack universality for observations. In this study, we propose a novel approach utilizing transfer learning experiment based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to establish a universal GRB identification method, which validated successfully using GECAM-B data. By employing data augmentation techniques, we enhance the diversity and quantity of the GRB sample. We develop a 1D CNN model with a multi-scale feature cross fusion module (MSCFM) to extract features from samples and perform classification. The comparative results demonstrated significant performance improvements following pre-training and transferring on a large-scale dataset. Our optimal model achieved an impressive accuracy of 96.41% on the source dataset of GECAM-B, and identified three previously undiscovered GRBs by contrast with manual analysis of GECAM-B observations. These innovative transfer learning and data augmentation methods presented in this work hold promise for applications in multi-satellite exploration scenarios characterized by limited data sets and a scarcity of labeled samples in high-energy astronomy.</description>

      <title>Capturing primordial non-Gaussian signatures in the late Universe by multi-scale extrema of the cosmic log-density field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct two new summary statistics, the scale-dependent peak height function (scale-PKHF) and the scale-dependent valley depth function (scale-VLYDF), and forecast their constraining power on PNG amplitudes $\{f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{local}, f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{equil},f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{ortho}\}$ and standard cosmological parameters based on ten thousands of density fields drawn from \textsc{Quijote} and \textsc{Quijote-PNG} simulations at $z=0$. With the Fisher analysis, we find that the scale-PKHF and scale-VLYDF are capable of capturing a wealth of primordial information about the Universe. Specifically, the constraint on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ obtained from the scale-VLYDF (scale-PKHF) is 12.4 (8.6) times tighter than that from the power spectrum, and 3.9 (2.7) times tighter than that from the bispectrum. The combination of the two statistics yields constraints on $\{f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{local}, f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{equil}\}$ similar to those from the bispectrum and power spectrum combination, but provides a 1.4-fold improvement in the constraint on $f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{ortho}$. After including the power spectrum, its constraining power well exceeds that of the bispectrum and power spectrum combination by factors of 1.1--2.9 for all parameters.</description>

      <title>Variations in the Inferred Cosmic-Ray Spectral Index as Measured by Neutron Monitors in Antarctica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A technique has recently been developed for tracking short-term spectral variations in Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) using data from a single neutron monitor (NM), by collecting histograms of the time delay between successive neutron counts and extracting the leader fraction $L$ as a proxy of the spectral index. Here we analyze $L$ from four Antarctic NMs during 2015 March to 2023 September. We have calibrated $L$ from the South Pole NM with respect to a daily spectral index determined from published data of GCR proton fluxes during 2015--2019 from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) aboard the International Space Station. Our results demonstrate a robust correlation between the leader fraction and the spectral index fit over the rigidity range 2.97--16.6 GV for AMS-02 data, with uncertainty 0.018 in the daily spectral index as inferred from $L$. In addition to the 11-year solar activity cycle, a wavelet analysis confirms a 27-day periodicity in the GCR flux and spectral index corresponding to solar rotation, especially near sunspot minimum, while the flux occasionally exhibited a strong harmonic at 13.5 days, and that the magnetic field component along a nominal Parker spiral (i.e., the magnetic sector structure) is a strong determinant of such spectral and flux variations, with the solar wind speed exerting an additional, nearly rigidity-independent influence on flux variations. Our investigation affirms the capability of ground-based NM stations to accurately and continuously monitor cosmic ray spectral variations in the long-term future.</description>

      <title>Simulating Gravitational Microlensing Events by TESS: Predictions on Statistics and Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistics and properties of microlensing events that can be detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite(TESS) based on Monte Carlo simulations. We simulate potential microlensing events from a sample of the TESS Candidate Target List(CTL) stars by assuming different observational time spans(or different numbers of sectors for each star) and a wide range of lens masses, i.e., $M_{\rm l}\in [0.1M_{\oplus},~2 M_{\odot}]$. On average, the microlensing optical depth and the event rate for CTL stars are $\simeq 0.2\times 10^{-9}$, and $\Gamma_{\rm{TESS}}\simeq0.6\times10^{-9}$ per star per day, respectively. The microlensing optical depth decreases by increasing the CTL priority, whereas the efficiency for detecting their microlensing signals enhances with the priority. Additionally, we simulate the microlensing events from the TESS Full-Frame Images(FFIs) stars extracted from the \texttt{TESS}-\texttt{SPOC} pipeline. The optical depth and event rate for these stars are on average $\simeq 1$-$3\times 10^{-9}$, and $\Gamma_{\rm{TESS}}\simeq 1$-$4\times 10^{-9}$ per star per day, and their highest values occur for sector $12$. The total number of microlensing events for the CTL stars is $N_{\rm e, \rm{tot}}\sim0.03$, whereas for the FFIs' stars number of events per star during $27.4$-day observing windows is $\hat{N}_{\rm e, \rm{tot}}\simeq1.4 \times 10^{-6}$. Based on four criteria we extract the detectable microlensing events and evaluate the detection efficiencies. The highest efficiency for detecting microlensing events from the TESS data occurs for the lens mass $\log_{10}[M_{\rm l}(M_{\odot})] \in [-4.5$,~$-2.5]$, i.e., super-Earth to Jupiter-mass Free Floating Planets(FFPs). The detectable microlensing events from the TESS stars are significantly affected by both finite-source and parallax effects.</description>

      <title>ALMA Memo 628 -- High-cadence observations of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) offers new diagnostic capabilities for studying the Sun, providing complementary insights through high spatial and temporal resolution at millimeter wavelengths. ALMA acts as a linear thermometer for atmospheric gas, aiding in understanding the solar atmosphere's structure, dynamics, and energy balance. Given the Sun's complex emission patterns and rapid evolution, high-cadence imaging is essential for solar observations. Snapshot imaging is required, though it limits available visibility data, making full exploitation of ALMA's capabilities non-trivial. Challenges in processing solar ALMA data highlight the need for revising and enhancing the solar observing mode. The ALMA development study High-Cadence Imaging of the Sun demonstrated the potential benefits of high cadence observations through a forward modelling approach. The resulting report provides initial recommendations for improved post-processing solar ALMA data and explores increasing the observing cadence to sub-second intervals to improve image reliability.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Searching for Close-in Companions around Young M Dwarfs using a Multi-year PSF Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Super-RDI, a unique framework for the application of reference star differential imaging (RDI) to Keck/NIRC2 high-contrast imaging observations with the vortex coronagraph. Super-RDI combines frame selection and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) optimization techniques with a large multi-year reference point spread function (PSF) library to achieve optimal PSF subtraction at small angular separations. We compile a $\sim$7000 frame reference PSF library based on a set of 288 new Keck/NIRC2 $L'$ sequences of 237 unique targets acquired between 2015 and 2019 as part of two planet-search programs, one focusing on nearby young M dwarfs and the other targeting members of the Taurus star-forming region. For our dataset, synthetic companion injection-recovery tests reveal that frame selection with the mean-squared error (MSE) metric combined with KLIP-based PSF subtraction using 1000-3000 frames and $&lt;$500 principal components yields the highest average S/N for injected synthetic companions. We uniformly reduce targets in the young M-star survey with both Super-RDI and angular differential imaging (ADI). For the typical parallactic angle rotation of our dataset ($\sim$10$^\circ$), Super-RDI performs better than a widely used implementation of ADI at separations $\lesssim$0.4" ($\approx$5 $\lambda$/$D$) gaining an average of 0.25 mag in contrast at 0.25" and 0.4 mag in contrast at 0.15". This represents a performance improvement in separation space over RDI with single-night reference star observations ($\sim$100 frame PSF libraries) applied to a similar Keck/NIRC2 dataset in previous work. We recover two known brown dwarf companions and provide detection limits for 155 targets in the young M-star survey. Our results demonstrate that increasing the PSF library size with careful selection of reference frames can improve the performance of RDI with the Keck/NIRC2 vortex coronagraph in $L'$.</description>

Our work focuses on the nature of the narrow Fe K$_{\alpha}$ emission line at 6.4 keV, the strongest and most common X-ray line observed in AGN. The total line is found to consist of three components. Even the narrowest component of the line is resolved with evident Fe K$_{\alpha,1}$ (6.404 keV) and K$_{\alpha,2}$ (6.391 keV) contributions in a 2:1 flux ratio, fully consistent with neutral gas with negligible bulk velocity. Subject to the limitations of our models, the narrowest and intermediate-width components are consistent with emission from optically thin gas, suggesting that they arise in a disk atmosphere and/or wind. Modeling the three line components in terms of Keplerian broadening, they are readily associated with (1) the inner wall of the ``torus,'' (2) the innermost optical ``broad line region'' (or, ``X-ray BLR''), and (3) a region with a radius of $r\simeq 100~GM/c^{2}$ that may signal a warp in the accretion disk. Viable alternative explanations of the broadest component include a fast wind component and/or scattering; however, we find evidence of variability in the narrow Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line complex on time scales consistent with small radii. The best-fit models are statistically superior to simple Voigt functions, but when fit with Voigt profiles the time-averaged lines are consistent with a projected velocity broadening of FWHM$=1600^{+400}_{-200}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$. Overall, the resolution and sensitivity of XRISM show that the narrow Fe K line in AGN is an effective probe of all key parts of the accretion flow, as it is currently understood. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of AGN accretion, future studies with XRISM, and X-ray-based black hole mass measurements.</description>

      <title>Radiance Cascades: A Novel High-Resolution Formal Solution for Multidimensional Non-LTE Radiative Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-LTE radiative transfer is a key tool for modern astrophysics: it is the means by which many key synthetic observables are produced, thus connecting simulations and observations. Radiative transfer models also inform our understanding of the primary formation layers and parameters of different spectral lines, and serve as the basis of inversion tools used to infer the structure of the solar atmosphere from observations. The default approach for computing the radiation field in multidimensional solar radiative transfer models has long remained the same: a short characteristics, discrete ordinates method, formal solver. In situations with complex atmospheric structure and multiple transitions between optically-thick and -thin regimes these solvers require prohibitively high angular resolution to correctly resolve the radiation field. Here, we present the theory of radiance cascades, a technique designed to exploit structure inherent to the radiation field, allowing for efficient reuse of calculated samples, thus providing a very high-resolution result at a fraction of the computational cost of existing methods. We additionally describe our implementation of this method in the DexRT code, and present initial results of the synthesis of a snapshot of a magnetohydrodynamic model of a solar prominence formed via levitation-condensation. The approach presented here provides a credible route for routinely performing multidimensional radiative transfer calculations free from so-called ray effects, and scaling high-quality non-LTE models to next-generation high-performance computing systems with GPU accelerators.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 118 New Ultracool Dwarf Candidates Using Machine Learning Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 118 new ultracool dwarf candidates, discovered using a new machine learning tool, named \texttt{SMDET}, applied to time series images from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We gathered photometric and astrometric data to estimate each candidate's spectral type, distance, and tangential velocity. This sample has a photometrically estimated spectral class distribution of 28 M dwarfs, 64 L dwarfs, and 18 T dwarfs. We also identify a T subdwarf candidate, two extreme T subdwarf candidates, and two candidate young ultracool dwarfs. Five objects did not have enough photometric data for any estimations to be made. To validate our estimated spectral types, spectra were collected for 2 objects, yielding confirmed spectral types of T5 (estimated T5) and T3 (estimated T4). Demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning tools as a new large-scale discovery technique.</description>

      <title>Machine-directed gravitational-wave counterpart discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint observations in electromagnetic and gravitational waves shed light on the physics of objects and surrounding environments with extreme gravity that are otherwise unreachable via siloed observations in each messenger. However, such detections remain challenging due to the rapid and faint nature of counterparts. Protocols for discovery and inference still rely on human experts manually inspecting survey alert streams and intuiting optimal usage of limited follow-up resources. Strategizing an optimal follow-up program requires adaptive sequential decision-making given evolving light curve data that (i) maximizes a global objective despite incomplete information and (ii) is robust to stochasticity introduced by detectors/observing conditions. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches allow agents to implicitly learn the physics/detector dynamics and the behavior policy that maximize a designated objective through experience. To demonstrate the utility of such an approach for the kilonova follow-up problem, we train a toy RL agent for the goal of maximizing follow-up photometry for the true kilonova among several contaminant transient light curves. In a simulated environment where the agent learns online, it achieves 3x higher accuracy compared to a random strategy. However, it is surpassed by human agents by up to a factor of 2. This is likely because our hypothesis function (Q that is linear in state-action features) is an insufficient representation of the optimal behavior policy. More complex agents could perform at par or surpass human experts. Agents like these could pave the way for machine-directed software infrastructure to efficiently respond to next generation detectors, for conducting science inference and optimally planning expensive follow-up observations, scalably and with demonstrable performance guarantees.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Image Reconstruction using Closure Invariants and Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interferometric closure invariants encode calibration-independent details of an object's morphology. Excepting simple cases, a direct backward transformation from closure invariants to morphologies is not well established. We demonstrate using simple Machine Learning models that closure invariants can aid in morphological classification and parameter estimation. We consider six phenomenologically parametrised morphologies: point-like, uniform circular disc, crescent, dual disc, crescent with elliptical accretion disc, and crescent with double jet lobes. Using logistic regression (LR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and random forest models on closure invariants obtained from a sparsely covered aperture, we find that all methods except LR can classify morphologies with $\gtrsim$80% accuracy, which improves with greater aperture coverage. Separately from the classification problem, given an independently confirmed class, we estimate parameters of uniform circular disc, crescent, and dual disc morphologies using simple MLP models, and parametrically reconstruct images. The estimated parameters and images correspond well with inputs, but the accuracy worsens when degeneracies between parameters are present. This independent approach to interferometric imaging under challenging observing conditions such as that faced by the Event Horizon Telescope and Very Long Baseline Interferometry in general can complement other methods in robustly constraining an object's morphology.</description>

      <title>DECam Multi-Messenger Astrophysics Pipeline. I. from Raw Data to Single-Exposure Candidates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a pipeline that performs rapid image subtraction and source selection to detect transients, with a focus on identifying gravitational wave optical counterparts using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). In this work, we present the pipeline steps from processing raw data to identification of astrophysical transients on individual exposures. We process DECam data and build difference images using the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Science Pipelines software, and we use flags and principal component analysis to select transients on a per-exposure basis, without associating the results from different exposures. Those candidates will be sent to brokers for further classification and alert distribution. We validate our pipeline using archival exposures that cover various types of objects, and the tested targets include a kilonova (GW170817), supernovae, stellar flares, variable stars (in a resolved galaxy or the Milky Way Bulge), and serendipitous objects. Overall, the data processing produces clean light curves that are comparable with published results, demonstrating the photometric quality of our pipeline. Real transients can be well selected by our pipeline when sufficiently bright (S/N $\gtrsim15$). This pipeline is intended to serve as a tool for the broader research community. Although this pipeline is designed for DECam, our method can be easily applied to other instruments and future LSST observations.</description>

      <title>Solar Active Regions Detection Via 2D Circular Kernel Time Series Transformation, Entropy and Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes an enhancement to the existing method for detecting Solar Active Regions (ARs). Our technique tracks ARs using images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). It involves a 2D circular kernel time series transformation, combined with Statistical and Entropy measures, and a Machine Learning (ML) approach. The technique transforms the circular area around pixels in the SDO AIA images into one-dimensional time series (1-DTS). Statistical measures (Median Value, Xmed; 95th Percentile, X95) and Entropy measures (Distribution Entropy, DisEn; Fuzzy Entropy, FuzzyEn) are used as feature selection methods (FSM 1), alongside a method applying 1-DTS elements directly as features (FSM 2). The ML algorithm classifies these series into three categories: no Active Region (nARs type 1, class 1), non-flaring Regions outside active regions with brightness (nARs type 2, class 2), and flaring Active Regions (ARs, class 3). The ML model achieves a classification accuracy of 0.900 and 0.914 for Entropy and Statistical measures, respectively. Notably, Fuzzy Entropy shows the highest classification accuracy (AKF=0.895), surpassing DisEn (AKF=0.738), X95 (AKF=0.873), and Xmed (AKF=0.840). This indicates the high effectiveness of Entropy and Statistical measures for AR detection in SDO AIA images. FSM 2 captures a similar distribution of flaring AR activities as FSM 1. Additionally, we introduce a generalizing characteristic of AR activities (GSA), finding a direct agreement between increased AR activities and higher GSA values. The Python code implementation of the proposed method is available in supplementary material.</description>

      <title>The Quasar Catalogue for S-PLUS DR4 (QuCatS) and the estimation of photometric redshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of massive broad-band photometric surveys enabled photometric redshift estimates for unprecedented numbers of galaxies and quasars. These estimates can be improved using better algorithms or by obtaining complementary data such as narrow-band photometry, and broad-band photometry over an extended wavelength range. We investigate the impact of both approaches on photometric redshifts for quasars using data from Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) DR4, Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) DR6/7, and the unWISE catalog for the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) in three machine learning methods: Random Forest, Flexible Conditional Density Estimation (FlexCoDE), and Bayesian Mixture Density Network (BMDN). Including narrow-band photometry improves the root-mean-square error by 11% in comparison to a model trained with only broad-band photometry. Narrow-band information only provided an improvement of 3.8% when GALEX and WISE colours were included. Thus narrow bands play a more important role for objects that do not have GALEX or WISE counterparts, which respectively makes 92% and 25% of S-PLUS data considered here. Nevertheless, the inclusion of narrow-band information provided better estimates of the probability density functions obtained with FlexCoDE and BMDN. We publicly release a value-added catalogue of photometrically selected quasars with the photo-z predictions from all methods studied here. The catalogue provided with this work covers the S-PLUS DR4 area (~3000deg$^2$), containing 645 980, 244 912, 144 991 sources with the probability of being a quasar higher than, 80%, 90%, 95% up to r &lt; 21.3 and good photometry quality in the detection image. More quasar candidates can be retrieved from the S-PLUS data base by considering less restrictive selection criteria.</description>

      <title>The Detection of KIC 1718360, A Rotating Variable with a Possible Companion, Using Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the detection of a periodic dimming event in the lightcurve of the G1.5IV-V type star KIC 1718360. This is based on visible-light observations conducted by both the TESS and Kepler space telescopes. Analysis of the data seems to point toward a high rotation rate in the star, with a rotational period of 2.938 days. The high variability seen within the star's lightcurve points toward classification as a rotating variable. The initial observation was made in Kepler Quarter 16 data using the One-Class SVM machine learning method. Subsequent observations by the TESS space telescope corroborated these findings. It appears that KIC 1718360 is a nearby rotating variable that appears in little to no major catalogs as such. A secondary, additional periodic dip is also present, indicating a possible exoplanetary companion.</description>

      <title>A New Monte-Carlo Model for the Space Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Monte Carlo (MC) method to simulate the evolution of the low-earth orbit environment, enhancing the MIT Orbital Capacity Analysis Tool (MOCAT). In recent decades, numerous space environment models have been developed by government agencies and research groups to understand and predict the dynamics of space debris. Our MC approach advances this by simulating the trajectories of space objects and modeling their interactions, such as collisions and explosions. This aids in analyzing the trends of space-object and debris populations. A key innovation of our method is the computational efficiency in orbit propagation, which is crucial for handling potentially large numbers of objects over centuries. We present validation results against the IADC (Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee) study and explore various scenarios, including ones without future launches and those involving the launch of proposed megaconstellations with over 80,000 active payloads. With the improvement in computational efficiencies provided by this work, we can run these new scenarios that predict millions of trackable objects over a 200-year period. The previous state-of-the-art was 400,000 objects over the same period of time. Notably, while fewer megaconstellations are planned for altitudes above 800 km, even minimal failures in post-mission disposal or collision avoidance maneuvers can significantly impact orbital debris accumulation.</description>
