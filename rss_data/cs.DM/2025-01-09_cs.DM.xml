      <title>Multivariate Exploration of Metric Dilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a weighted graph embedded in a metric space $(M, d_M )$. The vertices of $G$ correspond to the points in $M$ , with the weight of each edge $uv$ being the distance $d_M (u, v)$ between their respective points in $M$ . The dilation (or stretch) of $G$ is defined as the minimum factor $t$ such that, for any pair of vertices $u, v$, the distance between $u$ and $v$-represented by the weight of a shortest $u$, $v$-path is at most $ t \cdot d_M (u, v)$. We study Dilation t-Augmentation, where the objective is, given a metric $M $, a graph $G$, and numerical values $k$ and $t$, to determine whether $G$ can be transformed into a graph with dilation $t$ by adding at most $k$ edges.
  Our primary focus is on the scenario where the metric $M$ is the shortest path metric of an unweighted graph $\Gamma$. Even in this specific case, Dilation $t$-Augmentation remains computationally challenging. In particular, the problem is W[2]-hard parameterized by $k$ when $\Gamma$ is a complete graph, already for $t=2$. Our main contribution lies in providing new insights into the impact of combinations of various parameters on the computational complexity of the problem. We establish the following.
  -- The parameterized dichotomy of the problem with respect to dilation $t$, when the graph $G$ is sparse: Parameterized by $k$, the problem is FPT for graphs excluding a biclique $K_{d,d}$ as a subgraph for $t\leq 2$ and the problem is W[1]-hard for $t\geq 3$ even if $G$ is a forest consisting of disjoint stars.
  -- The problem is FPT parameterized by the combined parameter $k+t+\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph $G$ or $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trading of a Charging-Station Company in Auction Markets for Electricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a charging-station company (Chargco) for electric and hydrogen vehicles. The optimal trading of the Chargco in day-ahead and intraday auction markets for electricity is modeled as a stochastic Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP). We propose a series of linearization and reformulation techniques to reformulate the stochastic MIQP as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To model stochasticity, we utilize generative adversarial networks to cluster electricity market price scenarios. Additionally, a combination of random forests and linear regression is employed to model the relationship between Chargco electricity and hydrogen loads and their selling prices. Finally, we propose an Improved L-Shaped Decomposition (ILSD) algorithm to solve our stochastic MILP. Our ILSD algorithm not only addresses infeasibilities through an innovative approach but also incorporates warm starts, valid inequalities and multiple generation cuts, thereby reducing computational complexity. Numerical experiments illustrate the Chargco trading using our proposed stochastic MILP and its solution algorithm.</description>

      <title>Graph classes through the lens of logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph transformations definable in logic can be described using the notion of transductions. By understanding transductions as a basic embedding mechanism, which captures the possibility of encoding one graph in another graph by means of logical formulas, we obtain a new perspective on the landscape of graph classes and of their properties. The aim of this survey is to give a comprehensive presentation of this angle on structural graph theory.
  We first give a logic-focused overview of classic graph-theoretic concepts, such as treedepth, shrubdepth, treewidth, cliquewidth, twin-width, bounded expansion, and nowhere denseness. Then, we present recent developments related to notions defined purely through transductions, such as monadic stability, monadic dependence, and classes of structurally sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>Composable Constraint Models for Permutation Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a powerful tool for modeling mathematical concepts and objects and finding both solutions or counter examples. One of the major strengths of CP is that problems can easily be combined or expanded. In this paper, we illustrate that this versatility makes CP an ideal tool for exploring problems in permutation patterns.
  We declaratively define permutation properties, permutation pattern avoidance and containment constraints using CP and show how this allows us to solve a wide range of problems. We show how this approach enables the arbitrary composition of these conditions, and also allows the easy addition of extra conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques by modelling the containment and avoidance of six permutation patterns, eight permutation properties and measuring five statistics on the resulting permutations. In addition to calculating properties and statistics for the generated permutations, we show that arbitrary additional constraints can also be easily and efficiently added.
  This approach enables mathematicians to investigate permutation pattern problems in a quick and efficient manner. We demonstrate the utility of constraint programming for permutation patterns by showing how we can easily and efficiently extend the known permutation counts for a conjecture involving the class of $1324$ avoiding permutations. For this problem, we expand the enumeration of $1324$-avoiding permutations with a fixed number of inversions to permutations of length 16 and show for the first time that in the enumeration there is a pattern occurring which follows a unique sequence on the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.</description>

      <title>Moving a Derivation Along a Derivation Preserves the Spine in Adhesive Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13510v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between two elementary operations on derivations in the framework of graph transformation based on adhesive categories: moving a derivation along a derivation based on parallel and sequential independence on one hand and restriction of a derivation with respect to a monomorphism into the start object on the other hand. Intuitively, a restriction clips off parts of the start object that are never matched by a rule application throughout the derivation on the other hand. As main result, it is shown that moving a derivation preserves its spine being the minimal restriction.</description>

      <title>Covering a Graph with Minimal Local Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local sets, a graph structure invariant under local complementation, have been originally introduced in the context of quantum computing for the study of quantum entanglement within the so-called graph state formalism. A local set in a graph is made of a non-empty set of vertices together with its odd neighborhood. We show that any graph can be covered by minimal local sets, i.e. that every vertex is contained in at least one local set that is minimal by inclusion. More precisely, we introduce an algorithm for finding a minimal local set cover in polynomial time. This result is proved by exploring the link between local sets and cut-rank. We prove some additional results on minimal local sets: we give tight bounds on their size, and we show that there can be exponentially many of them in a graph. Finally, we provide an extension of our definitions and our main result to $q$-multigraphs, the graphical counterpart of quantum qudit graph states.</description>

      <title>Hardness of circuit and monotone diameters of polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Circuit diameter of polytopes was introduced by Borgwardt, Finhold and Hemmecke as a fundamental tool for the study of circuit augmentation schemes for linear programming and for estimating combinatorial diameters. Determining the complexity of computing the circuit diameter of polytopes was posed as an open problem by Sanit\`a as well as by Kafer, and was recently reiterated by Borgwardt, Grewe, Kafer, Lee and Sanit\`a.
  In this paper, we solve this problem by showing that computing the circuit diameter of a polytope given in halfspace-description is strongly NP-hard. To prove this result, we show that computing the combinatorial diameter of the perfect matching polytope of a bipartite graph is NP-hard. This complements a result by Sanit\`a (FOCS 2018) on the NP-hardness of computing the diameter of fractional matching polytopes and implies the new result that computing the diameter of a $\{0,1\}$-polytope is strongly NP-hard, which may be of independent interest. In our second main result, we give a precise graph-theoretic description of the monotone diameter of perfect matching polytopes and use this description to prove that computing the monotone (circuit) diameter of a given input polytope is strongly NP-hard as well.</description>

      <title>Local equivalence of stabilizer states: a graphical characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stabilizer states form a ubiquitous family of quantum states that can be graphically represented through the graph state formalism. A fundamental property of graph states is that applying a local complementation - a well-known and extensively studied graph transformation - results in a graph that represents the same entanglement as the original. In other words, the corresponding graph states are LU-equivalent. This property served as the cornerstone for capturing non-trivial quantum properties in a simple graphical manner, in the study of quantum entanglement but also for developing protocols and models based on graph states and stabilizer states, such as measurement-based quantum computing, secret sharing, error correction, entanglement distribution... However, local complementation fails short to fully characterise entanglement: there exist pairs of graph states that are LU-equivalent but cannot be transformed one into the other using local complementations. Only few is known about the equivalence of graph states beyond local complementation. We introduce a generalisation of local complementation which graphically characterises the LU-equivalence of graph states. We use this characterisation to show the existence of a strict infinite hierarchy of equivalences of graph states. Our approach is based on minimal local sets, which are subsets of vertices that are known to cover any graph, and to be invariant under local complementation and even LU-equivalence. We use these structures to provide a type to each vertex of a graph, leading to a natural standard form in which the LU-equivalence can be exhibited and captured by means of generalised local complementation.</description>
