      <title>Intercellular contact is sufficient to drive Fibroblast to Myofibroblast transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibroblast cells play a key role in maintaining the extracellular matrix. During wound healing, fibroblasts differentiate into highly contractile myofibroblasts, which secrete extracellular matrix proteins like collagen to facilitate tissue repair. Under normal conditions, myofibroblasts undergo programmed cell death after healing to prevent excessive scar formation. However, in diseases like fibrosis, the myofibroblasts remain active even after the wound is closed, resulting in excessive collagen buildup and a stiff, fibrotic matrix. The reasons for the persistence of myofibroblasts in fibrosis are not well understood. Here we show the existence of a mechanism where direct physical contact between a fibroblast and a myofibroblast is sufficient for fibroblasts to transition into myofibroblasts. We show that fibroblast-myofibroblast transition can occur even in the absence of known biochemical cues such as growth factor activation or mechanical cues from a stiff, fibrotic matrix. Further, we show that contact-based fibroblast-myofibroblast activation can be blocked by G{\alpha}q/11/14 inhibitor FR9003591, which inhibits the formation of myofibroblasts. These findings offer new insights into the persistence of fibrosis despite therapeutic interventions and suggest a potential strategy to target fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition in fibrosis.</description>

      <title>Insights into new mechanosensitive behaviors of G protein-coupled receptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a diverse and vital family of membrane proteins that mediate intracellular signaling in response to extracellular stimuli, playing critical roles in physiology and disease. Traditionally recognized as chemical signal transducers, GPCRs have recently been implicated in mechanotransduction, the process of converting mechanical stimuli into cellular responses. This review explores the emerging role of GPCRs in sensing and responding to mechanical forces, with a particular focus on the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular homeostasis is heavily influenced by mechanical forces such as shear stress, cyclic stretch, and pressure, which are central to both normal physiology and the pathogenesis of diseases like hypertension and atherosclerosis. GPCRs, including the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and the $\beta$2-adrenergic receptor ($\beta$2-AR), have demonstrated the ability to integrate mechanical and chemical signals, potentially through conformational changes and/or modulation of lipid interactions, leading to biased signaling. Recent studies highlight the dual activation mechanisms of GPCRs, with $\beta$2-AR now serving as a key example of how mechanical and ligand-dependent pathways contribute to cardiovascular regulation. This review synthesizes current knowledge of GPCR mechanosensitivity, emphasizing its implications for cardiovascular health and disease, and explores advancements in methodologies poised to further unravel the mechanistic intricacies of these receptors.</description>

      <title>Global Constraint Principle for Microbial Growth Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monod's law is a widely accepted phenomenology for bacterial growth. Since it has the same functional form as the Michaelis--Menten equation for enzyme kinetics, cell growth is often considered to be locally constrained by a single reaction. In contrast, this paper shows that a global constraint principle of resource allocation to metabolic processes can well describe the nature of cell growth. This concept is a generalization of Liebig's law, a growth law for higher organisms, and explains the dependence of microbial growth on the availability of multiple nutrients, in contrast to Monod's law.</description>
