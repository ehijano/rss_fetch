      <title>Beta-Generalized Lindley Distribution: A Novel Probability Model for Wind Speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind speed distribution has many applications, such as the assessment of wind energy and building design. Applying an appropriate statistical distribution to fit the wind speed data, especially on its heavy right tail, is of great interest. In this study, we introduce a novel four-parameter class of generalized Lindley distribution, called the beta-generalized Lindley (BGL) distribution, to fit the wind speed data, which are derived from the annual and long-term measurements of the Flatirons M2 meteorological tower from the years 2010 to 2020 at heights of 10, 20, 50, and 80 meters. In terms of the density fit and various goodness-of-fit metrics, the BGL model outperforms its submodels (beta-Lindley, generalized Lindley, and Lindley) and other reference distributions, such as gamma, beta-Weibull, Weibull, beta-exponential, and Log-Normal. Furthermore, the BGL distribution is more accurate at modeling the long right tail of wind speed, including the $95^{th}$ and $99^{th}$ percentiles and Anderson-Darling statistics at different heights. Therefore, we conclude that the BGL distribution is a strong alternative model for the wind speed distribution.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Geometric Brownian Motion: An Extension with Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This analysis derives the maximum likelihood estimator and applies Bayesian inference to model geometric Brownian motion, incorporating jump diffusion to account for sudden market shifts. The Bayesian approach is implemented using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations on S\&amp;P 500 stock data from 2009 to 2014, providing a robust framework for analyzing stock dynamics and forecasting future trends. Exact solutions are obtained for both the standard Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model and the GBM model with Poisson jumps. Although both models yield reasonable results and fit the data well, the GBM with Poisson jumps exhibits superior performance, significantly enhancing model fit and capturing more complex market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Using Causal Inference to Explore Government Policy Impact on Computer Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the causal relationship between COVID-19 lockdown policies and changes in personal computer usage. In particular, we examine how lockdown policies affected average daily computer usage, as well as how it affected usage patterns of different groups of users. This is done through a merging of the Oxford Policy public data set, which describes the timeline of implementation of COVID policies across the world, and a collection of Intel's Data Collection and Analytics (DCA) telemetry data, which includes millions of computer usage records and updates daily. Through difference-in-difference, synthetic control, and change-point detection algorithms, we identify causal links between the increase in intensity (watts) and time (hours) of computer usage and the implementation of work from home policy. We also show an interesting trend in the individual's computer usage affected by the policy. We also conclude that computer usage behaviors are much less predictable during reduction in COVID lockdown policies than during increases in COVID lockdown policies.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Sleep Dysregulation in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome with and without Fibromyalgia Through Bayesian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Fibromyalgia (FM) often co-occur as medically unexplained conditions linked to disrupted physiological regulation, including altered sleep. Building on the work of Kishi et al. (2011), who identified differences in sleep-stage transitions in CFS and CFS+FM females, we exploited the same strictly controlled clinical cohort using a Bayesian Network (BN) to quantify detailed patterns of sleep and its dynamics. Our BN confirmed that sleep transitions are best described as a second-order process (Yetton et al., 2018), achieving a next-stage predictive accuracy of 70.6%, validated on two independent data sets with domain shifts (60.1-69.8% accuracy). Notably, we demonstrated that sleep dynamics can reveal the actual diagnoses. Our BN successfully differentiated healthy, CFS, and CFS+FM individuals, achieving an AUROC of 75.4%. Using interventions, we quantified sleep alterations attributable specifically to CFS and CFS+FM, identifying changes in stage prevalence, durations, and first- and second-order transitions. These findings reveal novel markers for CFS and CFS+FM in early-to-mid-adulthood females, offering insights into their physiological mechanisms and supporting their clinical differentiation.</description>

      <title>Estimating relapse time distribution from longitudinal biomarker trajectories using iterative regression and continuous time Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomarker measurements obtained by blood sampling are often used as a non-invasive means of monitoring tumour progression in cancer patients. Diseases evolve dynamically over time, and studying longitudinal observations of specific biomarkers can help to understand patients response to treatment and predict disease progression. We propose a novel iterative regression-based method to estimate changes in patients status within a cohort that includes censored patients, and illustrate it on clinical data from myeloma cases. We formulate the relapse time estimation problem in the framework of Piecewise Deterministic Markov processes (PDMP), where the Euclidean component is a surrogate biomarker for patient state. This approach enables continuous-time estimation of the status-change dates, which in turn allows for accurate inference of the relapse time distribution. A key challenge lies in the partial observability of the process, a complexity that has been rarely addressed in previous studies. . We evaluate the performance of our procedure through a simulation study and compare it with different approaches. This work is a proof of concept on biomarker trajectories with simple behaviour, but our method can easily be extended to more complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized network autoregressive modelling of longitudinal networks with application to presidential elections in the USA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Longitudinal networks are becoming increasingly relevant in the study of dynamic processes characterised by known or inferred community structure. Generalised Network Autoregressive (GNAR) models provide a parsimonious framework for exploiting the underlying network and multivariate time series. We introduce the community-$\alpha$ GNAR model with interactions that exploits prior knowledge or exogenous variables for analysing interactions within and between communities, and can describe serial correlation in longitudinal networks. We derive new explicit finite-sample error bounds that validate analysing high-dimensional longitudinal network data with GNAR models, and provide insights into their attractive properties. We further illustrate our approach by analysing the dynamics of $\textit{Red, Blue}$ and $\textit{Swing}$ states throughout presidential elections in the USA from 1976 to 2020, that is, a time series of length twelve on 51 time series (US states and Washington DC). Our analysis connects network autocorrelation to eight-year long terms, highlights a possible change in the system after the 2016 election, and a difference in behaviour between $\textit{Red}$ and $\textit{Blue}$ states.</description>

      <title>On the Proportional Principal Stratum Hazards Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In clinical trials involving both mortality and morbidity, an active treatment can influence the observed risk of the first non-fatal event either directly, through its effect on the non-fatal event process, or indirectly, through its effect on the death process, or both. Discerning the direct effect of treatment on the first non-fatal event holds clinical interest. However, with the competing risk of death, the Cox proportional hazards model that treats death as non-informative censoring and evaluates treatment effects on time to the first non-fatal event provides an estimate of the cause-specific hazard ratio, which may not correspond to the direct effect. To obtain the direct effect on the first non-fatal event, within the principal stratification framework, we define the principal stratum hazard and introduce the Proportional Principal Stratum Hazards model. This model estimates the principal stratum hazard ratio, which reflects the direct effect on the first non-fatal event in the presence of death and simplifies to the hazard ratio in the absence of death. The principal stratum membership is identified using the shared frailty model, which assumes independence between the first non-fatal event process and the potential death process from the counterfactual arm, conditional on per-subject random frailty. Simulation studies are conducted to verify the reliability of our estimators. We illustrate the method using the Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival trial which involves heart-failure events.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Between U.S. Presidential Elections: How Should We Learn From A 2020 Ad Campaign To Inform 2024 Ad Campaigns?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the 2024 U.S. presidential election, would negative, digital ads against Donald Trump impact voter turnout in Pennsylvania (PA), a key "tipping point'' state? The gold standard to address this question, a randomized experiment where voters get randomized to different ads, yields unbiased estimates of the ad effect, but is very expensive. Instead, we propose a less-than-ideal, but significantly cheaper and faster framework based on transfer learning, where we transfer knowledge from a past ad experiment in 2020 to evaluate ads for 2024. A key component of our framework is a sensitivity analysis that quantifies the unobservable differences between 2020 and 2024 elections, where sensitivity parameters can be calibrated in a data-driven manner. We propose two estimators of the 2024 ad effect: a simple regression estimator with bootstrap, which we recommend for practitioners in this field, and an estimator based on the efficient influence function for broader applications. Using our framework, we estimate the effect of running a negative, digital ad campaign against Trump on voter turnout in PA for the 2024 election. Our findings indicate effect heterogeneity across counties of PA and among important subgroups stratified by gender, urbanicity, and education attainment.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of restricted mean survival time adjusted for covariates using pseudo-observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The difference in restricted mean survival time (RMST) is a clinically meaningful measure to quantify treatment effect in randomized controlled trials, especially when the proportional hazards assumption does not hold. Several frequentist methods exist to estimate RMST adjusted for covariates based on modeling and integrating the survival function. A more natural approach may be a regression model on RMST using pseudo-observations, which allows for a direct estimation without modeling the survival function. Only a few Bayesian methods exist, and each requires a model of the survival function. We developed a new Bayesian method that combines the use of pseudo-observations with the generalized method of moments. This offers RMST estimation adjusted for covariates without the need to model the survival function, making it more attractive than existing Bayesian methods. A simulation study was conducted with different time-dependent treatment effects (early, delayed, and crossing survival) and covariate effects, showing that our approach provides valid results, aligns with existing methods, and shows improved precision after covariate adjustment. For illustration, we applied our approach to a phase III trial in prostate cancer, providing estimates of the treatment effect on RMST, comparable to existing methods. In addition, our approach provided the effect of other covariates on RMST and determined the posterior probability of the difference in RMST exceeds any given time threshold for any covariate, allowing for nuanced and interpretable results.</description>

      <title>Similarity-based Random Partition Distribution for Clustering Functional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01704v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random partition distribution is a crucial tool for model-based clustering. This study advances the field of random partition in the context of functional spatial data, focusing on the challenges posed by hourly population data across various regions and dates. We propose an extension of the generalized Dirichlet process, named the similarity-based generalized Dirichlet process (SGDP)-type distribution, to address the limitations of simple random partition distributions (e.g., those induced by the Dirichlet process), such as an overabundance of clusters. This model prevents excess cluster production and incorporates pairwise similarity information to ensure accurate and meaningful clustering. The theoretical properties of the SGDP-type distribution are studied. Then, SGDP-type random partition is applied to a real-world dataset of hourly population flow in $500\text{m}^2$ meshes in the central part of Tokyo. In this empirical context, our method excels at detecting meaningful patterns in the data while accounting for spatial nuances. The results underscore the adaptability and utility of the method, showcasing its prowess in revealing intricate spatiotemporal dynamics. The proposed random partition will significantly contribute to urban planning, transportation, and policy-making and will be a helpful tool for understanding population dynamics and their implications.</description>

      <title>Tackling water table depth modeling via machine learning: From proxy observations to verifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial patterns of water table depth (WTD) play a crucial role in shaping ecological resilience, hydrological connectivity, and human-centric systems. Generally, a large-scale (e.g., continental or global) continuous map of static WTD can be simulated using either physically-based (PB) or machine learning-based (ML) models. We construct three fine-resolution (500 m) ML simulations of WTD, using the XGBoost algorithm and more than 20 million real and proxy observations of WTD, across the United States and Canada. The three ML models were constrained using known physical relations between WTD's drivers and WTD and were trained by sequentially adding real and proxy observations of WTD. Through an extensive (pixel-by-pixel) evaluation across the study region and within ten major ecoregions of North America, we demonstrate that our models (corr=0.6-0.75) can more accurately predict unseen real and proxy observations of WTD compared to two available PB simulations of WTD (corr=0.21-0.40). However, we still argue that currently-available large-scale simulations of static WTD could be uncertain within data-scarce regions such as steep mountainous regions. We reason that biased observational data mainly collected from low-elevation floodplains and the over-flexibility of available models can negatively affect the verifiability of large-scale simulations of WTD. Ultimately, we thoroughly discuss future directions that may help hydrogeologists decide how to improve machine learning-based WTD estimations. In particular, we advocate for the use of proxy satellite data, the incorporation of physical laws, the implementation of better model verification standards, the development of novel globally-available emergent indices, and the collection of more reliable observations.</description>

      <title>Conditional diffusions for amortized neural posterior estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based computational approach for Bayesian inference, has shown great success in approximating complex posterior distributions. Existing NPE methods typically rely on normalizing flows, which approximate a distribution by composing many simple, invertible transformations. But flow-based models, while state of the art for NPE, are known to suffer from several limitations, including training instability and sharp trade-offs between representational power and computational cost. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of conditional diffusions coupled with high-capacity summary networks for amortized NPE. Conditional diffusions address many of the challenges faced by flow-based methods. Our results show that, across a highly varied suite of benchmarking problems for NPE architectures, diffusions offer improved stability, superior accuracy, and faster training times, even with simpler, shallower models. Building on prior work on diffusions for NPE, we show that these gains persist across a variety of different summary network architectures.
