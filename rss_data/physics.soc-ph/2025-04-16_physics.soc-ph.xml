      <title>Advancing the Economic and Environmental Sustainability of Rare Earth Element Recovery from Phosphogypsum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitioning to green energy technologies requires more sustainable and secure rare earth elements (REE) production. The current production of rare earth oxides (REOs) is completed by an energy and chemically intensive process from the mining of REE ores. Investigations into a more sustainable supply of REEs from secondary sources, such as toxic phosphogypsum (PG) waste, is vital to securing the REE supply chain. However, conventional solvent extraction to recover dilute REEs from PG waste is inefficient and has high environmental impact. In this work, we propose a treatment train for the recovery of REEs from PG which includes a bio-inspired adsorptive separation to generate a stream of pure REEs, and we assess its financial viability and environmental impacts under uncertainties through a "probabilistic sustainability" framework integrating life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA). Results show that in 87% of baseline scenario simulations, the internal rate of return (IRR) exceeded 15%, indicating that this system has the potential to be profitable. However, environmental impacts of the system are mixed. Specifically, the proposed system outperforms conventional systems in ecosystem quality and resource depletion, but has higher human health impacts. Scenario analysis shows that the system is profitable at capacities larger than 100,000 kg*hr-1*PG for PG with REE content above 0.5 wt%. The most dilute PG sources (0.02-0.1 wt% REE) are inaccessible using the current process scheme (limited by the cost of acid and subsequent neutralization) requiring further examination of new process schemes and improvements in technological performance. Overall, this study evaluates the sustainability of a first-of-its-kind REE recovery process from PG and uses these results to provide clear direction for advancing sustainable REE recovery from secondary sources.</description>

      <title>Drivers and barriers of adopting shared micromobility: a latent class clustering model on the attitudes towards shared micromobility as part of public transport trips in the Netherlands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shared micromobility (SMM) is often cited as a solution to the first/last mile problem of public transport (train) travel, yet when implemented, they often do not get adopted by a broader travelling public. A large part of behavioural adoption is related to peoples' attitudes and perceptions. In this paper, we develop an adjusted behavioural framework, based on the UTAUT2 technology acceptance framework. We carry out an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to obtain attitudinal factors which we then use to perform a latent class cluster analysis (LCCA), with the goal of studying the potential adoption of SMM and to assess the various drivers and barriers as perceived by different user groups. Our findings suggest there are six distinct user groups with varying intention to use shared micromobility: Progressives, Conservatives, Hesitant participants, Bold innovators, Anxious observers and Skilled sceptics. Bold innovators and Progressives tend to be the most open to adopting SMM and are also able to do so. Hesitant participants would like to, but find it difficult or dangerous to use, while Skilled sceptics are capable and confident, but have limited intention of using it. Conservatives and Anxious observers are most negative about SMM, finding it difficult to use and dangerous. In general, factors relating to technological savviness, ease-of-use, physical safety and societal perception seem to be the biggest barriers to wider adoption. Younger, highly educated males are the group most likely and open to using shared micromobility, while older individuals with lower incomes and a lower level of education tend to be the least likely.</description>

      <title>Fusion for high-value heat production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global consumption of heat is vast and difficult to decarbonise, but it could present an opportunity for commercial fusion energy technology.
  The economics of supplying heat with fusion energy are explored in context of a future decarbonised energy system. A simple, generalised model is used to estimate the impact of selling heat on profitability, and compare it to selling electricity, for a variety of fusion proposed power plant permutations described in literature.
  Heat production has the potential to significantly improve the financial performance of fusion over selling electricity. Upon entering a highly electrified energy system, fusion should aim to operate as a grid-scale heat pump, avoiding both electrical conversion and recirculation costs whilst exploiting firm demand for high-value heat. This strategy is relatively high-risk, high-reward, but options are identified for hedging these risks. We also identify and discuss new avenues for competition in this domain, which would not exist if fusion supplies electricity only.</description>

      <title>Network Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex networks are frequently employed to model physical or virtual complex systems. When certain entities exist across multiple systems simultaneously, unveiling their corresponding relationships across the networks becomes crucial. This problem, known as network alignment, holds significant importance. It enhances our understanding of complex system structures and behaviours, facilitates the validation and extension of theoretical physics research about studying complex systems, and fosters diverse practical applications across various fields. However, due to variations in the structure, characteristics, and properties of complex networks across different fields, the study of network alignment is often isolated within each domain, with even the terminologies and concepts lacking uniformity. This review comprehensively summarizes the latest advancements in network alignment research, focusing on analyzing network alignment characteristics and progress in various domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, computational linguistics and privacy protection. It provides a detailed analysis of various methods' implementation principles, processes, and performance differences, including structure consistency-based methods, network embedding-based methods, and graph neural network-based (GNN-based) methods. Additionally, the methods for network alignment under different conditions, such as in attributed networks, heterogeneous networks, directed networks, and dynamic networks, are presented. Furthermore, the challenges and the open issues for future studies are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A Review of Traffic Wave Suppression Strategies: Variable Speed Limit vs. Jam-Absorption Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main form of freeway traffic congestion is the familiar stop-and-go wave, characterized by wide moving jams that propagate indefinitely upstream provided enough traffic demand. They cause severe, long-lasting adverse effects, such as reduced traffic efficiency, increased driving risks, and higher vehicle emissions. This underscores the crucial importance of artificial intervention in the propagation of stop-and-go waves. Over the past two decades, two prominent strategies for stop-and-go wave suppression have emerged: variable speed limit (VSL) and jam-absorption driving (JAD). Although they share similar research motivations, objectives, and theoretical foundations, the development of these strategies has remained relatively disconnected. To synthesize fragmented advances and drive the field forward, this paper first provides a comprehensive review of the achievements in the stop-and-go wave suppression-oriented VSL and JAD, respectively. It then focuses on bridging the two areas and identifying research opportunities from the following perspectives: fundamental diagrams, traffic dynamics modeling, traffic state estimation and prediction, stochasticity, scenarios for strategy validation, and field tests and practical deployment. We expect that through this review, one area can effectively address its limitations by identifying and leveraging the strengths of the other, thus promoting the overall research goal of freeway stop-and-go wave suppression.</description>

      <title>Towards global equity in political polarization research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a folk understanding that political polarization refers to socio-political divisions within a society, many have proclaimed that we are more divided than ever. In this account, polarization has been blamed for populism, the erosion of social cohesion, the loss of trust in the institutions of democracy, legislative dysfunction, and the collective failure to address existential risks such as Covid-19 or climate change. However, at a global scale there is surprisingly little academic literature which conclusively supports these claims, with half of all studies being U.S.-focused. Here, we provide an overview of the global state of research on polarization, highlighting insights that are robust across countries, those unique to specific contexts, and key gaps in the literature. We argue that addressing these gaps is urgent, but has been hindered thus far by systemic and cultural barriers, such as regionally stratified restrictions on data access and misaligned research incentives. If continued cross-disciplinary inertia means that these disparities are left unaddressed, we see a substantial risk that countries will adopt policies to tackle polarization based on inappropriate evidence, risking flawed decision-making and the weakening of democratic institutions.</description>

      <title>OpenTuringBench: An Open-Model-based Benchmark and Framework for Machine-Generated Text Detection and Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open Large Language Models (OLLMs) are increasingly leveraged in generative AI applications, posing new challenges for detecting their outputs. We propose OpenTuringBench, a new benchmark based on OLLMs, designed to train and evaluate machine-generated text detectors on the Turing Test and Authorship Attribution problems. OpenTuringBench focuses on a representative set of OLLMs, and features a number of challenging evaluation tasks, including human/machine-manipulated texts, out-of-domain texts, and texts from previously unseen models. We also provide OTBDetector, a contrastive learning framework to detect and attribute OLLM-based machine-generated texts. Results highlight the relevance and varying degrees of difficulty of the OpenTuringBench tasks, with our detector achieving remarkable capabilities across the various tasks and outperforming most existing detectors. Resources are available on the OpenTuringBench Hugging Face repository at https://huggingface.co/datasets/MLNTeam-Unical/OpenTuringBench</description>

      <title>Proper Interpretation of Heaps' and Zipf's Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We checked that the distribution of words in text should uniform, which gives Heaps' law as natural result, that is, the number of types of words can be expressed as a power law of the number of tokens within text. We developed a ``superposition'' model, which leads to an asymptotic power-law distribution of the number of occurrences (or frequency) of words, that is, Zipf's law. The model is well consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Epidemic-induced local awareness behavior inferred from surveys and genetic sequence data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavior-disease models suggest that pandemics can be contained cost-effectively if individuals take preventive actions when disease prevalence rises among their close contacts. However, assessing local awareness behavior in real-world datasets remains a challenge. Through the analysis of mutation patterns in clinical genetic sequence data, we propose an efficient approach to quantify the impact of local awareness by identifying superspreading events and assigning containment scores to them.
  We validate the proposed containment score as a proxy for local awareness in simulation experiments, and find that it was correlated positively with policy stringency during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we observe a temporary drop in the containment score during the Omicron wave in the United Kingdom, matching a survey experiment we carried out in Hungary during the corresponding period of the pandemic. Our findings bring important insight into the field of awareness modeling through the analysis of large-scale genetic sequence data, one of the most promising data sources in epidemics research.</description>

      <title>AI agents can coordinate beyond human scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02822v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in collaborative tasks involving multiple agents, forming an "AI agent society: where agents interact and influence one another. Whether such groups can spontaneously coordinate on arbitrary decisions without external influence - a hallmark of self-organized regulation in human societies - remains an open question. Here we investigate the stability of groups formed by AI agents by applying methods from complexity science and principles from behavioral sciences. We find that LLMs can spontaneously form cohesive groups, and that their opinion dynamics is governed by a majority force coefficient, which determines whether coordination is achievable. This majority force diminishes as group size increases, leading to a critical group size beyond which coordination becomes practically unattainable and stability is lost. Notably, this critical group size grows exponentially with the language capabilities of the models, and for the most advanced LLMs, it exceeds the typical size of informal human groups. Our findings highlight intrinsic limitations in the self-organization of AI agent societies and have implications for the design of collaborative AI systems where coordination is desired or could represent a treat.</description>
