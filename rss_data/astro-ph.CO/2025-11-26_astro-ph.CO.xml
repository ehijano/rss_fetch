      <title>Simulated Rotation Measure Sky from Primordial Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial Magnetic Fields (PMFs) -- magnetic fields originating in the early Universe and permeating the cosmological scales today -- can explain the observed microGauss-level magnetisation of galaxies and their clusters. In light of current and upcoming all-sky radio surveys, PMFs have drawn attention not only as major candidates for explaining the large-scale magnetisation of the Universe, but also as potential probes of early-Universe physics. In this paper, using cosmological simulations coupled with light-cone analysis, we study for the first time the imprints of the PMF structure on the mean rotation measure (RM) originating in the intergalactic medium (IGM), $\langle \mathrm{RM_{IGM}}\rangle$. We introduce a new method for producing full-sky $\mathrm{RM_{IGM}}$ distributions and analyse the autocorrelation of $\mathrm{RM_{IGM}}$ on small and large angular scales; we find that PMF structures indeed show distinct signatures. The large-scale uniform model (characterised by an initially unlimited coherence scale) leads to correlations up to 90 degrees, while correlations for small-scale stochastic PMF models drop by factor of $100$ at $ 0.17, 0.13$ and 0.11 degrees angular scales, corresponding to $5.24, 4.03$ and $3.52$ Mpc scales (at $z=2$ redshift) for magnetic fields with comoving $3.49, 1.81, 1.00 $ Mpc/h coherence scales, respectively; the correlation amplitude of the PMF model with comoving $\sim 19$ Mpc/h coherence scale drops only by factor of $10$ at 1 degree (30.6 Mpc). These results suggests that improvements in the modelling of Galactic RM will be necessary to investigate the signature of large-scale correlated PMFs. A comparison of $\langle \mathrm{RM_{IGM}}\rangle$ redshift dependence obtained from our simulations with that from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey shows agreement with our previous upper limits' estimates on the PMF strength derived from RM-rms analysis.</description>

      <title>Towards Reconciling Reionization with JWST: The Role of Bright Galaxies and Strong Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elevated UV luminosity functions (UVLF) from recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have challenged the viability of existing theoretical models. To address this, we use a semi-analytical framework -- which couples a physically motivated source model derived from radiative-transfer hydrodynamic simulations of reionization with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler -- to perform a joint calibration to JWST galaxy surveys (UVLF, $\phi_{\rm UV}$ and UV luminosity density, $\rho_{\rm UV}$) and reionization-era observables (ionizing emissivity, $\dot{N}_{\rm ion}$, neutral hydrogen fraction, $x_{\rm HI}$, and Thomson optical depth, $\tau$). We find that models with weak feedback and a higher contribution from faint galaxies reproduce the reionization observables but struggle to match the elevated JWST UVLF at $z &gt; 9$. In contrast, models with stronger feedback (i.e., rapid redshift evolution) and a higher contribution from bright galaxies successfully reproduce JWST UVLF at $z \geq 10$, but over-estimate the bright end at $z &lt; 9$. The strong-feedback model constrained by JWST UVLF predicts a more gradual and extended reionization history, as opposed to the sudden reionization seen in the weak-feedback models. This extended nature of reionization ($z\sim 16$ - $6$) yields an optical depth consistent (at 2-$\sigma$) with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraint, thereby alleviating the photon-budget crisis. In both scenarios, reionization is complete by $z \sim 6$, consistent with current data. Our analysis highlights the importance of accurately modeling feedback and ionizing emissivities from different source populations during the first billion years after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>In medio stat virtus: enrichment history in poor galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enrichment history of galaxy clusters and groups remains far from being fully understood. Recent measurements in massive clusters have revealed remarkably flat iron abundance profiles out to the outskirts, suggesting that similar enrichment processes have occurred for all systems. In contrast, abundance profiles in galaxy groups have sometimes been measured to decline with radius, challenging our understanding of the physical processes at these scales. In this paper, we present a pilot study aimed at accurately measuring the iron abundance profiles of MKW3s, A2589, and Hydra A, three poor clusters with total masses of $M_{500} \simeq 2.0-2.5 \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$, intermediate between the scales of galaxy groups and massive clusters. Using XMM-Newton to obtain nearly complete azimuthal coverage of the outer regions of these systems, we show that abundance measurements in the outskirts are more likely to be limited by systematics than by statistical errors. In particular, inaccurate modelling of the soft X-ray background can significantly bias metallicity estimates in regions where the cluster emission is faint. Once these systematics are properly accounted for, the abundance profiles of all three clusters appear to be flat at $Z \sim 0.3$ Z$_{\odot}$, in agreement with values observed in massive clusters. Using available stellar mass estimates, we also computed their iron yields, thereby beginning to probe a largely unexplored mass range. We find $Y_{Fe,500} = 2.68\pm0.34$, $2.54\pm0.64$, and $7.51\pm1.47$ Z$_{\odot}$ for MKW3s, A2589, and Hydra A, respectively, spanning the transition regime between galaxy groups and massive clusters. Future observations of systems with temperatures of $2-4$ keV will be essential to further populate this intermediate-mass regime and to draw firmer conclusions on the chemical enrichment history of galaxy systems across the full mass scale.</description>

      <title>Connecting clustering and the cosmic web:Observational constraints on secondary halo bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations predict significant secondary dependencies of halo clustering on internal properties and environment. Detecting these subtle signals in observational data remains challenging, with important ramifications for galaxy evolution and cosmology. We probe secondary halo bias in observational survey data, using galaxy groups as dark matter halo proxies. We quantify secondary bias using central galaxy colour and environmental diagnostics. We use an extended, refined galaxy group catalogue from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Secondary bias is defined as any deviation in group clustering strength at fixed mass, quantified through the projected two-point correlation function. Our environmental analysis uses DisPerSE to compute distances to critical points of the density field, incorporating local group overdensity measurements on multiple scales. We robustly detect several forms of secondary bias in the clustering of galaxy groups. At fixed mass, groups hosting red central galaxies are more strongly clustered than those with blue centrals, with $b_{\rm relative}$ ranging from $\sim 1.2$ for the 15\% reddest centrals to $\sim 0.8$ for the bluest ones. Environmental dependencies based on cosmic-web distances are also present, though significantly weaker and largely mass-independent. The strongest signal arises from local overdensity: groups in the densest 15\% of environments reach $b_{\rm relative} \sim 1.4$, while those in the least dense regions fall to $b_{\rm relative} \sim 0.7$. These results establish a clear observational hierarchy for secondary halo bias. The colour of central galaxies correlates with the local group overdensity, which, in turn, correlates with the bias at fixed group mass. Assuming that central galaxy colour traces halo assembly history, this three-stage picture offers a conceptual link between our results and halo assembly bias.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement the constrained divergence cleaning algorithm of \citet{Tricco2016} into the cosmological smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) code OpenGadget3. Our implementation modifies the governing equations of SPMHD to allow the constrained hyperbolic/parabolic cleaning scheme to be applied consistently in an expanding cosmological framework. This ensures that divergence errors in the magnetic field are actively propagated away and damped, rather than merely being advected with the flow or partially controlled by source terms. To validate our implementation, we perform a series of standard test problems, including the advection of divergence errors, the Orszag-Tang vortex, the Brio-Wu shock tube, and magnetised Zeldovich pancakes. These tests confirm that our scheme successfully reduces divergence errors while preserving the correct physical evolution of the system.
  We then apply the method to a fully cosmological simulation of a massive galaxy cluster, comparing the results to those obtained using the previously employed Powell eight-wave divergence preserving scheme. We find that the overall density structure of the cluster is largely unaffected by the choice of divergence cleaning method, and the magnetic field geometry and strengths in the cluster core remain similar. However, in the cluster outskirts ($r \approx$~1-3~$h^{-1}$~Mpc), the magnetic field is amplified by a factor of $\sim$ 5 compared to the Powell-only approach. Moreover, the constrained divergence cleaning algorithm reduces the divergence error by 2-3 orders of magnitude throughout the cluster volume, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining the solenoidal condition of the magnetic field in large-scale cosmological simulations. Our results suggest that accurate divergence control is essential for modeling magnetic field amplification in low-density regions of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Detection of the Cosmological 21 cm Signal in Auto-correlation at z ~ 1 with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detection of the cosmological 21 cm intensity mapping signal in auto-correlation at z ~ 1 with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). Using 94 nights of observation, we have measured the 21 cm auto-power spectrum over a frequency range from 608.2 MHz to 707.8 MHz (z = 1.34 to 1.01) at 0.4 h Mpc^-1 &lt; k &lt; 1.5 h Mpc^-1, with a detection significance of 12.5 sigma. Our analysis employs significant improvements to the CHIME data processing pipeline compared to previous work, including novel radio frequency interference (RFI) detection and masking algorithms, achromatic beamforming techniques, and foreground filtering before time averaging to minimize spectral leakage. We establish the robustness and reliability of our detection through a comprehensive suite of validation tests. We also measure the 21 cm signal in two independent sub-bands centered at z ~ 1.08 and z ~ 1.24 with detection significance of 8.7 sigma and 9.2 sigma, respectively. We briefly discuss the theoretical interpretation of these measurements in terms of a power spectrum model, deferring the details to a companion paper. This auto-power spectrum detection demonstrates CHIME's capability to probe large-scale structure through 21 cm intensity mapping without reliance on external galaxy surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On August 17$^{\rm th}$ 2017, observatories worldwide made a landmark detection: gravitational waves and light from a binary neutron star merger. This event revolutionized our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology, and gravitation. In this proceeding of the 2025 International Congress of Basic Science, we describe how it transformed our view of cosmic acceleration (dark energy). The near-simultaneous arrival of light and gravitational waves shows that their speeds agree to within one part in $10^{15}$, excluding large classes of modified gravity theories and interactions between dark energy and matter.</description>

      <title>Cold Dark Matter and Dark Energy Based on an Analogy with Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel candidate for cold dark matter consisting of condensed Cooper pairs in a theory of interacting fermions with broken chiral symmetry. Establishing the thermal history from the early radiation era to the present, the fermions are shown to behave like standard radiation at high temperatures, but then experience a critical era decaying faster than radiation, akin to freeze-out that sets the relic abundance. Through a second-order phase transition, fermion - antifermion pairs condense and the system asymptotes towards zero temperature and pressure. By the present era, the non-relativistic, massive condensate decays slightly faster than in the standard scenario -- a unique prediction that may be tested by combined measurements of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure. We also show that in the case of massive fermions, the phase transition is frustrated, and freeze-out instead leaves a residual, long-lived</description>

      <title>The Evolving Baryonic Tully Fisher Relation: A Universal Law from Galaxies to Galactic Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) links the baryonic mass of galaxies to their characteristic rotational velocity and has been shown to with remarkable precision across a wide mass range. Recent studies, however, indicate that galaxy clusters occupy a parallel but offset relation, raising questions about the universality of the BTFR. Here, we demonstrate that the offset between galaxies and clusters arises naturally from cosmic time evolution. Using the evolving BTFR derived from the Nexus Paradigm of quantum gravity, we show that the normalization of the relation evolves as an exponential function of cosmic time., while the slope remains fixed at $\sim 4$. This provides a simple and predictive framework in which both galaxies and clusters obey the same universal scaling law, with their apparent offset reflecting their different formation epochs. Our results unify mass-velocity scaling across five orders of magnitude in baryonic mass, offering new insights into cosmic structure formation.</description>

      <title>Impact of Simulation Box Size for Weak Lensing: Replication and Super-Sample Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify the bias caused by small simulation box size on weak lensing observables and covariances, considering both replication and super-sample effects for a range of higher-order statistics. Using two simulation suites -- one comprising large boxes ($3750\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$) and another constructed by tiling small boxes ($625\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$) -- we generate full-sky convergence maps and extract $10^\circ \times 10^\circ$ patches via a Fibonacci grid. We consider biases in the mean and covariance of the angular power spectrum, bispectrum (up to $\ell=3000$), PDF, peak/minima counts, and Minkowski functionals. By first identifying lines of sight that are impacted by replications, we find that replication causes a O$(10\%)$ bias in the PDF and Minkowski functionals, and a O$(1\%)$ bias in other summary statistics. Replication also causes a O$(10\%)$ bias in the covariances, increasing with source redshift and $\ell$, reaching $\sim25\%$ for $z_s=2.5$. We additionally show that replication leads to heavy biases (up to O$(100\%)$ at high redshift) when performing gnomonic projection on a patch that is centered along a direction of replication. We then identify the lines of sight that are minimally affected by replication, and use the corresponding patches to isolate and study super-sample effects, finding that, while the mean values agree to within $1\%$, the variances differ by O$(10\%)$ for $z_s\leq2.5$. We show that these effects remain in the presence of noise and smoothing scales typical of the DES, KiDS, HSC, LSST, Euclid, and Roman surveys. We also discuss how these effects scale as a function of box size. Our results highlight the importance of large simulation volumes for accurate lensing statistics and covariance estimation.</description>

      <title>Estimating the triaxiality of massive clusters from 2D observables in MillenniumTNG with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties of massive galaxy clusters, such as mass abundance and concentration, are sensitive to cosmology, making cluster statistics a powerful tool for cosmological studies. However, favoring a more simplified, spherically symmetric model for galaxy clusters can lead to biases in the estimates of cluster properties. In this work, we present a deep-learning approach for estimating the triaxiality and orientations of massive galaxy clusters (those with masses $\gtrsim 10^{14}\,M_\odot h^{-1}$) from 2D observables. We utilize the flagship hydrodynamical volume of the suite of cosmological-hydrodynamical MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations as our ground truth. Our model combines the feature extracting power of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and the message passing power of a graph neural network (GNN) in a multi-modal, fusion network. Our model is able to extract 3D geometry information from 2D idealized cluster multi-wavelength images (soft X-ray, medium X-ray, hard X-ray and tSZ effect) and mathematical graph representations of 2D cluster member observables (line-of-sight radial velocities, 2D projected positions and V-band luminosities). Our network improves cluster geometry estimation in MTNG by $30\%$ compared to assuming spherical symmetry. We report an $R^2 = 0.85$ regression score for estimating the major axis length of triaxial clusters and correctly classifying $71\%$ of prolate clusters with elongated orientations along our line-of-sight.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions are a promising probe of physics beyond the Standard Model, as many extensions of the standard model result in first-order phase transitions in the early universe, from which the resulting gravitational waves could be detectable with the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).
  The properties of the phase transition and the resulting gravitational wave spectrum are determined by five key parameters: the nucleation temperature $T_n$, phase transition strength at the nucleation temperature $\alpha_n$, bubble wall speed $v_\text{wall}$, transition rate $\beta$ and the sound speed $c_s$. Of these, the sound speed $c_s$ is determined by the equation of state $p(T,\phi)$. In most studies, the plasma of the early universe has been assumed to be ultrarelativistic and therefore following the bag equation of state with $c_s = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.
  In this thesis, the PTtools simulation framework for first-order phase transitions, based on the Sound Shell Model, has been extended to include support for arbitrary equations of state and therefore for a temperature- and phase-dependent sound speed $c_s(T,\phi)$. The thesis also functions as a reference manual for PTtools. The framework has been tested with the constant sound speed model, in which the sound speed is a different constant in each phase. The sound speed has been shown to have a significant effect on the resulting gravitational wave spectrum, especially when changing the sound speed results in a change in the type of the solution. This has laid the groundwork for simulating cosmological phase transitions with realistic equations of state. This will result in in gravitational wave spectra that can be used in the LISA data analysis pipeline to search for the existence and parameters of a first-order phase transition in the early universe.</description>

      <title>An improved time delay from VLA and ATCA monitoring of the gravitational lens system PKS 1830-211</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have measured a time delay of 25.3 +/- 2.0 d (1-sigma confidence) in the Einstein ring gravitational lens system PKS 1830-211 from an analysis of archival VLA and ATCA monitoring data observed between 1997 and 2004. A small portion of the ATCA data was previously used to determine a time delay and our result is consistent with the previous value, but with an uncertainty that is smaller by more than a factor of two. The long time-baseline of the monitoring reveals that the flux density ratio is smoothly varying on a time-scale of years, an effect which we attribute to millilensing by massive objects (&gt;&gt;1 M_sun) in the lensing galaxy. Image A is unpolarized in the VLA monitoring, but VLBI observations show that this is partly due to beam dilution by an unpolarized counter-jet that is only present in that image. Based on the identification of this feature as a counter-jet, we conclude that its unexpected prominence in image A is a consequence of lensing and that more detailed modelling is required in order to reconcile the VLBI morphology of each image.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Impacts of Baryonic Feedback from Kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich Cross-Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex processes of baryonic feedback associated with galaxy evolution are still poorly understood, and their impact on the clustering of matter on small scales remains difficult to quantify. While many fitting functions and emulators exist to model the matter power spectrum, their input parameters are not directly observable. However, recent studies using hydrodynamical simulations have identified a promising correlation between the gas content of halos and changes to the matter power spectrum from feedback. Building on these findings, we create the first fully data-driven power spectrum emulator. We utilize the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect, a secondary anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background, as a tracer of free electrons in and around halos. We train a neural network to learn the mapping between the suppression of the matter power spectrum and the shape of the kSZ power spectrum extracted with a radial velocity template. We train and validate our algorithm using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, which encompasses a wide range of feedback models. Our emulator can reconstruct the matter power spectrum at the sub-percent level for scales $k\leq 5\;h/$Mpc and $0.2\leq z \leq 1.25$ directly from the data. Our model is robust and retains percent-level accuracy even for feedback models and cosmological parameter values not seen during training (except in a few extreme cases drastically different from the fiducial model). Due to its robustness, our algorithm offers a new way to identify the sources of suppression in the matter power spectrum, breaking the degeneracies between baryonic feedback and new physics. Finally, we present a forecast for reconstruction of the matter power spectrum combining maps of the microwave background anisotropies from a Simons Observatory-like experiment and galaxy catalogs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</description>

      <title>GREA and Dark Energy: A holographic dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of the cosmological constant is a mystery. We don't understand its quantum origin but we associate it with the actual acceleration of the universe because it is the simplest description we had until recently of the present cosmological observations. However, this may change with the next generation of experiments. If we can convince ourselves that the cosmic acceleration is not due to a constant, this would open up new fascinating avenues. By exploring the simplest cosmological model in the bulk, that of an empty and flat space with a cosmological constant $\Lambda$, we find that its holographic dual makes sense as a theory of fundamental quantum degrees of freedom at the boundary. Moreover, we find that an observer in the bulk, making long-range (electromagnetic and gravitational) observations, cannot distinguish the acceleration induced by the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ from that induced by the thermodynamic properties of the boundary, the de Sitter horizon. By including matter in the bulk we extend this holographic principle to GREA, where the quantum d.o.f. associated with the evolving boundary of the causal horizon induces an entropic acceleration that varies in time. Future observations will determine whether our causal horizon is responsible for the present acceleration and whether our universe will end in de Sitter or Minkowski.</description>

      <title>Searching Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background Landscape Across Frequency Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astrophysics is entering a multi-band era with upcoming GW detectors, enabling detailed mapping of the stochastic GW background across vast frequencies. We highlight this potential via a new physics scenario: hybrid topological defects from a two-step phase transition separated by inflation. We develop a general pipeline to analyze experimental exclusions and apply it to this model. The model offers a possible explanation of the pulsar timing array signal at low frequencies, and future experiments (LISA/Cosmic Explorer/Einstein Telescope) will confirm or rule it out via the higher-frequency probes, showcasing the power of multi-band constraints.</description>

      <title>Mind the Information Gap: Unveiling Detailed Morphologies of z 0.5-1.0 Galaxies with SLACS Strong Lenses and Data-Driven Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new state-of-the-art lens models for strong gravitational lensing systems from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey, developed within a Bayesian framework that employs high-dimensional (pixellated), data-driven priors for the background source, foreground lens light, and point-spread function (PSF). Unlike conventional methods, our approach delivers high-resolution reconstructions of all major physical components of the lensing system and substantially reduces model-data residuals compared to previous work. For the majority of 30 lensing systems analyzed, we also provide posterior samples capturing the full uncertainty of each physical model parameter. The reconstructions of the background sources reveal high significance morphological structures as small as 200 parsecs in galaxies at redshifts of z 0.5-1.0, demonstrating the power of strong lensing and the analysis method to be used as a cosmic telescope to study the high redshift universe. This study marks the first application of data-driven generative priors to modeling real strong-lensing data and establishes a new benchmark for strong lensing precision modeling in the era of large-scale imaging surveys.</description>

      <title>Periodic gravitational lensing by oscillating boson stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that oscillating (real-scalar) boson stars can act as strictly periodic gravitational lenses and generically host an \emph{oscillating radial caustic}. Sources near this caustic cross it every half period, producing achromatic phase-locked photometric spikes synchronized with an astrometric wobble, providing a promising target for time-domain astronomy. Event-number estimation indicates a measurable discovery space with current astrometric and high-cadence photometric surveys. These predictions rely only on the dynamics of long-lived real-scalar condensates, therefore offering a clean test of self-gravitating quantum fields in curved spacetime. The framework extends naturally to self-interacting real scalars (including axion-like particles) and to ultralight vector bosons.</description>

      <title>Fibre Inflation Meets Quintessence: Implications of Perturbative Stabilisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have discovered a new avenue of fibre inflation in perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS) due to the redefinition of the base modulus. pLVS offers a novel regime where large volume of the internal space is guaranteed without the need of non-perturbative effects. In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data \cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim} and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\lesssim r\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $\alpha^{\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier.</description>

      <title>Probing High Reheating Temperatures by Direct Detection Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the benchmark freeze in dark matter (DM) scenario for direct detection experiments, in which a DM candidate interacts with the Standard Model (SM) through an ultralight dark photon, becomes sensitive to the visible sector reheating temperature if it is sufficiently high. At such temperatures, the irreducible ultraviolet (UV) freeze in production of DM through graviton exchange becomes important and must be combined with the infrared (IR) freeze in yield mediated by the dark photon. As long as gravitationally produced DM does not equilibrate through annihilation into dark photons and the subsequent formation of a dark thermal bath, it retains information about the reheating phase. Including this gravitational contribution relaxes the required DM and SM portal coupling and allows smaller values than those that would match the observed relic abundance through IR freeze in alone. Since current direct detection experiments have excluded the benchmark freeze in model over a wide range of DM masses, they are now effectively probing high reheating temperatures and the gravitational freeze in of DM.</description>

      <title>Tracing ionized gas kinematics in Lyman-Break Analogs. Implications for star formation compactness and outflow properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the ionized gas kinematics and feedback properties in a sample of 14 low-mass, UV-luminous Lyman Break Analogs (LBAs) at redshifts z~0.1-0.3. These compact, strongly star-forming galaxies serve as local analogs of high-redshift starbursts. Using high-resolution VLT/X-shooter spectra, we model the optical emission-line profiles, including [O III] 4959,5007 and the Balmer lines, with multi-component Gaussian fits. All galaxies show complex kinematics that require both narrow (sigma &lt; 90 km/s) and broad (sigma &gt; 90 km/s) components. The narrow components trace highly turbulent gas associated with massive star-forming regions, while the broad components indicate ionized outflows driven by stellar winds and supernova feedback, with outflow velocities of about 200-500 km/s. Estimated mass outflow rates range from 0.20 to 2.72 solar masses per year, with mass-loading factors between 0.03 and 0.81. We find a mild increase in mass loading toward lower stellar masses, as well as a strong correlation between mass loading and star-formation-rate surface density, suggesting that more compact starbursts drive more powerful outflows. These trends are consistent with those seen in star-forming galaxies at higher redshifts. Our results highlight the importance of local UV-compact starbursts for understanding feedback processes in low-mass, rapidly star-forming galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope has recently detected massive, fully formed, galaxies at redshifts corresponding to few hundred million years after the Big-Bang. However, our current cosmological model cannot produce such massive systems so early in the lifetime of the universe. A number of theoretical solutions have been proposed, but they all appeal to exotic new physics and introduce rather excessive fine-tuning. In this essay, we outline a theoretical answer to the early galaxy-formation question, which operates within standard general relativity and standard cosmology, without appealing to any new physics. Instead, we account for the effect of a well established feature of our universe. This feature, which has so far been kept in the margins of mainstream cosmology, are the peculiar velocities.</description>

      <title>New constraints on axion with gamma-ray observations of the Crab Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the upper bounds on the coupling of axion-like particles (ALPs) with photon as a function of the mass by considering axion-photon conversion in the Crab Nebula. Previous studies have not considered the influence of the magnetic field within the Crab Nebula. The magnetic field plays a crucial role through the Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) process, in which high-energy electrons produce synchrotron radiation that is subsequently up-scattered by the same electrons via inverse Compton scattering to generate gamma rays. Therefore, neglecting the magnetic field in modeling leads to theoretical inconsistencies. In this work, we investigate the significance of the magnetic field effect and demonstrate that even differences in magnetic field modeling can substantially alter the conversion probability. We thus, for the first time, point out that proper consideration of the magnetic field is essential in ALP searches using gamma rays from the Crab Nebula. The resulting constraints reach up to a coupling of $g_{a\gamma \gamma} \lesssim 1 \times 10^{-11} {\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses in the range $10^{-10} {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-6} {\rm eV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a precision investigation of smooth quintessential inflation in which a single canonical scalar field unifies the two known phases of cosmic acceleration. Using a CMB-normalized runaway exponential potential, we obtain sharply predictive inflationary observables: a red-tilted spectrum with $n_s = 0.964241$ and an exceptionally suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = 7.48 \times 10^{-5}$ at $N=60$, lying near the optimal region of current Planck+ACT constraints. Remarkably, all observable scales exit the horizon within an extremely narrow field interval $\Delta\phi \simeq 0.03\,M_{\rm Pl}$, tightly linking early and late-time dynamics and reducing theoretical ambiguities. While inflationary tensors remain invisible to CMB B-mode surveys, the subsequent stiff epoch-an intrinsic hallmark of quintessential cosmology-imprints a blue-tilted stochastic gravitational-wave background within the discovery reach of future interferometers such as LISA, DECIGO, ALIA, and BBO. Our results demonstrate that this minimal, featureless model not only survives current bounds, but provides concrete, falsifiable predictions across gravitational-wave frequencies spanning over twenty orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: We present a search for gravitational waves from inspiraling, planetary-mass ultra-compact binaries using data from the first part of the fourth observing run of LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA. Finding no evidence of such systems, we determine the maximum distance reach for such objects and their merger rate densities, independently of how they could have formed. Then, we identify classes of primordial black-hole mass distributions for which these rate limits can be translated into relevant constraints on the mass distribution of primordial black holes, assuming that they compose all of dark matter, in the mass range $[10^{-6},10^{-3}]M_\odot$. Our constraints are consistent with existing microlensing results in the planetary-mass range, and provide a complementary probe to sub-solar mass objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the origin of the scatter in the stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation using the \colibre cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. At fixed halo mass, we find a clear positive correlation between stellar mass and halo concentration, particularly in low-mass haloes between $10^{11}$ and $10^{12}\,\rm M_\odot$, where all halo properties are computed from the corresponding dark-matter-only simulation. Two scenarios have been proposed to explain this trend: the earlier formation of higher-concentration haloes allows more time for star formation, or the deeper gravitational potential wells of higher-concentration haloes enhance baryon retention. To distinguish between them, we examine correlations between halo concentration, stellar mass, stellar age, and stellar metallicity. While, at fixed halo mass, halo concentration correlates with stellar age, stellar age itself shows only a weak correlation with stellar mass, indicating that early formation alone cannot account for the concentration-dependence in the scatter of the SMHM relation. In contrast, both stellar metallicity and halo concentration exhibit correlations with stellar mass. The connection between halo concentration and stellar metallicity persists even when simultaneously controlling for both halo mass and stellar mass. These results support the scenario in which the deeper gravitational potentials in higher-concentration haloes suppress feedback-driven outflows, thereby enhancing both baryon and metal retention.</description>

      <title>Chiral phonons in metal-organic frameworks as quantum sensors for the direct detection of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a new quantum sensor for dark matter direct detection with sub-eV sensitivity, focusing on several candidate materials that potentially host chiral phonons with large magnetic moments that can be directly read out with an external magnetometer. We focus on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as possible candidate materials for single chiral phonon detection due to their noncentrosymmetric structure, tunability, and the ability to host these excitations in stable acoustic bands. We identify several promising candidates and compare their projected dark matter detection sensitivity for all possible interactions identified within effective field theory. We establish that the expected sensitivity does not depend heavily on the specific choice of the MOF, enabling us to tailor the final material composition to facilitate the magnetic readout. We then propose a prototype setup able to test the direct readout of a chiral phonon sensor with a surface-integrated magnetometer.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Bianchi-I cosmological model in non-conservative unimodular gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose an anisotropic Bianchi-I type cosmological model in non-conservative Unimodular Gravity ($\mathrm{NUG}$). We show that simply using the Bianchi-I type metric does not resolve a striking characteristic of the field equations in $\mathrm{NUG}$: their underdetermination. This fact led us to implement extra conditions on the combination $\left(\rho+p\right)$ and, consequently, obtain a consistent background cosmological analysis. In the vacuum case, we obtain an analogy between the Kasner solutions and the equations in $\mathrm{NUG}$. We also propose a new analysis of a non-homogeneous equation of state, the combination $\left(\rho+p\right)=l$. We identify that the cosmological dynamics are strictly dependent on the value of the constant $l$. The physically interesting case is at the value $l&lt;0$, which seems to indicate a super-accelerated, ghost-like universe. This case still requires a more detailed analysis, for example, from a thermodynamic point of view, keeping in mind that $\left(\rho+p\right)$ may be interpreted as enthalpy of the system. For the cases $\left(\rho+p\right)\propto a^{-3}$ and $\left(\rho+p\right) \propto a^{-4}$, we obtain a description consistent with the anisotropic cosmological model described by $\mathrm{GR}$. In all cases analyzed, a small value for the anisotropic parameter $\Omega_{A}$ (on the order of $10^{-2}$) is required in order to have agreement, for example, with the age of the universe to be approximately $12-14\, \mathrm{Gyr}$, agreeing with the age of globular clusters. As the universe expands an isotropization is verified, with the anistropies going to zero asymptotically, similarly with what happens in an anistropic cosmological model based on $\mathrm{GR}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $F(R)$ Palatini gravity provides a robust framework for constructing viable inflationary potentials. In this study, we examine natural inflation and show that its consistency with observational data can be restored when the model is embedded within $F(R)$ Palatini gravity, specifically for $F(R) = R + \alpha R^n$ with $7/4 \lesssim n \leq 2$. For completeness, we also demonstrate that models with $n &gt; 2$ do not yield comparable improvements, achieving partial agreement with the data only in the limit $n \rightarrow 2$.</description>

      <title>Multi-Resonant-Line Radiative Transfer: Lyman-Alpha Fine Structure and Deuterium Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonance lines encode rich information about astrophysical sources and their environments, yet fully analytic treatments of multi-line radiative transfer remain almost entirely unexplored. We present exact, closed-form solutions for steady-state resonant-line radiative transfer in "V-shaped" atomic networks, where a single ground state couples to multiple transitions. Starting from the full angle-dependent transfer equation, we generalize absorption and emission coefficients to an arbitrary number of lines, derive a modified Fokker-Planck expansion of the frequency-redistribution COLT Monte Carlo radiative transfer code and find excellent agreement with the analytic predictions across a wide range of line separations, optical depths, and damping parameters, establishing our solutions as stringent validation benchmarks. For concrete applications related to the Lyman-alpha transition of neutral hydrogen, we examine how fine-structure splitting and deuterium injection modify the emergent spectra, internal radiation field, and radiative force multiplier. We show that these effects leave previous conclusions about Lyman-alpha feedback in the early universe essentially unchanged. Even when direct observational diagnostics are subtle, our framework provides novel analytic and numerical insights into coupled resonance-line transport and facilitates progress in general modeling of multi-line radiative transfer in diverse astrophysical settings.</description>

      <title>Halo mass functions at high redshift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations of very early galaxies, at $\rm{z \gtrsim 10}$, have led to claims that tension exists between the sizes and luminosities of high-redshift galaxies and what is predicted by standard $\Lambda$CDM models. Here we use the adaptive mesh refinement code $\texttt{Enzo}$ and the N-body smoothed particle hydrodynamics code $\texttt{SWIFT}$ to compare (semi-)analytic halo mass functions against the results of direct N-body models at high redshift. In particular, our goal is to investigate the variance between standard halo mass functions derived from (semi-)analytic formulations and N-body calculations and to determine what role any discrepancy may play in driving tensions between observations and theory. We find that the difference between direct N-body calculations and (semi-) analytic halo mass function fits is less than a factor of 2 (at $\rm{z \sim 10}$) within the mass range of galaxies currently being observed by JWST, and is therefore not a dominant source of error when comparing theory and observation at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Hot Spots and Nucleosynthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upon their evaporation via Hawking radiation, primordial black holes (PBHs) may deposit energy in the ambient plasma on scales smaller than the typical distance between two black holes, leading to the formation of hot spots around them. We investigate how the corresponding rise of the local temperature during the evaporation may act as a shield against the release of low-energy photons, affecting PBH's capacity to dissociate light nuclei after Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis through photo-dissociation. We study the different ways PBH hot spots affect the flux of low-energy photons expected from PBH evaporation, and we find that such effects can be particularly relevant to the physics of photo-dissociation during Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis for PBHs with masses between $10^{11}$g and $3\times 10^{12}$g. We emphasize that the magnitude of this effect is highly dependent on the specific shape of the temperature profile around PBHs and its time evolution. This underscores the necessity for a comprehensive study of PBH hot spots and their dynamics in the future.</description>

      <title>Has ACT measured radiative corrections to the tree-level Higgs-like inflation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starobinsky inflation and nonminimally coupled (NMC) Higgs inflation have been among the most favored models of the early Universe, as their predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ fall comfortably within the constraints set by Planck and BICEP/Keck. However, new results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) suggest a preference for higher values of $n_s$, introducing tension with the simplest realizations of these models. In this work, being agnostic about the nature of the inflaton, we show that incorporating one-loop corrections to a quartic NMC inflationary scenario leads to a shift in the predicted value of $n_s$, which brings NMC inflation into better agreement with ACT observations. The effect is even more significant when the model is formulated in the Palatini approach, where the modified field-space structure naturally enhances deviations from the metric case. These findings highlight the importance of quantum corrections and gravitational degrees of freedom in refining inflationary predictions in light of new data.</description>

      <title>The Glow of Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: (III) The Mysteries of the Milky Way UV Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion quark nuggets (AQNs) are hypothetical objects with nuclear density that would have formed during the quark-hadron transition and could make up most of the dark matter today. These objects have a mass greater than a few grams and are sub-micrometer in size. They would also help explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry and the similarity between visible and dark components of the universe, i.e. $\Omega_{\text{DM}} \sim \Omega_{\text{visible}}$. These composite objects behave as cold dark matter, interacting with ordinary matter and producing pervasive electromagnetic radiation. This work aims to calculate the FUV electromagnetic signature in a 1 kpc region surrounding the solar system, resulting from the interaction between antimatter AQNs and baryons. To this end, we use the high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation of the Milky Way, FIRE-2 Latter suite, to select solar system-like regions. From the simulated gas and dark matter distributions in these regions, we calculate the FUV background radiation generated by the AQN model. We find that the results are consistent with the FUV excess recently confirmed by the Alice spectrograph aboard New Horizons, which corroborated the FUV excess initially discovered by GALEX a decade ago. We also discuss the potential cosmological implications of our work, which suggest the existence of a new source of FUV radiation in galaxies, linked to the interaction between dark matter and baryons.</description>

      <title>Primordial Power Spectrum and Bispectrum from Lattice Simulations of Axion-U(1) Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present primordial non-Gaussianity predictions from a new high-precision code for simulating axion-U(1) inflation on a discrete lattice. We measure the primordial scalar curvature power spectrum and bispectrum from our simulations, determining their dependence on both scale and axion-gauge coupling strength. Both the gauge-sourced power spectrum and the bispectrum exhibit a strong blue tilt due to our choice of an $\alpha$-attractor inflaton potential. We provide fitting functions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that accurately reproduce these statistics across a wide range of scales and coupling strengths. While our fitting function for the bispectrum has a separable form, results from high-resolution simulations demonstrate that the full shape is not separable. Thus, our simulations generate realizations of primordial curvature perturbations with nontrivial correlators that cannot be generated using standard techniques for primordial non-Gaussianity. We derive bounds on the axion-gauge coupling strength based on the bispectrum constraints from the cosmic microwave background, demonstrating a new method for constraining inflationary primordial non-Gaussianity by simulating the nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons are deflected by large-scale structure through gravitational lensing. This secondary effect introduces higher-order correlations in CMB anisotropies, which are used to reconstruct lensing deflections. This allows mapping of the integrated matter distribution along the line of sight, probing the growth of structure, and recovering an undistorted view of the last-scattering surface. Gravitational lensing has been measured by previous CMB experiments, with $\textit{Planck}$'s $42\,\sigma$ detection being the current best full-sky lensing map. We present an enhanced $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ lensing map by extending the CMB multipole range and including the minimum-variance estimation, leading to a $49$ to $58\,\sigma$ detection over $80\,\%$ of the sky, depending on the final complexity of polarized Galactic emission. The combination of $\textit{Planck}$ and $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ will be the best full-sky lensing map in the 2030s, providing a $72$ to $78\,\sigma$ detection over $80\,\%$ of the sky, almost doubling $\textit{Planck}$'s sensitivity. Finally, we explore different applications of the lensing map, including cosmological parameter estimation using a lensing-only likelihood and internal delensing, showing that the combination of both experiments leads to improved constraints. The combination of $\textit{Planck}$ + $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ will improve the $S_8$ constraint by a factor of 2 compared to $\textit{Planck}$, and $\textit{Planck}$ + $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ internal delensing will improve $\textit{LiteBIRD}$'s tensor-to-scalar ratio constraint by $6\,\%$. We have tested the robustness of our results against foreground models of different complexity, showing that improvements remains even for the most complex foregrounds.</description>

Abstract: We study inflationary constraints from reheating on two classes of single-field inflationary models: a generalized $\alpha$-attractor with potential $V(\phi) = V_0 \!\left(1 - \sech^p\!\left[\phi/(\sqrt{6\alpha}\,M_{Pl})\right]\right)$ and the $\alpha$-Starobinsky model with potential $V(\phi) = V_0 \!\left(1 - e^{- \sqrt{2/(3\alpha)}\, \phi / M_{Pl}} \right)^2$. Using a semi-analytical relation that connects inflationary dynamics to reheating, we solve for the horizon-crossing field value and calculate the scalar spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the reheating temperature $T_{re}$. We consider three perturbative decay channels of the inflaton: gravitational, Yukawa (fermionic), and scalar. The parameter space spanned by $(\alpha,p,\omega_{re})$ for the first model and $(\alpha,\omega_{re})$ for the second is explored and compared with recent measurements from Planck and ACT DR6, as well as BAO from DESI DR2. For clarity, we emphasize that ACT DR6 alone is fully compatible with Planck regarding $n_s$. The upward shift toward $n_s \simeq 0.975$ appears only when DESI DR2 BAO are combined with CMB datasets (Planck+DESI, ACT+DESI, SPT-3G+DESI), and is likewise seen in the P--ACT--LB2+DESI combination. CMB-only combinations (e.g., Planck+ACT or Planck+ACT+SPT-3G) primarily refine constraints and do not by themselves raise $n_s$. Our comparisons and model assessments are therefore made with this distinction in mind: CMB-only constraints versus CMB+DESI combinations. We conclude that both models remain consistent with current CMB-only data in restricted regions of parameter space, and that residual tension with the higher $n_s$ favored by CMB+DESI persists.</description>

      <title>An Accurate Comprehensive Approach to Substructure: IV. Dynamical Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In three previous Papers we analysed the origin of the properties of halo substructure found in simulations. This was achieved by deriving them analytically in the peak model of structure formation, using the statistics of nested peaks (with no free parameter) plus a realistic model of subhalo stripping and shock-heating (with only one parameter). However, to simplify the treatment we neglected dynamical friction (DF). Here, we revisit that work by including it. That is done in a fully analytic manner, i.e. avoiding the integration of subhalo orbital motions. This leads to simple accurate expressions for the abundance and radial distribution of subhaloes of different masses, which disentangle the effects of DF from those of tidal stripping and shock-heating. This way we reproduce and explain the results of simulations and extend them to haloes of any mass, redshift and formation times in the desired cosmology.</description>

      <title>Large Scale White Noise and Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generation of white noise on large scales is a generic property of the dynamics of physical systems described by local non-linear partial differential equations. Non-linearities prevent the small scale dynamics from being erased by smoothing. Unresolved small scale dynamics act as an uncorrelated (white or Poissonian) noise (seemingly stochastic but actually deterministic) contribution to large scale dynamics. This white noise exists even when the dynamics is very nearly linear. In cases where the power spectrum is sub-Poissonian on large scales, this noise will dominate on the largest scale power no matter the amplitude of the inhomogeneities. Such is the case in the standard model of cosmology, where the primordial density power spectrum is expected to have an almost Harrison-Zel'dovich, $P[k]\sim k$, spectrum on a much broader range of scales than can be observed. Even though linear gravitational evolution dominates non-linear corrections by a factor $\sim10^5$, the non-observation of white noise on the Hubble scale precludes the extrapolation of this power law below the comoving $1\,$pc scale. More generally, observation or non-observation of large scale white noise provides a powerful probe of the universe on very small scales in the early early universe. Gravitational radiation, phase transitions, vorticity, and running of the spectral index are all phenomena that can be probed with large scale white noise. Large scale white noise is a non-optional feature of all cosmological models but one which has not heretofore been appreciated.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Cross-correlation of kSZ and continuity equation velocity reconstruction with photometric DESI LRGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last year, kinematic Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (kSZ) velocity reconstruction -- the measurement of the large-scale velocity field using the anisotropic statistics of the small-scale kSZ-galaxy overdensity correlation -- has emerged as a statistically significant probe of the large-scale Universe. In this work, we perform a 2-dimensional tomographic reconstruction using ACT DR6 CMB data and DESI legacy luminous red galaxies (LRGs). We measure the cross-correlation of the kSZ-reconstructed velocity $v^{\mathrm{kSZ}}$ with the velocity inferred from the continuity equation applied to the DESI LRGs $v^{\mathrm{cont}}$ at the $\sim 10 \sigma$ level, detecting the signal with an amplitude with respect to our theory of $b_v = 0.339\pm 0.034$. We fit a scale-dependent galaxy bias model to our measurement in order to constrain local primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{loc}}$, finding {$f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{loc}}=-180^{+61}_{-86}$} at 67\% confidence, with $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{loc}}$ consistent with zero at 95\% confidence. We also measure an auto spectrum at $2.1\sigma$ significance which provides a constraint on $b_v$ of $b_v=0.26_{-0.05}^{+0.11}$, which is consistent with the measurement from the cross spectrum. Our combined measurement is $b_v=0.33\pm0.03$, an $11\sigma$ measurement. We find a good fit of our model to the data in all cases. Finally, we use different ACT frequency combinations to explore foreground contamination, finding no evidence for foreground contamination in our velocity cross correlation. We compare to a similar measurement where $v^{\mathrm{kSZ}}$ is directly cross correlated with the large-scale galaxy field, and find signs of foreground contamination which is contained in the equal-redshift spectra.</description>

      <title>Creation of Viscous Dark Energy by the Hubble Flow: Comparison with SNe Ia Master Sample Binned Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a cosmological model featuring evolutionary dark energy, according to the idea that the creation of its constituents arises from the gravitational field of the expanding universe, whose non-equilibrium physics is described by a non-zero bulk viscosity coefficient. This physical scenario calls for two additional parameters with respect to the {\Lambda}CDM model, one of which is the equation of state parameter of the created dark energy. The model is constrained by the requirement that its deceleration parameter coincides with the one predicted by the {\Lambda}CDM model. Then, we construct the effective running Hubble constant, a theoretical function that corresponds to the ratio of the Hubble parameter in our model to the {\Lambda}CDM expansion rate. The model's theoretical predictions for the effective running Hubble constant are compared with the binned data of the Supernovae Ia Master Sample. The comparison is performed by a MCMC procedure for each bin, with three parameters left free to vary, while the particle creation rate is taken from a grid of values, each of which is fixed in the given MCMC run. The most important result emerging from this analysis is that the created dark energy constituent corresponds to an equation of state parameter with phantom character. Only if particle creation is removed do the dark energy constituents acquire a quintessence character. No matter the intrinsic nature of the constituents, their effective z-dependent equation of state parameter is, both with and without considering particle creation, entirely of phantom nature across the considered redshift range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bulk peculiar flows are commonplace in the universe, with many surveys reporting their presence on scales spanning between few hundred and several hundred Mpc. However, the sizes and the speeds of some of these bulk flows are well in excess of those theoretically anticipated, which has made them a potentially serious problem for the $\Lambda$CDM model. Having said that, essentially all the available theoretical studies are Newtonian, or quasi-Newtonian, in nature and both bypass a key feature of peculiar motions, namely the gravitational contribution of the \textit{peculiar flux}. To begin with, recall that bulk flows are matter in motion and that moving matter means nonzero energy flux. In relativity energy fluxes gravitate, but the gravitational input of the peculiar flux has been largely bypassed. As we will show here, when the flux contribution to the gravitational field is accounted for, linear peculiar velocities grow considerably faster than in the Newtonian/quasi-Newtonian studies. Therefore, general relativity, could naturally relax the current $\Lambda$CDM limits to accommodate the reported fast bulk flows.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints using Bayesian statistics and Deep Learning in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the evolution of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological models within the $f(Q)$ gravity framework, utilizing a specific $f(Q)$ formulation and a novel Hubble parameter $H(z)$ parameterization to probe the universe's accelerating expansion. A central aspect is the application of advanced machine learning techniques for cosmological parameter estimation, alongside comparisons with traditional Bayesian (MCMC) methods. We employ a hybrid Mixed Neural Network (MNN), which synergistically combines Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Mixture Density Networks (MDNs), to enhance the accuracy and robustness of parameter constraints. This MNN architecture is integrated into the CoLFI (Cosmological Likelihood-Free Inference) framework. CoLFI facilitates likelihood-free inference, a significant methodological advancement that provides an efficient and robust alternative, particularly for complex models with computationally expensive or intractable likelihood functions. Training efficiency for the neural networks is optimized by generating data via hyperellipsoid sampling. The $f(Q)$ model, constrained using these diverse approaches, successfully describes a universe transitioning from an early decelerating phase to the current accelerated expansion, with a computed transition redshift of $z_t = 0.60$. The physical and kinematic properties of the model are discussed, underscoring the efficacy of the MNN-CoLFI methodology and its consistency with MCMC results, while highlighting its advantages for obtaining observational constraints in $f(Q)$ gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding astrophysical and cosmological processes can be challenging due to their complexity and lack of intuitive analogies. To address this, we present \texttt{AstronomyCalc}, a Python package specifically designed to aid university-level teaching by integrating theoretical physics with practical astronomical data analysis methods. The package enables students to solve key cosmological calculations, such as the Friedmann equations, and explore various models while visualizing how parameter variations affect cosmic dynamics. It includes tools for generating synthetic astronomical data, such as Type Ia supernova measurements, and supports analysis of publicly available datasets, including Pantheon+ and the SPARC galaxy database. Simplified implementations of advanced algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains, allow students to engage with data analysis techniques used in contemporary research. Additionally, \texttt{AstronomyCalc} will be consistently updated with more tools and user-friendly Jupyter notebooks, making it a continually evolving educational resource for developing conceptual understanding and practical skills in astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Scalar-assisted magnetogenesis during the radiation-dominated epoch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism to generate primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) strong enough to explain the observed cosmic magnetic fields. We employ a scalar field charged under U(1) gauge symmetry with a non-trivial VEV to provide an effective mass term to the EM field and thus break its conformal invariance. The primordial magneto-genesis takes place in the radiation dominated (RD) epoch, after the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) phase. As a result, our mechanism is naturally free from the over-production of electric fields due to high conductivity in the RD epoch, and the baryon isocurvature problem which takes place only if magneto-genesis happens before the ESWB phase. In addition, we find that a significant amount of PMFs can be generated when the scalar field experiences a tachyonic phase. In this case, the scalar field is light and weakly coupled and has negligible energy density compared to the cold dark matter, hence the strong coupling problem and the back-reaction problem are also absent. Therefore, our model is free from the above-mentioned problems that frequently appear in other primordial magneto-genesis scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Simulation Based Inference Approach to the Dynamics of the MW-LMC System -- Validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The infall of the LMC into the Milky Way (MW) has generated dynamical disequilibrium throughout the MW. The interaction has displaced the MW's centre of mass, manifesting as an apparent 'reflex motion' in velocities of outer halo stars. Often, expensive high fidelity MW--LMC simulations are required to model these effects, though the range of model parameter spaces can be large and complex. We investigate the ability of lower fidelity, rigid MW-LMC simulations to reliably infer the model parameters of higher fidelity N-body and hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in MW--LMC simulations using a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) approach. We produce and release a set of 128,000 MW--LMC rigid potentials, with stellar haloes evolved to present-day, each adopting a unique combination of model parameters including the MW mass, the LMC mass and the dynamical friction strength. For these simulation parameters, we use SBI to find their posterior distributions. We find that our SBI framework trained on rigid MW--LMC simulations is able to correctly infer the true simulation LMC mass within a $1\sigma$ confidence interval from both N-body and cosmological simulations when knowledge of the induced MW reflex motion is provided as data. This motivates future applications of the presented SBI framework to observational data, which will help constrain both MW and LMC properties, as well as the dynamics of the MW's reflex motion.</description>

      <title>Strategy for identifying Vera C. Rubin Observatory kilonova candidates for targeted gravitational-wave searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the observation of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and the associated kilonova AT2017gfo, the next joint gravitational-wave/optical kilonova has been highly anticipated. Overlapping observations between the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the international gravitational-wave detector network are expected soon. Wide-field survey facilities, such as Rubin, can serve dual roles in gravitational-wave astronomy: conducting dedicated optical counterpart searches following gravitational-wave triggers and, through surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), providing opportunities for fortuitous kilonova discoveries during routine operations. We use simulations to develop a strategy for identifying kilonova candidates observed by Rubin and processed by the Fink broker. These candidates can be used as astrophysical triggers for a targeted gravitational-wave search. We simulate kilonovae light-curves for the first year of Rubin with the latest observing strategy for the Wide-Fast-Deep and the Deep Drilling Fields. Assuming a kilonova rate of 250 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, we find that Rubin brokers should observe $\sim 4$ kilonovae per year with at least one alert above a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 within the gravitational-wave detector horizon ($\sim 350$ Mpc). Most of these will be faint, and detected 1-2 days following the neutron star merger. Photometric and spectroscopic follow-up will be limited to large telescopes. Using archival data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and our proposed selection criteria, we estimate a minimum contamination of at least 30 events per month from other transients and variables, even under our strictest selection criteria. A deep gravitational-wave search targeting Rubin kilonova candidates may lead to the next multi-messenger discovery.</description>

      <title>CMB observables and reheat temperature as a window to models of inflation and freeze-in dark matter production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A systematic approach is presented for using CMB observables and reheating temperature for discriminating between various models of inflation and certain freeze-in dark matter scenarios. It is applied to several classes of $\alpha$-attractor models as an illustrative example. In the first step, all independent parameters of the inflationary potential are expressed in terms of the CMB observables (the three parameters - by the scalar spectral index $n_s$, scalar amplitude $A_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar amplitude ratio $r$). For a standard reheating mechanism characterized by the inflaton equation of state parameter $w$ and its effective dissipation rate $\Gamma$ the reheating temperature is uniquely fixed in terms of the CMB observables measured for some pivot scale $k_*$. There are striking consequences of this fact. The model independent bounds on the reheating temperature, the BBN lower bound and the upper bound of the order of the GUT/Planck scale, translate themselves for each class of models into very narrow ranges of the allowed values of the spectral index $n_s(k_*)$, providing their strong tests by the present and future CMB data. The recent tension between Planck and DESI-ACT results has strong impact on our conclusions. Furthermore, given a class of inflaton models satisfying those tests, the reheating temperature is an interesting portal to link the CMB observables to the particle physics scenarios that are sensitive to it. As an example, non-thermal dark matter (DM) production mechanisms are discussed. One obtains then a consistency check between theories of inflation and DM production. If the future precision of the CMB data will constrain the reheating temperature beyond the model independent bounds, further constraints on the DM production will follow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark energy perturbations are expected to modify the evolution of cosmological perturbations, producing different observational effects. We show that these effects can be encoded in a momentum, space and polarization dependent effective matter-gravity coupling. For scalar perturbations the effective gravitational coupling can be locally negative, in regions with local dark energy under-densities. For adiabatic perturbations the effective gravitational coupling for scalar perturbations can be negative for phantom dark energy, providing an explanation for the observed structure suppression at low redshift, consistent with other independent evidences of evolving dark energy.</description>
