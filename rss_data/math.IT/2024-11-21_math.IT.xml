      <title>An Experimental Multi-Band Channel Characterization in the Upper Mid-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following paper provides a multi-band channel measurement analysis on the frequency range (FR)3. This study focuses on the FR3 low frequencies 6.5 GHz and 8.75 GHz with a setup tailored to the context of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), where the data are collected with and without the presence of a target. A method based on multiple signal classification (MUSIC) is used to refine the delays of the channel impulse response estimates. The results reveal that the channel at the lower frequency 6.5 GHz has additional distinguishable multipath components in the presence of the target, while the one associated with the higher frequency 8.75 GHz has more blockage. The set of results reported in this paper serves as a benchmark for future multi-band studies in the FR3 spectrum.</description>

      <title>NCAirFL: CSI-Free Over-the-Air Federated Learning Based on Non-Coherent Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air federated learning (FL), i.e., AirFL, leverages computing primitively over multiple access channels. A long-standing challenge in AirFL is to achieve coherent signal alignment without relying on expensive channel estimation and feedback. This paper proposes NCAirFL, a CSI-free AirFL scheme based on unbiased non-coherent detection at the edge server. By exploiting binary dithering and a long-term memory based error-compensation mechanism, NCAirFL achieves a convergence rate of order $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ in terms of the average square norm of the gradient for general non-convex and smooth objectives, where $T$ is the number of communication rounds. Experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of NCAirFL compared to vanilla FL with ideal communications and to coherent transmission-based benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Communication and Tracking using Fused Bistatic Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a bistatic sensing-assisted beam tracking method for simultaneous communication and tracking of user vehicles navigating arbitrary-shaped road trajectories. Prior work on simultaneous communication and tracking assumes a colocated radar receiver at the transmitter for sensing measurements using the reflected Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) signals in the mmWave band. Full isolation between transmitter and receiver is required here to avoid self-interference. We consider the bistatic setting where the sensing receivers are not colocated and can be realized in practice using traditional half-duplex transmit or receive nodes. First, we process the echoes reflected from the vehicle at multiple multi-antenna nodes at various locations, facilitating estimation of the vehicle's current position. Then, we propose selection criteria for the estimates and a maximum likelihood (ML) fusion scheme to fuse these selected estimates based on the estimated error covariance matrices of these measurements. This fusion scheme is important in bistatic and multistatic settings as the localization error depends significantly on the geometry of the transmitter, target, and receiver locations. Finally, we predict the vehicle's next location using a simple kinematic equation-based model. Through extensive simulation, we study the average spectral efficiency of communication with a moving user using the proposed simultaneous communication and tracking scheme. The proposed fusion-based scheme achieves almost the same average spectral efficiency as an ideal scheme that knows the exact trajectory. We also show that the proposed scheme can be easily extended to systems with Hybrid Digital-Analog architectures and performs similarly even in these systems.</description>

      <title>Geometry-informed Channel Statistics Prediction Based upon Uncalibrated Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) of wireless environments can be utilized to predict the propagation channel and reduce the overhead of required to estimate the channel statistics. However, direct channel prediction requires data-intensive calibration of the DT to capture the environment properties relevant for propagation of electromagnetic signals. We introduce a framework that starts from a satellite image of the environment to produce an uncalibrated DT, which has no or imprecise information about the materials and their electromagnetic properties. The key idea is to use the uncalibrated DT to implicitly provide a geometric prior for the environment. This is utilized to inform a Gaussian process (GP), which permits the use of few channel measurements to attain an accurate prediction of the channel statistics. Additionally, the framework is able to quantify the uncertainty in channel statistics prediction and select rate in ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) that complies with statistical guarantees. The efficacy of the proposed geometry-informed GP is validated using experimental data obtained through a measurement campaign. Furthermore, the proposed prediction framework is shown to provide significant improvements compared to the benchmarks where i) direct channel statistics prediction is obtained using an uncalibrated DT and (ii) the GP predicts channel statistics using information about the location.</description>

      <title>The weight hierarchy of decreasing norm-trace codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Generalized Hamming weights and their relative version, which generalize the minimum distance of a linear code, are relevant to numerous applications, including coding on the wire-tap channel of type II, $t$-resilient functions, bounding the cardinality of the output in list decoding algorithms, ramp secret sharing schemes, and quantum error correction. The generalized Hamming weights have been determined for some families of codes, including Cartesian codes and Hermitian one-point codes. In this paper, we determine the generalized Hamming weights of decreasing norm-trace codes, which are linear codes defined by evaluating monomials that are closed under divisibility on the rational points of the extended norm-trace curve given by $x^{u} = y^{q^{s - 1}} + y^{q^{s - 2}} + \cdots + y$ over the finite field of cardinality $q^s$, where $u$ is a positive divisor of $\frac{q^s - 1}{q - 1}$. As a particular case, we obtain the weight hierarchy of one-point norm-trace codes and recover the result of Barbero and Munuera (2001) giving the weight hierarchy of one-point Hermitian codes. We also study the relative generalized Hamming weights for these codes and use them to construct impure quantum codes with excellent parameters.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa, Reed-Muller codes and Shannon capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1948, Shannon used a probabilistic argument to show the existence of codes achieving a maximal rate defined by the channel capacity. In 1954, Muller and Reed introduced a simple deterministic code construction, based on polynomial evaluations, conjectured shortly after to achieve capacity. The conjecture led to decades of activity involving various areas of mathematics and the recent settlement by [AS23] using flower set boosting. In this paper, we provide an alternative proof of the weak form of the capacity result, i.e., that RM codes have a vanishing local error at any rate below capacity. Our proof relies on the recent Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture's proof [GGMT23] and an entropy extraction approach similar to [AY19]. Further, a new additive combinatorics conjecture is put forward which would imply the stronger result with vanishing global error. We expect the latter conjecture to be more directly relevant to coding applications.</description>

Abstract: We propose an information-theoretic framework to measure narratives, providing a formalism to understand pivotal moments, cliffhangers, and plot twists. This approach offers creatives and AI researchers tools to analyse and benchmark human- and AI-created stories. We illustrate our method in TV shows, showing its ability to quantify narrative complexity and emotional dynamics across genres. We discuss applications in media and in human-in-the-loop generative AI storytelling.</description>

      <title>On large Sidon sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Sidon set $M$ is a subset of $\mathbb{F}_2^t$ such that the sum of four distinct elements of $M$ is never 0. The goal is to find Sidon sets of large size. In this note we show that the graphs of almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions with high linearity can be used to construct large Sidon sets. Thanks to recently constructed APN functions $\mathbb{F}_2^8\to \mathbb{F}_2^8$ with high linearity, we can construct Sidon sets of size 192 in $\mathbb{F}_2^{15}$, where the largest sets so far had size 152. Using the inverse and the Dobbertin function also gives larger Sidon sets as previously known. Moreover, we improve the upper bound for the linearity of arbitrary APN functions.</description>

      <title>Strong XOR Lemma for Information Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any $\{0,1\}$-valued function $f$, its \emph{$n$-folded XOR} is the function $f^{\oplus n}$ where $f^{\oplus n}(X_1, \ldots, X_n) = f(X_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus f(X_n)$. Given a procedure for computing the function $f$, one can apply a ``naive" approach to compute $f^{\oplus n}$ by computing each $f(X_i)$ independently, followed by XORing the outputs. This approach uses $n$ times the resources required for computing $f$.
  In this paper, we prove a strong XOR lemma for \emph{information complexity} in the two-player randomized communication model: if computing $f$ with an error probability of $O(n^{-1})$ requires revealing $I$ bits of information about the players' inputs, then computing $f^{\oplus n}$ with a constant error requires revealing $\Omega(n) \cdot (I - 1 - o_n(1))$ bits of information about the players' inputs. Our result demonstrates that the naive protocol for computing $f^{\oplus n}$ is both information-theoretically optimal and asymptotically tight in error trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Incremental Label Distribution Learning with Scalable Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Label Distribution Learning (LDL) is an effective approach for handling label ambiguity, as it can analyze all labels at once and indicate the extent to which each label describes a given sample. Most existing LDL methods consider the number of labels to be static. However, in various LDL-specific contexts (e.g., disease diagnosis), the label count grows over time (such as the discovery of new diseases), a factor that existing methods overlook. Learning samples with new labels directly means learning all labels at once, thus wasting more time on the old labels and even risking overfitting the old labels. At the same time, learning new labels by the LDL model means reconstructing the inter-label relationships. How to make use of constructed relationships is also a crucial challenge. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Incremental Label Distribution Learning (ILDL), analyze its key issues regarding training samples and inter-label relationships, and propose Scalable Graph Label Distribution Learning (SGLDL) as a practical framework for implementing ILDL. Specifically, in SGLDL, we develop a New-label-aware Gradient Compensation Loss to speed up the learning of new labels and represent inter-label relationships as a graph to reduce the time required to reconstruct inter-label relationships. Experimental results on the classical LDL dataset show the clear advantages of unique algorithms and illustrate the importance of a dedicated design for the ILDL problem.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Physically-Consistent Modeling of Reconfigurable Electromagnetic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable electromagnetic structures (REMSs), such as reconfigurable reflectarrays (RRAs) or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), hold significant potential to improve wireless communication and sensing systems. Even though several REMS modeling approaches have been proposed in recent years, the literature lacks models that are both computationally efficient and physically consistent. As a result, algorithms that control the reconfigurable elements of REMSs (e.g., the phase shifts of an RIS) are often built on simplistic models that are inaccurate. To enable physically accurate REMS-parameter tuning, we present a new framework for efficient and physically consistent modeling of general REMSs. Our modeling method combines a circuit-theoretic approach with a new formalism that describes a REMS's interaction with the electromagnetic (EM) waves in its far-field region. Our modeling method enables efficient computation of the entire far-field radiation pattern for arbitrary configurations of the REMS reconfigurable elements once a single full-wave EM simulation of the non-reconfigurable parts of the REMS has been performed. The predictions made by the proposed framework align with the physical laws of classical electrodynamics and model effects caused by inter-antenna coupling, non-reciprocal materials, polarization, ohmic losses, matching losses, influence of metallic housings, noise from low-noise amplifiers, and noise arising in or received by antennas. In order to validate the efficiency and accuracy of our modeling approach, we (i) compare our modeling method to EM simulations and (ii) conduct a case study involving a planar RRA that enables simultaneous multiuser beam- and null-forming using a new, computationally efficient, and physically accurate parameter tuning algorithm.</description>

      <title>Degenerate quantum erasure decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Erasures are the primary type of errors in physical systems dominated by leakage errors. While quantum error correction (QEC) using stabilizer codes can combat these error, the question of achieving near-capacity performance with explicit codes and efficient decoders remains a challenge. Quantum decoding is a classical computational problem that decides what the recovery operation should be based on the measured syndromes. For QEC, using an accurate decoder with the shortest possible runtime will minimize the degradation of quantum information while awaiting the decoder's decision. We examine the quantum erasure decoding problem for general stabilizer codes and present decoders that not only run in linear-time but are also accurate. We achieve this by exploiting the symmetry of degenerate errors. Numerical evaluations show near maximum-likelihood decoding for various codes, achieving capacity performance with topological codes and near-capacity performance with non-topological codes. We furthermore explore the potential of our decoders to handle other error models, such as mixed erasure and depolarizing errors, and also local deletion errors via concatenation with permutation invariant codes.</description>

      <title>Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Data Reconstruction Enhancement in Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) are proposed to enhance the data transmission and reconstruction over wireless channels. The underlying mechanism of DDPM is to decompose the data generation process over the so-called "denoising" steps. Inspired by this, the key idea is to leverage the generative prior of diffusion models in learning a "noisy-to-clean" transformation of the information signal to help enhance data reconstruction. The proposed scheme could be beneficial for communication scenarios in which a prior knowledge of the information content is available, e.g., in multimedia transmission. Hence, instead of employing complicated channel codes that reduce the information rate, one can exploit diffusion priors for reliable data reconstruction, especially under extreme channel conditions due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or hardware-impaired communications. The proposed DDPM-assisted receiver is tailored for the scenario of wireless image transmission using MNIST dataset. Our numerical results highlight the reconstruction performance of our scheme compared to the conventional digital communication, as well as the deep neural network (DNN)-based benchmark. It is also shown that more than 10 dB improvement in the reconstruction could be achieved in low SNR regimes, without the need to reduce the information rate for error correction.</description>

      <title>Soft Demapping of Spherical Codes from Cartesian Powers of PAM Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For applications in concatenated coding for optical communications systems, we examine soft-demapping of short spherical codes constructed as constant-energy shells of the Cartesian power of pulse amplitude modulation constellations. These are unions of permutation codes having the same average power. We construct a list decoder for permutation codes by adapting Murty's algorithm, which is then used to determine mutual information curves for these permutation codes. In the process, we discover a straightforward expression for determining the likelihood of large subcodes of permutation codes called orbits. We introduce a simple process, called orbit demapping, that allows us to extract soft information from noisy permutation codewords. In a sample communication system with probabilistic amplitude shaping protected by a standard low-density parity-check code that employs short permutation codes, we demonstrate that orbit demapping provides a gain of about 0.3 dB in signal-to-noise ratio compared to the traditional symbol-by-symbol demapping. By using spherical codes composed of unions of permutation codes, we can increase the input entropy compared to using permutation codes alone. In one scheme, we consider a union of a small number of permutation codes. In this case, orbit demapping provides about 0.2 dB gain compared to the traditional method. In another scheme, we use all possible permutations to form a spherical code that exhibits a computationally feasible trellis representation. The soft information obtained using the BCJR algorithm outperforms the traditional symbol-by-symbol method by 0.1 dB. Using the spherical codes containing all possible permutation codes of the same average power and the BCJR algorithm, a gain of 0.5 dB is observed. Comparison of the achievable information rates of bit-metric decoding verifies the observed gains.</description>

      <title>Random Reed-Solomon Codes and Random Linear Codes are Locally Equivalent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02238v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an equivalence between two important random ensembles of linear codes: random linear codes (RLCs) and random Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. Specifically, we show that these models exhibit identical behavior with respect to key combinatorial properties, such as list-decodability and list-recoverability, when the alphabet size is sufficiently large.
  We introduce monotone-decreasing local coordinate-wise linear (LCL) properties, a new class of properties designed for studying the large alphabet regime. This class encompasses list-decodability, list-recoverability, and their average-weight variants. We develop a framework to analyze these properties and prove a threshold theorem for RLCs. Specifically, we identify a threshold rate $ R_P $ for any LCL property $P$, where RLCs are likely to satisfy $P$ when $ R &lt; R_P $ and unlikely to do so when $ R &gt; R_P $. We extend this threshold theorem to random RS codes and prove that they share the same threshold $ R_P $, thereby establishing the equivalence between the two ensembles and enabling unified analysis of list-recoverability and related properties.
  Applying our framework, we compute the threshold rate for list-decodability, proving that both random RS codes and RLCs achieve the generalized Singleton bound. This recovers recent results of Alrabiah, Guruswami, and Li (2023) via elementary methods. Additionally, we provide an upper bound on the list-recoverability threshold and conjecture that this bound is tight. Our approach suggests a plausible pathway for proving this conjecture and thus pinpointing the list-recoverability parameters of both models.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Received Adaptive Spatial Modulation for Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel wireless transmission scheme, as named the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted received adaptive spatial modulation (RASM) scheme, is proposed in this paper. In this scheme, the adaptive spatial modulation (ASM)-based antennas selection works at the receiver by employing the characteristics of the RIS in each time slot, where the signal-to-noise ratio at specific selected antennas can be further enhanced with near few powers. Besides for the bits from constellation symbols, the extra bits can be mapped into the indices of receive antenna combinations and conveyed to the receiver through the ASM-based antenna-combination selection, thus providing higher spectral efficiency. To explicitly present the RASM scheme, the analytical performance of bit error rate of it is discussed in this paper. As a trade-off selection, the proposed scheme shows higher spectral efficiency and remains the satisfactory error performance. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the better performance and exhibit more potential to apply in practical wireless communication.</description>

      <title>On the Zero-Error Capacity of Semantic Channels with Input and Output Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the zero-error capacity of channels with memory. Motivated by the nuanced requirements of semantic communication that incorporate memory, we advance the classical enlightened dictator channel by introducing a new category known as the semantic channel. We analyze the zero-error capacity of the semantic channel using a comprehensive framework that accommodates multiple input and output memories. Our approach reveals a more sophisticated and detailed model compared to the classical memory channels, highlighting the impact of memory on achieving error-free communication.</description>

      <title>A New Twist on Low-Complexity Digital Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel low-complexity digital backpropagation (DBP) method, with the goal of optimizing the trade-off between backpropagation accuracy and complexity. The method combines a split step Fourier method (SSFM)-like structure with a simplifed logarithmic perturbation method to obtain a high accuracy with a small number of DBP steps. Subband processing and asymmetric steps with optimized splitting ratio are also employed to further reduce the number of steps required to achieve a prescribed performance. The first part of the manuscript is dedicated to the derivation of a simplified logaritmic-perturbation model for the propagation of signal in an optical fiber, which serves for the development of the proposed coupled-band enhanced split step Fourier method (CB-ESSFM) and for the analytical calculation of the model coefficients. Next, the manuscript presents a DSP algorithm for the implementation of DBP based on a discrete-time version of the model and an overlap-and-save processing strategy. Practical approaches for the optimization of the coefficients used in the algorithm and of the splitting ratio of the asymmetric steps are also discussed. A detailed analysis of the computational complexity is presented. Finally, the performance and complexity of the proposed DBP method are investigated through simulations. In a five-channel 100 GHz-spaced wavelength division multiplexing system over a 15x80 km single-mode-fiber link, the proposed CB-ESSFM achieves a gain of about 1dB over simple dispersion compensation with only 15 steps (corresponding to 681 real multiplications per 2D symbol), with an improvement of 0.9 dB over conventional SSFM and almost 0.4dB over our previously proposed ESSFM. Significant gains and improvements are obtained also at lower complexity. A similar analysis is performed also for longer links, confirming the good performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Receiver-Centric Generative Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates semantic communications between a transmitter and a receiver, where original data, such as videos of interest to the receiver, is stored at the transmitter. Although significant process has been made in semantic communications, a fundamental design problem is that the semantic information is extracted based on certain criteria at the transmitter alone, without considering the receiver's specific information needs. As a result, critical information of primary concern to the receiver may be lost. In such cases, the semantic transmission becomes meaningless to the receiver, as all received information is irrelevant to its interests. To solve this problem, this paper presents a receiver-centric generative semantic communication system, where each transmission is initialized by the receiver. Specifically, the receiver first sends its request for the desired semantic information to the transmitter at the start of each transmission. Then, the transmitter extracts the required semantic information accordingly. A key challenge is how the transmitter understands the receiver's requests for semantic information and extracts the required semantic information in a reasonable and robust manner. We address this challenge by designing a well-structured framework and leveraging off-the-shelf generative AI products, such as GPT-4, along with several specialized tools for detection and estimation. Evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed new semantic communication system.</description>

      <title>Signal Processing and Learning for Next Generation Multiple Access in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless communication systems to date primarily rely on the orthogonality of resources to facilitate the design and implementation, from user access to data transmission. Emerging applications and scenarios in the sixth generation (6G) wireless systems will require massive connectivity and transmission of a deluge of data, which calls for more flexibility in the design concept that goes beyond orthogonality. Furthermore, recent advances in signal processing and learning, e.g., deep learning, provide promising approaches to deal with complex and previously intractable problems. This article provides an overview of research efforts to date in the field of signal processing and learning for next-generation multiple access, with an emphasis on massive random access and non-orthogonal multiple access. The promising interplay with new technologies and the challenges in learning-based NGMA are discussed.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Integrated Sensing and Communication with Intelligent Metasurfaces: Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of technologies demanding high data rates and precise sensing, such as autonomous vehicles and IoT devices, has driven the popularity of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in recent years. ISAC provides a framework for communication and sensing, where both functionalities are performed simultaneously or in a coordinated manner. There are two levels of integration in ISAC: radio-communications coexistence (RCC), where communication and radar systems use distinct hardware, waveforms, and signal processing but share the spectrum; and dual-function radar-communications (DFRC), where communication and sensing share the same hardware, waveform, and signal processing. At the architectural level, intelligent metasurfaces are a key enabler for the sixth-generation (6G) of wireless communication due to their ability to control the propagation environment efficiently. With the potential to enhance communication and sensing performance, numerous studies have explored the gains of metasurfaces for ISAC. Moreover, certain ISAC frameworks address limitations associated with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for communication. Thus, integrating ISAC with metasurfaces enhances both technologies. This survey reviews the literature on metasurface-assisted ISAC, detailing challenges and opportunities. To provide a comprehensive overview, we begin with fundamentals of ISAC and metasurfaces. The paper summarizes state-of-the-art studies on metasurface-assisted ISAC, focusing on metasurfaces as separate entities between the transmitter and receiver (known as RIS) and emphasizing RCC and DFRC. We also review work on holographic ISAC, where metasurfaces are part of the transmitter and receiver. For each category, lessons learned, challenges, opportunities, and research directions are highlighted.</description>

      <title>The revised boomerang connectivity tables and their connection to the Difference Distribution Table</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that functions over finite fields play a crucial role in designing substitution boxes (S-boxes) in modern block ciphers. In order to analyze the security of an S-box, recently, three new tables have been introduced: the Extended Boomerang Connectivity Table (EBCT), the Lower Boomerang Connectivity Table (LBCT), and the Upper Boomerang Connectivity Table (UBCT). In fact, these tables offer improved methods over the usual Boomerang Connectivity Table (BCT) for analyzing the security of S-boxes against boomerang-style attacks. Here, we put in context these new EBCT, LBCT, and UBCT concepts by connecting them to the DDT for a differentially $\delta$-uniform function and also determine the EBCT, LBCT, and UBCT entries of three classes of differentially $4$-uniform power permutations, namely, Gold, Kasami and Bracken-Leander. We also determine the Double Boomerang Connectivity Table (DBCT) entries of the Gold function. As byproducts of our approach, we obtain some previously published results quite easily.</description>
