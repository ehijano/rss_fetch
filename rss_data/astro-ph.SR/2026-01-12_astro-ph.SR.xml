      <title>Overestimated Pressure Broadening Misleads Model Spectra in Cool M Dwarf Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Available one-dimensional stellar models fail to reproduce the observed spectrum of the ultracool M dwarf TRAPPIST-1. In particular, current models predict strong iron hydride (FeH) absorption due to the Wing-Ford bands at 0.99$\mu$m, yet this spectral feature is only weakly present in TRAPPIST-1 and other mid-to-late M dwarf stars. Additionally, the shape of the continuum between the water bands in the near-infrared does not match between models and observations. Here, we show that assumptions about pressure broadening, specifically van der Waals broadening, have a dramatic effect on modeled broadband spectral features. We use Merged Parallelized Simplified-ATLAS to generate synthetic spectra over a range of van der Waals broadening strengths, adopting 1D PHOENIX temperature-pressure structures. We find that minimal broadening best matches the observed FeH profile at 0.99$\mu$m and in the pseudocontinuum between the large water bands. These results suggest that broadening prescriptions derived for Sun-like stars are not valid for lower-mass stars and that pressure broadening for molecular lines in cool stellar atmospheres must be reevaluated. Refining pressure broadening treatments will improve the accuracy of M dwarf spectral models, enabling more reliable determinations of stellar properties and atmospheric compositions of planets orbiting M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The fate of the failed supernova candidate M31-2014-DS1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fate of massive stars above 20M$_{\odot}$ remains uncertain. Debate persists about whether they die as supernovae (SNe), or if they collapse directly into black holes (BHs) with little or no optical outburst -- so-called ``failed supernovae''. The source M31-2014-DS1 experienced an optical outburst in 2014 and has remained faint at visual wavelengths since then. Due to its persistent faintness, it has been proposed as a failed SN candidate. We present new observations of this candidate obtained using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Submillimeter Array (SMA), and Chandra. The JWST observations demonstrate that a luminous mid-infrared source persists at the same location a decade after the star faded at visual wavelengths. We model its current spectral energy distribution (SED) as a dust-enshrouded star. No X-ray emission is detected, disfavoring the hypothesis that the late-time luminosity is powered by accretion onto a BH. We find that the remaining source is highly obscured by an asymmetric distribution of circumstellar dust, making it difficult to quantify its physical properties using spherically symmetric radiative transfer codes. The dust geometry requires that the inferred bolometric luminosity is only a lower limit, as a significant fraction of the central source's radiation may escape without being reprocessed by dust. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of failed SN models and consider the potential overlap with signatures expected from a stellar merger, which also seems to provide a plausible explanation of this source.</description>

      <title>On the gravitational stratification of multi-fluid-multi-species plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The solar atmosphere is gravitationally stratified and consists of several layers at temperatures different by orders of magnitude. Consequently, the solar atmospheric plasma changes from weakly ionized in the photosphere, partially ionized in the chromosphere, to eventually fully ionized in the corona. However, it is still not trivial to integrate ionization and recombination processes into multi-fluid solar plasma models with gravitational stratification. Aims. We intend to provide a method for constructing multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratification that satisfies ionization equilibrium and hydrostatic equilibrium at the same time, avoiding causing non-physical disturbances and numerical instability due to initial in-equilibria. Methods. We assume that collisional interactions between fluids are sufficient for coupling all fluids when there is no high-frequency external driving force imposed. Ionization fractions can be (I) calculated assuming ionization in statistical equilibrium at any given temperature, or (II) extracted from other atmospheric models. A simple numerical integration routine is then designed and used to construct multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratifications. Results. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present numerical integration routine can be in hydrostatic equilibrium with any given ionization fractions of multi-species plasmas. Meanwhile, without any dynamic driving force, fluid decoupling appears in the transition region of the constructed stratification, while the total velocity of all fluids remains zero. Conclusions. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present routine can be used in multi-fluid-multi-species models to study specific dynamics without being affected by initial in-equilibria.</description>

      <title>Featureless stars: Flux Calibration for Extremely Large Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrophotometric flux calibration of recent spectroscopic surveys has reached a limiting systematic precision of approximately 1-3 percent, and is often biased near the wavelengths associated with H I Balmer absorption. As we prepare for the next generation of imaging and spectroscopic surveys, and high-precision cosmology experiments, we must find a way to address this systematic. Towards this goal, we have identified a global network of 29 bright (G &lt; 17.5) featureless white dwarf stars that have a spectral energy distribution consistent with an almost pure blackbody form over the entire optical and near-infrared wavelength range. Based on this sample, we have computed the systematic uncertainty and AB magnitude offsets associated with Gaia, SDSS, SMSS, PanSTARRS, DES, and 2MASS, and we have also checked the consistency of our objects with both GALEX and WISE. The magnitude range of the featureless stars reported here are ideally suited to observations taken with the forthcoming generation of extremely large telescopes, as well as calibrating the survey data acquired by the Rubin, Euclid and Roman observatories. Finally, all of the high-precision spectrophotometric standard stars reported here have been included in the latest release of the PypeIt data reduction pipeline.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Properties of MHD Waves in the Expanding Solar Wind for a Parker Spiral Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we quantify the effects of solar wind expansion on the dispersive properties of the three normal modes of ideal MHD using the Expanding Box Model, under a background magnetic field that follows the Parker spiral geometry. From the linearized MHD-EBM equations, we construct the dispersion tensor and derive analytical expressions for the eigenfrequencies $\omega(k,R)$, magnetic compressibility $C_B$, and the ratio of the parallel electric field to the perpendicular magnetic field $|\delta E_\parallel|/|\delta B_\perp|$ of the magnetosonic modes to quantify how radial solar wind expansion reshapes the character of compressive fluctuations in the solar wind. Magnetic compressibility increases with heliocentric distance, and this trend shows a better alignment with in-situ observations when expansion is included from the MHD-EBM framework. $C_B$ shows a well-defined minimum at small radii and then increases linearly with distance, which naturally reproduces the observed transition from Alfv\'enic to compressive fluctuations between $\sim$0.3-1 AU. The ratio $|\delta E_\parallel|/|\delta B_\perp|$ reveals opposite behaviors for the fast and slow modes: while the fast mode becomes more electrostatic with increasing distance, the slow mode evolves to a more magnetically dominated character. Expansion reduces the growth of their electromagnetic/compressive balance at large radii. Our results demonstrate that solar wind expansion actively redistributes energy between magnetically compressive modes and purely transverse fluctuations with respect to the background magnetic field, playing a major role in shaping the radial evolution of wave dynamics throughout the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Paving the Road to the Habitable Worlds Observatory with High-Resolution Imaging I: New and Archival Speckle Observations of Potential HWO Target Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key goals of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is to directly image about 25 potentially habitable exoplanets and determine their properties. This challenge will require a large survey of nearby, bright stars -- ~100 according to the Astro2020 Decadel Survey. To ensure the success of the mission and to help guide design decisions, the stellar multiplicity of the target stars must be well-understood. To this end, we present optical speckle imaging of stars in the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) provisional HWO star list, which is currently the Tier 1 target list for the HWO Target Stars and Systems Sub-Working Group. We obtained new observations using `Alopeke and Zorro at Gemini Observatory and queried the Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program Archive for archival observations, resulting in speckle imaging data for 80 of the 164 stars. We confirmed one candidate companion detected previously by Gaia (HD 90089) and obtained an ambiguous detection of a known companion (HD 212330). To examine our sensitivity to companions, we simulated stellar companions down to ~0.1 $M_{\odot}$ for each target and found that 75%-85% would be detected in our speckle images; the remaining simulated companions are either too faint or too close-in, and will require follow-up using other methods such as long-term spectroscopic measurements and space-based techniques. This work represents a first step towards surveying potential HWO targets for close-in stellar companions and helping to inform the target selection process for the HWO direct-imaging survey, bringing us closer towards the discovery of potential habitable worlds.</description>

      <title>Structural Tilting and Depth-Dependent Behavior of Equatorial Rossby Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, solar equatorial Rossby waves have been unambiguously identified and are considered potential diagnostics of solar interior dynamics. We investigate their inclined structure and temporal evolution in the solar interior across multiple depths using approximately 14.5 yr of ring-diagram (RD) and time-distance (TD) helioseismology data from SDO/HMI. Normalized phase differences and cross power are computed from filtered spherical harmonic coefficients of radial vorticity to probe the structural tilt and power of Rossby waves. We find a systematic and robust depth-dependent phase behavior that shows no clear significant correlation with the solar cycle, while the depth-dependent cross power exhibits a positive correlation with the solar cycle for both datasets. Our results show that deeper depths lead in phase over shallower ones, with increasing negative phases with depth. We infer that Rossby waves exhibit a retrograde tilt relative to the Sun's rotation that is stable throughout the solar cycle. Analogous small tilts have been noted in planetary atmospheres and in magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the Sun, indicating that this behavior is not uncommon in rotating, stratified bodies and has implications for angular momentum and energy transport in the solar interior.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Solar Flare and Sunspots on 4th Jan 2025 and Their Effects on Space Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are among the most energetic phenomena in the solar system, often impacting space weather and terrestrial technologies. In this study, we utilize SunPy, an open-source Python library for solar physics, to analyze solar active regions and their correlation with flare and CME events observed on 4th January 2025. Data from GOES, SDO (AIA and HMI), Solar Oribter (STIX), e-CALLISTO, Aditya L1 (SUIT), and SOHO are processed to track flare intensity, active region evolution, shock wave and CME dynamics. The analyzed flare is identified as an X1.8-class event, and our study highlights key magnetic precursors that led to it. This work enhances understanding of solar eruption precursors and supports future predictive models for space weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Impact of Newly Measured Nuclear Reaction Rates on $^{26}$Al Ejected Yields from Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last three years, the rates of all the main nuclear reactions involving the destruction and production of $^{26}$Al in stars ($^{26}$Al(n, p)$^{26}$Mg, $^{26}$Al(n, $\alpha$)$^{23}$Na, $^{26}$Al(p, $\gamma$)$^{27}$Si and $^{25}$Mg(p, $\gamma$)$^{26}$Al) have been re-evaluated thanks to new high-precision experimental measurements of their cross sections at energies of astrophysical interest, considerably reducing the uncertainties in the nuclear physics affecting their nucleosynthesis. We computed the nucleosynthetic yields ejected by the explosion of a high-mass star (20 Msun, Z = 0.0134) using the FRANEC stellar code, considering two explosion energies, 1.2 10$^{51}$ erg and 3 10$^{51}$ erg. We quantify the change in the ejected amount of $^{26}$Al and other key species that is predicted when the new rate selection is adopted instead of the reaction rates from the STARLIB nuclear library. Additionally, the ratio of our ejected yields of 26Al to those of 14 other short-lived radionuclides (36Cl, 41Ca, 53Mn, 60Fe, 92Nb, 97Tc, 98Tc, 107Pd, 126Sn, 129I, 36Cs, 146Sm, 182Hf, 205Pb) are compared to early solar system isotopic ratios, inferred from meteorite measurements. The total ejected 26Al yields vary by a factor of ~3 when adopting the new rates or the STARLIB rates. Additionally, the new nuclear reaction rates also impact the predicted abundances of short-lived radionuclides in the early solar system relative to $^{26}$Al. However, it is not possible to reproduce all the short-lived radionuclide isotopic ratios with our massive star model alone, unless a second stellar source could be invoked, which must have been active in polluting the pristine solar nebula at a similar time of a core-collapse supernova.</description>

      <title>Impact of newly measured 26Al(n, p)26Mg and 26Al(n, {\alpha})23Na reaction rates on the nucleosynthesis of 26Al in stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic production of the short-lived radioactive nuclide 26Al is crucial for our understanding of the evolution of stars and galaxies. However, simulations of the stellar sites producing 26Al are still weakened by significant nuclear uncertainties. We re-evaluate the 26Al(n, p)26Mg, and 26Al(n, {\alpha})23Na ground state reactivities from 0.01 GK to 10 GK, based on the recent n TOF measurement combined with theoretical predictions and a previous measurement at higher energies, and test their impact on stellar nucleosynthesis. We computed the nucleosynthesis of low- and high-mass stars using the Monash nucleosynthesis code, the NuGrid mppnp code, and the FUNS stellar evolutionary code. Our low-mass stellar models cover the 2-3 Msun mass range with metallicities between Z = 0.01 and 0.02, their predicted 26Al/27Al ratios are compared to 62 meteoritic SiC grains. For high-mass stars, we test our reactivities on two 15 Msun models with Z = 0.006 and 0.02. The new reactivities allow low-mass AGB stars to reproduce the full range of 26Al/27Al ratios measured in SiC grains. The final 26Al abundance in high-mass stars, at the point of highest production, varies by a factor of 2.4 when adopting the upper, or lower limit of our rates. However, stellar uncertainties still play an important role in both mass regimes. The new reactivities visibly impact both low- and high-mass stars nucleosynthesis and allow a general improvement in the comparison between stardust SiC grains and low-mass star models. Concerning explosive nucleosynthesis, an improvement of the current uncertainties between T9~0.3 and 2.5 is needed for future studies.</description>

      <title>Energy Bounds from Relative Magnetic Helicity in Spherical Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative magnetic helicity is commonly used in solar physics to avoid the well known gauge ambiguity of standard magnetic helicity in magnetically open domains. But its physical interpretation is difficult owing to the invocation of a reference field. For the specific case of spherical shell domains (with potential reference field), relative helicity may be written intrinsically in terms of the magnetic field alone, without the need to calculate the reference field or its vector potential. We use this intrinsic expression to prove that non-zero relative helicity implies lower bounds for both magnetic energy and free magnetic energy, generalizing the important Arnol'd inequality known for closed-field magnetic helicity. Further, we derive a stronger energy bound by spatially decomposing the relative helicity over a magnetic partition of the domain to obtain a new ideal invariant which we call unsigned helicity. The bounds are illustrated with analytical linear force-free fields (that maximize relative helicity for given boundary conditions) as well as a non-potential data-driven model of the solar corona. These bounds confirm that both relative helicity and the unsigned helicity can influence the dynamics in the solar corona.</description>

      <title>The NuGrid AGB Evolution and Nucleosynthesis Data Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars play a key role in the chemical evolution of galaxies. These stars are the fundamental stellar site for the production of light elements such as C, N and F, and half of the elements heavier than Fe via the slow neutron capture process (s-process). Hence, detailed computational models of AGB stars' evolution and nucleosynthesis are essential for galactic chemical evolution. In this work, we discuss the progress in updating the NuGrid data set of AGB stellar models and abundance yields. All stellar models have been computed using the MESA stellar evolution code, coupled with the post-processing mppnp code to calculate the full nucleosynthesis. The final data set will include the initial masses Mini/Msun = 1, 1.65, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 for initial metallicities Z = 0.0001, 0.001, 0.006, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03. Observed s-process abundances on the surfaces of evolved stars as well as the typical light elements in the composition of H-deficient post-AGB stars are reproduced.

      <title>Probing the CME Core--Prominence Relation Using Inner Coronal Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) often exhibit a three-part structure consisting of a bright inner core, an outer leading edge, and an intervening dark cavity. While the core has traditionally been attributed to prominence material, an alternative interpretation suggests it may arise from the projection effects of a twisted flux rope. We focused on limb CME events to reassess the connection between CME cores and their associated prominences in the inner corona. The CME cores were analyzed using white-light observations from the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO) K-Coronagraph (K-Cor), while the corresponding prominence eruptions were examined using H$\alpha$ data from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) and 304 \AA{} images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). Our results show a strong spatial correspondence between H$\alpha$ prominences and CME cores in white light, with an average image correlation of $\sim$0.7, while correlations between white light and AIA 304 \AA{} are comparatively weaker ($\sim$0.5). Several events could be continuously traced into the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment (LASCO/C2) field of view, confirming the persistence of prominence material into the outer corona. We find back-extrapolating LASCO/C2 CME cores under constant-velocity, linear-trajectory assumptions can introduce large errors -- up to 40$^\circ$ in inferred position angle and $\sim$140 minutes in eruption time relative to their true values -- underscoring the importance of inner-coronal observations for accurately constraining CME dynamics. Overall, our findings suggest that in prominence-associated CMEs, the bright cores are predominantly composed of prominence material.</description>

      <title>Fading into darkness: A weak mass ejection and low-efficiency fallback accompanying black hole formation in M31-2014-DS1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can form from the near-complete collapse of massive stars, causing them to abruptly disappear. The star M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda galaxy was reported to exhibit such a disappearance between 2014 and 2022, with properties consistent with the failed explosion of a $\approx 12 - 13$ M$_\odot$ yellow supergiant leading to the formation of a $\approx 5$ M$_\odot$ BH. We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the remnant obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and X-ray observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2024. The JWST MIRI/NIRSpec data reveal an extremely red source, showing strong blueshifted absorption from molecular gas (CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O, SO$_2$) and deep silicate dust features. Modeling the dust continuum confirms continued bolometric fading of the central source to $\log(L/L_\odot)\approx3.88$ ($\approx7-8$% of the progenitor luminosity), surrounded by a dust shell spanning $\approx40-200$ au. Modeling of the molecular gas indicates $\sim 0.1$ M$_\odot$ of gas expanding at $\approx 100$ km s$^{-1}$ near the inner edge of the dust shell. No X-ray source is detected down to a luminosity limit of $L_X\lesssim1.5\times10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We show that the panchromatic observations are explained by (i) a low-energy ($\approx10^{46}$ erg) ejection of the outer H-rich progenitor envelope and (ii) a fading central BH powered by inefficient ($\sim0.1$% in mass) accretion of loosely bound fallback material. The analysis robustly establishes the bolometric fading of M31-2014-DS1 and provides the first cohesive insights into BH formation via low-energy explosions and long-term fallback.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of 45,206 H{\alpha} Emission-line Stars from LAMOST MRS DR7</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars that exhibit prominent emission lines in their spectra are referred to as emission-line stars, encompassing a wide range of stellar types and indicative of intriguing physical properties. The Large Sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) has released millions of spectra from its Medium-Resolution Survey (MRS). A small fraction of these spectra exhibit emission lines, yet they remain undiscovered and unanalyzed due to being buried in the vast dataset. We have developed a method based on Derivative Spectroscopy (DS), which provides a novel approach for detecting and identifying emission-line stars by extracting signals from complex backgrounds and estimating spectral line profiles. Applying this method to the $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ spectral line profiles from the LAMOST-MRS Data Release 7 (DR7), we compiled a catalog of emission-line stars using the second- and third-derivative spectra for automated peak detection. This approach also facilitates the classification of $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ emission-line morphologies through a simplified scheme. The catalog comprises 56\,649 spectra with relatively prominent $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ emission lines from 45\,206 unique stars, with each emission-line component accompanied by approximate estimates of its wavelength, amplitude, and width. All $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ spectral lines were classified into three morphological classes under a unified classification scheme: single emission peak (83.0 \%), double emission peaks (5.6 \%), and P Cygni-type profiles (11.5 \%), which encompass both P Cygni and inverse P Cygni features. Through cross-referencing with SIMBAD, 39\,497 stars represent new emission-line sources discovered in our research.</description>

      <title>Radial differential rotation leading to dipole collapse in pre-main-sequence stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite progress in the observations of stellar magnetic fields, their physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. During the pre-main sequence (PMS) phase, the inner layers of stars contract and a radiative core gradually develops. In contrast, the convective envelope is gradually braked through magnetic interactions with the accretion disk and winds. With developing differential rotation inside the star, PMS phase is thus a critical period for magnetic properties of stars when strong initial dipoles can get perturbed, leading to the observed diversity in the magnetism on the main sequence (MS). In this work, we study the impact of differential rotation on such fields. We perform three-dimensional anelastic convective dynamo simulations of rotating spherical shells with an imposed differential rotation (shear) between the boundaries. Density, gravity profiles and convective zone thicknesses were set close to those predicted in PMS low-mass stars by one-dimensional stellar evolution code Cesam2k20. Our results show that radial differential rotation can induce dipole collapse leading to weaker, oscillatory magnetic fields. Differential rotation seems to perturb $\alpha^2$ dynamo mechanism, responsible for dipolar magnetic fields, by shearing poloidal field lines and by affecting turbulent magnetic transport processes. This collapse is moderated by the relative importance of shear compared to the vigor of convective motions, with exact stability criterion depending on the field strength and the size of the radiative core. Applying DNS-based stability criterion in PMS stellar evolution models, we qualitatively reproduce the trends observed in the magnetic topologies of low-mass stars when assuming an efficient internal angular momentum redistribution. This suggests that stellar magnetic properties are intimately related to the PMS angular momentum evolution.</description>

      <title>The Column Density Probability Density Function of Cygnus-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The density distribution within molecular clouds offers critical insights into their underlying physical processes, which are essential for understanding star formation. As a statistical measure of column density on the cloud scale, the shape and evolution of the column density probability density function (N-PDF) serve as important tools for understanding the dynamics between turbulence and gravity. Here we investigate the N-PDFs of Cygnus-X using the column density map obtained from Herschel, supplemented by HI and Young Stellar Objects (YSO) data. We find that the N-PDFs of Cygnus-X and four sub-regions display log-normal + power-law shapes, indicating the combined effects of turbulence and gravity in sculpting the density structure. We find evidence that the power-law segment of the N-PDFs flattens over time, and the transitional column density can be seen as a unique and stable star formation threshold specific to each molecular cloud. These results not only clarify the physical state of Cygnus-X but also emphasize the utility of the N-PDF as a statistical diagnostic tool, as it is an accessible indicator of evolutionary stages and star formation thresholds in molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Superluminous supernovae: diverse rise times explain diverse spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a diverse class of exceptionally bright massive star explosions, which typically exhibit absorption from ionised oxygen in their early spectra. While their photometric properties (luminosity and duration) both span an order of magnitude, population studies suggest that these distributions are continuous. However, spectroscopic samples have shown some indications of distinct sub-types, either through similarity to certain prototype objects, or in terms of their velocity evolution. Here we show that a well-observed SLSN, PTF12dam, completely changes its O II absorption profile as it rises to maximum light, moving from one proposed sub-type to another. This supports an interpretation where spectroscopic diversity is driven by the ejecta temperature at maximum light, rather than fundamental differences in the explosion or progenitor. Motivated by this, we develop a new diagnostic, the Brightness-Timescale-Temperature-Radius diagram, and a simple toy model for the evolution of the photospheric velocity, to show that diversity in the light curve rise time (likely due to differences in ejected mass) naturally explains why SLSNe with broader light curves generally have weaker O II lines, lower photospheric velocities after maximum, and slower changes in photospheric velocity over time. We show that the velocity distribution of the known SLSN population favours a relatively flat ejecta density profile, consistent with a hot bubble inflated by a central engine.</description>

      <title>A Large and Precise All-Sky Photometric Standard Star Dataset Across More Than 200 Passbands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision photometric standard stars play a key role in enabling accurate photometric calibration and advancing various fields of astronomy. However, due to limitations in calibration methods and the limited availability and underuse of high-precision reference data, existing photometric standard stars may suffer from insufficient numbers, systematic errors exceeding 10 milli-magnitude (mmag), limited photometric band coverage, or incomplete sky coverage, among other issues. To overcome these limitations, we have constructed the largest (over 200 million stars, 1000 times the widely recognized Landolt standards in the same magnitude range), most precise (better than 10 mmag), and most comprehensive (over 200 bands, nearly 40 times the coverage of traditional standards) all-sky standard stars. Based on standards, we have calibrated multiple survey datasets to mmag precision, and subsequently developed a complete sky distribution of stars for the Pan-STARRS system. This database, the BEst STars Database (BEST), is expected to pave the way for achieving mmag-level - or even higher - photometric precision in large-scale surveys, and to play a central role in shaping a high-precision astronomical measurement framework.</description>

      <title>Condensate Dark Stars beyond the Mean-Field Approximation: The Lee-Huang-Yang correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study structural properties of self-gravitating fluid spheres made of a dilute, homogeneous and ultracold Bose gas assuming repulsive, short-range interactions. For the first time we include the Lee-Huang-Yang correction to the usual polytropic equation-of-state of index $n=1$, which goes beyond the Hartree mean-field approximation taking into account quantum fluctuations. We find that the correction has a considerable impact on the M-R relationships and other properties of condensate dark stars, such as factor of compactness and tidal Love numbers. The impact is more significant for equation-of-states that support larger highest stellar masses.</description>

      <title>Backlighting young stellar objects in the Central Molecular Zone: an ensemble-averaged abundance structure of methanol ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) contains a substantial reservoir of dense molecular gas, where numerous young stellar objects (YSOs) and dense cloud cores have been identified. However, the large distance and severe foreground extinction complicate interpretation of infrared ice absorption features tracing chemical and evolutionary properties of these embedded objects. To better characterise YSOs and dense cores in this region, we combined spectra from multiple YSOs, each likely backlit by a giant star, allowing us to probe their outer layers and derive an ensemble-averaged ice abundance profile. We obtained L-band spectra of 15 point-like sources with extremely red colours using Gemini/GNIRS, enabling measurements of the CH3OH absorption feature at 3.535 micron. To better constrain the foreground extinction and H$_2$O ice column densities, we combined these data with K-band and mid-infrared spectra using NASA/IRTF and Spitzer/IRS. We found that the CH$_3$OH abundance in the CH$_3$OH-CO$_2$ ice mixture is 2 to 5 percent, confirming that it is systematically lower than those typically observed in the Galactic disk. Furthermore, by using the local excess of foreground extinction as a proxy for the projected distance between a backlit source and the centre of a YSO, we found that the CH$_3$OH abundance relative to solid CO$_2$ remains near 10 percent in the inner regions of the envelope, but increases sharply to about 30 percent in the outer regions. The relatively low methanol ice abundance may reflect the unique chemical environment of the CMZ. However, our results offer an alternative interpretation: since our sample is biased towards massive and luminous YSOs, intense heating from the central protostar may have caused substantial sublimation of methanol ice in the inner regions of their envelopes, thereby systematically lowering the observed CH$_3$OH/H$_2$O ice ratios.</description>

      <title>Probing the morphology of the Gum Nebula through pulsar observables and a novel distance estimation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various existing models of the Gum Nebula differ significantly in their parameters and suggested origins, which can be independently tested for consistency with data on some key observables of pulsars in the direction of the nebula. Our analysis of such data on the Vela pulsar, assuming a dominant scattering region in its foreground, suggests that the fractional distance of the scatterer is $0.89 \pm 0.01$, and for the given distance of the Vela pulsar, it translates to $254 \pm 16$ pc. Using independent distances of ten pulsars, we suggest a refined description of the Gum Nebula electron density model with its basic morphology similar to that used in the YMW16 model, which now provides better estimates of pulsar distances in these directions. In our new Gum Nebula model, as expected, the Vela pulsar would be behind the frontal edge of the Gum shell, which was intriguingly located in front of the nebula in the YMW16 model. We also present a new technique to better constrain the pulsar distances using their dispersion measure and temporal broadening simultaneously, and find that it is less affected by the uncertainties in the Galactic electron density distribution models. Notably, the new approach shows that the expected temporal broadening as a function of trial distance does not follow a monotonic increasing trend, but instead exhibits oscillations at regions of enhanced electron density. This behaviour is expected, as the method employs the integral form of temporal broadening with the appropriate weighting kernel, leading to more reliable estimates.</description>

      <title>On the orbital evolution of binaries with polar circumbinary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binaries occur in many astrophysical systems, from young protostellar binaries in star forming regions to supermassive black hole binaries in galaxy centers. In many cases, a circumbinary disk of gas forms around the binary with an orbit that may be misaligned to the binary plane. Misaligned disks around nearly circular binaries evolve into disks that are either aligned or counteraligned with the binary orbit. However, if the binary is sufficiently eccentric, then it can be more likely that the disk ends up in a polar-aligned configuration in which the disk angular momentum vector aligns with the binary eccentricity vector. We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations, evolved to an approximate steady state under mass injection, to determine the orbital evolution of a binary with a polar-aligned disk for a range of binary-disk parameters. We find that, in all of the cases we have simulated, the binary shrinks with time. The decay rate is larger than for binaries surrounded by aligned or retrograde disks with matched disk parameters. The rate of shrinkage is largely unaltered by the size of the sink radii employed for the binary stars, but for small enough sink radii some of the models exhibit long-lived polar circumprimary disks, which are continually fed mass from the circumbinary disk. We discuss our results in the contexts of planet formation in young polar-aligned disks and merging supermassive black holes in galaxy centers.</description>

      <title>Distinct Rotational Evolution of Giant Planets and Brown Dwarf Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rotational velocity (vsini) survey of 32 stellar/substellar objects and giant planets using Keck/KPIC high-resolution spectroscopy, including 6 giant planets (2-7 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) and 25 substellar/stellar companions (12-88 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$). Adding companions with spin measurements from the literature, we construct a curated spin sample for 43 benchmark stellar/substellar companions and giant planets and 54 free-floating brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects. We compare their spins, parameterized as fractional breakup velocities at 10 Myr, assuming constant angular momentum evolution. We find the first clear evidence that giant planets exhibit distinct spins versus low-mass brown dwarf companions (10 to 40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) at 4-4.5 $\sigma$ significance assuming inclinations aligned with their orbits, while under randomly oriented inclinations the significance is at 1.6-2.1 $\sigma$. Our findings hold when considering various assumptions about planets, and the mass ratio below 0.8% gives a clean cut for rotation between giant planets and brown dwarf companions. The higher fractional breakup velocities of planets can be interpreted as less angular momentum loss through circumplanetary disk braking during the planet formation phase. Brown dwarf companions exhibit evidence of slower rotation compared to isolated brown dwarfs, while planets and planetary mass objects show similar spins. Finally, our analysis of specific angular momentum versus age of 221 stellar/substellar objects below 0.1 MSun with spin measurements in the literature indicates that the substellar objects of 5-40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ retain much higher angular momenta compared to stellar and substellar objects of 40-100 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ after 10 Myr, when their initial angular momenta were set.</description>

      <title>Testing the Shock-cooling Emission Model from Star-disk Collisions for Quasi-periodic Eruptions</title>

Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), the repeated outbursts observed in soft X-ray bands, have attracted broad interest, but their physical origin is under debate. One of the popular models, the star-disk collision model, suggests that QPEs can be produced through periodic collisions of an orbiting star with the accretion disk of a central black hole (BH). However, previous tests of the star-disk collision model mainly focus on the timing analysis. Other observed properties, such as peak luminosities $L_{\rm{p}}$, durations $t_{\rm{e}}$, and radiation temperatures $T_{\rm{p}}$ of the eruptions, are not systematically investigated. For a sample of six QPE sources and two QPE-like sources, we test the shock-cooling emission model from star-disk collisions by using these observables to derive the constraints on the stellar radius $R_\star$. We find that, except for two sources (eRo-QPE3 and eRo-QPE4), the rest of the sample either has no allowed $R_\star$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed $L_{\rm{p}}$ and $t_{\rm{e}}$, or the required $R_\star$ is too large to avoid being disrupted by the central BH. For the two exceptions, a stellar radius of the order of $1\ R_{\rm{\odot}}$ is necessary to satisfy all the constraints. Another issue with the simplest version of this model is that it predicts $k T_{\rm{p}} \sim 10\ \rm{eV}$, one order of magnitude lower than the observed value.</description>

      <title>Close-in planet induces flares on its host star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, hundreds of exoplanets have been discovered in extremely short orbits below 10 days. Unlike in the Solar System, planets in these systems orbit their host stars close enough to disturb the stellar magnetic field lines. The interaction can enhance the star's magnetic activity, such as its chromospheric and radio emission, or flaring. So far, the search for magnetic star-planet interactions has remained inconclusive. Here, we report the first detection of planet-induced flares on HIP 67522, a 17 million-year-old G dwarf star with two known close-in planets. Combining space-borne photometry from TESS and dedicated CHEOPS observations over a span of 5 years, we find that the 15 flares in HIP 67522 cluster near the innermost planet's transit phase, indicating persistent magnetic star-planet interaction in the system. The stability of interaction implies that the innermost planet is continuously self-inflicting a six time higher flare rate than it would experience without interaction. The subsequent flux of energetic radiation and particles bombarding HIP 67522 b may explain the planet's remarkably extended atmosphere, recently detected with the James Webb Space Telescope. HIP 67522 is therefore an archetype to understand the impact of magnetic star-planet interaction on the atmospheres of nascent exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Violent mergers revisited: The origin of the fastest stars in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary systems of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are one of the most promising candidates for the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae.
  Violent mergers, where the primary white dwarf ignites when the secondary white dwarf smashes onto it while being disrupted on its last orbit, were the first proposed double degenerate merger scenario that ignites dynamically.
  However, violent mergers likely contribute only a few per cent to the total Type Ia supernova rate and do not yield normal Type Ia supernova light curves.
  Here we revisit the scenario, simulating a violent merger with better methods, and in particular a more accurate treatment of the detonation.
  We find good agreement with previous simulations, with one critical difference. The secondary white dwarf, being disrupted and accelerated towards the primary white dwarf, and impacted by its explosion, does not fully burn. Its core survives as a bound object.
  The explosion leaves behind a $0.16\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ carbon-oxygen white dwarf travelling $2800\,\mathrm{km/s}$, making it an excellent (and so far the only) candidate to explain the origin of the fastest observed hyper-velocity white dwarfs.
  We also show that before the explosion, $5\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ of material consisting predominantly of helium, carbon, and oxygen has already been ejected at velocities above $1000\,\mathrm{km/s}$.
  Finally, we argue that if a violent merger made D6-1 and D6-3, and violent mergers require the most massive primary white dwarfs in binaries of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, there has to be a much larger population of white dwarf mergers with slightly lower-mass primary white dwarfs. Because of its size, this population can essentially only give rise to normal Type Ia supernovae, likely exploding via the quadruple detonation channel and leaving no bound object behind.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Reaction Rates for Charged-Particle Induced Reactions on Proton-Rich Nuclides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical reaction rates for reactions with proton-rich isotopes of Ne to Bi from stability to the proton dripline were calculated with an updated version of the SMARAGD statistical model (Hauser-Feshbach) code. Here, the focus was on reactions with protons or $\alpha$ particles as required for nucleosynthesis in proton-rich matter. For completeness, also neutron-induced reactions are provided for the same set of targets. Some comments on dependencies of rates on various nuclear properties and on the appropriate way to compare to experiments are given. The new rate set for charged-particle induced reactions provides a better description of experimental data than previously widely used rates, especially for reactions involving $\alpha$ particles.</description>

      <title>Predicting dust temperature from molecular line data using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conducted experiments with machine learning techniques to construct dust temperature maps from the CO isotopologue molecular line data in the Orion A molecular cloud. In the classical astrophysical methodology, multi-band continuum data are required to derive the dust temperature. The present study aims to investigate the capability and limitations of machine learning techniques to derive dust temperatures in regions without multi-band dust continuum data. We investigated how the number of pixels used for training influences prediction accuracy, and how the dust temperatures sampled in the training area influence prediction accuracy. We found that $\sim$5\% of the total number of pixels in the observational region is sufficient for training to obtain accurate predictions. Furthermore, a dust temperature sample within the training area should cover the whole temperature range and have a similar sample distribution to that of the entire observing region for an accurate prediction. The $^{12}$CO / $^{13}$CO ratio is often found to be the most important feature in predicting the dust temperature. As the $^{12}$CO / $^{13}$CO ratio is a tracer of PDR, the machine learning technique could connect the dust temperatures to the PDRs. We also found that the condition of thermal gas-dust coupling is not required for accurate prediction of the dust temperature from the molecular line data, and that machine learning is capable of capturing information more than classical astrophysical concepts.</description>
