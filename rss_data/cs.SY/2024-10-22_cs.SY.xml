      <title>Advancing Gasoline Consumption Forecasting: A Novel Hybrid Model Integrating Transformers, LSTM, and CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iran, endowed with abundant hydrocarbon resources, plays a crucial role in the global energy landscape. Gasoline, as a critical fuel, significantly supports the nation's transportation sector. Accurate forecasting of gasoline consumption is essential for strategic resource management and environmental planning. This research introduces a novel approach to predicting monthly gasoline consumption using a hybrid Transformer-LSTM-CNN model, which integrates the strengths of Transformer networks, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This advanced architecture offers a superior alternative to conventional methods such as artificial neural networks and regression models by capturing both short- and long-term dependencies in time series data. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism of Transformers, the temporal memory of LSTMs, and the local pattern detection of CNNs, our hybrid model delivers improved prediction accuracy. Implemented using Python, the model provides precise future gasoline consumption forecasts and evaluates the environmental impact through the analysis of greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines gasoline consumption trends from 2007 to 2021, which rose from 64.5 million liters per day in 2007 to 99.80 million liters per day in 2021. Our proposed model forecasts consumption levels up to 2031, offering a valuable tool for policymakers and energy analysts. The results highlight the superiority of this hybrid model in improving the accuracy of gasoline consumption forecasts, reinforcing the need for advanced machine learning techniques to optimize resource management and mitigate environmental risks in the energy sector.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Electric Vehicle Charging Optimization: A Survey of Reinforcement Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to global warming and energy shortages, there has been a significant shift towards integrating renewable energy sources, energy storage systems, and electric vehicles. Deploying electric vehicles within smart grids offers a promising solution to reduce carbon emissions. However, managing the charging and discharging processes of them as distributed power supplies present significant challenges. Additionally, the intermittent nature of renewable energy, uncertainties in electric vehicle-related parameters, fluctuating energy prices, and varying loads make maintaining stable power system operations more complex. Effective management systems for electric vehicle battery charging are crucial to coordinating these processes and ensuring a secure, efficient, and reliable power system. Reinforcement learning, enhanced by deep learning, has gained substantial interest for its model-free approach and real-time optimization, effectively managing electric vehicle charging by maximizing cumulative rewards. This review synthesizes existing literature on reinforcement learning-based frameworks, objectives, and architectures for electric vehicle charging coordination strategies in power systems, classifying methods into centralized and decentralized categories. Additionally, the article offers suggestions for future research directions to further enhance reinforcement learning-based electric vehicle charging optimization.</description>

      <title>Residues in Partial Fraction Decomposition Applied to Pole Sensitivity Analysis and Root Locus Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The applications of the partial fraction decomposition in control and systems engineering are several. In this letter, we propose a new interpretation of residues in the partial fraction decomposition, which is employed for the following purposes: to address the pole sensitivity problem, namely to study the speed of variation of the system poles when the control parameter changes and when the system is subject to parameters variations, as well as to propose a new algorithm for the construction of the root locus. The new algorithm is proven to be more efficient in terms of execution time than the dedicated MATLAB function, while providing the same output results.</description>

      <title>PEtra: A Flexible and Open-Source PE Loop Tracer for Polymer Thin-Film Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of ferroelectric properties in polymer piezoelectrics is critical for optimizing the performance of flexible and wearable ultrasound transducers, such as screen-printed PVDF devices. Standard charge measurement techniques, like the Sawyer-Tower circuit, often fall short when applied to ferroelectric polymers due to low-frequency leakage. In this work, we present PEtra, an open-source and versatile piezoelectric loop tracer. PEtra employs a transimpedance amplifier (LMP7721, TI) to convert picoampere-level currents into measurable voltages, covering a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 5 Hz for a gain setting of 10^7 V/A, and 0.1 Hz to 200 Hz for gain settings between 10^3 V/A to 10^6 V/A (10-fold increments). We demonstrate through simulations and experimental validations that PEtra achieves a sensitivity down to 2 pA, effectively addressing the limitations of traditional charge measurement methods. Compared to the Sawyer-Tower circuit, PEtra directly amplifies currents without the need for a reference capacitor. As a result, it is less susceptible to leakage and can operate at lower frequencies, improving measurement accuracy and reliability. PEtra's design is fully open source, offering researchers and engineers a versatile tool to drive advancements in flexible PVDF transducer technology.</description>

      <title>Nature-inspired dynamic control for pursuit-evasion of robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit-evasion problem is widespread in nature, engineering and societal applications. It is commonly observed in nature that a predator runs faster than its prey but it has less agile maneuverability. Over millions of years of evolution, animals have developed effective and efficient pursuit and evasion strategies. In this paper, we provide a dynamic framework for pursuit-evasion of unicycle systems from a nature-inspired perspective. Firstly, for the problem with one pursuer and one evader, we propose an Alert-Turn control strategy which consists of two efficient ingredients: the suddenly turning maneuver and the alert condition for starting and maintaining the maneuver. We present and analyze the escape and capture results at a lower level of a single run and at a higher level with respect to parameters' changes. A theorem with sufficient condition for capture is also given. Then, the Alert-Turn strategy is combined with aggregation control laws and a target-changing mechanism to model more complex phenomenons with multiple pursuers and evaders. By adjusting a selfish parameter, the aggregation control commands can achieve different escape patterns of evaders: cooperative mode, selfish mode, as well as their combinations, and the influence of the selfish parameter is quantified. We present the effects of the number of pursuers and the target-changing mechanism from a statistical perspective. Our findings are largely in line with observations in nature. Furthermore, our control strategies are verified by numerical simulations that replicate some chasing behaviors of animals in nature.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Trajectory Planning: Principles for Human-Machine System Design on Trajectory Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores cooperative trajectory planning approaches within the context of human-machine shared control. In shared control research, it is typically assumed that the human and the automation use the same reference trajectory to stabilize the coupled system. However, this assumption is often incorrect, as they usually follow different trajectories, causing control conflicts at the action level that have not been widely researched. To address this, it is logical to extend shared control concepts to include human-machine interaction at the trajectory-level before action execution, resulting in a unified reference trajectory for both human and automation. This paper begins with a literature overview on approaches of cooperative trajectory planning. It then presents an approach of finding a joint trajectory by modelling cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process. A generally valid system structure is proposed for this purpose. Finally, it proposes concepts to implement cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process.</description>

      <title>Iterative Cut-Based PWA Approximation of Multi-Dimensional Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PieceWise Affine (PWA) approximations for nonlinear functions have been extensively used for tractable, computationally efficient control of nonlinear systems. However, reaching a desired approximation accuracy without prior information about the behavior of the nonlinear systems remains a challenge in the function approximation and control literature. As the name suggests, PWA approximation aims at approximating a nonlinear function or system by dividing the domain into multiple subregions where the nonlinear function or dynamics is approximated locally by an affine function also called local mode. Without prior knowledge of the form of the nonlinearity, the required number of modes, the locations of the subregions, and the local approximations need to be optimized simultaneously, which becomes highly complex for large-scale systems with multi-dimensional nonlinear functions. This paper introduces a novel approach for PWA approximation of multi-dimensional nonlinear systems, utilizing a hinging hyperplane formalism for cut-based partitioning of the domain. The complexity of the PWA approximation is iteratively increased until reaching the desired accuracy level. Further, the tractable cut definitions allow for different forms of subregions, as well as the ability to impose continuity constraints on the PWA approximation. The methodology is explained via multiple examples and its performance is compared to two existing approaches through case studies, showcasing its efficacy.</description>

      <title>Electrode SOC and SOH estimation with electrode-level ECMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being able to predict battery internal states that are related to battery degradation is a key aspect to improve battery lifetime and performance, enhancing cleaner electric transportation and energy generation. However, most present battery management systems (BMSs) use equivalent-circuit models (ECMs) for state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) estimation. These models are not able to predict these aging-related variables, and therefore, they cannot be used to limit battery degradation. In this paper, we propose a method for electrode-level SOC (eSOC) and electrode-level SOH (eSOH) estimation using an electrode-level ECM (eECM). The method can produce estimates of the states of lithiation (SOL) of both electrodes and update the eSOH parameters to maintain estimation accuracy through the lifetime of the battery. Furthermore, the eSOH parameter estimates are used to obtain degradation mode information, which could be used to improve state estimation, health diagnosis and prognosis. The method was validated in simulation and experimentally.</description>

      <title>On Optimal Battery Sizing for Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a quantitative framework to optimize electric vehicle (EV) battery capacities, considering two criteria: upfront vehicle cost and charging inconvenience cost. For this purpose, we (1) develop a comprehensive model for charging inconvenience costs, incorporating both charging time and detours, improving on existing studies, (2) show, through extensive simulations and analytical models, how charging inconvenience cost is affected by different battery capacity and charging infrastructure configurations, (3) introduce an optimisation framework to determine optimal battery capacities based on charging inconvenience and vehicle cost, and (4) show that optimal battery capacities can be influenced by strategic investments in charging infrastructure and tax/incentive policies. The proposed framework provides actionable insights into the sustainable design of EV systems, supporting the development of cost-effective and convenient electric mobility solutions.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Baseline Models and a Transformer Network for SOC Prediction in Lithium-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the state of charge of Lithium-ion batteries is essential to the performance of battery management systems of electric vehicles. One of the main reasons for the slow global adoption of electric cars is driving range anxiety. The ability of a battery management system to accurately estimate the state of charge can help alleviate this problem. In this paper, a comparison between data-driven state-of-charge estimation methods is conducted. The paper compares different neural network-based models and common regression models for SOC estimation. These models include several ablated transformer networks, a neural network, a lasso regression model, a linear regression model and a decision tree. Results of various experiments conducted on data obtained from natural driving cycles of the BMW i3 battery show that the decision tree outperformed all other models including the more complex transformer network with self-attention and positional encoding.</description>

      <title>Optimal gait design for nonlinear soft robotic crawlers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robots offer a frontier in robotics with enormous potential for safe human-robot interaction and agility in uncertain environments. A steppingstone towards unlocking the potential of soft robotics is a tailored control theory, including a principled framework for gait design. We analyze the problem of optimal gait design for a soft crawling body, "the crawler". The crawler is an elastic body with the control signal defined as actuation forces between segments of the body. We consider the simplest such crawler: a two-segmented body with a passive mechanical connection modeling the viscoelastic body dynamics and a symmetric control force modeling actuation between the two body segments. The model accounts for the nonlinear asymmetric friction with the ground, which together with the symmetric actuation forces enable the crawler's locomotion. Using a describing-function analysis, we show that when the body is forced sinusoidally, the optimal actuator contraction frequency corresponds to the body's natural frequency when operating with only passive dynamics. We then use the framework of Optimal Periodic Control (OPC) to design optimal force cycles of arbitrary waveform and the corresponding crawling gaits. We provide a hill-climbing algorithm to solve the OPC problem numerically. Our proposed methods and results inform the design of optimal forcing and gaits for more complex and multi-segmented crawling bodies.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Simulation of DNN-based Gray Box Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation is vital for engineering disciplines, as it enables the prediction and design of physical systems. However, the computational challenges inherent to large-scale simulations often arise from complex device models featuring high degrees of nonlinearities or hidden physical behaviors not captured by first principles. Gray-box models combine deep neural networks (DNNs) with physics-based models to address the computational challenges in modeling physical systems. A well-crafted gray box model capitalizes on the interpretability and accuracy of a physical model while incorporating DNNs to capture hidden physical behaviors and mitigate computational load associated with highly nonlinear components. Previously, gray box models have been constructed by defining an explicit combination of physics-based and DNN models to represent the behavior of sub-systems; however this cannot represent the coupled interactions within physical systems. We explore an implicit gray box model, where both DNNs and physical equations share a common set of state-variables. While this approach captures coupled interactions at the boundary of DNN and physics-based models, simulating the implicit gray box model remains an open-ended problem. In this work, we introduce a new hybrid simulation that integrates DNNs into the numerical solvers of simulation engines to fully simulate implicit gray box models of large physical systems. This is accomplished by backpropagating through the DNN to calculate Jacobian values during each iteration of the numerical method. The hybrid simulation improves the accuracy and runtime compared to physics-based simulation and enables reusable DNN models with lower data requirements. We explore the advantages of this approach as compared to physics-based, black box, and other gray box methods for simulating the steady-state and transient behavior of power systems.</description>

      <title>Empowering the Grid: Decentralized Autonomous Control for Effective Utilization and Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of low-inertia microgrids powered by inverter-based generation, there remains a concern about the operational resilience of these systems. Grid-forming inverters (GFMs), enabled by various device-level (primary) and system-level (secondary) control methods, are poised to play a significant role in achieving certain operational objectives, such as the effective utilization of clean energy resources while maintaining stability. However, despite the recent advances in GFMs, there is a lack of suitable controls that can ascertain resilience-constrained operations, like maintaining critical operational safety limits during transients under various cyber-physical disruptions. In this work, we develop decentralized autonomous controllers (DACs) that enforce resilience-constrained operation via local, minimally invasive adjustments (e.g., changes in set-points) while co-existing within the hierarchy of existing (primary and secondary) controls. The DACs work autonomously by sensing only local GFM measurements and act only when operational resilience constraints are violated. The proposed DAC scheme is computationally efficient (only algebraic computations), which enables fast, real-time execution and demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed control framework on GridLAB-D-HELICS-based control-grid co-simulations on the IEEE 123-node networked microgrid. Finally, we show how the developed DACs empower the grid by utilizing the available resources entirely to ensure resilience (maintain frequency safe limits).</description>

      <title>Verification of Neural Control Barrier Functions with Symbolic Derivative Bounds Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are important in safety-critical systems and robot control applications. Neural networks have been used to parameterize and synthesize CBFs with bounded control input for complex systems. However, it is still challenging to verify pre-trained neural networks CBFs (neural CBFs) in an efficient symbolic manner. To this end, we propose a new efficient verification framework for ReLU-based neural CBFs through symbolic derivative bound propagation by combining the linearly bounded nonlinear dynamic system and the gradient bounds of neural CBFs. Specifically, with Heaviside step function form for derivatives of activation functions, we show that the symbolic bounds can be propagated through the inner product of neural CBF Jacobian and nonlinear system dynamics. Through extensive experiments on different robot dynamics, our results outperform the interval arithmetic based baselines in verified rate and verification time along the CBF boundary, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method with different model complexity. The code can be found at https://github.com/intelligent-control-lab/ verify-neural-CBF.</description>

      <title>Optimal Ground Station Selection for Low-Earth Orbiting Satellites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a solution to the problem of optimal ground station selection for low-Earth orbiting (LEO) space missions that enables mission operators to precisely design their ground segment performance and costs. Space mission operators are increasingly turning to Ground-Station-as-a-Service (GSaaS) providers to supply the terrestrial communications segment to reduce costs and increase network size. However, this approach leads to a new challenge of selecting the optimal service providers and station locations for a given mission. We consider the problem of ground station selection as an optimization problem and present a general solution framework that allows mission designers to set their overall optimization objective and constrain key mission performance variables such as total data downlink, total mission cost, recurring operational cost, and maximum communications time-gap. We solve the problem using integer programming (IP). To address computational scaling challenges, we introduce a surrogate optimization approach where the optimal station selection is determined based on solving the problem over a reduced time domain. Two different IP formulations are evaluated using randomized selections of LEO satellites of varying constellation sizes. We consider the networks of the commercial GSaaS providers Atlas Space Operations, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Ground Station, Azure Orbital Ground Station, Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), Leaf Space, and Viasat Real-Time Earth. We compare our results against standard operational practices of integrating with one or two primary ground station providers.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Ball Chain Robots for Cardiac Arrhythmia Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel magnetic navigation system for cardiac ablation. The system is formed from two key elements: a magnetic ablation catheter consisting of a chain of spherical permanent magnets; and an actuation system comprised of two cart-mounted permanent magnets undergoing pure rotation. The catheter design enables a large magnetic content with the goal of minimizing the footprint of the actuation system for easier integration with the clinical workflow. We present a quasi-static model of the catheter, the design of the actuation units, and their control modalities. Experimental validation shows that we can use small rotating magnets (119mm diameter) to reach cardiac ablation targets while generating clinically-relevant forces. Catheter control using a joystick is compared with manual catheter control. blue While total task completion time is similar, smoother navigation is observed using the proposed robotic system. We also demonstrate that the ball chain can ablate heart tissue and generate lesions comparable to the current clinical ablation catheters.</description>

      <title>Policies with Sparse Inter-Agent Dependencies in Dynamic Games: A Dynamic Programming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common feedback strategies in multi-agent dynamic games require all players' state information to compute control strategies. However, in real-world scenarios, sensing and communication limitations between agents make full state feedback expensive or impractical, and such strategies can become fragile when state information from other agents is inaccurate. To this end, we propose a regularized dynamic programming approach for finding sparse feedback policies that selectively depend on the states of a subset of agents in dynamic games. The proposed approach solves convex adaptive group Lasso problems to compute sparse policies approximating Nash equilibrium solutions. We prove the regularized solutions' asymptotic convergence to a neighborhood of Nash equilibrium policies in linear-quadratic (LQ) games. We extend the proposed approach to general non-LQ games via an iterative algorithm. Empirical results in multi-robot interaction scenarios show that the proposed approach effectively computes feedback policies with varying sparsity levels. When agents have noisy observations of other agents' states, simulation results indicate that the proposed regularized policies consistently achieve lower costs than standard Nash equilibrium policies by up to 77% for all interacting agents whose costs are coupled with other agents' states.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Emulation for Deploying Robot Swarm Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant research, robotic swarms have yet to be useful in solving real-world problems, largely due to the difficulty of creating and controlling swarming behaviors in multi-agent systems. Traditional top-down approaches in which a desired emergent behavior is produced often require complex, resource-heavy robots, limiting their practicality. This paper introduces a bottom-up approach by employing an Embodied Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation approach, emphasizing the use of simple robots and identifying conditions that naturally lead to self-organized collective behaviors. Using the Reality-to-Simulation-to-Reality for Swarms (RSRS) process, we tightly integrate real-world experiments with simulations to reproduce known swarm behaviors as well as discovering a novel emergent behavior without aiming to eliminate or even reduce the sim2real gap. This paper presents the development of an Agent-Based Embodiment and Emulation process that balances the importance of running physical swarming experiments and the prohibitively time-consuming process of even setting up and running a single experiment with 20+ robots by leveraging low-fidelity lightweight simulations to enable hypothesis-formation to guide physical experiments. We demonstrate the usefulness of our methods by emulating two known behaviors from the literature and show a third behavior `discovered' by accident.</description>

      <title>Can Transformers In-Context Learn Behavior of a Linear Dynamical System?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether transformers can learn to track a random process when given observations of a related process and parameters of the dynamical system that relates them as context. More specifically, we consider a finite-dimensional state-space model described by the state transition matrix $F$, measurement matrices $h_1, \dots, h_N$, and the process and measurement noise covariance matrices $Q$ and $R$, respectively; these parameters, randomly sampled, are provided to the transformer along with the observations $y_1,\dots,y_N$ generated by the corresponding linear dynamical system. We argue that in such settings transformers learn to approximate the celebrated Kalman filter, and empirically verify this both for the task of estimating hidden states $\hat{x}_{N|1,2,3,...,N}$ as well as for one-step prediction of the $(N+1)^{st}$ observation, $\hat{y}_{N+1|1,2,3,...,N}$. A further study of the transformer's robustness reveals that its performance is retained even if the model's parameters are partially withheld. In particular, we demonstrate that the transformer remains accurate at the considered task even in the absence of state transition and noise covariance matrices, effectively emulating operations of the Dual-Kalman filter.</description>

      <title>FastGEMF: Scalable High-Speed Simulation of Stochastic Spreading Processes over Complex Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the spread of processes across complex multi-layered networks has long challenged researchers due to the intricate interplay between network structure and propagation dynamics. Each layer of these networks possesses unique characteristics, further complicating analysis. To authors' knowledge, a comprehensive framework capable of simulating various spreading processes across different layers, particularly in networks with millions of nodes and connections, has been notably absent. This study introduces a novel framework that efficiently predicts Markov Chain processes over large-scale networks, while significantly reducing time and space complexity. This approach enables exact simulation of spreading processes across extensive real-world multi-layer networks, accounting for diverse influencers on each layer. FastGEMF provides a baseline framework for exact simulating stochastic spread processes, facilitating comparative analysis of models across diverse domains, from epidemiology to social media dynamics.</description>

      <title>Global Stability Notions to Enhance the Rigor and Robustness of Adaptive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stability theory plays a crucial role in feedback control. However, adaptive control theory requires advanced and specialized stability notions that are not frequently used in standard feedback control theory. The present document is a set of notes for a graduate course. It describes the global stability notions needed in (robust) adaptive control and develops the mathematical tools that are used for the proof of such stability properties. Moreover, the document shows why and how these global stability properties arise in adaptive control. We focus on stability properties for time-invariant systems. Consequently, tracking control problems are not covered by the present document.</description>

      <title>Fast State-of-Health Estimation Method for Lithium-ion Battery using Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are utilized as a major energy source in various fields because of their high energy density and long lifespan. During repeated charging and discharging, the degradation of LIBs, which reduces their maximum power output and operating time, is a pivotal issue. This degradation can affect not only battery performance but also safety of the system. Therefore, it is essential to accurately estimate the state-of-health (SOH) of the battery in real time. To address this problem, we propose a fast SOH estimation method that utilizes the sparse model identification algorithm (SINDy) for nonlinear dynamics. SINDy can discover the governing equations of target systems with low data assuming that few functions have the dominant characteristic of the system. To decide the state of degradation model, correlation analysis is suggested. Using SINDy and correlation analysis, we can obtain the data-driven SOH model to improve the interpretability of the system. To validate the feasibility of the proposed method, the estimation performance of the SOH and the computation time are evaluated by comparing it with various machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Guiding Reinforcement Learning with Incomplete System Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is inherently a reactive method, operating under the assumption that it starts with no prior knowledge of the system and entirely depends on trial-and-error for learning. This approach faces several challenges, such as poor sample efficiency, generalization, and the need for well-designed reward functions to guide learning effectively. On the other hand, controllers based on complete system dynamics do not require data. This paper addresses the intermediate situation where there is not enough model information for complete controller design, but there is enough to suggest that a model-free approach is not the best approach either. By carefully decoupling known and unknown information about the system dynamics, we obtain an embedded controller guided by our partial model and thus improve the learning efficiency of an RL-enhanced approach. A modular design allows us to deploy mainstream RL algorithms to refine the policy. Simulation results show that our method significantly improves sample efficiency compared with standard RL methods on continuous control tasks, and also offers enhanced performance over traditional control approaches. Experiments on a real ground vehicle also validate the performance of our method, including generalization and robustness.</description>

      <title>Learning Load Balancing with GNN in MPTCP-Enabled Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks are a promising paradigm of heterogeneous network (HetNet), attributed to the complementary physical properties of optical spectra and radio frequency. However, the current development of such HetNets is mostly bottlenecked by the existing transmission control protocol (TCP), which restricts the user equipment (UE) to connecting one access point (AP) at a time. While the ongoing investigation on multipath TCP (MPTCP) can bring significant benefits, it complicates the network topology of HetNets, making the existing load balancing (LB) learning models less effective. Driven by this, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based model to tackle the LB problem for MPTCP-enabled HetNets, which results in a partial mesh topology. Such a topology can be modeled as a graph, with the channel state information and data rate requirement embedded as node features, while the LB solutions are deemed as edge labels. Compared to the conventional deep neural network (DNN), the proposed GNN-based model exhibits two key strengths: i) it can better interpret a complex network topology; and ii) it can handle various numbers of APs and UEs with a single trained model. Simulation results show that against the traditional optimisation method, the proposed learning model can achieve near-optimal throughput within a gap of 11.5%, while reducing the inference time by 4 orders of magnitude. In contrast to the DNN model, the new method can improve the network throughput by up to 21.7%, at a similar inference time level.</description>

      <title>Risk-Averse Model Predictive Control for Racing in Adverse Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) algorithms can be sensitive to model mismatch when used in challenging nonlinear control tasks. In particular, the performance of MPC for vehicle control at the limits of handling suffers when the underlying model overestimates the vehicle's capabilities. In this work, we propose a risk-averse MPC framework that explicitly accounts for uncertainty over friction limits and tire parameters. Our approach leverages a sample-based approximation of an optimal control problem with a conditional value at risk (CVaR) constraint. This sample-based formulation enables planning with a set of expressive vehicle dynamics models using different tire parameters. Moreover, this formulation enables efficient numerical resolution via sequential quadratic programming and GPU parallelization. Experiments on a Lexus LC 500 show that risk-averse MPC unlocks reliable performance, while a deterministic baseline that plans using a single dynamics model may lose control of the vehicle in adverse road conditions.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Upper Confidence Bounds for Constrained Online Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is a foundational framework in sequential decision-making under uncertainty, extensively studied for its applications in areas such as clinical trials, online advertising, and resource allocation. Traditional MAB formulations, however, do not adequately capture scenarios where decisions are structured hierarchically, involve multi-level constraints, or feature context-dependent action spaces. In this paper, we introduce the hierarchical constrained bandits (HCB) framework, which extends the contextual bandit problem to incorporate hierarchical decision structures and multi-level constraints. We propose the hierarchical constrained upper confidence bound (HC-UCB) algorithm, designed to address the complexities of the HCB problem by leveraging confidence bounds within a hierarchical setting. Our theoretical analysis establishes sublinear regret bounds for HC-UCB and provides high-probability guarantees for constraint satisfaction at all hierarchical levels. Furthermore, we derive a minimax lower bound on the regret for the HCB problem, demonstrating the near-optimality of our algorithm. The results are significant for real-world applications where decision-making processes are inherently hierarchical and constrained, offering a robust and efficient solution that balances exploration and exploitation across multiple levels of decision-making.</description>

Abstract: Network Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), a popular model for multi-agent control, pose a significant challenge to efficient learning due to the exponential growth of the global state-action space with the number of agents. In this work, utilizing the exponential decay property of network dynamics, we first derive scalable spectral local representations for network MDPs, which induces a network linear subspace for the local $Q$-function of each agent. Building on these local spectral representations, we design a scalable algorithmic framework for continuous state-action network MDPs, and provide end-to-end guarantees for the convergence of our algorithm. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of our scalable representation-based approach on two benchmark problems, and demonstrate the advantages of our approach over generic function approximation approaches to representing the local $Q$-functions.</description>

Abstract: Batteries can effectively improve the security of energy systems and mitigate climate change by facilitating wind and solar power. The installed capacity of battery energy storage system (BESS), mainly the lithium ion batteries are increasing significantly in recent years. However, the battery degradation cannot be accurately quantified and integrated into energy management system with existing heuristic battery degradation models. This paper proposed a hierarchical deep learning based battery degradation quantification (HDL-BDQ) model to quantify the battery degradation given scheduled BESS daily operations. Particularly, two sequential and cohesive deep neural networks are proposed to accurately estimate the degree of degradation using inputs of battery operational profiles and it can significantly outperform existing fixed or linear rate based degradation models as well as single-stage deep neural models. Training results show the high accuracy of the proposed system. Moreover, a learning and optimization decoupled algorithm is implemented to strategically take advantage of the proposed HDL-BDQ model in optimization-based look-ahead scheduling (LAS) problems. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HDL-BDQ model in LAS of a microgrid testbed.</description>

Abstract: To provide real-time visibility of physics-based states, phasor measurement units (PMUs) are deployed throughout power networks. PMU data enable real-time grid monitoring and control -- and are essential in transitioning to smarter grids. Various considerations are taken into account when determining the geographic, optimal PMU placements (OPP). This paper focuses on the control-theoretic, observability aspect of OPP. A myriad of studies have investigated observability-based formulations to determine the OPP within a transmission network. However, they have mostly adopted a simplified representation of system dynamics, ignored basic algebraic equations that model power flows, disregarded including renewables such as solar and wind, and did not model their uncertainty. Consequently, this paper revisits the observability-based OPP problem by addressing the literature's limitations. A nonlinear differential algebraic representation (NDAE) of the power system is considered. The system is discretized using various discretization approaches while explicitly accounting for uncertainty. A moving horizon estimation approach is explored to reconstruct the joint differential and algebraic initial states of the system, as a gateway to the OPP problem which is then formulated as a computationally tractable integer program (IP). Comprehensive numerical simulations on standard power networks are conducted to validate the different aspects of this approach and test its robustness to various dynamical conditions.</description>

Abstract: Contaminated and polluted water poses significant threats to human health, necessitating vigilant monitoring of water sources for potential contamination. This paper introduces a low-cost Internet of Things (IoT)-based water quality monitoring system designed to address water quality challenges in rural communities, as demonstrated through a case study conducted in the Philippines. The system consists of two core components. The hardware component of the system, built on Arduino technology and featuring real-time data transmission, focuses on monitoring pH levels, turbidity, and temperature via sensors. The system is equipped to transmit data to a cloud database and send informative messages to mobile numbers, updating users on the status of water supplies. The application component acts as a user interface for accessing and managing data collected by the sensors. The successful deployment of this Water Quality Monitoring (WQM) system not only helps community leaders and health workers monitor water sources but also underscores its potential to empower communities in safeguarding their water sources, thereby contributing to the advancement of clean and safe water access.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Magnetics Model for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines Capturing Saturation and Temperature Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a nonlinear magnetics model for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSMs) that accurately captures the effects of magnetic saturation in the machine iron and variations in rotor temperature on the permanent magnet excitation. The proposed model considers the permanent magnet as a current source rather than the more commonly used flux-linkage source. A comparison of the two modelling approaches is conducted using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for different machine designs as well as experimental validation, where it is shown that the proposed model has substantially better accuracy. The proposed model decouples magnetic saturation and rotor temperature effects in the current/flux-linkage relationship, allowing for adaptive estimation of the PM excitation.</description>

      <title>k-Dimensional Agreement in Multiagent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08999v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a network of agents, we study the problem of designing a distributed algorithm that computes k independent weighted means of the network's initial conditions (namely, the agents agree on a k-dimensional space). Akin to average consensus, this problem finds applications in distributed computing and sensing, where agents seek to simultaneously evaluate k independent functions at a common point by running a single coordination algorithm. We show that linear algorithms can agree on quantities that are oblique projections of the vector of initial conditions, and we provide techniques to design protocols that are compatible with a pre-specified communication graph. More broadly, our results show that a single agreement algorithm can solve $k$ consensus problems simultaneously at a fraction of the complexity of classical approaches but, in general, it requires higher network connectivity.</description>

      <title>Developing Path Planning with Behavioral Cloning and Proximal Policy Optimization for Path-Tracking and Static Obstacle Nudging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05289</link>

Abstract: In autonomous driving, end-to-end methods utilizing Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are becoming more and more common. However, they do not involve explicit reasoning like classic robotics workflow and planning with horizons, resulting in strategies implicit and myopic. In this paper, we introduce a path planning method that uses Behavioral Cloning (BC) for path-tracking and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for static obstacle nudging. It outputs lateral offset values to adjust the given reference waypoints and performs modified path for different controllers. Experimental results show that the algorithm can do path following that mimics the expert performance of path-tracking controllers, and avoid collision to fixed obstacles. The method makes a good attempt at planning with learning-based methods in path planning problems of autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Competency-Aware Planning for Probabilistically Safe Navigation Under Perception Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perception-based navigation systems are useful for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation in complex terrains, where traditional depth-based navigation schemes are insufficient. However, these data-driven methods are highly dependent on their training data and can fail in surprising and dramatic ways with little warning. To ensure the safety of the vehicle and the surrounding environment, it is imperative that the navigation system is able to recognize the predictive uncertainty of the perception model and respond safely and effectively in the face of uncertainty. In an effort to enable safe navigation under perception uncertainty, we develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method to estimate the model's level of familiarity with an input image as a whole and with specific regions in the image. We find that the overall competency score can correctly predict correctly classified, misclassified, and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We also confirm that the regional competency maps can accurately distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar regions across images. We then use this competency information to develop a planning and control scheme that enables effective navigation while maintaining a low probability of error. We find that the competency-aware scheme greatly reduces the number of collisions with unfamiliar obstacles, compared to a baseline controller with no competency awareness. Furthermore, the regional competency information is very valuable in enabling efficient navigation.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Wheel Loader Navigation Using Goal-Conditioned Actor-Critic MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel control method for an autonomous wheel loader, enabling time-efficient navigation to an arbitrary goal pose. Unlike prior works that combine high-level trajectory planners with Model Predictive Control (MPC), we directly enhance the planning capabilities of MPC by integrating a cost function derived from Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, we train an RL agent to solve the pose reaching task in simulation, then incorporate the trained neural network critic as both the stage and terminal cost of an MPC. We show through comprehensive simulations that the resulting MPC inherits the time-efficient behavior of the RL agent, generating trajectories that compare favorably against those found using trajectory optimization. We also deploy our method on a real wheel loader, where we successfully navigate to various goal poses.</description>
