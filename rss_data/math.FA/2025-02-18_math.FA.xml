      <title>$\ell_{p}$ has nontrivial Euclidean distortion growth when $2&lt;p&lt;4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if $2 &lt; p &lt; 4$, then every $n$-point subset of $\ell_{p}$ embeds into a Hilbert space with distortion $o(\log n)$, i.e., with distortion that is asymptotically smaller than what Bourgain's embedding theorem provides for arbitrary $n$-point metric spaces. This has been previously unknown for any $2&lt;p&lt;\infty$. We also prove that for every $2&lt;p&lt;\infty$ the largest possible separation modulus of an $n$-point subset of $\ell_{p}$ is bounded from above and from below by positive constant multiples of $\sqrt{\log n}$ which may depend only on $p$.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the space of compact operators endowed with the numerical radius norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10821v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the space of bounded linear operators on a Banach space equipped with a norm which is equivalent to the operator norm such that the subspace of compact operators is an M-ideal. In particular, we observe that the space of compact operators on $\ell_p$ $(1&lt;p&lt;\infty)$ equipped with the numerical radius norm is an M-ideal whenever the numerical index of $\ell_p$ is not $0$. On the other hand, we show that the space of compact operators on a Banach space containing an isomorphic copy of $\ell_1$ whose numerical index is greater than $1/2$ is not M-ideals. We also study the proximinality, the existence of farthest points and the compact perturbation property for the numerical radius.</description>

      <title>In the graphical Sierpinski gasket, the reverse Riesz transform is unbounded on $L^p$, $p\in (1,2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we proved that the reverse Riesz transform on the graphical Sierpinski gasket is unbounded on $L^p$ for $p\in (1,2)$. Together with previous results, it shows that the Riesz transform on the graphical Sierpinski gasket is bounded on $L^p$ if and only if $p\in (1,2]$ and the reverse Riesz transform is bounded on $L^p$ if and only if $p\in [2,\infty)$.
  Moreover, our method is quite flexible - but requires explicit computations - and hints to the fact that the reverse Riesz transforms is never bounded on $L^p$, $p\in (1,2)$, on graphs with slow diffusions.</description>

      <title>The Scaled Polarity transform and related inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we deal with generalizations of the Mahler volume product for log-concave functions. We show that the polarity transform $\mathcal A$ can be rescaled so that the Mahler product it induces has upper and lower bounds of the same asymptotics. We discuss a similar result for the $\mathcal J$ transform.
  As an application, we extend the K\"onig-Milman duality of entropy result to the class of geometric log-concave functions.</description>

      <title>On the definition of "almost LUR (ALUR)" notion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of almost LUR (ALUR) point is introduced in the paper [P. Bandyopadhyay et al., Some generalizations of locally uniform rotundity, J. Math. Anal. Appl., 252, 906-916 (2000)], where one says that the point $x$ of the unit sphere $S_{X}$ of a Banach space is an almost LUR (ALUR) point of $B_{X}$ if for any sequences $\{x_{n}\}\subseteq B_{X}$ and $\{x_{m}^{\ast}\}\subseteq B_{X^{\ast}}$, the condition $\lim_{m}\lim_{n}x_{m}^{\ast}\left(\frac{x_{n}+x}{2}\right)=1$ implies $\lim_{n}\left\Vert x_{n}-x\right\Vert =0$, without mentioning what is meant by $\lim_{m}\lim_{n}\gamma_{m,n}=\gamma$ for $\gamma$, $\gamma_{m,n}\in\mathbb{R}$; $X$ is ALUR if $X$ is almost LUR at any $x\in S_{X}$. Of course, the natural definition for this iterated limit would be that for each $m$ sufficiently large there exists $\mu_{m}:=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\gamma_{m,n}\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\gamma =\lim_{m\rightarrow\infty}\mu_{m}$. However, as seen in some proofs where $\lim_{m}\lim_{n}$ appears, this interpretation is not confirmed. In this paper we examine several works in which almost LUR is mentioned and, especially, the proofs of those results in which the above definition of "almost LUR" point (or space) is invoked. Moreover, we analyze similar problems related to the notion CWALUR which extend ALUR. Furthermore, we mention several gaps in the proofs of some results. Finally, we propose the change of $\lim_{m}\lim_{n}$ by $\lim_{m}\liminf_{n}$ in the definitions of several types of ALUR points; moreover, we provide the complete proofs of two results from the literature in which $\lim_{m}\lim_{n}$ were used effectively, using $\lim_{m}\liminf_{n}$ instead.</description>

      <title>Convolution-type operators in grand Lorentz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a novel grand Lorentz space-that we believe is appropriate for critical cases-that lies "between" the Lorentz-Karamata space and the recently defined grand Lorentz space from [1]. We prove both Young's and O'Neil's inequalities in the newly introduced grand Lorentz spaces, which allows us to derive a Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev-type inequality. We also discuss K\"othe duality for grand Lorentz spaces, from which we obtain a new K\"othe dual space theorem in grand Lebesgue spaces.</description>

      <title>Empirical plunge profiles of time-frequency localization operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For time-frequency localization operators with symbol $R\Omega$, we work out the exact large $R$ eigenvalue behavior for rotationally invariant $\Omega$ and conjecture that the same relation holds for all scaled symbols $R \Omega$ as long as the window is the standard Gaussian. Specifically, we conjecture that the $k$-th eigenvalue of the localization operator with symbol $R\Omega$ converges to $\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{erfc}\big( \sqrt{2\pi}\frac{k-|R\Omega|}{|\partial R\Omega|} \big)$ as $R \to \infty$. To support the conjecture, we compute the eigenvalues of discrete frame multipliers with various symbols using LTFAT and find that they agree with the behavior of the conjecture to a large degree.</description>

      <title>A characterization of generalized Lipschitz classes by the rate of convergence of semi-discrete operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a comprehensive characterization of the generalized Lipschitz classes through the study of the rate of convergence of a family of semi-discrete sampling operators, of Durrmeyer type, in $L^p$-setting. To achieve this goal, we provide direct approximation results, which lead to quantitative estimates based on suitable $K$-functionals in Sobolev spaces and, consequently, on higher-order moduli of smoothness. Additionally, we introduce a further approach employing the celebrated Hardy-Littlewood maximal inequality to weaken the assumptions required on the kernel functions. These direct theorems are essential for obtaining qualitative approximation results in suitable Lipschitz and generalized Lipschitz classes, as they also provide conditions for studying the rate of convergence when functions belonging to Sobolev spaces are considered. The converse implication is, in general, delicate, and actually consists in addressing an inverse approximation problem allowing to deduce regularity properties of a function from a given rate of convergence. Thus, through both direct and inverse results, we establish the desired characterization of the considered Lipschitz classes based on the $L^p$-convergence rate of Durrmeyer sampling operators. Finally, we provide remarkable applications of the theory, based on suitable combinations of kernels that satisfy the crucial Strang-Fix type condition used here allowing to both enhance the rate of convergence and to predict the signals.</description>

      <title>Coupled Ising-Potts Model: Rich Sets of Critical Temperatures and Translation-Invariant Gibbs Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a coupled Ising-Potts model on Cayley trees of order $ k \geq 2 $. This model involves spin vectors $ (s, \sigma) $, and generalizes both the Ising and Potts models by incorporating interactions between two types of spins: $s = \pm 1$ and $\sigma = 1, \dots, q$. It is applicable to a wide range of systems, including multicomponent alloys, spin glasses, biological systems, networks, and social models.
  In this paper, we find some translation-invariant splitting Gibbs measures (TISGMs) and show, for $k\geq 2$, that at sufficiently low temperatures, the number of such measures is at least $2^{q}+1$. This is not an exact upper bound; for $k=2$ and $q=5$, we demonstrate that the number of TISGMs reaches the exact bound of 335, which is much larger than $2^5+1=33$. We prove, for $q=5$ that there are 12 critical temperatures at which the number of TISGMs changes, and we provide the exact number of TISGMs for each intermediate temperature. Additionally, we identify temperature regions where three TISGMs, close to the free measure, are either extreme or non-extreme among all Gibbs measures.
  We also show that the coupled Ising-Potts model exhibits properties absent in the individual Ising and Potts models. In particular, we observe the following new phenomena:
  1. In both the Ising and Potts models, if a Gibbs measure exists at some temperature $T_0$, then it exists for all $T&lt;T_0$. However, in the coupled Ising-Potts model, some TISGMs may only exist at intermediate temperatures (neither very low nor very high).
  2. The 5-state Potts model has three critical temperatures and up to 31 TISGMs. We show that for $q=5$, the coupled Ising-Potts model has four times as many critical temperatures and approximately 11 times as many TISGMs. Thus, our model modifies the phase structure more rapidly and exhibits a significantly richer class of splitting Gibbs measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a solution of Exercise 1.2.1 of [2] which yields a short new proof of a key step in one of proofs of Brouwer's fixed point theorem, 1910. A few people asked the author about the details of the solution and they might be interesting to a broader audience. Our approach is absolutely different from the ones using algebraic or differential topology or differential calculus and is based on a simple observation which somehow escaped many authors treating this theorem in the past.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Permutation Invariant Polynomials by Transformers: Efficient Construction in Column-Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers are a type of neural network that have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, particularly in natural language processing tasks. Motivated by this success, research on the theoretical understanding of transformers has garnered significant attention. A notable example is the mathematical analysis of their approximation power, which validates the empirical expressive capability of transformers. In this study, we investigate the ability of transformers to approximate column-symmetric polynomials, an extension of symmetric polynomials that take matrices as input. Consequently, we establish an explicit relationship between the size of the transformer network and its approximation capability, leveraging the parameter efficiency of transformers and their compatibility with symmetry by focusing on the algebraic properties of symmetric polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical kernel ridge regression problem aims to find the best fit for the output $Y$ as a function of the input data $X\in \mathbb{R}^d$, with a fixed choice of regularization term imposed by a given choice of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, such as a Sobolev space. Here we consider a generalization of the kernel ridge regression problem, by introducing an extra matrix parameter $U$, which aims to detect the scale parameters and the feature variables in the data, and thereby improve the efficiency of kernel ridge regression. This naturally leads to a nonlinear variational problem to optimize the choice of $U$. We study various foundational mathematical aspects of this variational problem, and in particular how this behaves in the presence of multiscale structures in the data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monotonicity of a mapping implies its pseudomonotonicity and hence quasimonotonocity, the converse is not true. In this note we intend to study the situations under which quasimono tonicity of a mapping implies its monotonicity. Thus we generalize some results in the literature related to the connection between monotonocity and its generalized classes for multi-valued mappings via translation maps in real topological spaces. No differentiability assumption is required but continuity assumption is imposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex operator systems are an important category containing the C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras, which is increasingly of interest in modern analysis and also in modern quantum physics (such as quantum information theory). They have an extensive theory, and have very important applications in all of these subjects. We present here the real case of the theory of (complex) operator systems, and also the real case of their remarkable tensor product theory, due in the complex case to Paulsen and his coauthors and students (such as Kavruk), building on pioneering earlier work of Kirchberg and others. For example in the final two sections of our paper we study real versions of the Kirchberg conjectures etc, and show that they are equivalent. We also develop very many foundational structural results for real operator systems, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic constructions in the subject.</description>

Abstract: Let $S_{n}f$ denote the $n$th partial sum of the Vilenkin-Fourier series of a function $f \in L^{1}(G)$. For $1 &lt; p_{-} \leq p_{+} &lt; \infty$, we characterize all exponents $p(\cdot)$ for which the convergence of $S_{n}f$ to $f$ in $L^{p(\cdot)}(G)$ holds whenever $f \in L^{p(\cdot)}(G)$.</description>

      <title>A Complex Geometric Approach to the Discrete Gabor Transform and Localization Operators on the Flat Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, the discrete Gabor transform was connected to a Gabor transform with a time frequency domain given by the flat torus. We show that the corresponding Bargmann spaces can be expressed as theta line bundles on Abelian varieties. We give applications of this viewpoint to frame results for the discrete Gabor transform. In particular, we get results which hold in higher dimension. We also give an application to asymptotics of restriction operators which arises from the asymptotic behavior of Bergman kernels for high tensor powers.</description>

      <title>Free dilations of families of $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups and applications to evolution families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commuting families of contractions or contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups on Hilbert spaces often fail to admit power dilations resp. simultaneous unitary dilations which are themselves commutative (see [31, 11, 13]). In the \emph{non-commutative} setting, Sz.-Nagy [41] and Bo\.{z}ejko [4] provided means to dilate arbitrary families of contractions. The present work extends this discrete-time result to families $\{T_{i}\}_{i \in I}$ of contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups. We refer to these dilations as continuous-time \emph{free unitary dilations} and present three distinct approaches to obtain them: 1) An explicit derivation applicable to semigroups that arise as interpolations; 2) A full proof with an explicit construction, via the theory of co-generators \`{a} la S\l{}oci\'{n}ski [37, 38] as well as a version for topologised index sets via a reformulation of the Trotter--Kato theorem for co-generators, leading to applications to evolution families; and 3) A second full proof based on the abstract structure of semigroups, which admits a natural reformulation to semigroup defined over topological free products of $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ and leads to various residuality results.</description>

      <title>Vlasov Equations on Directed Hypergraph Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a framework to investigate the mean field limit (MFL) of interacting particle systems on directed hypergraphs. We provide a non-trivial measure-theoretic viewpoint and make extensions of directed hypergraphs as directed hypergraph measures (DHGMs), which are measure-valued functions on a compact metric space. These DHGMs can be regarded as hypergraph limits which include limits of a sequence of hypergraphs that are sparse, dense, or of intermediate densities. Our main results show that the Vlasov equation on DHGMs are well-posed and its solution can be approximated by empirical distributions of large networks of higher-order interactions. The results are applied to a Kuramoto network in physics, an epidemic network, and an ecological network, all of which include higher-order interactions. To prove the main results on the approximation and well-posedness of the Vlasov equation on DHGMs, we robustly generalize the method of [Kuehn, Xu. Vlasov equations on digraph measures, JDE, 339 (2022), 261--349] to higher-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for Random Quadratic Transportation Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the validity of asymptotic limits for the general transportation problem between random i.i.d. points and their common distribution, with respect to the squared Euclidean distance cost, in any dimension larger than three. Previous results were essentially limited to the two (or one) dimensional case, or to distributions whose absolutely continuous part is uniform.
  The proof relies upon recent advances in the stability theory of optimal transportation, combined with functional analytic techniques and some ideas from quantitative stochastic homogenization. The key tool we develop is a quantitative upper bound for the usual quadratic optimal transportation problem in terms of its boundary variant, where points can be freely transported along the boundary. The methods we use are applicable to more general random measures, including occupation measure of Brownian paths, and may open the door to further progress on challenging problems at the interface of analysis, probability, and discrete mathematics.</description>

      <title>Shape Derivatives of the Eigenvalues of the De Rham Complex for Lipschitz Deformations and Variable Coefficients: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study eigenvalue problems for the de Rham complex on varying three dimensional domains. Our analysis includes the Helmholtz equation as well as the Maxwell system with mixed boundary conditions and non-constant coefficients. We provide Hadamard-type formulas for the shape derivatives under weak regularity assumptions on the domain and its perturbations. Our proofs are based on abstract results adapted to varying Hilbert complexes. As a bypass product of our analysis we give a proof of the celebrated Helmann-Feynman theorem both for simple and multiple eigenvalues of suitable families of self-adjoint operators in Hilbert space depending on possibly infinite dimensional parameters. This series of papers consists of Parts I and II.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Inequality for Local Log-Polyak-Lojasiewicz Measures : Non-asymptotic Analysis in Low-temperature Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Potential functions in highly pertinent applications, such as deep learning in over-parameterized regime, are empirically observed to admit non-isolated minima. To understand the convergence behavior of stochastic dynamics in such landscapes, we propose to study the class of \logPLmeasure\ measures $\mu_\epsilon \propto \exp(-V/\epsilon)$, where the potential $V$ satisfies a local Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P\L) inequality, and its set of local minima is provably \emph{connected}. Notably, potentials in this class can exhibit local maxima and we characterize its optimal set S to be a compact $\mathcal{C}^2$ \emph{embedding submanifold} of $\mathbb{R}^d$ without boundary. The \emph{non-contractibility} of S distinguishes our function class from the classical convex setting topologically. Moreover, the embedding structure induces a naturally defined Laplacian-Beltrami operator on S, and we show that its first non-trivial eigenvalue provides an \emph{$\epsilon$-independent} lower bound for the \Poincare\ constant in the \Poincare\ inequality of $\mu_\epsilon$. As a direct consequence, Langevin dynamics with such non-convex potential $V$ and diffusion coefficient $\epsilon$ converges to its equilibrium $\mu_\epsilon$ at a rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon)$, provided $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. Here $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ hides logarithmic terms.</description>
