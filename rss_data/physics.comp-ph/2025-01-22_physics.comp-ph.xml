      <title>Adomian decomposition method reformulated using dimensionless nonlinear perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Adomian decomposition method (ADM) is a universal approach to solving governing equations in various engineering and technological applications. The applicability of the ADM is almost limitless due to its universal applicability, but its convergence rate and numerical accuracy are sensitive to the number of truncated terms in series solutions. More importantly, Adomian formalism still holds unresolved issues regarding the mismatch of the order of the expansion parameter. The current work provides an in-depth analysis of Adomian's decomposition method, Lyapunov's stability theory, and the nonlinear perturbation theory to resolve the fundamental mismatch with physical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Random batch sum-of-Gaussians algorithm for molecular dynamics simulations of Yukawa systems in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yukawa systems have drawn widespread interest across various applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel random batch sum-of-Gaussians (RBSOG) algorithm for molecular dynamics simulations of 3D Yukawa systems with periodic boundary conditions. We develop a sum-of-Gaussians (SOG) decomposition of the Yukawa kernel, dividing the interactions into near-field and far-field components. The near-field component, singular but compactly supported in a local domain, is calculated directly. The far-field component, represented as a sum of smooth Gaussians, is treated using the random batch approximation in Fourier space with an adaptive importance sampling strategy to reduce the variance of force calculations. Unlike the traditional Ewald decomposition, which introduces discontinuities and significant truncation error at the cutoff, the SOG decomposition achieves high-order smoothness and accuracy near the cutoff, allowing for efficient and energy-stable simulations. Additionally, by avoiding the use of the fast Fourier transform, our method achieves optimal O(N) complexity while maintaining high parallel scalability. Finally, unlike previous random batch approaches, the proposed adaptive importance sampling strategy achieves nearly optimal variance reduction across the regime of the coupling parameters. Rigorous theoretical analyses are presented. We validate the performance of RBSOG method through simulations of one-component plasma under weak and strong coupling conditions, using up to 10^6 particles and 1024 CPU cores. As a practical application in fusion ignition, we simulate high-temperature, high-density deuterium-\alpha mixtures to study the energy exchange between deuterium and high-energy \alpha particles. The RBSOG method can be readily extended to other dielectric response functions, offering a promising approach for large-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Multiscale simulation of rarefied polyatomic gas flow via DIG method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel multiscale numerical method is developed to accelerate direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) simulations for polyatomic gases with internal energy. This approach applies the general synthetic iterative scheme to stochastic simulations, removing the inherent restrictions on spatial grid size in DSMC and boosting the evolution of the particle distribution towards a steady state. Firstly, the proposed method intermittently couples the standard DSMC solver with the solution of steady-state macroscopic synthetic equations derived from the kinetic equation for polyatomic gases. These synthetic equations, encompassing accurate constitutive relations and relaxation rates, ensure applicability across the entire flow regime. Secondly, the particle distribution within the DSMC framework is adjusted to align with the solution of the macroscopic equations, significantly accelerating convergence to the steady-state solution. Finally, an adaptive treatment is implemented for the constitutive relations. Higher-order terms extracted from DSMC are applied only in rarefied regions where the local Knudsen number exceeds a predefined threshold. The fast convergence and asymptotic-preserving properties of the proposed method are demonstrated through several numerical simulations, in which it achieves remarkable speedups compared to standard DSMC, particularly in the near-continuum regime.</description>

      <title>Nested Sampling for Exploring Lennard-Jones Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lennard-Jones clusters, while an easy system, have a significant number of non equivalent configurations that increases rapidly with the number of atoms in the cluster. Here, we aim at determining the cluster partition function; we use the nested sampling algorithm, which transforms the multidimensional integral into a one-dimensional one, to perform this task. In particular, we use the nested_fit program, which implements slice sampling as search algorithm. We study here the 7-atoms and 36-atoms clusters and then look at the computational cost of nested_fit with and without parallelisation. We find that nested_fit is able to recover phase transitions and find different stable configurations of the cluster. Furthermore, the implementation of the slice sampling algorithm has a clear impact on the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Extreme scaling of the metadynamics of paths algorithm on the pre-exascale JUWELS Booster supercomputer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD)-based path sampling algorithms are a very important class of methods used to study the energetics and kinetics of rare (bio)molecular events. They sample the highly informative but highly unlikely reactive trajectories connecting different metastable states of complex (bio)molecular systems. The metadynamics of paths (MoP) method proposed by Mandelli, Hirshberg, and Parrinello [Pys. Rev. Lett. 125 2, 026001 (2020)] is based on the Onsager-Machlup path integral formalism. This provides an analytical expression for the probability of sampling stochastic trajectories of given duration. In practice, the method samples reactive paths via metadynamics simulations performed directly in the phase space of all possible trajectories. Its parallel implementation is in principle infinitely scalable, allowing arbitrarily long trajectories to be simulated. Paving the way for future applications to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein-ligand (un)binding, a problem of great pharmaceutical interest, we present here the efficient implementation of MoP in the HPC-oriented biomolecular simulation software GROMACS. Our benchmarks on a membrane protein (150,000 atoms) show an unprecedented weak scaling parallel efficiency of over 70% up to 3200 GPUs on the pre-exascale JUWELS Booster machine at the J\"ulich Supercomputing Center.</description>

      <title>Numerical Modeling of Oxygen Diffusion in Tissue Spheroids Undergoing Fusion Using Functional Representation and Finite Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A three-dimensional cell culture called a spheroid serves as a foundational entity in a wide variety of modern tissue engineering applications, including 3D-bioprinting and preclinical drug testing. Lack of oxygen within tissue spheroids hinders metabolism of cells and eventually leads to cell death. Prevention of necrosis is crucial to success of tissue engineering methods and such prevention requires estimation of cell viability in the spheroid. We propose a novel approach for numerical modeling of diffusion in tissue spheroids during their fusion. The approach is based on numerical solutions of partial differential equations and the application of Functional Representations (FRep) framework for geometric modeling. We present modeling of oxygen diffusion based on meshes derived from the geometry of fusing spheroids, a method for selecting optimal spheroid size, and several statistics for estimating cellular viability. Our findings provide insights into oxygen diffusion in three-dimensional cell cultures thus improving the robustness of biotechnological methods that employ tissue spheroids.</description>

      <title>On the practical applicability of modern DFT functionals for chemical computations. Case study of DM21 applicability for geometry optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is probably the most promising approach for quantum chemistry calculations considering its good balance between calculations precision and speed. In recent years, several neural network-based functionals have been developed for exchange-correlation energy approximation in DFT, DM21 developed by Google Deepmind being the most notable between them. This study focuses on evaluating the efficiency of DM21 functional in predicting molecular geometries, with a focus on the influence of oscillatory behavior in neural network exchange-correlation functionals. We implemented geometry optimization in PySCF for the DM21 functional in geometry optimization problem, compared its performance with traditional functionals, and tested it on various benchmarks. Our findings reveal both the potential and the current challenges of using neural network functionals for geometry optimization in DFT. We propose a solution extending the practical applicability of such functionals and allowing to model new substances with their help.</description>

      <title>Accurate and thermodynamically consistent hydrogen equation of state for planetary modeling with flow matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of the equation of state of dense hydrogen is essential for understanding gas giants. Currently, there is still no consensus on methods for calculating its entropy, which play a fundamental role and can result in qualitatively different predictions for Jupiter's interior. Here, we investigate various aspects of entropy calculation for dense hydrogen based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we employ the recently developed flow matching method to validate the accuracy of the traditional thermodynamic integration approach. We then clearly identify pitfalls in previous attempts and propose a reliable framework for constructing the hydrogen equation of state, which is accurate and thermodynamically consistent across a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions. This allows us to conclusively address the long-standing discrepancies in Jupiter's adiabat among earlier studies, demonstrating the potential of our approach for providing reliable equations of state of diverse materials.</description>

      <title>Effects of particle elongation on dense granular flows down a rough inclined plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Granular materials in nature are nearly always non-spherical, but particle shape effects in granular flow remain largely elusive. This study uses discrete element method simulations to investigate how elongated particle shapes affect the mobility of dense granular flows down a rough incline. For a range of systematically varied particle length-to-diameter aspect ratios (AR), we run simulations with various flow thicknesses $h$ and slope angles $\theta$ to extract the well-known $h_\textrm{stop}(\theta)$ curves (below which the flow ceases) and the $Fr$-$h/h_\textrm{stop}$ relations following Pouliquen's approach, where $Fr=u/\sqrt{gh}$ is the Froude number, $u$ is the mean flow velocity, and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration. The slope $\beta$ of the $Fr$-$h/h_\textrm{stop}$ relations shows an intriguing S-shaped dependence on AR, with two plateaus at small and large AR, respectively, transitioning with a sharp increase. We understand this S-shaped dependence by examining statistics of particle orientation, alignment, and hindered rotation. We find that the rotation ability of weakly elongated particles ($\textrm{AR}\lesssim1.3$) remains similar to spheres, leading to the first plateau in the $\beta$-AR relation, whereas the effects of particle orientation saturates beyond $\textrm{AR}\approx2.0$, explaining the second plateau. An empirical sigmoidal function is proposed to capture this non-linear dependence. The findings are expected to enhance our understanding of how particle shape affects the flow of granular materials from both the flow- and particle-scale perspectives.</description>

      <title>Density of States Calculation of CeO$_2$ Based on VASP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, the Density of States (DOS) of CeO$_2$ was analyzed in detail using the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method based on VASP software. As an important functional material, CeO$_2$ finds wide applications in catalysis, optics, and electronic devices. Through structural optimization, self-consistent electronic calculations, and non-self-consistent calculations, we thoroughly investigated the crystal structure and electronic energy level distribution of CeO$_2$. The lattice parameter optimization results from the structural calculations indicated a stable crystal structure for CeO$_2$. Self-consistent electronic calculations revealed a bandgap of approximately 2.403 eV, with the valence band maximum primarily contributed by O 2p orbitals and the conduction band minimum mainly originating from Ce 4f orbitals. Non-self-consistent calculations further demonstrated the total DOS and partial DOS of CeO$_2$, confirming the significant roles of Ce 4f and O 2p states in its electronic conduction and optical properties. These results not only provide theoretical support for the applications of CeO$_2$ in catalysis and electronic materials but also deepen our understanding of its fundamental electronic structural characteristics, offering guidance for the design and development of novel CeO$_2$-based materials.</description>

      <title>Direct unconstrained optimization of excited states in density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital-optimized density functional theory (DFT) has emerged as an alternative to time-dependent (TD) DFT capable of describing difficult excited states with significant electron density redistribution, such as charge-transfer, Rydberg, and double-electron excitations. Here, a simple method is developed to solve the main problem of the excited-state optimization -- the variational collapse of the excited states onto the ground state. In this method, called variable-metric time-independent DFT (VM TIDFT), the electronic states are allowed to be nonorthogonal during the optimization but their orthogonality is gradually enforced with a continuous penalty function. With nonorthogonal electronic states, VM TIDFT can use molecular orbital coefficients as independent variables, which results in a closed-form analytical expression for the gradient and allows to employ any of the multiple unconstrained optimization algorithms that guarantees convergence of the excited-state optimization. Numerical tests on multiple molecular systems show that the variable-metric optimization of excited states performed with a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm is robust and produces accurate energies for well-behaved excitations and, unlike TDDFT, for more challenging charge-transfer and double-electron excitations.</description>

      <title>Automatic Calibration of Mesoscopic Traffic Simulation Using Vehicle Trajectory Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic simulation models have long been popular in modern traffic planning and operation applications. Efficient calibration of simulation models is usually a crucial step in a simulation study. However, traditional calibration procedures are often resource-intensive and time-consuming, limiting the broader adoption of simulation models. In this study, a vehicle trajectory-based automatic calibration framework for mesoscopic traffic simulation is proposed. The framework incorporates behavior models from both the demand and the supply sides of a traffic network. An optimization-based network flow estimation model is designed for demand and route choice calibration. Dimensionality reduction techniques are incorporated to define the zoning system and the path choice set. A stochastic approximation model is established for capacity and driving behavior parameter calibration. The applicability and performance of the calibration framework are demonstrated through a case study for the City of Birmingham network in Michigan.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories: emergent properties from Tensor Network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis develops advanced Tensor Network (TN) methods to address Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), overcoming limitations in real-time dynamics and finite-density regimes. A novel dressed-site formalism is introduced, enabling efficient truncation of gauge fields while preserving gauge invariance for both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. This formalism is successfully applied to SU(2) Yang-Mills LGTs in two dimensions, providing the first TN simulations of this system and revealing critical aspects of its phase diagram and non-equilibrium behavior, such as a Quantum Many-Body (QMB) scarring dynamics. A generalization of the dressed-site formalism is proposed through a new fermion-to-qubit mapping for general lattice fermion theories, revealing powerful for classical and quantum simulations. Numerical innovations, including the use of optimal space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve to preserve locality in high-dimensional simulations, further enhance the efficiency of these methods. Together with high-performance computing techniques, these advances open current and future development pathways toward optimized, efficient, and faster simulations on scales comparable to Monte Carlo state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Explicit near-optimal quantum algorithm for solving the advection-diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An explicit near-optimal quantum algorithm is proposed for modeling dissipative initial-value problems. This method, based on the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulations (LCHS), approximates a target nonunitary operator as a weighted sum of Hamiltonian evolutions, thereby emulating a dissipative problem by mixing various time scales. We propose an efficient encoding of this algorithm into a quantum circuit based on a simple coordinate transformation that turns the dependence on the summation index into a trigonometric function and significantly simplifies block-encoding. The resulting circuit has high success probability and scales logarithmically with the number of terms in the LCHS sum and linearly with time. We verify the quantum circuit and its scaling by simulating it on a digital emulator of fault-tolerant quantum computers and, as a test problem, solve the advection-diffusion equation. The proposed algorithm can be used for modeling a wide class of nonunitary initial-value problems including the Liouville equation and linear embeddings of nonlinear systems.</description>

Abstract: Interatomic potentials are essential for driving molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, directly impacting the reliability of predictions regarding the physical and chemical properties of materials. In recent years, machine-learned potentials (MLPs), trained against first-principles calculations, have become a new paradigm in materials modeling as they provide a desirable balance between accuracy and computational cost. The neuroevolution potential (NEP) approach, implemented in the open-source GPUMD software, has emerged as a promising machine-learned potential, exhibiting impressive accuracy and exceptional computational efficiency. This review provides a comprehensive discussion on the methodological and practical aspects of the NEP approach, along with a detailed comparison with other representative state-of-the-art MLP approaches in terms of training accuracy, property prediction, and computational efficiency. We also demonstrate the application of the NEP approach to perform accurate and efficient MD simulations, addressing complex challenges that traditional force fields typically can not tackle. Key examples include structural properties of liquid and amorphous materials, chemical order in complex alloy systems, phase transitions, surface reconstruction, material growth, primary radiation damage, fracture in two-dimensional materials, nanoscale tribology, and mechanical behavior of compositionally complex alloys under various mechanical loadings. This review concludes with a summary and perspectives on future extensions to further advance this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Electronic States and Mechanical Behaviors of Phosphorus Carbide Nanotubes -- Structural and Quantum Phase Transitions in a Quasi-one-dimensional Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials can manifest exotic electronic properties in manners that are distinct from the bulk phase or other low-dimensional systems. Helical symmetries in such materials -- e.g., nanotubes with intrinsic or applied twist -- can simultaneously lead to strong electronic correlation and anomalous transport behavior. However, these materials remain underexplored, in part due to computational challenges. Using specialized symmetry-adapted first-principles calculations, we show that mono-layer $P_2C_3$ -- identified in a previous letter to possess ``double Kagome bands'' -- exhibits a number of striking properties when rolled up into phosphorous carbide nanotubes ($P_2C_3$NTs). Both armchair and zigzag $P_2C_3$NTs are stable at room temperature and display a degenerate combination of Dirac points and electronic flat bands at the Fermi level. Notably, these flat bands are highly resilient to elastic deformations. Large strains can transform the nanotube structure from honeycomb-kagome to ``brick-wall'', and trigger multiple quantum phase transitions. Edge states in $P_2C_3$NTs, spin-degeneracy lifting induced by vacancies and dopants, and strain-tunable magnetism are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Nanopillar-Driven Antibacterial Surfaces: Elucidating Bactericidal Mechanisms and Engineering Nanostructures for Enhanced Efficacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insects like dragonflies and cicadas possess nanoprotusions on their wings that rupture bacterial membranes upon contact, inspiring synthetic antibacterial surfaces mimicking this phenomenon. Designing such biomimetic surfaces requires understanding the mechanical interaction between nanopillars and bacterial membranes. However, the small scales of these interactions pose challenges. Molecular Dynamics simulations offer precise and efficient modeling at these scales. This study presents a coarse-grained membrane model to explore the mechanical responses of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial membranes to nanopillar arrays. By varying bacterial shapes (spherical and cylindrical), membrane bending rigidity, and loading rates, we identified two distinct failure mechanisms. Low bending rigidity, typical of gram-negative bacteria, leads to tearing near nanopillar tips, contrary to prior assumptions. High bending rigidity, characteristic of gram-positive bacteria, results in puncturing at contact points. Gram-positive bacteria are more resistant, requiring a threefold increase in loading rate for effective piercing. Nanopillar height and spacing also critically impact bactericidal efficacy: greater heights enhance activity beyond a critical threshold, while increased spacing reduces efficacy. This simplified coarse-grained model, representing bacterial membranes with high fidelity, enables cost-effective, full-scale simulations over extended periods. Our findings provide essential insights for optimizing nanopillared surface designs, advancing antibacterial technology through tailored height and spacing configurations.</description>

      <title>Wakefield-induced THz wave generation in a hybrid dielectric-plasma cylindrical waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, the generation of THz radiation through wakefield excitation in a cylindrical dielectric plasma waveguide is investigated. The proposed hybrid dielectric-plasma wakefield structure combines the advantages of dielectric materials and plasma, creating a versatile platform for high-performance applications and advanced THz radiation generation. By leveraging the strengths of both techniques, this hybrid configuration achieves enhanced gradients and optimized THz wave output. The mechanism involves a high-energy laser pulse propagating through a plasma-loaded dielectric waveguide, inducing wakefields that drive THz wave emission. This dual capability underscores the versatility of the proposed structure, offering significant advancements in THz wave generation technologies. To support the theoretical analysis, numerical simulations were employed using the Fourier-Bessel Particle-In-Cell (FBPIC) method and the COMSOL Multiphysics package. The simulation modeled the wakefield generation process and validated the propagation of electromagnetic waves. A comprehensive parametric study examined the effects of various parameters including dielectric thickness, an external DC magnetic field, laser pulse length, driver beam radius, and total current, on the wakefield generated THz radiation. Through systematic variation of these parameters, the study aims to elucidate the controlled features of the resulting fields and optimize THz radiation.</description>

      <title>Evaluating many-body stabilizer R\'enyi entropy by sampling reduced Pauli strings: singularities, volume law, and nonlocal magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo scheme for evaluating the $\alpha$-stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) with any integer $\alpha\ge 2$. By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as a ratio of generalized partition functions, we prove that it can be simulated by sampling reduced Pauli strings within a reduced configuration space. This allows for straightforward computation of the values and derivatives of $\alpha$-SRE using techniques such as reweight-annealing and thermodynamic integration. Moreover, our approach separates the free energy contribution in $\alpha$-SRE, thus the contribution solely from the characteristic function can be studied, which is directly tied to magic. In our applications to the ground states of 1D and 2D transverse field Ising (TFI) model, we reveal that the behavior of $2$-SRE is governed by the interplay between the characteristic function and the free energy contributions, with singularities hidden in both of their derivatives at quantum critical points. This indicates that $\alpha$-SRE does not necessarily exhibit a peak at the quantum critical point for a general many-body system. We also study the volume-law corrections to the ground-state magic. These corrections slightly violate the strict volume law and suggest discontinuity at quantum critical points, which we attribute to the abrupt change of the ground-state magical structure. Our findings suggest that volume-law corrections of magic are stronger diagnostics for criticalities than the full-state magic. Lastly, we study the finite-temperature phase transition of the 2D TFI model, where the $2$-SRE is not a well-defined magic measure. The nonphysical results we obtain also prove the ineffectiveness of $2$-SRE for mixed states. Our method enables scalable and efficient evaluation of $\alpha$-SRE in large-scale quantum systems, providing a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Strong phonon-mediated high temperature superconductivity in Li$_2$AuH$_6$ under ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used our developed AI search engine~(InvDesFlow) to perform extensive investigations regarding ambient stable superconducting hydrides. A cubic structure Li$_2$AuH$_6$ with Au-H octahedral motifs is identified to be a candidate. After performing thermodynamical analysis, we provide a feasible route to experimentally synthesize this material via the known LiAu and LiH compounds under ambient pressure. The further first-principles calculations suggest that Li$_2$AuH$_6$ shows a high superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) $\sim$ 140 K under ambient pressure. The H-1$s$ electrons strongly couple with phonon modes of vibrations of Au-H octahedrons as well as vibrations of Li atoms, where the latter is not taken seriously in other previously similar cases. Hence, different from previous claims of searching metallic covalent bonds to find high-$T_c$ superconductors, we emphasize here the importance of those phonon modes with strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC). And we suggest that one can intercalate atoms into binary or ternary hydrides to introduce more potential phonon modes with strong EPC, which is an effective approach to find high-$T_c$ superconductors within multicomponent compounds.</description>

      <title>Transitions to synchronization in adaptive multilayer networks with higher-order interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world networks are often characterized by simultaneous interactions between multiple agents that adapt themselves due to feedback from the environment. In this article, we investigate the dynamics of an adaptive multilayer network of Kuramoto oscillators with higher-order interactions. The dynamics of the nodes within the layers are adaptively controlled through the global synchronization order parameter with the adaptations present alongside both pairwise and higher-order interactions. We first explore the dynamics with a linear form of the adaptation function and discover a tiered transition to synchronization, along with continuous and abrupt routes to synchronization. Multiple routes to synchronization are also observed due to the presence of multiple stable states. We investigate the bifurcations behind these routes and illustrate the basin of attraction to attain a deeper understanding of the multistability, that is born as a consequence of the adaptive interactions. When nonlinear adaptation is infused in the system, we observe three different kinds of tiered transition to synchronization, viz., continuous tiered, discontinuous tiered, and tiered transition with a hysteretic region. Our study provides an overview of how inducting order parameter adaptations in higher-order multilayer networks can influence dynamics and alter the route to synchronization in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Numerical methods and improvements for simulating quasi-static elastoplastic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypo-elastoplasticity is a framework suitable for modeling the mechanics of many hard materials that have small elastic deformation and large plastic deformation. In most laboratory tests for these materials the Cauchy stress is in quasi-static equilibrium. Rycroft et al. discovered a mathematical correspondence between this physical system and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and developed a projection method similar to Chorin's projection method (1968) for incompressible Newtonian fluids. Here, we improve the original projection method to simulate quasi-static hypo-elastoplasticity, by making three improvements. First, drawing inspiration from the second-order projection method for incompressible Newtonian fluids, we formulate a second-order in time numerical scheme for quasi-static hypo-elastoplasticity. Second, we implement a finite element method for solving the elliptic equations in the projection step, which provides both numerical benefits and flexibility. Third, we develop an adaptive global time-stepping scheme, which can compute accurate solutions in fewer timesteps. Our numerical tests use an example physical model of a bulk metallic glass based on the shear transformation zone theory, but the numerical methods can be applied to any elastoplastic material.</description>

      <title>Distilling Machine Learning's Added Value: Pareto Fronts in Atmospheric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The added value of machine learning for weather and climate applications is measurable through performance metrics, but explaining it remains challenging, particularly for large deep learning models. Inspired by climate model hierarchies, we propose that a full hierarchy of Pareto-optimal models, defined within an appropriately determined error-complexity plane, can guide model development and help understand the models' added value. We demonstrate the use of Pareto fronts in atmospheric physics through three sample applications, with hierarchies ranging from semi-empirical models with minimal parameters to deep learning algorithms. First, in cloud cover parameterization, we find that neural networks identify nonlinear relationships between cloud cover and its thermodynamic environment, and assimilate previously neglected features such as vertical gradients in relative humidity that improve the representation of low cloud cover. This added value is condensed into a ten-parameter equation that rivals deep learning models. Second, we establish a machine learning model hierarchy for emulating shortwave radiative transfer, distilling the importance of bidirectional vertical connectivity for accurately representing absorption and scattering, especially for multiple cloud layers. Third, we emphasize the importance of convective organization information when modeling the relationship between tropical precipitation and its surrounding environment. We discuss the added value of temporal memory when high-resolution spatial information is unavailable, with implications for precipitation parameterization. Therefore, by comparing data-driven models directly with existing schemes using Pareto optimality, we promote process understanding by hierarchically unveiling system complexity, with the hope of improving the trustworthiness of machine learning models in atmospheric applications.</description>

Abstract: This study utilises linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) and develops a new machine-learning potential for carbon and nitrogen (GAP-CN), based on the carbon potential (GAP20), to investigate the interaction between carbon self-interstitials and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, focusing on their excited states and diffusion behaviour. From the simulated excited states, 'Bright', 'Spike', and 'Dark' defect configurations are classified based on their absorption spectrum features. Furthermore, machine learning molecular dynamics simulation provides insight into the possible diffusion mechanism of Ci and NV, showing that Ci can diffuse away or recombine with NV. The study yields new insight into the formation of NV defects in diamond for quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for the advection-diffusion equation and the Koopman-von Neumann approach to nonlinear dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an explicit algorithm based on the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulations technique to simulate both the advection-diffusion equation and a nonunitary discretized version of the Koopman-von Neumann formulation of nonlinear dynamics. By including dissipation into the model, through an upwind discretization of the advection operator, we avoid spurious parasitic oscillations which usually accompany standard finite difference discretizations of the advection equation. In contrast to prior works on quantum simulation of nonlinear problems, we explain in detail how different components of the algorithm can be implemented by using the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) methods. In addition, we discuss the general method for implementing the block-encoding (BE) required for QSP and QSVT circuits and provide explicit implementations of the BE oracles tailored to our specific test cases. We simulate the resulting circuit on a digital emulator of quantum fault-tolerant computers and investigate its complexity and success probability. The proposed algorithm is universal and can be used for modeling a broad class of linear and nonlinear differential equations including the KvN and Carleman embeddings of nonlinear systems, the semiclassical Koopman-van Hove (KvH) equation, as well as the advection and Liouville equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chebyshev polynomials have shown significant promise as an efficient tool for both classical and quantum neural networks to solve linear and nonlinear differential equations. In this work, we adapt and generalize this framework in a quantum machine learning setting for a variety of problems, including the 2D Poisson's equation, second-order linear differential equation, system of differential equations, nonlinear Duffing and Riccati equation. In particular, we propose in the quantum setting a modified Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Network (SAPINN) approach, where self-adaptive weights are applied to problems with multi-objective loss functions. We further explore capturing correlations in our loss function using a quantum-correlated measurement, resulting in improved accuracy for initial value problems. We analyse also the use of entangling layers and their impact on the solution accuracy for second-order differential equations. The results indicate a promising approach to the near-term evaluation of differential equations on quantum devices.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo simulation framework for investigating the effect of inter-track coupling on H$_2$O$_2$ productions at ultra-high dose rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Lower production of H$_2$O$_2$ in water is a hallmark of ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) compared to the conventional dose rate (CDR). However, the current computational models based on the predicted yield of H$_2$O$_2$ are in opposite of the experimental data. Methods: We construct an analytical model for the rate equation in the production of H$_2$O$_2$ from \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals and use it as a guide to propose a hypothetical geometrical inhomogeneity in the configuration of particles in the FLASH-UHDR beams. We perform a series of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the track structures for a system of charged particles impinging the medium in the form of clusters and/or bunches. Results: We demonstrate the interplay of diffusion, reaction rates, and overlaps in track-spacing attribute to a lower yield of H$_2$O$_2$ at FLASH-UHDR vs. CDR. This trend is reversed if spacing among the tracks becomes larger than a critical value, with a length scale that is proportional to the diffusion length of \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals modulated by a rate of decay due to recombination with other species, available within a track, and the space among the tracks. The latter is substantial on the suppressing of the H$_2$O$_2$ population at FLASH-UHDR relative to CDR. Conclusions: Based on our analysis of the present work, at FLASH-UHDR, the lower yield in H$_2$O$_2$ can be interpreted as a signature of bunching the particles in beams of ionizing radiation. The beams enter the medium in closely packed clusters and form inhomogeneities in the track-structure distribution. Thus the MC simulations based on the assumption of uniformly distributed tracks are unable to explain the experimental data.</description>

Abstract: We investigate how the computational difficulty of contracting tensor networks depends on the sign structure of the tensor entries. Using results from computational complexity, we observe that the approximate contraction of tensor networks with only positive entries has lower complexity. This raises the question how this transition in computational complexity manifests itself in the hardness of different contraction schemes. We pursue this question by studying random tensor networks with varying bias towards positive entries. First, we consider contraction via Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the transition from hard to easy occurs when the entries become predominantly positive; this can be seen as a tensor network manifestation of the Quantum Monte Carlo sign problem. Second, we analyze the commonly used contraction based on boundary tensor networks. Its performance is governed by the amount of correlations (entanglement) in the tensor network. Remarkably, we find that the transition from hard to easy (i.e., from a volume law to a boundary law scaling of entanglement) occurs already for a slight bias towards a positive mean, and the earlier the larger the bond dimension is. This is in contrast to both expectations and the behavior found in Monte Carlo contraction. We gain further insight into this early transition from the study of an effective statmech model. Finally, we investigate the computational difficulty of computing expectation values of tensor network wavefunctions, i.e., PEPS, where we find that the complexity of entanglement-based contraction always remains low. We explain this by providing a local transformation which maps PEPS expectation values to a positive-valued tensor network. This not only provides insight into the origin of the observed boundary law entanglement scaling, but also suggests new approaches towards PEPS contraction based on positive decompositions.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for an Efficient Normalizing Flow-Based Solution to the Electronic Schrodinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central problem in quantum mechanics involves solving the Electronic Schrodinger Equation for a molecule or material. The Variational Monte Carlo approach to this problem approximates a particular variational objective via sampling, and then optimizes this approximated objective over a chosen parameterized family of wavefunctions, known as the ansatz. Recently neural networks have been used as the ansatz, with accompanying success. However, sampling from such wavefunctions has required the use of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, which is inherently inefficient. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem via an ansatz which is cheap to sample from, yet satisfies the requisite quantum mechanical properties. We prove that a normalizing flow using the following two essential ingredients satisfies our requirements: (a) a base distribution which is constructed from Determinantal Point Processes; (b) flow layers which are equivariant to a particular subgroup of the permutation group. We then show how to construct both continuous and discrete normalizing flows which satisfy the requisite equivariance. We further demonstrate the manner in which the non-smooth nature ("cusps") of the wavefunction may be captured, and how the framework may be generalized to provide induction across multiple molecules. The resulting theoretical framework entails an efficient approach to solving the Electronic Schrodinger Equation.</description>

      <title>Boundary layer stability analysis using the nonlinear One-Way Navier-Stokes approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the One-Way Navier Stokes (OWNS) approach to support nonlinear interactions between waves of different frequencies, which will enable nonlinear analysis of instability and transition. In OWNS, the linearized Navier-Stokes equations are parabolized and solved in the frequency domain as a spatial initial-value (marching) problem. OWNS yields a reduced computational cost compared to global solvers, while also conferring numerous advantages over the parabolized stability equations (PSE), despite its higher computational cost relative to PSE, that we seek to extend to nonlinear analysis. We validate the nonlinear OWNS (NOWNS) method by examining nonlinear evolution of two- and three-dimensional disturbances in a low-speed Blasius boundary layer compared to nonlinear PSE (NPSE) and direct numerical simulation (DNS) results from the literature. We demonstrate that NOWNS can be used to simulate flows involve blowing/suction strips, is more robust to numerical noise, and converges for stronger nonlinearities, as compared to NPSE.</description>

      <title>Impact of Numerical Fluxes on High Order Semidiscrete WENO-DeC Finite Volume Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The numerical flux determines the performance of numerical methods for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we compare a selection of 8 numerical fluxes in the framework of nonlinear semidiscrete finite volume (FV) schemes, based on Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) spatial reconstruction and Deferred Correction (DeC) time discretization. The methodology is implemented and systematically assessed for order of accuracy in space and time up to seven. The numerical fluxes selected in the present study represent the two existing classes of fluxes, namely centred and upwind. Centred fluxes do not explicitly use wave propagation information, while, upwind fluxes do so from the solution of the Riemann problem via a wave model containing $A$ waves. Upwind fluxes include two subclasses: complete and incomplete fluxes. For complete upwind fluxes, $A=E$, where $E$ is the number of characteristic fields in the exact problem. For incomplete upwind ones, $A&lt;E$. Our study is conducted for the one- and two-dimensional Euler equations, for which we consider the following numerical fluxes: Lax-Friedrichs (LxF), First-Order Centred (FORCE), Rusanov (Rus), Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL), Central-Upwind (CU), Low-Dissipation Central-Upwind (LDCU), HLLC, and the flux computed through the exact Riemann solver (Ex.RS). We find that the numerical flux has an effect on the performance of the methods. The magnitude of the effect depends on the type of numerical flux and on the order of accuracy of the scheme. It also depends on the type of problem; that is, whether the solution is smooth or discontinuous, whether discontinuities are linear or nonlinear, whether linear discontinuities are fast- or slowly-moving, and whether the solution is evolved for short or long time.</description>

      <title>Parametric Autoresonance with Time-Delayed Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how a constant time delay influences a parametric autoresonant system. This is a nonlinear system driven by a parametrically chirped force with a negative delay-feedback that maintains adiabatic phase locking with the driving frequency. This phase locking results in a continuous amplitude growth, regardless of parameter changes. Our study reveals a critical threshold for delay strength; above this threshold, autoresonance is sustained, while below it, autoresonance diminishes. We examine the interplay between time delay and autoresonance stability, using multi-scale perturbation methods to derive analytical results, which are corroborated by numerical simulations. Ultimately, the goal is to understand and control autoresonance stability through the time-delay parameters.</description>

      <title>Double Ionization Potential Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster Approach with Full Inclusion of 4-Hole-2-Particle Excitations and Three-Body Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The double ionization potential (DIP) equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) method with a full treatment of 4-hole-2-particle (4$h$-2$p$) correlations and triply excited clusters, abbreviated as DIP-EOMCCSDT(4$h$-2$p$), and its approximate form called DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a)(4$h$-2$p$) have been formulated and implemented in the open-source CCpy package available on GitHub. The resulting codes work with both nonrelativistic and spin-free scalar-relativistic Hamiltonians. By examining the DIPs of a few small molecules, for which accurate reference data are available, we demonstrate that the DIP-EOMCCSDT(4$h$-2$p$) and DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a)(4$h$-2$p$) approaches improve the results obtained using the DIP-EOMCC methods truncated at 3$h$-1$p$ or 4$h$-2$p$ excitations on top of the CC calculations with singles and doubles.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Forecasting of Tomorrow's Solar Wind at 1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the concept of relativity of simultaneity used in the theory of special relativity, a new approach is proposed to simulate future solar wind conditions at any point in the inner solar system. An important distinctive feature of the proposed approach is that the simulation in the solar corona is driven by hourly updated solar magnetograms and is continuously simulated in nearly real time. The model for the inner heliosphere is based on time transformation to a boosted frame of reverence (or spacetime coordinate system) in which the current state of the solar wind at the solar corona -- inner heliosphere boundary and future states of the solar wind are simultaneous. The predictive capability for tomorrow's parameters of the ambient solar wind at 1 AU is achieved by simulating them simultaneously with the current observations of the solar magnetic field, the time offset being due to the use of boosted frame.
  We derive the modified governing equations for both hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics and present a new numerical algorithm that solves the modified governing equations. The proposed method enables an efficient numerical implementation and thus a significantly longer forecast time than traditional solution methods. In the numerical test for transient propagation, the boosted solution for the CME-driven shock arrival at 1AU is 16 hours ahead of the solution at the solar corona -- inner heliosphere boundary.</description>
