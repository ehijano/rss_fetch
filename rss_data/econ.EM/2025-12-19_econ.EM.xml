      <title>xtdml: Double Machine Learning Estimation to Static Panel Data Models with Fixed Effects in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double machine learning (DML) method combines the predictive power of machine learning with statistical estimation to conduct inference about the structural parameter of interest. This paper presents the R package `xtdml`, which implements DML methods for partially linear panel regression models with low-dimensional fixed effects, high-dimensional confounding variables, proposed by Clarke and Polselli (2025). The package provides functionalities to: (a) learn nuisance functions with machine learning algorithms from the `mlr3` ecosystem, (b) handle unobserved individual heterogeneity choosing among first-difference transformation, within-group transformation, and correlated random effects, (c) transform the covariates with min-max normalization and polynomial expansion to improve learning performance. We showcase the use of `xtdml` with both simulated and real longitudinal data.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time Framework for Forecasting Metal Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a real-time forecasting framework for the monthly real prices of four key industrial metals -- aluminum, copper, nickel, and zinc -- whose demand is rising due to their widespread use in manufacturing and low-carbon technologies. To replicate the information set available to forecasters in real time, we construct a new dataset combining daily financial variables with first-release macroeconomic indicators and use nowcasting techniques to address publication lags. Within this real-time environment, we evaluate the predictive accuracy of a broad set of univariate, multivariate, and factor-augmented models, comparing their performance with two industry benchmarks: survey expectations and futures-spot spread models. Results show that although short-run metal price movements remain difficult to predict, medium-term horizons display substantial forecastability. Indicators of manufacturing activity tied to primary metals -- such as new orders and capacity utilization -- significantly improve forecasting accuracy for aluminum and copper, with more moderate gains for zinc and limited improvements for nickel. Futures and survey forecasts generally underperform the real-time econometric models. These findings highlight the value of incorporating timely macroeconomic information into forecasting frameworks for industrial metal markets.</description>

      <title>Exponentially weighted estimands and the exponential family: filtering, prediction and smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose using a discounted version of a convex combination of the log-likelihood with the corresponding expected log-likelihood such that when they are maximized they yield a filter, predictor and smoother for time series. This paper then focuses on working out the implications of this in the case of the canonical exponential family. The results are simple exact filters, predictors and smoothers with linear recursions. A theory for these models is developed and the models are illustrated on simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>Optimal Decision Rules when Payoffs are Partially Identified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11748v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive asymptotically optimal statistical decision rules for discrete choice problems when payoffs depend on a partially-identified parameter $\theta$ and the decision maker can use a point-identified parameter $\mu$ to deduce restrictions on $\theta$. Examples include treatment choice under partial identification and pricing with rich unobserved heterogeneity. Our notion of optimality combines a minimax approach to handle the ambiguity from partial identification of $\theta$ given $\mu$ with an average risk minimization approach for $\mu$. We show how to implement optimal decision rules using the bootstrap and (quasi-)Bayesian methods in both parametric and semiparametric settings. We provide detailed applications to treatment choice and optimal pricing. Our asymptotic approach is well suited for realistic empirical settings in which the derivation of finite-sample optimal rules is intractable.</description>

      <title>Clustered Network Connectedness: A New Measurement Framework with Application to Global Equity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network connections, both across and within markets, are central in countless economic contexts. In recent decades, a large literature has developed and applied flexible methods for measuring network connectedness and its evolution, based on variance decompositions from vector autoregressions (VARs), as in Diebold and Yilmaz (2014). Those VARs are, however, typically identified using full orthogonalization (Sims, 1980), or no orthogonalization (Koop, Pesaran and Potter, 1996; Pesaran and Shin, 1998), which, although useful, are special and extreme cases of a more general framework that we develop in this paper. In particular, we allow network nodes to be connected in ``clusters", such as asset classes, industries, regions, etc., where shocks are orthogonal across clusters (Sims style orthogonalized identification) but correlated within clusters (Koop-Pesaran-Potter-Shin style generalized identification), so that the ordering of network nodes is relevant across clusters but irrelevant within clusters. After developing the clustered connectedness framework, we apply it in a detailed empirical exploration of sixteen country equity markets spanning three global regions.</description>

      <title>Identification-aware Markov chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leaving posterior sensitivity concerns aside, non-identifiability of the parameters does not raise a difficulty for Bayesian inference as far as the posterior is proper, but multi-modality or flat regions of the posterior induced by the lack of identification leaves a challenge for modern Bayesian computation. Sampling methods often struggle with slow or non-convergence when dealing with multiple modes or flat regions of the target distributions. This paper develops a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for non-identified models, leveraging the knowledge of observationally equivalent sets of parameters, and highlights an important role that identification plays in modern Bayesian analysis.We show that our identification-aware proposal eliminates mode entrapment, achieving a convergence rate uniformly bounded away from zero, in sharp contrast to the exponentially decaying rates characterizing standard Random Walk Metropolis and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Simulation studies show its superior performance compared to other popular computational methods including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo. We also demonstrate that our method uncovers non-trivial modes in the target distribution in a structural vector moving-average (SVMA) application.</description>

      <title>Unified Inference on Moment Restrictions with Nuisance Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.11031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a simple unified inference approach on moment restrictions in the presence of nuisance parameters. The proposed test is constructed based on a new characterization that avoids the estimation of nuisance parameters and can be broadly applied across diverse settings. Under suitable conditions, the test is shown to be asymptotically size controlled and consistent for both independent and dependent samples. Monte Carlo simulations show that the test performs well in finite samples. Numerical results from the application to conditional moment restriction models with weak instruments demonstrate that the proposed method may improve upon existing approaches in the literature.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Deep Learning for Discrete Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) are used to analyze individual decision-making in contexts such as transportation choices, political elections, and consumer preferences. DCMs play a central role in applied econometrics by enabling inference on key economic variables, such as marginal rates of substitution, rather than focusing solely on predicting choices on new unlabeled data. However, while traditional DCMs offer high interpretability and support for point and interval estimation of economic quantities, these models often underperform in predictive tasks compared to deep learning (DL) models. Despite their predictive advantages, DL models remain largely underutilized in discrete choice due to concerns about their lack of interpretability, unstable parameter estimates, and the absence of established methods for uncertainty quantification. Here, we introduce a deep learning model architecture specifically designed to integrate with approximate Bayesian inference methods, such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). Our proposed model collapses to behaviorally informed hypotheses when data is limited, mitigating overfitting and instability in underspecified settings while retaining the flexibility to capture complex nonlinear relationships when sufficient data is available. We demonstrate our approach using SGLD through a Monte Carlo simulation study, evaluating both predictive metrics--such as out-of-sample balanced accuracy--and inferential metrics--such as empirical coverage for marginal rates of substitution interval estimates. Additionally, we present results from two empirical case studies: one using revealed mode choice data in NYC, and the other based on the widely used Swiss train choice stated preference data.</description>
