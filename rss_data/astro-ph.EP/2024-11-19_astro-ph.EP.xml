      <title>A Map of the Orbital Landscape for Perturbing Planet Solutions for Single-Planet Systems with TTVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are now thousands of single-planet systems observed to exhibit transit timing variations (TTVs), yet we largely lack any interpretation of the implied masses responsible for these perturbations. Even when assuming these TTVs are driven by perturbing planets, the solution space is notoriously multi-modal with respect to the perturber's orbital period and there exists no standardized procedure to pinpoint these modes, besides from blind brute force numerical efforts. Using $N$-body simulations with $\texttt{TTVFast}$ and focusing on the dominant periodic signal in the TTVs, we chart out the landscape of these modes and provide analytic predictions for their locations and widths, providing the community with a map for the first time. We then introduce an approach for modeling single-planet TTVs in the low-eccentricity regime, by splitting the orbital period space into a number of uniform prior bins over which there aren't these degeneracies. We show how one can define appropriate orbital period priors for the perturbing planet in order to sufficiently sample the complete parameter space. We demonstrate, analytically, how one can explain the numerical simulations using first-order near mean-motion resonance super-periods, the synodic period, and their aliases -- the expected dominant TTV periods in the low-eccentricity regime. Using a Bayesian framework, we then present a method for determining the optimal solution between TTVs induced by a perturbing planet and TTVs induced by a moon.</description>

      <title>Terrestrial planet surfaces and interiors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rocky planets in our Solar System, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and the Moon, which is generally added to this group due to its geological complexity, possess a solid surface and share a common structure divided into major layers, namely a silicate crust, a silicate mantle, and an iron-rich core. However, while all terrestrial planets share a common structure, the thickness of their interior layers, their bulk chemical composition, and surface expressions of geological processes are often unique to each of them. In this chapter we provide an overview of the surfaces and interiors of rocky planets in the Solar System. We list some of the major discoveries in planetary exploration and discuss how they have helped to answer fundamental questions about planetary evolution while at the same time opening new avenues. For each of the major planetary layers, i.e., the surface, the crust and lithosphere, the mantle, and the core, we review key geological and geophysical processes that have shaped the planets that we observe today. Understanding the similarities and differences between the terrestrial planets in the Solar System will teach us about the diversity of evolutionary paths a planet could follow, helping us to better understand our own home, the Earth.</description>

      <title>A Wave Scattering Approach to Modelling Surface Roughness in Orbital Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing density of space objects in low-Earth orbit highlights the critical need for accurate orbit predictions to minimise operational disruptions. One significant challenge lies in accurately modelling the interaction of gas particles with the surfaces of these objects, as errors in aerodynamic coefficient modelling directly impact orbit prediction accuracy. Current approaches rely on empirical models, such as those by Sentman and Cercignani-Lampis-Lord, incorporating one or two adjustable parameters typically calibrated with orbital acceleration data. However, these models fall short in capturing essential gas-solid interaction processes, including multiple reflections, shadowing, and backscattering caused by surface roughness. We present a novel, physics-based gas-surface interaction model that utilises electromagnetic wave theory to account for macroscopic effects of surface roughness on gas particle scattering distributions. This approach not only offers a more accurate representation of gas-surface interactions but also allows parameter determination through a combination of ground-based surface roughness measurements and molecular dynamics simulations at the atomic scale. The model validity is tested across the entire parameter space using a test-particle Monte Carlo method on a simulated rough surface. Furthermore, it successfully reproduces experimental results from the literature on the scattering of Argon and Helium from smooth and rough Kapton and Aluminium surfaces. Finally, we demonstrate the model's impact on aerodynamic coefficients for simple geometric shapes, comparing the results with those from the Sentman and Cercignani-Lampis-Lord models. This comparison reveals that inconsistencies previously observed between these models and tracking data for spherical satellites can be attributed to surface roughness effects, which our model effectively accounts for.</description>

      <title>Non-Gravitational Forces in Planetary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-gravitational forces play surprising and, sometimes, centrally important roles in shaping the motions and properties of small planetary bodies. In the solar system, the morphologies of comets, the delivery of meteorites and the shapes and dynamics of asteroids are all affected by non-gravitational forces. Around other stars, non-gravitational forces affect the lifetimes of particles and their rates of radial transport within circumstellar disks. Unlike the gravitational force, which is a simple function of the well known separations and masses of bodies, the non-gravitational forces are frequently functions of poorly known or even unmeasurable physical properties. Here, we present order-of-magnitude descriptions of non-gravitational forces, with examples of their application.</description>

      <title>Greenhouse warming potential of a suite of gas species on early Mars evaluated using a radiative-convective climate model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abundant geomorphological and geochemical evidence of liquid water on the surface of early Mars during the late Noachian and early Hesperian periods needs to be reconciled with a fainter young Sun. While a dense CO2 atmosphere and related warming mechanisms are potential solutions to the early Mars climate problem, further investigation is warranted. Here, we complete a comprehensive survey of the warming potential of all known greenhouse gases and perform detailed calculations for 15 different minor gas species under early Martian conditions. We find that of these 15 species, H2O2, HNO3, NH3, SO2, and C2H4 cause significant greenhouse warming at concentrations of ~0.1 ppmv or greater. However, the most highly effective greenhouse gas species also tend to be more condensable, soluble and vulnerable to photolytic destruction. To provide a reference for future atmospheric evolution and photochemical studies, we have made our warming potential database freely available online.</description>

      <title>Diversity of disc viscosities can explain the period ratios of resonant and non-resonant systems of hot super-Earths and mini-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Migration is a key ingredient for the formation of close-in super-Earth and mini-Neptune systems, as it sets in which resonances planets can be trapped. Slower migration rates result in wider resonance configurations compared to higher migration rates. We investigate the influence of different migration rates, set by the disc's viscosity, on the structure of multi-planet systems growing by pebble accretion via N-body simulations. Planets in low viscosity environments migrate slower due to partial gap opening. Thus systems formed in low viscosity environments tend to have planets trapped in wider resonant configurations (typically 4:3, 3:2 and 2:1), compared to their high viscosity counterparts (mostly 7:6, 5:4 and 4:3 resonances). After gas disc dissipation, the damping forces cease and the systems can undergo instabilities, rearranging their configurations and breaking the resonance chains. The low viscosity discs naturally account for the resonant chains like Trappist-1, TOI-178 and Kepler-223, unlike high viscosity simulations which produce relatively more compact chains. About 95% of our low viscosity resonant chains became unstable, experiencing giant impacts. Dynamical instabilities in our low viscosity simulations are more violent than those of high viscosity simulations due to the effects of leftover external perturbers (P&gt;200 days). About 50% of our final system ended with no planets within 200 days, while all our systems have remaining outer planets. We speculate that this process could be qualitatively consistent with the lack of inner planets in a large fraction of Sun-like stars. Systems produced in low viscosity simulations alone do not match the overall period ratio distribution of observations, but give a better match to the period distributions of chains, which may suggest that systems of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes form in natal discs with a diversity of viscosities.</description>

      <title>Measuring Regolith Strength in Reduced Gravity Environments in the Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and development of a Shear and Compression Cell (SCC) for measuring the mechanical properties of granular materials in low-gravity environments. This research is motivated by the increasing interest in planetary exploration missions that involve surface interactions, such as those to asteroids and moons. The SCC is designed to measure key mechanical properties, including Young's modulus, angle of internal friction, bulk cohesion, and tensile strength, under both reduced gravity and microgravity conditions. By utilizing a drop tower with interchangeable configurations, we can simulate the gravitational environments of celestial bodies like the Moon and Titan. The SCC, coupled with the drop tower, provides a valuable tool for understanding the behavior of regolith materials and their implications for future space exploration missions.</description>

      <title>The plausibility of origins scenarios requiring two impactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen cyanide delivered by cometary impactors can be concentrated as ferrocyanide salts, which may support the initial stages of prebiotic chemistry on the early Earth. One way to achieve the conditions required for a variety of prebiotic scenarios, requiring for example the formation of cyanamide and cyanoacetylene, is through the arrival of a secondary impactor. In this work, we consider the bombardment of the early Earth, and quantitatively evaluate the likelihood of origins scenarios that invoke double impacts. Such scenarios are found to be possible only at very early times ($&gt;\,$4Gya), and are extremely unlikely settings for the initial stages of prebiotic chemistry, unless (i) ferrocyanide salts are stable on 1000yr timescales in crater environments, (ii) there was a particularly high impact rate on the Hadean Earth, and (iii) environmental conditions on the Hadean Earth were conducive to successful cometary delivery (i.e., limited oceanic coverage, and low ($\lesssim 1$bar) atmospheric surface pressure). Whilst environmental conditions on the early Earth remain subject to debate, this work highlights the need to measure the typical lifetime of ferrocyanide salts in geochemically realistic environments, which will determine the plausibility of double impact scenarios.</description>

      <title>Particle fragmentation inside planet-induced spiral waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing planets interact with their surrounding protoplanetary disk, generating feedback effects that may promote or suppress nearby planet formation. We study how spiral waves launched by planets affect the motion and collisional evolution of particles in the disk. To this end, we perform local 2D hydrodynamical simulations that include a gap-opening planet and integrate particle trajectories within the gas field. Our results show that particle trajectories bend at the location of the spiral wave, and collisions occurring within the spiral exhibit significantly enhanced collisional velocities compared to elsewhere. To quantify this effect, we ran simulations with varying planetary masses and particle sizes. The resulting collisional velocities within the spiral far exceed the typical fragmentation threshold, even for collisions between particles of relatively similar sizes and for planetary masses below the pebble isolation mass. If collisions within the spiral are frequent, this effect could lead to progressively smaller particle sizes as the radial distance from the planet decreases, impacting processes such as gap filtering, pebble accretion, and planetesimal formation.</description>

      <title>DECaPS and SMA discovery of a highly-inclined class I YSO with an outflow: IRAS 08235-4316</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present images of IRAS~08235--4316 with the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS; spanning 0.398--1.034$\,\mu$m, at ${\sim}1''$ resolution) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA; at 1.38\,mm/217\,GHz, at ${\sim}1.9''\times1.2''$ resolution), a YSO located in the Vela constellation near to the Puppis boundary, detected in a systematic search for new large/extended emission sources. The DECaPS data show an asymmetric bi--polar morphology with a large angular extent of ${\sim}7.1''$ separated by a dark lane, characteristic of highly--inclined protoplanetary disks and less-evolved YSOs with outflows. The SMA data show an extended continuum structure along the optical dark lane with a smaller angular extent of ${\sim}4.6''$. The detected $^{12}$CO J=2--1 emission tentatively shows a velocity gradient along the position angle of the dark lane/millimeter continuum, that may trace rotating gas. Additional $^{12}$CO emission is present which could trace infalling/outflowing gas, and/or a nearby gas cloud. We estimate a distance to IRAS~08235--4316 of at least ${\sim}191\,$pc. Supported by additional SED modelling, we infer IRAS~08235--4316 to be a newly discovered class~I YSO with an outflow, host to an embedded protoplanetary disk, with a large millimeter radius of ${\sim}440$\,au and dust mass ${\gtrsim}11\,M_\oplus$.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric abundances and bulk properties of the binary brown dwarf Gliese 229 Bab from JWST/MIRI spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI low-resolution spectroscopy ($4.75-14~\mu$m) of the first known substellar companion, Gliese 229 Bab, which was recently resolved into a tight binary brown dwarf. Previous atmospheric retrieval studies modeling Gliese 229 B as a single brown dwarf have reported anomalously high carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) of $\approx 1.1$ using $1-5~\mu$m ground-based spectra. Here, we fit the MIRI spectrum of Gliese 229 Bab with a two-component binary model using the Sonora Elf Owl grid and additionally account for the observed $K$ band flux ratio of the binary brown dwarf. Assuming the two brown dwarfs share the same abundances, we obtain $\rm C/O=0.65\pm0.05$ and $\rm [M/H]=0.00^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ as their abundances ($2\sigma$ statistical errors), which are fully consistent with the host star abundances. We also recover the same abundances if we fit the MIRI spectrum with a single brown dwarf model, indicating that binarity does not strongly affect inferred abundances from mid-infrared data when the $T_\rm{eff}$ are similar between components of the binary. We measure $T_\rm{eff}=900^{+78}_{-29}~$K and $T_\rm{eff}=775^{+20}_{-33}~$K for the two brown dwarfs. We find that the vertical diffusion coefficients of $\log{K_\rm{zz}} \approx4.0$ are identical between the two brown dwarfs and in line with $\log{K_\rm{zz}}$ values inferred for isolated brown dwarfs with similar $T_\rm{eff}$. Our results demonstrate the power of mid-infrared spectroscopy in providing robust atmospheric abundance measurements for brown dwarf companions and by extension, giant planets.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Europium in The Milky Way Disk; Its Connection to Planetary Habitability and The Source of The R-Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy provided in the radioactive decay of thorium (Th) and uranium (U) isotopes, embedded in planetary mantles, sustains geodynamics important for surface habitability such as the generation of a planetary magnetic dynamo. In order to better understand the thermal evolution of nearby exoplanets, stellar photospheric abundances can be used to infer the material composition of orbiting planets. Here we constrain the intrinsic dispersion of the r-process element europium (Eu) (measured in relative abundance [Eu/H]) as a proxy for Th and U in local F, G, and K type dwarf stars. Adopting stellar-chemical data from two high quality spectroscopic surveys, we have determined a small intrinsic scatter of 0.025 dex in [Eu/H] within the disk. We further investigate the stellar anti-correlation in [Eu/$\alpha$] vs [$\alpha$/H] at late metallicities to probe in what regimes planetary radiogenic heating may lead to periods of extended dynamo collapse. We find that only near-solar metallicity stars in the disk have Eu inventories supportive of a persistent dynamo in attendant planets, supporting the notion of a ``metallicity Goldilocks zone'' in the galactic disk. The observed anti-correlation further provides novel evidence regarding the nature of r-processes injection by substantiating $\alpha$ element production is decoupled from Eu injection. This suggests either a metallicity-dependent r-process in massive core-collapse supernovae, or that neutron-star merger events dominate r-process production in the recent universe.</description>

      <title>GTOC 12: Results from TheAntipodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the solution approach developed by the team `TheAntipodes' during the 12th edition of the Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC 12). An overview of the approach is as follows: (1) generate asteroid subsets, (2) chain building with beam search, (3) convex low-thrust trajectory optimization, (4) manual refinement of rendezvous times, and (5) optimal solution set selection. The generation of asteroid subsets involves a heuristic process to find sets of asteroids that are likely to permit high-scoring asteroid chains. Asteroid sequences `chains' are built within each subset through a beam search based on Lambert transfers. Low-thrust trajectory optimization involves the use of sequential convex programming (SCP), where a specialized formulation finds the mass-optimal control for each ship's trajectory within seconds. Once a feasible trajectory has been found, the rendezvous times are manually refined with the aid of the control profile from the optimal solution. Each ship's individual solution is then placed into a pool where the feasible set that maximizes the final score is extracted using a genetic algorithm. Our final submitted solution placed fifth with a score of $15,489$.</description>

      <title>Multi-Target Spacecraft Mission Design using Convex Optimization and Binary Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal design of multi-target rendezvous and flyby missions presents significant challenges due to their inherent combination of traditional spacecraft trajectory optimization with high-dimensional combinatorial problems. This often necessitates the use of large-scale global search techniques, which are computationally expensive, or the use of simplified approximations that may yield suboptimal results. To address these issues, a nested-loop approach is proposed, where the problem is divided into separate combinatorial and optimal control problems. The combinatorial problem is formulated and solved using Binary Integer Programming (BIP) with a fixed rendezvous time schedule, whilst the optimal control problem is handled by adaptive-mesh Sequential Convex Programming (SCP), which additionally optimizes the time schedule. By iterating these processes in a nested-loop structure, the approach can efficiently find high-quality solutions. This method is applied to the Global Trajectory Optimization Competition 12 (GTOC 12) problem, leading to the creation of several new best-known solutions.</description>

      <title>High-temperature dust formation in carbon-rich astrophysical environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Condensation processes, which are responsible for the main chemical differences between gas and solids in the Galaxy, are the major mechanisms that control the cycle of dust from evolved stars to planetary systems. However, they are still poorly understood, mainly because the thermodynamics and kinetic models of nucleation or grain growth lack experimental data. To bridge this gap, we used a large-volume three-phase alternating-current plasma torch to obtain a full high-temperature condensation sequence at an elevated carbon-to-oxygen ratio from a fluxed chondritic gas composition. We show that the crystallized suites of carbides, silicides, nitrides, sulfides, oxides and silicates and the bulk composition of the condensates are properly modelled by a kinetically inhibited condensation scenario controlled by gas flow. This validates the thermodynamic predictions of the condensation sequence at a high carbon-to-oxygen ratio. On this basis and using appropriate optical properties, we also demonstrate the influence of pressure on dust chemistry as well as the low probability of forming and detecting iron silicides in asymptotic giant branch C-rich circumstellar environments as well as in our chondritic meteorites. By demonstrating the potential of predicting dust mineralogy in these environments, this approach holds high promise for quantitatively characterizing dust composition and formation in diverse astrophysical settings.</description>

      <title>Plausibility of Capture into High-Obliquity States for Exoplanets in the M Dwarf Habitable Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For temperate exoplanets orbiting M dwarf hosts, the proximity of the habitable zone to the star necessitates careful consideration of tidal effects. Spin synchronization of the planetary orbital period and rotation period, tidal locking, and the subsequent impact on surface conditions, frames common assumptions about M dwarf planets. We investigate the plausibility of capture into Cassini State 2 (CS2) for a known sample of 280 multiplanet systems orbiting M dwarf hosts. This resonance of the spin precession and orbital precession frequencies can excite planets into stable nonzero rotational obliquities, breaking tidal locking and inducing a version of "day" and "night." Considering each planetary pair and estimating the spin and orbital precession frequencies, we find 75% of detected planets orbiting M dwarfs may be plausibly excited to a high obliquity and maintain it through subsequent tidal dissipation over long timescales. We also investigate two possible mechanisms for capture into CS2: quantifying the orbital migration or primordial obliquity necessary for CS2. We find orbital migrations by a factor of $\lesssim$2 and an isotropic initial spin distribution can produce high-obliquity planets, aligning with similar findings for planets orbiting close-in to FGK dwarfs. Many of the planets in our sample reside in both CS2 and within their stellar habitable zone. Over half of planets with $T_{eq}&lt;400$ K around host stars with $T_{eff}&lt;3000$ K could possess non-zero obliquity due to residence in CS2. This overlap renders the potential capture into Cassini States extremely relevant to understanding the galaxy's most common temperate planets.</description>

      <title>Migration of Accreting Planets and Black Holes in Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nascent planets are thought to lose angular momentum (AM) to the gaseous protoplanetary disk via gravitational interactions, leading to inward migration. A similar migration process also applies to stellar-mass black holes (BHs) embedded in the disks of active galactic nuclei. However, AM exchange via accretion onto the planet/BH may strongly influence the migration torque. In this study, we perform 2D global hydrodynamic simulations of an accreting planet/BH embedded in a disk, where AM exchange between the planet/BH and disk via gravity, accretion, pressure, and viscosity are considered. When accretion is turned off, we recover the linear estimate for Type I migration torque. However, for the two planet masses we investigated with our accreting simulations, we find outward migration due to the positive AM deposited onto the accreting body by the disk gas. Our simulations achieve the global steady state for the transport of mass and AM: The mass and AM fluxes are constant across the disk except for jumps ($\Delta\dot M$ and $\Delta\dot J$) at the planet's location, and the jumps match the accretion rate and torque on the planet. Our findings suggest that caution is needed when applying the standard results of disk migration to accreting planets and BHs.</description>

      <title>Basaltic mini-moon: Characterizing 2024 PT5 with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Small bodies in Earth-like orbits, the Arjunas, are good targets for scientific exploration and mining studies as they enable low-cost missions. The subset of such objects that experience recurrent temporarily captured flyby or orbiter events, also called mini-moon episodes, are among the best ranked in terms of accessibility. Only a handful of objects are known to have engaged in such a dynamical behavior. Finding and characterizing more of them may help to expand scientific and commercial research activities in space over the next few decades. Asteroid 2024 PT5 was found recently and belongs to this group of interesting objects.
  Aims. Here, we investigate the orbital context of 2024 PT5, and its spectral and rotational properties.
  Methods. We studied the short-term orbital evolution of 2024 PT5 using direct N-body simulations. We identified its spectral class from the visible reflectance spectrum and used photometric observations to derive its rotational properties. Observational data were obtained with the OSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope.
  Results. Asteroid 2024 PT5 experiences recurrent co-orbital engagements and mini-moon events of the temporarily captured flyby type. Its visible spectrum is consistent with that of an Sv-type asteroid or perhaps lunar ejecta. Its rotational period could be less than or close to 1 h.
  Conclusions. The discovery of 2024 PT5 confirms that temporarily captured flybys are relatively frequent and involve objects larger than a few meters, suitable as accessible targets for scientific research activities and commercial mining ventures in space.</description>

      <title>The PLATO Mission</title>

Abstract: PLATO (PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars) is ESA's M3 mission designed to detect and characterise extrasolar planets and perform asteroseismic monitoring of a large number of stars. PLATO will detect small planets (down to &lt;2 R_(Earth)) around bright stars (&lt;11 mag), including terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of solar-like stars. With the complement of radial velocity observations from the ground, planets will be characterised for their radius, mass, and age with high accuracy (5 %, 10 %, 10 % for an Earth-Sun combination respectively). PLATO will provide us with a large-scale catalogue of well-characterised small planets up to intermediate orbital periods, relevant for a meaningful comparison to planet formation theories and to better understand planet evolution. It will make possible comparative exoplanetology to place our Solar System planets in a broader context. In parallel, PLATO will study (host) stars using asteroseismology, allowing us to determine the stellar properties with high accuracy, substantially enhancing our knowledge of stellar structure and evolution.
  The payload instrument consists of 26 cameras with 12cm aperture each. For at least four years, the mission will perform high-precision photometric measurements. Here we review the science objectives, present PLATO's target samples and fields, provide an overview of expected core science performance as well as a description of the instrument and the mission profile at the beginning of the serial production of the flight cameras. PLATO is scheduled for a launch date end 2026. This overview therefore provides a summary of the mission to the community in preparation of the upcoming operational phases.</description>

Abstract: In May 2024, the scientific community observed intense solar eruptions that resulted in a great geomagnetic storm and auroral extension, highlighting the need to document and quantify these events. This study mainly focuses on their quantification. The source active region (AR 13664) evolved from 113 to 2761 millionths of the solar hemisphere between 4 May and 14 May. AR 13664's magnetic free energy surpassed 10^33 erg on 7 May, triggering 12 X-class flares on 8 -- 15 May. Multiple interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) were produced from this AR, accelerating solar energetic particles toward Earth. According to satellite and interplanetary scintillation data, at least 4 ICMEs erupted from 13664 eventually overcoming each other and combining. The shock arrival at 17:05 UT on 10 May significantly compressed the magnetosphere down to ~ 5.04 RE, and triggered a deep Forbush Decrease. GOES satellite data and ground-based neutron monitors confirmed a ground-level enhancement from 2 UT to 10 UT on 11 May 2024. The ICMEs induced exceptional geomagnetic storms, peaking at a Dst index of -412 nT at 2 UT on 11 May, marking the sixth-largest storm since 1957. The AE and AL indices showed great auroral extensions that located the AE/AL stations into the polar cap. We gathered auroral records at that time and reconstructed the equatorward boundary of the visual auroral oval to 29.8{\deg} invariant latitude. We compared naked-eye and camera auroral visibility, providing critical caveats on their difference. We also confirmed global enhancements of storm-enhanced density of the ionosphere.</description>
