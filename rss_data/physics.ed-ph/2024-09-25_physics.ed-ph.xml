      <title>Propuesta de abordaje transversal del concepto diferencial de curvatura en situaciones f\'isicas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the process of teaching the concept of derivative, it is common and natural to refer to geometric interpretations, such as the use of the tangent line and the maximum and minimum points of a function, to illustrate the scope of the derivative. In this work, an inclusive and applied way of the concept of curvature differential is presented, specifically with the intervention of problems of Newton's mechanics, whose purpose is double, on the one hand, to provide the derivative with a highly versatile sense to model systems, and on the other hand; to approach diverse classic topics of the initial physics courses from a didactic proposal centered on the concept of curvature.</description>

      <title>A scaffolded curriculum to foster experimental skills acquisition in an introductory physics lab course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article outlines a comprehensive redesign of an introductory physics laboratory course aimed at promoting active student engagement, enhancing scientific experimental skills and the development of expert-like attitudes. The redesign process involved redefining specific and measurable learning goals and the development of tailored activities and assessment rubrics to reach and assess those goals. In order to implement course scaffolding, we made significant modifications to the previously existing course format, space, physics topics contexts, and assessment. Instructors` roles evolved from imparting knowledge to promoting student decision-making and fostering a collaborative learning environment. To guide the laboratory transformation we used the results of a research-based survey. This work offers practical insights for educators seeking to redesign laboratory courses, emphasizing authentic scientific practices and student-driven learning experiences in physics education.</description>

      <title>Exploring Relativistic World of Electromagnetism on Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is the theoretical structure of electromagnetism that led Einstein to special relativity. To foster an intuitive understanding of relativity's core idea, it is valuable to create a fully special relativistic computer simulation incorporating electromagnetic dynamics. In this paper, we provide a basic formulation for such an implementation. Specifically, the player observes the world via their past light cone and experiences the Lorentz force generated by the electromagnetic field at their spacetime location. The electromagnetic field at any given spacetime point is determined by the sublight-speed motion of individual point charges on the past light cone of that spacetime point.</description>
