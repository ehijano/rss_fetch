      <title>Weighted Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method for interacting fermions: An application to ultracold Fermi superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For several decades it has been known that divergences arise in the ground-state energy and chemical potential of unitary superfluids, where the scattering length diverges, due to particle-hole scattering. Leading textbooks and research articles recognize that there are serious issues but ignore them due to the lack of an approach that can regularize these divergences. We find a solution to this difficulty by proposing a general method, called the weighted Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory, to handle multiple decomposition channels originating from the same interaction. We distribute the interaction in weighted channels determined by minimization of the action, and we apply this idea to unpolarized Fermi superfluids. Using our method, we solve a long-standing difficulty in the partitioning of the interaction into Hartree, Fock, and Bogoliubov channels for Fermi superfluids, and we obtain a phase diagram at the saddle-point level, which contains multichannel nonperturbative corrections. In particular, we find a previously overlooked superfluid phase for weak interactions, which is dominated by particle-hole processes, in addition to the usual superfluid phase only containing particle-particle physics.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points and beyond of far-from-equilibrium dilute system: ultra-cold Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics driven by the scattering from next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections in the quantum field theory has stationary solutions for the particle distribution characterized as the Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points. The dynamics of the spatially homogeneous, isotropic dilute ultra-cold Fermi gas is investigated, and its kinetic equation confirms the Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points in the perturbation theory by the quasi-particle assumption, in contrast to the wave turbulence of the weakly coupled ultra-cold Bose gas. In addition, other stationary states are found without the quasi-particle assumption and in a strongly coupled system. These analytical solutions provide chances for future experiments and numerical simulations in search of far-from-equilibrium stationary states of the dilute system.</description>

      <title>Quantum diatomic chain: a supersolid structure in three-component Bose mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and properties of a supersolid structure in a three-component ultracold Bose gas mixture at T=0 are investigated theoretically. The system consists of 23Na, 39K, and 41K atomic species, in which the binary mixtures of (23Na,39K) and (39K,41K) can form self-bound quantum droplets stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Two such droplets can bind together by the shared 39K component, forming a stable "dimer" structure, which displays vibrational modes analogous to a classical diatomic molecule. A simple protocol is proposed to create a stable linear chain formed by periodic repetition of this basic building block, i.e. an alternating sequence of (23Na,39K) and (39K,41K) droplets. This structure exhibits both periodic density modulations from the droplet ordering and global phase coherence due to the shared 39K component, satisfying the criteria for supersolidity, and therefore adding another system to the gallery of supersolid structures in cold atoms arena. The low-energy excitation spectrum, probed by density perturbations, identifies modes corresponding to droplet vibrations close to the ones expected from a classical diatomic chain.</description>

      <title>Odd relaxation in three-dimensional Fermi liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical works predict a hierarchy of long-lived, non-hydrodynamic modes in two-dimensional Fermi liquids arising from the feature -- supposedly unique to two dimensions -- that relaxation by head-on scattering is not efficient in the presence of Pauli blocking. This leads to a parity-based separation of scattering rates, with odd-parity modes relaxing much more slowly than even-parity ones. In this work, we establish that a similar effect exists in isotropic three-dimensional Fermi liquids, even though relaxation does not proceed solely by head-on scattering. We show that while the relaxation rates of even and odd modes in 3D share the same leading-order $\sim T^2$ low-temperature scaling typical of Fermi liquids, their magnitudes differ, with odd-parity modes relaxing more slowly than even ones for a broad class of interactions. We find a relative difference between odd-and even-parity relaxation rates as large as $40\%$ just by Pauli blocking alone, with a strong additional dependence on the scattering potential, such that the odd-even staggering is further enhanced by interactions that favor large-angle scattering. We identify signatures of these odd-parity relaxation rates in the static transverse conductivity as well as the transverse collective mode structure. Our results establish the unexpected existence of a tomographic-like regime in higher-dimensional Fermi liquids and suggest experimental probes via transport measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba Effect in Dissipative Spin Chains at Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Mpemba Effect (QME) is the quantum counterpart of the classical Mpemba effect--a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system initially at a higher temperature relax to thermal eauilibrium faster than one at a lower temperature. In this work, we investigate the QME in one-dimensional quantum spin chains coupled to a Markovian environment. By analyzing the full relaxation dynamics governed by the Lindblad master equation, we reveal the emergence of a strong quantum Mpemba effect at quantum critical points. Our findings reveal that criticality enhances the non-monotonic dependence of relaxation times on the initial temperature, leading to anomalously accelerated equilibration. This phenomenon is directly linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectrum at criticality and the associated overlaps with the initial states. These findings demonstrate that quantum phase transitions could provide a natural setting for realizing and enhancing non-equilibrium phenomena in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Universal Dynamics with Globally Controlled Analog Quantum Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.</description>

      <title>Supersonic Flow Past an Obstacle in a Quasi-Two-Dimensional Lee-Huang-Yang Quantum Fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A supersonic flow past an obstacle can generate a rich variety of wave excitations. This paper investigates, both analytically and numerically, two types of excitations generated by the flow of a Lee-Huang-Yang quantum fluid past an obstacle: linear radiation and oblique dark solitons. We show that wave crests of linear radiation can be accurately described by the proper modification of the Kelvin original theory, while the oblique dark soliton solution is obtained analytically by transformation of the 1D soliton solution to the obstacle's reference frame. A comparison between analytical predictions and numerical simulations demonstrates good agreement, validating our theoretical approach.</description>

      <title>Dynamic correlations of frustrated quantum spins from high-temperature expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For quantum spin systems in equilibrium, the dynamic structure factor (DSF) is among the most feature-packed experimental observables. However, from a theory perspective it is often hard to simulate in an unbiased and accurate way, especially for frustrated and high-dimensional models at intermediate temperature. To address this challenge, we compute the DSF from a dynamic extension of the high-temperature expansion to frequency moments. We focus on nearest-neighbor Heisenberg models with spin-lengths S=1/2 and 1. We provide comprehensive benchmarks and consider a variety of frustrated two- and three-dimensional antiferromagnets as applications. In particular we shed new light on the anomalous intermediate temperature regime of the S=1/2 triangular lattice model and reproduce the DSF measured recently for the S=1 pyrochlore material NaCaNi2F7. An open-source numerical implementation for arbitrary lattice geometries is also provided.</description>

      <title>Integrals of motion as slow modes in dissipative many-body operator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Lindbladian operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems with one or more integrals of motion (IOM), subject to weak local dissipation. We demonstrate that IOMs with small support become slow modes of these dynamics, in the sense that their Frobenius norm decays more slowly compared to generic operators. As a result, the eigenoperators of such Lindbladians with slowest decay rates have a large overlap with the IOMs of the underlying Hamiltonian. We demonstrate this correspondence between slow modes and IOMs numerically for a number of many-body models, and further corroborate it with perturbative arguments. These results open up a new method for the identification of IOMs, and provide insights into the dissipative many-body dynamics.</description>
