      <title>The full iron budget in simulated galaxy clusters: The chemistry between gas and stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy chemical elements such as iron in the intra-cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters are a signpost of the interaction between the gas and stellar components. Observations of the ICM metallicity in present-day massive systems, however, pose a challenge to the underlying assumption that the cluster galaxies have produced the amount of iron that enriches the ICM. We evaluate the iron share between ICM and stars within simulated galaxy clusters with the twofold aim of investigating the origin of possible differences with respect to observational findings and of shedding light on the observed excess of iron on the ICM with respect to expectations based on the observed stellar population. We evaluated the iron mass in gas and stars in a sample of 448 simulated systems with masses M500 &gt; 1e14 Msun at z=0.07. These were extracted from the high-resolution (352 cMpc/h)^3 volume of the Magneticum cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We compared our results with observational data of low-redshift galaxy clusters. The iron share in simulated clusters features a shallow dependence on the total mass, and its value is close to unity on average. In the most massive simulated systems, the iron share is thus smaller than observational values by almost an order of magnitude. The dominant contribution to this difference is related to the stellar component, whereas the chemical properties of the ICM agree well overall with the observations. We find larger stellar mass fractions in simulated massive clusters, which in turn yield higher stellar iron masses, than in observational data. Consistently with the modelling, we confirm that the stellar content within simulated present-day massive systems causes the metal enrichment in the ICM. It will be crucial to alleviate the stellar mass discrepancy between simulations and observations to definitely assess the iron budget in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>SHARP -- IX. The dense, low-mass perturbers in B1938+666 and J0946+1006: implications for cold and self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extended analysis of the gravitational lens systems SDSS J0946+1006 and JVAS B1938+666. We focus on the properties of two low-mass dark matter haloes previously detected in these systems and compare them with predictions from different dark matter models. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the object H detected in J0946+1006 is a dark-matter-dominated subhalo. Object A, in B1938+666, is a foreground halo at $z = 0.13\pm0.07$, contradicting previous analyses which suggested this object to be located either within or at higher redshift than the lens. Given the new redshift for this object, we update the 3$\sigma$ upper limit on its luminosity to $L_V &lt; 6.3 \times 10^5 {(z/0.13)}^2 L_{V,\odot}$. By selecting central galaxies from the TNG50 hydrodynamical simulation, we find that analogues with projected mass density profiles around the robust radius of $\sim$ 91 pc and luminosities consistent with detection A can be found, although they lie near the edge of the halo distribution in the relevant mass and redshift ranges. We conclude, therefore, that this object is an atypical but possible event in $\Lambda$CDM. The projected mass density profile of both detections over the well-constrained range of radii may be consistent with expectations from SIDM gravothermal fluid model if the effective self-interaction cross-section $\sigma_{c,0}/m_{\rm{dm}}$ is of order $300 \ \rm{cm}^2 g^{-1}$ or larger.</description>

      <title>Galaxy cluster virial quantities from extrapolating strong lensing mass profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the radial total mass profiles of nine massive galaxy clusters ($M_\mathrm{200c}&gt;5\times10^{14}$ M$_\odot$) in the redshift range $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.9$. These clusters were observed as part of the CLASH, HFF, BUFFALO, and CLASH-VLT programs, that provided high-quality photometric and spectroscopic data. Additional high-resolution spectroscopic data were obtained with MUSE at the VLT. Our research is based on strong lensing analyses that rely on these measurements. From these data, we measure the projected total mass profiles of each galaxy cluster in our sample. We fit these mass profiles with one-component, spherically symmetric mass models including the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), non-singular isothermal sphere, beta model, and Hernquist profiles. We perform a Bayesian analysis to sample the posterior probability distributions of the free parameters of the models. We find that the NFW, Hernquist, and beta models are the most suitable profiles to fit the measured projected cluster total mass profiles. Moreover, we test the robustness of our results in a twofold way: we slightly modify the center of the projected mass profiles and the radial range of the considered region. We employ the results obtained with the Hernquist profile to compare our total mass estimates ($M_\mathrm{H}^\mathrm{tot} = M_\mathrm{H} (r\rightarrow + \infty)$), with the $M_\mathrm{200c}$ values from weak lensing studies. Through this analysis, we find scaling relations between $M_\mathrm{H}^\mathrm{tot}$ and $M_\mathrm{200c}$ and the value of the scale radius, $r_\mathrm{S}$, and $R_\mathrm{200c}$. Interestingly, we also find that the $M_\mathrm{200c}$ values, obtained by extrapolating the fitted total mass profiles, are very close to the weak lensing results. This feature can be exploited in future studies on clusters and cosmology, as it provides an easy way to infer galaxy cluster virial masses.</description>

      <title>Map-level baryonification: unified treatment of weak lensing two-point and higher-order statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision cosmology benefits from extracting maximal information from cosmic structures, motivating the use of higher-order statistics (HOS) at small spatial scales. However, predicting how baryonic processes modify matter statistics at these scales has been challenging. The baryonic correction model (BCM) addresses this by modifying dark-matter-only simulations to mimic baryonic effects, providing a flexible, simulation-based framework for predicting both two-point and HOS. We show that a 3-parameter version of the BCM can jointly fit weak lensing maps' two-point statistics, wavelet phase harmonics coefficients, scattering coefficients, and the third and fourth moments to within 2% accuracy across all scales $\ell &lt; 2000$ and tomographic bins for a DES-Y3-like redshift distribution ($z \lesssim 2$), using the FLAMINGO simulations. These results demonstrate the viability of BCM-assisted, simulation-based weak lensing inference of two-point and HOS, paving the way for robust cosmological constraints that fully exploit non-Gaussian information on small spatial scales.</description>

      <title>DESI DR1 Ly$\alpha$ 1D power spectrum: The optimal estimator measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional power spectrum $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ of Ly$\alpha$ forest offers rich insights into cosmological and astrophysical parameters, including constraints on the sum of neutrino masses, warm dark matter models, and the thermal state of the intergalactic medium. We present the measurement of $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ using the optimal quadratic maximum likelihood estimator applied to over 300,000 Ly$\alpha$ quasars from Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. This sample represents the largest to date for $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ measurements and is larger than the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) by a factor of 1.7. We conduct a meticulous investigation of instrumental and analysis systematics and quantify their impact on $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$. This includes the development of a cross-exposure estimator that eliminates the need to model the pipeline noise and has strong potential for future $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ measurements. We also present new insights into metal contamination through the 1D correlation function. Using a fitting function we measure the evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ forest bias with high precision: $b_F(z) = (-0.218\pm0.002)\times((1 + z) / 4)^{2.96\pm0.06}$. In a companion validation paper, we substantially extend our previous suite of CCD image simulations to quantify the pipeline's exquisite performance accurately. In another companion paper, we present DR1 $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ measurements using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) approach to power spectrum estimation. These two measurements are consistent with each other and constitute the most precise $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ measurement to date, while being in good agreement with results from the DESI early data release.</description>

      <title>Impact of ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 for Early Dark Energy and the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data release six of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT DR6) and the second data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR2) recently became available. In light of these data, we update constraints on the Early Dark Energy (EDE) resolution to the Hubble tension. While ACT DR6 does not favor EDE over the core cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM, it allows for a significantly larger maximum contribution of EDE, $f_{\rm EDE}$, in the pre-recombination era than the latest analysis of {\it Planck} NPIPE despite increased precision at small angular scales. Moreover, EDE rises the value of $H_0r_s$, improving consistency between CMB and DESI DR2 data. We find a residual tension with SH0ES of $\sim 2 \sigma$ for the combination of {\it Planck} at $\ell &lt;1000$ + ACT DR6 + lensing + Pantheon-plus + DESI DR2, a significant decrease from $3.7 \sigma$ for analyses that use NPIPE and SDSS BAO data. A profile likelihood analysis reveals significant prior-volume effects in Bayesian analyses which do not include SH$0$ES, with confidence intervals of $f_{\rm EDE}=0.09\pm 0.03$ and $H_0= 71.0\pm1.1$ km/s/Mpc. When including DESI data, the EDE model with $H_0=73$ km/s/Mpc provides a better fit than the $\Lambda$CDM model with $H_0=68.4$ km/s/Mpc. The inclusion of SH$0$ES data rises the preference well above $5\sigma$, with $\Delta\chi^2=-35.4$. Our work demonstrates that after ACT DR6 and DESI DR2, EDE remains a potential resolution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Quintessence Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we give the robust $\sim2\,\sigma$ evidences of dynamical dark matter and beyond $2\,\sigma$ signals of the coexistence of dynamical dark matter and dynamical dark energy using current cosmological observations [1]. Here we propose the quintessence dark matter model to explain the evolution of dark matter over time on cosmic scales. Interestingly, we find that the exponential quintessence is likely the origin of such an evolution.</description>

      <title>Observational tests for a class of scalar-tensor gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study observational bounds in a class of scalar-tensor gravity theories recently proposed. Either an upper or lower bound on a conformal factor in these theories is derived from null observation in composition dependent fifth force search, microscope mission. The important case of a lower bound implies that future improved observations have chances of verifying this class of theories. Future prospect for a particular type of observation is mentioned. The considered class of scalar-tensor gravity was shown elsewhere to explain the conversion of inflationary early phase to late time quintessence type dark energy.</description>

      <title>Robust {\mu}-distortion constraints on primordial supermassive black holes from cubic (gNL) non-Gaussian perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make the first calculation of the spectral distortion constraints on the primordial curvature power spectrum in the limit of large cubic non-Gaussianity. This calculation involves computing a 2-loop integral, which we perform analytically. Despite being non-perturbatively non-Gaussian, we show that the constraints only change significantly from the case of Gaussian perturbations in the high-k tail, where spectral distortions become weak. We conclude that generating primordial supermassive black holes requires even more extreme forms of non-Gaussianity. We also argue why the mu-distortion constraint is unlikely to significantly change even in the presence of more extreme local non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter phenomenological extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model in which the equation of state parameter of the ``dust'' fluid becomes different from zero for redshifts below a transition value $z_t$. Using data from DESI DR2 BAO, DESY5 Sn~Ia and CMB distance priors ($R,l_A,\omega_b$) data, we compare our model with the standard CPL parameterization $w_0-w_a$ for dynamical dark energy. Using the Deviance Information Criteria (DIC), we find that the two models are essentially indistinguishable ($\Delta$DIC $&lt;$ 2) and preferred over $\Lambda$CDM with a significance $\geq 3 \sigma$. We discuss how this parameterization finds a natural interpretation in the context of cosmological backreaction and derive a prediction for the evolution of the growth factor, discussing its impact on low redshift $f\sigma_8$ measurements.</description>

      <title>The CMB cold spot under the lens II: Lensing on polarization and cosmic textures footprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quadratic lensing estimator that incorporates off-diagonal correlations in both temperature and polarization CMB maps, and is capable of measuring localized lensing profiles with $&lt;10''$ average deflection angle at the $\sim3\sigma$ level in upcoming Simons observatory (SO) data. The proposed pipeline is agnostic to the underlying mass profile and can probe the subtle signatures of voids, clusters, and topological defects. As a case study and test scenario we focus on a collapsing cosmic texture, a topological defect that has been proposed to explain the CMB Cold Spot. With the forthcoming SO data, we forecast a $2.8\sigma$ detection if the texture amplitude reaches the current Planck 2018 $2\sigma$ limit, and a $1.8\sigma$ measurement for the best-fit value, which is remarkable given the expected typical lensing angle of $&lt;6''$. As the next-generation CMB surveys will reach $\ell&gt;3000$ for polarization, we demonstrate that its inclusion is significant, boosting the estimator's signal-to-noise ratio by $\sim50\%$, and making it a powerful tool, allowing us to recover faint lensing footprints that were previously inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Kination-like Era Driven by the Effective Inflaton/Higgs Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the minimal $U(1)_X$ extended Standard Model, we explore cosmic inflation where the $U(1)_X$ Higgs field serves as the inflaton. We demonstrate that a stiff era with an equation of state $w &gt; 1/3$ can emerge during the inflaton's oscillatory phase after inflation, driven by the Coleman-Weinberg potential of the inflaton, arising due to radiative corrections. This leads to significant modulation and enhancement of the irreducible stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background from inflation, deviating from the conventional scale-invariant spectrum. Such a distinct GW spectrum could be detectable by next-generation GW interferometer missions, such as U-DECIGO. In our framework, the GW spectrum depends on the $U(1)_X$ gauge coupling and the mass of the $U(1)_X$ gauge boson ($Z^\prime$). As a result, future GW observations and $Z^\prime$ boson resonance searches at high-energy collider experiments are complementary to one another.</description>

      <title>Modelling the impact of quasar redshift errors on the full-shape analysis of correlations in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In preparation for the first cosmological measurements from the full-shape of the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest from DESI, we must carefully model all relevant systematics that might bias our analysis. It was shown in Youles et al. (2022) that random quasar redshift errors produce a smoothing effect on the mean quasar continuum in the Ly$\alpha$ forest region. This in turn gives rise to spurious features in the Ly$\alpha$ auto-correlation, and its cross-correlation with quasars. Using synthetic data sets based on the DESI survey, we confirm that the impact on BAO measurements is small, but that a bias is introduced to parameters which depend on the full-shape of our correlations. We combine a model of this contamination in the cross-correlation (Youles et al. 2022) with a new model we introduce here for the auto-correlation. These are parametrised by 3 parameters, which when included in a joint fit to both correlation functions, successfully eliminate any impact of redshift errors on our full-shape constraints. We also present a strategy for removing this contamination from real data, by removing $\sim$0.3% of correlating pairs.</description>

      <title>An Agnostic Approach to Building Empirical Type Ia Supernova Light Curves: Evidence for Intrinsic Chromatic Flux Variation Using Nearby Supernova Factory Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new empirical Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) model with three chromatic flux variation templates: one phase dependent and two phase independent. No underlying dust extinction model or patterns of intrinsic variability are assumed. Implemented with Stan and trained using spectrally binned Nearby Supernova Factory spectrophotometry, we examine this model's 2D, phase-independent flux variation space using two motivated basis representations. In both, the first phase-independent template captures variation that appears dust-like, while the second captures a combination of effectively intrinsic variability and second-order dust-like effects. We find that approximately 13% of the modeled phase-independent flux variance is not dust-like. Previous empirical SN Ia models either assume an effective dust extinction recipe in their architecture, or only allow for a single mode of phase-independent variation. The presented results demonstrate such an approach may be insufficient, because it could "leak" noticeable intrinsic variation into phase-independent templates.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Velocity Distributions for Direct Detection: Astrophysical Uncertainties are Smaller Than They Appear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of direct detection experiments depends on the phase-space distribution of dark matter near the Sun, which can be modeled theoretically using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies. However, capturing the halo-to-halo variation in the local dark matter speeds -- a necessary step for quantifying the astrophysical uncertainties that feed into experimental results -- requires a sufficiently large sample of simulated galaxies, which has been a challenge. In this work, we quantify this variation with nearly one hundred Milky Way-like galaxies from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation, the largest sample to date at this resolution. Moreover, we introduce a novel phase-space scaling procedure that endows every system with a reference frame that accurately reproduces the local standard-of-rest speed of our Galaxy, providing a principled way of extrapolating the simulation results to real-world data. The predicted speed distributions are consistent with the Standard Halo Model, a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution peaked at the local circular speed and truncated at the escape speed. The dark matter-nucleon cross section limits placed by these speed distributions vary by ~60% about the median. This places the 1-sigma astrophysical uncertainty at or below the level of the systematic uncertainty of current ton-scale detectors, even down to the energy threshold. The predicted uncertainty remains unchanged when sub-selecting on those TNG galaxies with merger histories similar to the Milky Way. Tabulated speed distributions, as well as Maxwell-Boltzmann fits, are provided for use in computing direct detection bounds or projecting sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Warm Inflation with Pseudo-scalar couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflaton couplings during warm inflation result in the production of a thermal bath. Thermal friction and fluctuations can dominate the standard de Sitter analogues, resulting in a modified slow-roll scenario with a new source of density fluctuations. Due to issues with back-reaction, it is advantageous to consider inflaton couplings with the thermal bath that are pseudo-scalar in nature, e.g., derivative interactions or topological $F \tilde F$ couplings. We demonstrate that $\textit{ every single}$ existing model of warm inflation utilizing pseudo-scalar couplings needs to be corrected to account for the chemical potentials that the thermal bath acquires in response to the inflaton coupling. These chemical potentials are for non-conserved charges, and are non-zero only because of the applied inflaton couplings. The model-dependent chemical potentials modify the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, making the relationship between the thermal friction and thermal fluctuations model-dependent. In extreme cases, these chemical potentials can cause the friction term to vanish while thermal fluctuations remain non-zero. In the context of a simple example, we demonstrate how to calculate the chemical potentials, thermal friction, and thermal fluctuations using both the Boltzmann equations and by calculating thermal expectation values, showing explicitly that the two approaches give the same result.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismological constraints on--and hints of--dark matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If dark matter interacts with nuclei or electrons, then elastic collisions with constituents of stars will cause some of the galactic dark matter to fall below the escape velocity and become gravitationally bound. For asymmetric dark matter (which does not self-annihilate), the large accumulated population of dark matter can act as an additional source of heat transport, altering stellar structure and evolution. These effects can be probed by the use of asteroseismology. Here, we demonstrate this effect via numerical simulations. We use Monte Carlo-calibrated heat transport calculations, with a focus on the erasure of the convective core in stars that are slightly more massive than the Sun. We find limits on spin-dependent dark matter-nucleon and dark matter-electron interactions using asteroseismological data from a nearby sub-giant star. More tantalizingly, we find a $\gtrsim 4 \sigma$ preference for dark matter-electron interactions for dark matter masses $\lesssim 3.5$ GeV and cross sections $\sigma_{\chi-e} \sim 10^{-34.5}$ cm$^2$, albeit in strong tension with limits from Earth-based direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scalar perturbations for a metric reconstructed from group field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While homogeneous cosmologies have long been studied in the group field theory (GFT) approach to quantum gravity, including a quantum description of cosmological perturbations is highly non-trivial. Here we apply a recent proposal for reconstructing an effective spacetime metric in GFT to the case of a metric with small inhomogeneities over a homogeneous background. We detail the procedure and give general expressions for cosmological scalar perturbations defined in terms of the GFT energy-momentum tensor. These include all the scalar components of standard perturbation theory and hence can be used to define gauge-invariant quantities. We compute these perturbations explicitly for a particular Fock coherent state. While it was previously shown that such a state can be interpreted as an approximately flat homogeneous cosmology at late times, here we find that inhomogeneities do not follow the dynamics of general relativity in the semiclassical regime. More specifically, restricting ourselves to a specific coherent state in a simple (free) GFT, we study two types of perturbative GFT modes, squeezed and oscillating modes. For squeezed modes we find perturbation equations with Euclidean signature and a late-time limit that differs from general relativistic perturbation equations. Oscillating modes satisfy different dynamical equations that also differ from those of general relativity, but show a Lorentzian signature. Our analysis should be understood as a first step in understanding cosmological perturbations within the effective GFT metric.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on the Kerr and its several single-parameter modified spacetimes using quasi-periodic oscillation data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical effects of particles moving in the Kerr spacetime and its nine single-parameter modified spacetimes, including Bardeen, Ayon-Beato and Garcia (ABG), Hayward, Kerr-Newman (KN), Kerr-Taub-NUT (KTN), Braneworld Kerr (BK), Kerr-MOG, Kerr-Sen, and Perfect Fluid Dark Matter (PFDM) black holes. Using quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) observational data, we constrain the free parameters of the ten spacetimes through $\chi^2$ analysis under the relativistic precession model of QPO. We constrain the modification parameters for the nine single-parameter modified spacetimes and provide the spin and mass ranges of three microquasars within the ten spacetime models (including Kerr) at the $68\%$ confidence level (CL). The results demonstrate that, at the $68 \%$ CL, the QPO data impose stringent constraints on the free parameters, as evidenced by the narrow confidence intervals. Among them, only the KN spacetime yields a modification parameter constraint spanning both negative and positive values (encompassing the Kerr case at zero). In contrast, all other tested geometries mandate positive-definite parameters at $68 \%$ CL, demonstrating statistical deviation of the Kerr solution. This highlights the significance of exploring modifications to the Kerr spacetime. Finally, we evaluate the spacetime models using the Bayes factor and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Based on the current QPO observational data, the Bayesian factor analysis indicates that the ABG, Hayward, KN, BK, and Kerr-MOG spacetime have a slight advantage over the Kerr solution, while the Bardeen, KTN, Kerr-Sen, and PFDM spacetime are somewhat inferior to the Kerr model. In contrast, the AIC analysis shows that the Kerr spacetime remains the optimal model under the current QPO data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study graviton-photon conversion in the magnetic fields of a blazar jet and explore the possibility of detecting high-frequency gravitational waves through blazar observations. We calculate the conversion rate using the magnetic field configurations of leptonic, lepto-hadronic, and hadronic one-zone synchrotron self-Compton models for the blazar jet of Mrk 501. By requiring that the photon flux produced within the blazar jet does not exceed the observed flux of Mrk 501, we derive conservative constraints on the abundance of stochastic gravitational waves. We find that, for all three models considered, the resulting limits can be more stringent than previous constraints in the frequency range from $10^8$ Hz to $10^{15}$ Hz.</description>

      <title>L-BASS: a project to produce an absolutely calibrated 1.4 GHz sky map, I -- Scientific rationale and system overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: L-BASS is an instrument designed to produce an absolutely calibrated map of the sky at a wavelength of 21 cm (L-band) with a radiometric accuracy of less than or equal to 0.1 K and with an angular resolution of 23 degrees. The prime motivations are to improve the temperature calibration of higher resolution maps and to investigate the steep spectrum radio background proposed by the ARCADE 2 team. The instrument consists of a pair of conical horn antennas which can scan independently in elevation; each antenna produces a circularly polarized output. The difference in signals from the antennas is measured with a continuous-comparison receiver connected to a digital spectrometer sampling the signal from 1400 MHz to 1425 MHz within the protected radio astronomy band. We describe the astrophysical motivation for the project, the design requirements and how these will be attained.</description>

      <title>Time as a test-field: the no-boundary universe in motion and a smooth radiation bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review two arguments for using the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum cosmology and propose restricting to solutions in which time acts as a component with negligible backreaction on the metric - that is, it plays the role of a test field. We apply this idea to various minisuperspace models. In the semiclassical regime we recover expected results: the wavefunction peaks on the classical solution and, in models with a scalar field, the variance of $\zeta$ (a mini-superspace analogue of the comoving curvature perturbation) is conserved in time. Applied to the no-boundary wavefunction, our model highlights a bouncing behavior, which gives a straightforward quantum representation of global de Sitter space. We argue that the inevitable time dependence of the variance of the wavefunction breaks some of the classical de Sitter symmetries. Then, by modeling radiation as a fluid, we analyze the epoch of radiation domination near the singularity. The problem is equivalent to an $s$-wave scattering off a central power-law potential of the form $-r^{-2/3}$. Such a potential admits bound states, so the system is stable and the wavepacket undergoes unitary scattering. The radiation bounce, as opposed to the no-boundary bounce, does not have a classical counterpart as the corresponding classical solutions are singular. During the radiation bounce, the uncertainty and the expectation value of the scale factor become comparable. By selecting a large initial variance, the bounce can be made arbitrarily smooth, the mean value of the Hubble parameter correspondingly soft.</description>

Abstract: When measuring the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) scale from galaxy surveys, one typically assumes a fiducial cosmology when converting redshift measurements into comoving distances and also when defining input parameters for the reconstruction algorithm. A parameterised template for the model to be fitted is also created based on a (possibly different) fiducial cosmology. This model reliance can be considered a form of data compression, and the data is then analysed allowing that the true answer is different from the fiducial cosmology assumed. In this study, we evaluate the impact of the fiducial cosmology assumed in the BAO analysis of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey Data Release 1 (DR1) on the final measurements in DESI 2024 III. We utilise a suite of mock galaxy catalogues with survey realism that mirrors the DESI DR1 tracers: the bright galaxy sample (BGS), the luminous red galaxies (LRG), the emission line galaxies (ELG) and the quasars (QSO), spanning a redshift range from 0.1 to 2.1. We compare the four secondary AbacusSummit cosmologies against DESI's fiducial cosmology (Planck 2018). The secondary cosmologies explored include a lower cold dark matter density, a thawing dark energy universe, a higher number of effective species, and a lower amplitude of matter clustering. The mocks are processed through the BAO pipeline by consistently iterating the grid, template, and reconstruction reference cosmologies. We determine a conservative systematic contribution to the error of $0.1\%$ for both the isotropic and anisotropic dilation parameters $\alpha_{\rm iso}$ and $\alpha_{\rm AP}$. We then directly test the impact of the fiducial cosmology on DESI DR1 data.</description>

      <title>Dark matter coupled to radiation: Limits from the Milky Way satellites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions between dark matter (DM) and relativistic particles at early times suppress structure formation on small scales. In particular, the scattering process transfers heat and momentum from radiation to DM, ultimately reducing the abundance of low-mass DM halos and the dwarf galaxies they host. Herein, we derive limits on DM-photon and DM-neutrino scattering cross section using the Milky Way satellite galaxy population. We consider temperature-independent interactions parameterized by DM mass ($m_\chi$) and DM-radiation interaction cross section ($\sigma_{\chi\text{-}i}$, where $i$ represents the target species). By requiring that the linear matter power spectra be strictly less suppressed than in the case of a thermal-relic warm DM cutoff, we derive the following $95\%$ upper limits at $m_\chi=1$ MeV: $\sigma_{\chi\text{-}\gamma}&lt;1.98\times10^{-38}\text{cm}^2$ and $\sigma_{\chi\text{-}\nu}&lt;3.16\times10^{-38}\text{cm}^2$. Our bounds on $\sigma_{\chi\text{-}i}$ depend linearly on $m_\chi$ for $m_\chi \gtrsim 1~\mathrm{MeV}$ and improve upon previous limits by 1 order of magnitude. The mass dependence of our limit approaches $m_\chi^3$ at lower masses due to the effects of DM sound speed; at $m_{\chi}=100~\mathrm{keV}$, we arrive at an upper limit 3 orders of magnitude more stringent than achieved in previous explorations. Upcoming dwarf galaxy surveys will further improve the sensitivity of similar analyses, complementing laboratory and indirect detection searches for DM-radiation interactions.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity Beyond the Scalar Sector: A Search for Tensor and Mixed Tensor-Scalar Bispectra with Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves could be non-Gaussian, just like primordial scalar perturbations. Although the tensor two-point function has thus-far remained elusive, the three-point function could, in principle, be large enough to be detected in Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropies. We perform a detailed analysis of tensor and mixed tensor-scalar non-Gaussianity through the Planck PR4 bispectrum, placing constraints on eleven primordial templates, spanning various phenomenological and physical regimes including modifications to gravity, additional fields in inflation, and primordial magnetic fields. All analysis is performed using modern quasi-optimal binned estimators, and yields no evidence for tensor non-Gaussianity, with a maximum detection significance of $2\sigma$. Our constraints are derived primarily from large-scales (except for tensor-scalar-scalar models), and benefit greatly from the inclusion of $B$-modes. Although we find some loss of information from binning, mask effects and residual foreground contamination, our $f_{\rm NL}$ bounds improve over those of previous analyses by $(20-700)\%$, with six of the eleven models being analyzed for the first time. Unlike for scalar non-Gaussianity, future low-noise experiments such as LiteBIRD, the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, will yield considerable improvement in tensor non-Gaussianity constraints.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity realizations of quintom dark energy after DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the realization of quintom scenario for dynamical dark energy within modified gravity theories that can efficiently fit the recent observational datasets. Starting from a general effective field theory formulation of dark energy in metric-affine geometry, we derive the background action in unitary gauge and we demonstrate how both $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ gravity can naturally realize quintom behavior through appropriate forms and parameter choices. Additionally, using the Gaussian process reconstruction of the latest DESI DR2 BAO data combined with SNe and CMB observations, we extract the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state parameter, showing that it exhibits quintom-type evolution, crossing the phantom divide from below. Moreover, through detailed parameter estimations and application of information criteria, we compare the model with the quadratic one. Our results show that, due to its rich structure, modified gravity stands as one of the main candidates for the realization of the data-favoured dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic particle creation from $T-$vacuum in the radiation dominated universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We further investigate novel features of the $T-$vacuum state, originally defined in the context of quantum field theory in a (1+1) dimensional radiation dominated universe [Modak, JHEP 12, 031 (2020)]. Here we extend the previous work to a realistic (3+1) dimensional set up and show that $T-$vacuum gives rise to an anisotropic particle creation phenomena in the radiation dominated early universe. Unlike the Hawking or Unruh effect, where the particle content is thermal and asymptotically defined, here it is non-thermal and instantaneous. This novel example of particle creation is interesting because these particles are detected in the frame of physical/cosmological observers, who envision $T-$vacuum as a particle excited state. Such results comes with a potential to be eventually compared with the observed anisotropies from the early universe and may provide new insights on cosmological particle creation.</description>

      <title>Bridging the micro-Hz gravitational wave gap via Doppler tracking with the Uranus Orbiter and Probe Mission: Massive black hole binaries, early universe signals and ultra-light dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the recent announcement by NASA's \textit{Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032}, a priority flagship mission to the planet Uranus is anticipated. Here, we explore the prospects of using the mission's radio Doppler tracking equipment to detect gravitational waves (GWs) and other analogous signals related to dark matter (DM) over the duration of its interplanetary cruise. We develop a methodology to stack tracking data and account for time varying detector geometry, thereby constructing the sensitivity of the mission to GWs over the wide frequency range of $3\times 10^{-9}$ Hz to $10^{-4}$ Hz. We find that the mission has the potential to fill the gap between pulsar timing and space-based-interferometry GW observatories. If improvements in reducing \textit{Cassini} era noise by a factor of $\sim$10 are implemented, we forecast the detection of $\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}(\rm{few})$ individual massive black hole binaries using two independent population models. Additionally, we determine the mission's sensitivity to both astrophysical and primordial stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, as well as its capacity to test, or even confirm via detection, ultralight DM models. In all these cases, the tracking of the spacecraft over its interplanetary cruise would enable coverage of unexplored regions of parameter space, where signals from new phenomena in our Universe may be lurking.</description>

      <title>Optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of quasars at $z&gt;6.5$: public data release and composite spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations for a sample of $45$ quasars at $6.50 &lt; z \leq 7.64$ with absolute magnitudes at $1450$ {\AA} in the range $-28.82 \leq M_{1450} \leq -24.13$ and their composite spectrum. The median redshift and $M_{1450}$ of the quasars in the sample are $z_{\rm{median}}=6.71$ and $M_{1450,\rm{median}} \simeq -26.1$, respectively. The NIR spectra are taken with echelle spectrographs, complemented with additional data from optical long slit instruments, and then reduced consistently using the open-source Python-based spectroscopic data reduction pipeline PypeIt. The median of the mean signal-to-noise ratios per $110$ km s$^{-1}$ pixel in the J, H, and K band (median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{\lambda} \rangle$) is: median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{J} \rangle=9.7$, median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{H} \rangle=10.3$, and median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{K} \rangle=11.7$; demonstrating the good data quality. This work presents the largest medium/moderate-resolution sample of quasars at $z&gt;6.5$ from ground-based instruments. Despite the diversity in instrumental setups and spectral quality, the data set is uniformly processed and well-characterized, making it ideally suited for several scientific goals, including the study of the quasar proximity zones and damping wings, the Ly$\alpha$ forest, the intergalactic medium's metal content, as well as other properties such as the distribution of SMBH masses and Eddington ratios. Our composite spectrum is compared to others at both high and low-$z$ from the literature, showing differences in the strengths of many emission lines, probably due to differences in luminosity among the samples, but a consistent continuum slope, which proves that the same spectral features are preserved in quasars at different redshift ranges.</description>

      <title>Cold Dark Matter Based on an Analogy with Superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel candidate for cold dark matter consisting of condensed Cooper pairs in a theory of interacting fermions with broken chiral symmetry. Establishing the thermal history from the early radiation era to the present, the fermions are shown to behave like standard radiation at high temperatures, but then experience a critical era decaying faster than radiation, akin to freeze-out, which sets the relic abundance. Through a second-order phase transition, fermion-antifermion pairs condense and the system asymptotes toward zero temperature and pressure. By the present era, the nonrelativistic, massive condensate decays slightly faster than in the standard scenario--a unique prediction that may be tested by combined measurements of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure. We also show that in the case of massive fermions, the phase transition is frustrated, and instead leaves a residual, long-lived source of dark energy.</description>

      <title>The density of states method for symplectic gauge theories at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the finite-temperature behaviour of the $Sp(4)$ Yang-Mills lattice theory in four dimensions, by applying the Logarithmic Linear Relaxation (LLR) algorithm. We demonstrate the presence of coexisting (metastable) phases, when the system is in the proximity of the transition. We measure observables such as the free energy, the expectation value of the plaquette operator and of the Polyakov loop, as well as the specific heat, and the Binder cumulant. We use these results to obtain a high-precision measurement of the critical coupling at the confinement-deconfinement transition, and assess its systematic uncertainty, for one value of the lattice extent in the time direction. Furthermore, we perform an extensive study of the finite-volume behaviour of the lattice system, by repeating the measurements for fixed lattice time extent, while increasing the spatial size of the lattice. We hence characterise the first-order transition on the lattice, and present the first results in the literature on this theory for the infinite volume extrapolation of lattice quantities related to latent heat and interface tension.
  Gauge theories with $Sp(4)$ group have been proposed as new dark sectors to provide a fundamental origin for the current phenomenological evidence of dark matter. A phase transition at high temperature, in such a new dark sector, occurring in the early universe, might have left a relic stochastic background of gravitational waves. Our results represent a milestone toward establishing whether such a new physics signal is detectable in future experiments, as they enter the calculation of the parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, controlling the power spectrum of gravitational waves. We also outline the process needed in the continuum extrapolation of our measurements, and test its feasibility on one additional choice of temporal extent of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Galaxy populations in protoclusters at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties and redshift evolution of simulated galaxies residing in protoclusters at cosmic noon, to understand the influence of the environment on galaxy formation. This work is to build clear expectations for the ongoing ODIN survey, devoted to mapping large-scale structures at z=2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 using Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) as tracers. From the IllustrisTNG simulations, we define subregions centered on the most massive clusters ranked by total stellar mass at z=0 and study the properties of galaxies within, including LAEs. To model the LAE population, we take a semi-analytical approach that assigns Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and equivalent width based on the UV luminosities to galaxies in a probabilistic manner. We investigate stellar mass, star formation rate, major mergers, and specific star formation rate of the population of star-forming galaxies and LAEs in the field and protocluster environment and trace their evolution. We find that the overall shape of the UV luminosity function (LF) in simulated protocluster environments is characterized by a shallower faint-end slope and an excess on the bright end, signaling different formation histories for galaxies therein. The difference is milder for the Ly$\alpha$ LF. While protocluster galaxies follow the same SFR-$M_{\odot}$ scaling relation as average field galaxies, a larger fraction appears to have experienced major mergers in the last 200 Myr and as a result shows enhanced star formation at a ~60% level, leading to a flatter distribution in both SFR and $M_{\odot}$ relative to galaxies in the average field. We find that protocluster galaxies, including LAEs, begin to quench much earlier (z~0.8-1.6) than field galaxies (z~0.5-0.9); our result is in agreement with recent observational results and highlights the importance of large-scale environment on the overall formation history of galaxies.</description>

      <title>C-19 and Hot, Wide, Star Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The C-19 star stream has the abundance characteristics of an unusually metal poor globular cluster but kinematically is uncharacteristically hot and wide for a cluster stream, having a line of sight velocity dispersion of 7 +/- 2 km/s and a 1-sigma width of 240 pc. We show that the tidal dissolution of an old, lower mass, globular cluster in a CDM galactic halo can create a hot, wide stream currently near orbital apocenter. A cosmological Milky Way n-body simulation motivates the parameters for an evolving Milky Way halo potential containing an orbiting subhalo population in which we model a star cluster progenitor of C-19. The same model parameters have been used for a GD-1 stream model. The ~7 km/s velocity dispersion is readily accomplished with an evolving CDM subhalo population, a progenitor cluster mass ~2x10^4 M_sun and an orbit that keeps the progenitor orbital pericenter within about 10 kpc of the Milky Way dark halo or its precursors.</description>

      <title>Topological dark energy from black-hole formations and mergers through the gravity-thermodynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the gravity-thermodynamics approach in the case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, and its corresponding Wald-Gauss-Bonnet entropy, which due to the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem it is related to the Euler characteristic of the Universe topology. However, we consider the realistic scenario where we have the formation and merger of black holes that lead to topology changes, which induce entropy changes in the Universe horizon. We extract the modified Friedmann equations and we obtain an effective dark energy sector of topological origin. We estimate the black-hole formation and merger rates starting from the observed star formation rate per redshift, which is parametrized very efficiently by the Madau-Dickinson form, and finally we result to a dark-energy energy density that depends on the cosmic star formation rate density, on the fraction $f_{\text{BH}}$ of stars forming black holes, on the fraction of black holes $f_\text{merge}$ that eventually merge, on the fraction $ f_{\text{bin}}$ of massive stars that are in binaries, on the average mass of progenitor stars that will evolve to form black holes $ \langle m_{\text{prog}} \rangle $, as well as on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. We investigate in detail the cosmological evolution, obtaining the usual thermal history. Concerning the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter, we show that at intermediate redshifts it exhibits phantom-like or quintessence-like behavior according to the sign of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling, while at early and late times it tends to the cosmological constant value. Finally, we study the effect of the other model parameters, showing that for the whole allowed observationally estimated ranges, the topological dark-energy equation-of-state parameter remains within its observational bounds.</description>

      <title>Is MOND necessarily nonlinear?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The iconic, deep-MOND-limit (DML) relation between acceleration and mass, $a\sim (M\mathcal{A}_0)^{1/2}/r$, implies that, in MOND, accelerations cannot be linear in the mass distribution ($\mathcal{A}_0\equiv Ga_0$ is the DML constant, and $a_0$ the MOND acceleration). This leads to important idiosyncracies of MOND, such as a breakdown of the strong equivalence principle, and the resulting ``external-field effect''. I show that the DML axioms are, in themselves, consistent with a, possibly unique, nonrelativistic, action-based, linear formulation of the DML. This model suffers from important drawbacks, which may make it unacceptable as a basis for a full-fledged MOND theory. The model is unique among MOND theories propounded to date not only in being linear -- hence not exhibiting an external-field effect, for example -- but in constituting a modification of both Newtonian inertia and Newtonian gravity. This linear and time-local model inspires and begets several, one-parameter families of models. One family employs nonlinear, time-nonlocal kinetic terms, but still linear gravitational-field equations. Other families generalize the DMLs of AQUAL and QUMOND, modifying gravity as well as inertia. All families employ fractional time derivatives and possibly fractional Laplacians. At present, I cannot base some acceptable MOND theory on these models -- for example, I cannot offer a sensible umbrella theory that interpolates between these DML models and Newtonian dynamics. They are, however, quite useful in elucidating various matter-of-principle aspects of MOND; e.g., they help to understand which predictions follow from only the basic tenets of MOND -- so-called primary predictions -- and which are secondary, i.e., theory dependent. The models may also show the way to a wider class of MOND theories. (Abridged.)</description>
