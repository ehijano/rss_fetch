      <title>Bifurcations of polynomial functions with diffeomorphic fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomena that cause a value of a polynomial function to be a bifurcation one are yet to be described when the fibers have dimension higher than $1$. In this note, the main result is the construction of a polynomial submersion function of $\mathbb{R}^3$ with connected fibers having a bifurcation value such that close enough to it the fibers are mutually diffeomorphic. We also present an example of a polynomial submersion function of $\mathbb{R}^2$ having a bifurcation value such that close enough to it the fibers are mutually diffeomorphic.</description>

      <title>Quantum Extremal Transitions and Special L-values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A threefold extremal transition $Y \searrow X$ consists of a crepant extremal contraction $\phi \colon Y \to \bar Y$ with curve class $\ell \in \operatorname{NE}(Y)$, followed by a smoothing $\bar Y\rightsquigarrow X$. We consider the Type II case that $\phi$ contracts a divisor $E$ to a point and prove that the quantum cohomology $QH(X)$ is obtained from $QH(Y)$ via analytic continuation, regularization, and specialization in $Q^\ell$. Besides roots of unity, special $\mathrm{L}$-values appear in $\lim Q^\ell$ whenever $\bar Y$ admits more than one smoothings.
  Further techniques are employed and explored beyond known tools in Gromov--Witten theory including (i) the canonical local B model attached to $Y \searrow X$, (ii) existence of semistable reduction of double point type for the smoothing, (iii) the modularity of the extremal function $\mathbb{E} := E^3/\langle E, E, E\rangle^Y$, and (iv) periods integrals of Eisenstein series. Our study provides a geometric framework linking classifications of del Pezzo surfaces, Ramanujan's theta functions, and Zagier's special ODE list via Type II transitions.</description>

      <title>Boundedness Results for Planar Linear Systems Assuming The Segre-Harbourne-Gimigliano-Hirschowitz Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X_n$ be the projective plane blown up at $n \geq 10$ general points. In this paper we give several consequences of the Segre-Harbourne-Gimigliano-Hirschowitz Conjecture, that pertain to complete linear systems on $X_n$. We begin by classifying such systems $|C|$ with general irreducible member of genus $g \geq 2$ (up to Cremona equivalence), in terms of invariants of the adjoint systems $|C+mK|$. We then use this to prove that, for fixed $n \geq 10$ and $g\geq 2$, up to the action of the Cremona group, there exist finitely many complete linear systems on $X_n$ whose general member is irreducible of genus $g$. Further, there is a function $g\mapsto n(g)$ such that every such (effective) system is Cremona equivalent to a system in $X_{n(g)}$. The latter result is based on the explicit computation of the minimum possible self-intersection of an irreducible linear system with given $n$ and $\dim(|C|)$. We classify those systems which achieve the minimal self-intersection. We also classify the systems with $C^2 \leq 5$, whether or not they have minimal $C^2$ for the given $n$ and dimension. We finish by proving several statements concerning systems that are base-point-free, and systems that give birational maps to their image.</description>

      <title>Derived Stratifications and Arithmetic Intersection Theory for Varieties with Isolated Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, We develop the stratified de Rham theory on singular spaces using modern tools including derived geometry and stratified structures. This work unifies and extends the de Rham theory, Hodge theory, and deformation theory of singular spaces into the frameworks of stratified geometry, $p$-adic geometry, and derived geometry. Additionally, we close a gap in Ohsawa's original proof, concerning the convergence of $L^2$ harmonic forms in the Cheeger-Goresky-MacPherson conjecture for varieties with isolated singularities. Indicating that harmonic forms converge strongly and the $L^2$-cohomology coincides with intersection cohomology.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Supermanifolds through Sheaf and Ringed Space Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of supermanifolds, viewed as the super-analogues of classical manifolds. Instead of treating supermanifolds as sets of points, we adopt an algebraic-geometric perspective, emphasizing the algebra of functions and utilizing the framework of ringed spaces and sheaf theory. We begin by constructing presheaves and sheaves to define locally ringed spaces, which model the local structure of supermanifolds. Superfunctions, a key element, are shown to differ significantly from ordinary functions, leading to a richer structure. We also prove a key characterization theorem for morphisms between supermanifolds and demonstrate that the category of supermanifolds admits finite products. This approach provides a solid foundation for further studies in mathematics and theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Geometric Langlands in positive characteristic from characteristic zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish part of the statement of the geometric Langlands conjecture for l-adic sheaves over a field of positive characteristic. Namely, we show that the category of automorphic sheaves with nilpotent singular support is equivalent to the appropriately defined category of ind-coherent sheaves on the union of some of the connected components of the stack of Langlands parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the geometry of the Albanese morphism on 0-cycles. We provide an example of a smooth projective variety with representable CH_0-group but with no universal 0-cycle, which answers a question asked by Colliot-Th\'el\`ene. Our construction relies on a counterexample to the integral Hodge conjecture provided by Benoist and Ottem.</description>

      <title>Applications of the factorization theorem of conformal blocks to vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the factorization and vector bundle propositionerty of the sheaves of conformal blocks on $\overline{\mathscr{M}}_{g,n}$. defined by vertex operator algebras (VOAs) and give geometric proofs of essential results in the representation theory of strongly rational VOAs. We first prove the associativity of the fusion tensor product by investigating four-point conformal blocks on genus zero curves. Then we give a formula to calculate the ranks of VOA-conformal block bundles. Finally, by investigating one-point conformal blocks on genus-one curves, we prove the modular invariance of intertwining operators for VOAs, which is a generalization of Zhu's modular invariance for module vertex operators of strongly rational VOAs, and is a specialization of Huang's recent modular invariance of logarithmic intertwining operators for $C_2$-cofinite VOAs.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of spaces and numbers -- anabelian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ``Can number and geometric spaces be reconstructed from their symmetries?'' This question, which is at the heart of anabelian geometry, a theory built on the collaborative efforts of an international community in many variants and with the Japanese arithmetic school as a core, illustrates, in the case of a positive answer, the universality of the homotopic method in arithmetic geometry. Starting with elementary examples, we first introduce the motivations and guiding principles of the theory, then present its most structuring results and its contemporary trends. As a result, the reader is presented with a rich and diverse landscape of mathematics, which thrives on theoretical and explicit methods, and runs from number theory to topology.</description>

      <title>The tensor triangular geometry of fully faithful functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the map on Balmer spectra induced by a fully faithful geometric functor is a quotient map whose fibers are connected. This is an analogue of the Zariski Connectedness Theorem in algebraic geometry and it can be applied to a plethora of examples in equivariant and motivic mathematics. We isolate a significant source of examples by introducing the "concentration" of a tt-category at a well-behaved chosen set of compact generators. Various categories of cellular objects arise in this way. In particular, the "unitation" of a tt-category is the concentration at the unit object. We compute the Balmer spectrum of the unitation of the equivariant stable homotopy category as well as related categories arising in equivariant higher algebra. We also apply our results to the study of the comparison map of a tt-category. Among other results, we prove that the comparison map of a connective category is a quotient map with connected fibers. This involves studying the tt-geometry of weight complex functors, which may be of independent interest. We also study the relationship between the comparison map and the affinization of the Balmer spectrum viewed as a locally ringed space. These results provide a layered approach to understanding the spectrum of a given tt-category, by starting with the Zariski spectrum of the endomorphism ring of the unit, and then passing backwards to larger and larger concentrations (through quotient maps with connected fibers). Significant stages along the way include the passage to the unitation and the passage to the concentration at the Picard group.</description>

      <title>The Derivative of a Constructible Function is Constructible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of constructible functions in the setting of tame real geometry has been introduced by Cluckers and Dan Miller in their work on parametric integration of globally subanalytic functions. A function on a globally subanalytic set is called constructible if it is a finite sum of finite products of globally subanalytic functions and the logarithm of positive globally subanalytic functions. We show that the class of constructible functions is stable under taking derivatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct, for each 2&lt;r&lt;18, an explicit family of higher Chow cycles of type (2,1) on a family of lattice-polarized K3 surfaces of generic Picard rank r, and prove that the indecomposable part of this cycle is non-torsion for very general members of the family. These are the first explicit examples of such families in middle Picard rank. Our construction is based on singular double plane model of K3 surfaces, and the proof of indecomposability is done by a degeneration method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13456v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Frobenius--stable version of the Grauert--Riemenschneider vanishing theorem fails for threefolds in any positive characteristic, and for terminal 3-folds in characteristic $p \in \{2, 3, 5\}$. To prove this, we introduce the notion of $\mathbb{F}_p$-rationality for singularities in positive characteristic and we show that klt singularities in dimension at most 4 are $\mathbb{F}_p$-rational. We apply this to prove a Frobenius--stable version of the Kawamata--Viehweg vanishing theorem on $K$-trivial 3-folds.</description>

      <title>Terracini loci and a codimension one Alexander-Hirschowitz theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18751v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Terracini locus $\mathbb{T}(n, d; x)$ is the locus of all finite subsets $S$ of $ \mathbb{P}^n$ of cardinality $x$ such that $\langle S \rangle = \mathbb{P}^n$, $h^0(\mathcal{I}_{2S}(d)) &gt; 0$, and $h^1(\mathcal{I}_{2S}(d)) &gt; 0$. The celebrated Alexander-Hirschowitz Theorem classifies the triples $(n,d,x)$ for which $\dim\mathbb{T}(n, d; x)=xn$. Here we fully characterize the next step in the case $n=2$, namely, we prove that $\mathbb{T}(2,d;x)$ has at least one irreducible component of dimension $2x-1$ if and only if either $(d,x)\in\{(4,4),(4,6),$ $(5,6),(5,7),$ $(6,9),(6,10)\}$, or $d\ge 7$, $d\equiv 1,2 \pmod{3}$ and $x=(d+2)(d+1)/6$.</description>

Abstract: We characterize decomposable principally polarized abelian varieties of the form $E\times B$, with $E$ an elliptic curve, in two different ways, which are completely analogous to classical results of curve theory concerning hyperelliptic curves. The first one is by the failure of a normal generation property, namely the generation in degree zero of a certain graded module over the symmetric algebra over $H^0(2\Theta)$. This appears to be the first result of this type in the realm of p.p.a.v.'s. The second characterization is by the failure of surjectivity of a second order gaussian maps associated to line bundles corresponding to $6\Theta$, or, equivalently, by the fact that the line bundle corresponding to $3\Theta$ fails to separate $2$-jets at every point. We also show that this last result is equivalent to an effective version of a theorem of Nakamaye characterizing the above decomposable abelian varieties as those computing the minimal Seshadri constant. Finally we propose some conjectural generalizations relating $p$-jets separation thresholds, higher gaussian maps sujectivity thresholds, and Seshadri constants.</description>

Abstract: By an additive action on an algebraic variety $X$ over $\mathbb{C}$, we mean an action of the group $\mathbb{G}_a^n = \mathbb{C}^n $ on $X$ with an open orbit. We study limit points of one-dimensional subgroups of $\mathbb{G}_a^n$ for additive actions on projective hypersurfaces. We say that an additive action on $X$ satisfies the OP-condition if for every point $x\in X $ that does not lie in the open orbit $O$ there is a point $y \in O$ and a vector $v \in \mathbb{G}_a^n$ such that $ \lim_{t\to\infty} tv\circ y = x$. We find all projective hypersurfaces on which there is an additive action satisfying the OP-condition.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Hodge Cycles: A Novel Approach to the Hodge Conjecture via Generalized Moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hodge Conjecture, posits a profound connection between the topology and algebraic geometry of complex algebraic varieties. It asserts that Hodge cycles, specific elements in the cohomology of a K\"ahler variety with rational properties, originate from algebraic subvarieties. This paper introduces a novel approach to investigate this conjecture by generalizing the concept of Zernike moments through the lens of harmonic analysis and spectral geometry. Our core idea involves defining a ``characteristic form'' $\eta_Z$ for a Hodge cycle $Z$ within a K\"ahler variety $X$, and expanding this form in terms of the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $Z$. We hypothesize that for algebraic Hodge cycles, the coefficients of this spectral expansion (termed ``spectral fingerprints'') will exhibit specific algebraic patterns, such as being rational numbers, algebraic numbers, or algebraic functions of moduli parameters. We illustrate the computational methodology with a simplified ``toy model'' using a characteristic function on a torus, demonstrating how such coefficients can indeed be rational in a controlled setting. We then outline a conceptual framework for applying this approach to more complex scenarios, specifically K3 surfaces, by leveraging the theory of variations of Hodge structures and moduli spaces to define ``dynamic characteristic forms'' and analyze the algebraic nature of their coefficients. This framework promises to open new avenues in understanding the Hodge Conjecture by translating a deep geometric problem into a question about the algebraic properties of spectral data.</description>

      <title>Spectral Fingerprints of Algebraic Cycles: A Hodge-Theoretic Approach to the Hodge Conjecture and Special L-Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces and develops the "Spectral Fingerprint Philosophy" for detecting algebraic cycles on complex algebraic varieties, particularly K3 surfaces. This framework proposes that algebraic cycles can be revealed through intrinsic Hodge-theoretic and arithmetic data, leveraging the algebraic structure of period relations, Picard-Fuchs differential equations, and special values of motivic L-functions. The methodology extends to $(k,k)$-Hodge cycles on higher-dimensional K\"ahler manifolds, formulating a general criterion that links vanishing linear combinations of periods (interpreted as "spectral fingerprints") to the algebraicity of cycles and the arithmetic of corresponding L-functions. This perspective reframes the Hodge Conjecture as a statement about the algebraicity of spectral data within the variation of Hodge structures. A key contribution is the proposal and proof of a novel algebraic divisor on the Kummer K3 surface $X_{-1}$, which arises from complex multiplication (CM) on the elliptic curve $E_{2}(-1)$. By explicitly analyzing the period structure of $X_{-1}$, a non-trivial linear relation among period integrals, constituting the spectral fingerprint of this divisor, is derived. This result exemplifies how CM relations induce additional Hodge cycles and illustrates the broader philosophy behind spectral criteria for algebraicity, grounding the theory in established mathematical results and presenting concrete examples through case studies of genus-2 Riemann surfaces and Kummer K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>The Integral Chow Rings of the Moduli Stacks of Hyperelliptic Prym Pairs II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series devoted to describing the integral Chow ring of the moduli stacks $\mathcal{RH}_g$ of hyperelliptic Prym pairs. For fixed genus $g$, the stack $\mathcal{RH}_g$ is the disjoint union of $\lfloor (g+1)/2 \rfloor$ components $\mathcal{RH}_g^n$ for $n = 1, \ldots, \lfloor (g+1)/2 \rfloor$. In this paper, we give presentations and compute the integral Chow rings of the components $\mathcal{RH}_g^{(g+1)/2}$ for odd $g$. As an application, we also obtain presentations and Chow rings for all irreducible components of the moduli stack of hyperelliptic Spin curves of odd genus. An intermediate result of independent interest is the computation of the integral Chow ring of the moduli stack of unordered pairs of divisors of the same even degree in $\mathbb{P}^1$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Rigidity and Algebraicity: A Unified Framework for the Hodge Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel symbolic analytic framework to address the Hodge Conjecture, utilizing a refined invariant called the Hermitian spectral fingerprint. We modify the fingerprint functional to specifically exclude $(k,k)$ components, demonstrating its vanishing for rational classes of type $(k,k)$. Critically, we develop a comprehensive proof strategy to establish the converse: the vanishing of this refined fingerprint across all realization functors (de Rham and $\ell$adic) implies the class is absolute Hodge. By fundamental theorems in arithmetic algebraic geometry, absolute Hodge classes of type $(k,k)$ are equivalent to algebraic cycles. This framework offers a new, robust criterion for detecting algebraic cycles, reformulating the conjecture into a problem of establishing the exhaustive spanning properties of GaussManin derivatives and Galois actions within their respective cohomology spaces. While building upon established deep results, this approach provides a fresh perspective and a pathway towards a complete resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a symbolic analytic framework for addressing the Hodge Conjecture, based on a refined invariant called the Hermitian spectral fingerprint. By projecting out $(k,k)$ components from holomorphic forms and their Gauss Manin derivatives, we define a fingerprint functional that vanishes identically for any rational cohomology class of type $(k,k)$. We prove unconditionally that the projected derivatives span the entire orthogonal complement of $H^{k,k}(X)$ in $H^{2k}(X,\mathbb{C})$, implying structural vanishing. This vanishing criterion across realizations leads to absolute Hodge behavior and, by deep results in arithmetic geometry, confirms algebraicity. Thus, the Hodge Conjecture is resolved within this framework.</description>

Abstract: Given a triangulated category $D$ with an action of a fusion category $C$, we study the moduli space $Stab_{C}(D)$ of fusion-equivariant Bridgeland stability conditions on $D$. The main theorem is that the fusion-equivariant stability conditions form a closed, complex submanifold of the moduli space of stability conditions on $D$. As an application of this framework to finite group actions on categories, we generalise a result of Macr\`{i}--Mehrotra--Stellari by establishing a biholomorphism between the space of $G$-invariant stability conditions on $D$ and the space of $rep(G)$-equivariant stability conditions on the equivariant category $D^G$. We also describe applications to the study of stability conditions associated to McKay quivers and to geometric stability conditions on free quotients of smooth projective varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a categorical description of all abelian varieties with commutative endomorphism ring over a finite field with $q=p^a$ elements in a fixed isogeny class in terms of pairs consisting of a fractional $\mathbb Z[\pi,q/\pi]$-ideal and a fractional $W\otimes_{\mathbb Z_p} \mathbb Z_p[\pi,q/\pi]$-ideal, with $\pi$ the Frobenius endomorphism and $W$ the ring of integers in an unramified extension of $\mathbb Q_p$ of degree $a$. The latter ideal should be compatible at $p$ with the former and stable under the action of a semilinear Frobenius (and Verschiebung) operator; it will be the Dieudonn\'e module of the corresponding abelian variety. Using this categorical description we create effective algorithms to compute isomorphism classes of these objects and we produce many new examples exhibiting exotic patterns.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group with simply connected derived subgroup. Over the complex numbers there exists a local method to study the geometric properties of a point $g$ in the closure of a Jordan class of $G$ in terms of Jordan classes of a maximal rank reductive subgroup $M \leq G$ depending on the point $g$, and further to the closures of certain decomposition classes in Lie($M$). We adapt this method to the case of an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$, and we give sufficient restrictions on $p$ for it to hold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06705v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1990s, Kita--Yoshida and Cho--Matsumoto introduced intersection forms on the twisted (co)homologies of hyperplane arrangement complements. We give a closed combinatorial formula for these intersection pairings. We show that these intersection pairings are obtained from (continuous and discrete) Laplace transforms of subfans of the Bergman fan of the associated matroid. We compute inverses of these intersection pairings, allowing us to identify (variants of) these intersection forms with the contravariant form of Schechtman--Varchenko, and the bilinear form of Varchenko.
  Building on parallel joint work with C. Eur, we define a notion of scattering amplitudes for matroids. We show that matroid amplitudes satisfy locality and unitarity, and recover biadjoint scalar amplitudes in the case of the complete graphic matroid. We apply our formulae for twisted intersection forms to deduce old and new formulae for scattering amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: Let $Y$ be a genus $2$ curve over $\mathbb Q$. We provide a method to systematically search for possible candidates of a prime $\ell\geq 3$ and a genus $1$ curve $X$ for which there exists a genus $3$ curve $Z$ over $\mathbb Q$ whose Jacobian is, up to quadratic twist, $(\ell, \ell, \ell)$-isogenous to the product of Jacobians of $X$ and $Y$, building on the work by Hanselman, Schiavone, and Sijsling for $\ell=2$. We find several such pairs $(X,Y)$ for prime $\ell$ up to $13$. We also improve their numerical gluing algorithm, allowing us to successfully glue genus $1$ and genus $2$ curves along their $13$-torsion.</description>

Abstract: We establish a geometric construction of Kashiwara crystals on the irreducible components of the varieties of multiparameter persistence modules. Our approach differs from the seminal work of Kashiwara and Saito, as well as subsequent related works, by emphasizing commutative relations rather than preprojective relations for a given quiver. Furthermore, we provide explicit descriptions of the Kashiwara operators in the fundamental cases of 1- and 2-parameter persistence modules, offering concrete insights into the crystal structure in these settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a non-squarefree integer such that the quotient $X_0(N)^*$ of the modular curve $X_0(N)$ by the full group of Atkin-Lehner involutions has positive genus. Elkies conjectures that the rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ are only cusps or CM points when $N$ is large enough. We establish an integrality result for the $j$-invariants of non-cuspidal rational points on $X_0(N)^*$, representing a significant step toward resolving a key subcase of Elkies' conjecture. To this end, we prove the existence of rank-zero quotients of certain modular Jacobians $J_0(pq)$. Furthermore, we provide a complete classification of the rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ of genus $1 \leq g \leq 5$, when they are finite. In the process we identify exceptional rational points on $X_0(147)^*$ and $X_0(75)^*$ which were not known before.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-holomorphic curves with a fixed complex structure in positive symplectic manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a symplectic version of a conjecture of Lian and Pandharipande: in sufficiently high degree, the fixed-domain Gromov-Witten invariants of positive symplectic manifolds are signed counts of pseudo-holomorphic curves. The original conjecture in the complex algebraic setting was recently disproved by Beheshti et al. However, we show that the statement holds when the complex structure is replaced by a generic almost complex structure. The proof relies on showing that the fixed-domain Gromov-Witten pseudocycle can be constructed without the use of inhomogeneous or domain-dependent perturbations, which answers positively a question posed by Ruan and Tian.</description>

      <title>chipfiring: A Python Package for Efficient Mathematical Analysis of Chip-Firing Games on Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents `chipfiring`, a comprehensive Python package for the mathematical analysis of chip-firing games on finite graphs. The package provides a robust toolkit for defining graphs and chip configurations (divisors), performing chip-firing operations, and analyzing fundamental properties such as winnability, linear equivalence, and divisor rank. We detail the core components of the library, including its object-oriented graph and divisor implementations, integrated Laplacian matrix computations, and an efficient implementation of Dhar's algorithm for determining the solvability of the dollar game. The `chipfiring` package is designed for researchers and students in graph theory, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry, providing essential algorithms and data structures for exploring these rich mathematical models. We describe the library's architecture, illustrate its usage with comprehensive examples, and highlight its specialized contributions compared to general-purpose graph libraries.</description>
