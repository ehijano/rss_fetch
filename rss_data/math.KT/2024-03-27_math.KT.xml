      <title>Chain rule symmetry for singular SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise the chain rule symmetry for the geometric stochastic heat equations in the full subcritical regime for Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises. We show that the renormalised counter-terms that give a solution invariant under changes of coordinates are generated by iterations of covariant derivatives. The result was known only for space-time white noises, with a very specific proof that so far could not be extended to the general case. The key idea of the present paper is to change the perspective on several levels and to use ideas coming from operad theory and homological algebra. Concretely, we introduce the operad of Christoffel trees that captures the counter-terms of the renormalised equation; our main new insight is to describe the space of invariant terms homologically, using a suitable perturbation of the differential of the operadic twisting of that operad. As a consequence, we obtain the correct renormalisation for the quasi-linear KPZ equation in the subcritical regime completing the programme started by Hairer and Gerencser. Previously, the main algebraic tool used in the study of singular SPDEs were Hopf algebras of decorated trees; our work shows that operad theory and homological algebra add new powerful tools with immediate applications to open problems that were out of reach by other methods.</description>

      <title>A Quillen model structure of local homotopy equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we construct a closed model structure on the category of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-graded complexes of projective systems of ind-Banach spaces. When the base field is the fraction field $F$ of a complete discrete valuation ring $V$, the homotopy category of this model structure is the derived category of the quasi-abelian category $\overleftarrow{\mathsf{Ind}(\mathsf{Ban}_F)}$. This homotopy category is the appropriate target of the local and analytic cyclic homology theories for complete, torsionfree $V$-algebras and $\mathbb{F}$-algebras. When the base field is $\mathbb{C}$, the homotopy category is the target of local and analytic cyclic homology for pro-bornological $\mathbb{C}$-algebras, which includes the subcategory of pro-$C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Homotopy cofinality for Non-Abelian homology of group diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01726v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a homotopy cofinal functor between small categories induces a weak equivalence between homotopy colimits of pointed simplicial sets. This is used to prove that the non-Abelian homology of a group diagram is isomorphic to the homology of its inverse image under a homotopy cofinal functor. This also made it possible to establish that the non-Abelian homology of group diagrams are invariant under the left Kan extension along virtual discrete cofibrations. With the help of these results, we have constructed a non-Abelian Gabriel-Zisman homology theory for simplicial sets with coefficients in group diagrams. Moreover, we have generalized this theory to presheaves over an arbitrary small category, which play the role of simplicial sets. Sufficient conditions are found for the isomorphism of non-Abelian homology of presheaves over a small category with coefficients in group diagrams. It is proved that the non-Abelian homology of the factorization category for the small category is isomorphic to the Baues-Wirsching homology. A condition is found under which a functor between small categories induces an isomorphism of non-Abelian Baues-Wirsching homology.</description>
