      <title>Enhancing Microwave Heating Uniformity in Cavities Using a 2-bit Coding Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel method for enhancing microwave heating uniformity using a 2-bit coding metasurface is proposed. This metasurface is specially designed to scatter incident waves into multiple directions at 2.45 GHz rather than just one, significantly improving the electric field distribution uniformity within a cavity, and eliminating the need to redesign the cavity itself or modify the power excitation. Simulated results demonstrate a reduction in the coefficient of variation (COV) of potato temperature from 0.694 to 0.461, indicating enhanced heating uniformity while maintaining efficiency. Additionally, the measured potato temperatures show excellent agreement with the simulated results, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Induced Spiral Motion and Breathing Dynamics of Neel Skyrmions in Ferromagnetic Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions exhibit particle-like stability and rich dynamical behaviour arising from their topological nature, making them promising building blocks for future spintronic devices. In this work, we investigate the interaction dynamics of two Neel-type skyrmions in an ultrathin ferromagnetic film through a combined analytical and numerical approach. Full micromagnetic simulations reveal that when the initial separation exceeds twice the skyrmion radius, the pair undergoes a repulsive interaction leading to an outward spiral trajectory whose radial and angular components depend sensitively on the Gilbert damping, consistent with particle-like models of skyrmion motion. The simulations further show a two-component oscillatory behaviour in the out-of-plane magnetization: a fast intrinsic breathing mode superimposed on a slower interaction-induced modulation. Using Thiele collective-coordinate model, an expression for the radial drift, angular decay, and logarithmic growth of the separation distance is derived. The analytical predictions show excellent agreement with numerical results, confirming the exponential form of the long-range interaction potential. A continuum micromagnetic analysis of the skyrmion tail explains the origin of the exponential decay and its role in governing the interaction strength. Together, these findings provide a unified framework for understanding spiral motion, breathing dynamics, and long-range repulsion in interacting skyrmion systems, offering insights relevant for multi-skyrmion information carriers and collective skyrmion-based devices.</description>

      <title>Structure, biomineralization and biodegradation of Ca-Mg oxyfluorosilicates synthesized by inorganic salt coprecipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, a novel group of Ca-Mg oxyfluorosilicates containing different levels of fluoride substituting for oxide was synthesized by an inorganic salt coprecipitation process followed by calcination/sintering. The effects of the incorporation of fluoride on the resultant structural characteristics, apatite-forming ability and biodegradability were evaluated by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and pH measurements. According to the results, the samples containing up to 2 mol% F present a single-phase structure of diopside (MgCaSi2O6) doped with F. It was also found that to meet the most biomineralization characteristic, the optimal value of fluoride in the homogeneous samples is 1 mol%. In this regard, on the one hand, the partial incorporation of fluoride into apatite (via forming fluorohydroxyapatite) and, on the other hand, the absence of fluorite (CaF2) as a consumer of Ca in the deposits are responsible for achieving the most apatite-forming ability circumstance controlled by an ion-exchange reaction mechanism. In conclusion, this study reflects the merit of the optimization of fluoride-doping into Ca-Mg silicates for development in biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-enhanced dual-mode multiplexed optical sensor for point-of-care diagnostics of cardiovascular diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid and accessible cardiac biomarker testing is essential for the timely diagnosis and risk assessment of myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF), two interrelated conditions that frequently coexist and drive recurrent hospitalizations with high mortality. However, current laboratory and point-of-care testing systems are limited by long turnaround times, narrow dynamic ranges for the tested biomarkers, and single-analyte formats that fail to capture the complexity of cardiovascular disease. Here, we present a deep learning-enhanced dual-mode multiplexed vertical flow assay (xVFA) with a portable optical reader and a neural network-based quantification pipeline. This optical sensor integrates colorimetric and chemiluminescent detection within a single paper-based cartridge to complementarily cover a large dynamic range (spanning ~6 orders of magnitude) for both low- and high-abundance biomarkers, while maintaining quantitative accuracy. Using 50 uL of serum, the optical sensor simultaneously quantifies cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) within 23 min. The xVFA achieves sub-pg/mL sensitivity for cTnI and sub-ng/mL sensitivity for CK-MB and NT-proBNP, spanning the clinically relevant ranges for these biomarkers. Neural network models trained and blindly tested on 92 patient serum samples yielded a robust quantification performance (Pearson's r &gt; 0.96 vs. reference assays). By combining high sensitivity, multiplexing, and automation in a compact and cost-effective optical sensor format, the dual-mode xVFA enables rapid and quantitative cardiovascular diagnostics at the point of care.</description>

      <title>Incorporating rank-free coupling and external field via an amplitude-only modulated spatial photonic Ising machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as effective solvers for combinatorial optimization problems, such as NP-hard problems, machine learning, and financial modeling. Recent spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) excel in multi-node optimization and spin glass simulations, leveraging their large-scale and fully connected characteristics. However, existing laser diffraction-based SPIMs usually sacrifice time efficiency or spin count to encode high-rank spin-spin coupling and external fields, limiting their scalability for real-world applications. Here, we demonstrate an amplitude-only modulated rank-free spatial photonic Ising machine (AR-SPIM) with 200 iterations per second. By re-formulating an arbitrary Ising Hamiltonian as the sum of Hadamard products, followed by loading the corresponding matrices/vectors onto an aligned amplitude spatial light modulator and digital micro-mirrors device, we directly map a 797-spin Ising model with external fields (nearly 9-bit precision, -255 to 255) into an incoherent light field, eliminating the need for repeated and auxiliary operations. Serving as encoding accuracy metrics, the linear coefficient of determination and Pearson correlation coefficient between measured light intensities and Ising Hamiltonians exceed 0.9800, with values exceed 0.9997 globally. The AR-SPIM achieves less than 0.3% error rate for ground-state search of biased Max-cut problems with arbitrary ranks and weights, enables complex phase transition observations, and facilitates scalable spin counts for sparse Ising problems via removing zero-valued Hadamard product terms. This reconfigurable AR-SPIM can be further developed to support large-scale machine-learning training and deployed for practical applications in discrete optimization and quantum many-body simulations.</description>

      <title>On-chip quadratically nonlinear photodetector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Involving deterministically nonlinear photoresponse in on-chip photodetector is intriguing to develop sophisticated functions in photonic integrated circuits, such as in-sensor computing and optoelectronic mixing, though the corresponding devices are still lack of sufficient investigation. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip quadratically nonlinear photodetector (QNPD) by configuring an InSe p-i-n homojunction on a silicon waveguide. Telecom-band light guiding in the waveguide couples with the InSe evanescently and is frequency up-converted into visible light via InSe's second-harmonic generation (SHG), which is subsequently absorbed by InSe and finally generates photocurrent under the built-in electric field of the p-i-n homojunction. Governed by these sequential processes, the on-chip QNPD presents a quadratic function between photocurrent and optical power. Thanks to the efficient SHG and well-established homojunction in InSe, the QNPD reaches a high normalized responsivity of 37.1 A/W2 and low dark current of 1 pA, representing greatly improved performances among reported nonlinear photodetectors. Benefiting from the extra SHG process, the on-chip QNPD intrinsically incorporates light-light interactions, enabling straightforwardly monitoring all-optically mixing signals electrically. As an example, an array of 16-pixel QNPDs was designed to implement a fully single-shot on-chip autocorrelator without requirement of bulky optics and external cameras, which precisely measures picosecond pulses with high sensitivity of 6.1*10-10 W2.</description>

      <title>Electrically induced ferromagnetism in an irradiated complex oxide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In metal-insulator transition materials, a small perturbation can shift the delicate balance between competing or coexisting electronic phases, leading to dramatic changes of the material's properties. Using La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, a prototypical metal-insulator transition manganite, we show that local low-dose focused ion beam irradiation increases resistivity by several orders of magnitude, converting the ferromagnetic-metal ground state into a paramagnetic-insulator. Surprisingly, we found that applying electric stimuli to the irradiated material induces a non-thermal insulator-to-metal transition, which results in low-power, repeatable volatile resistive switching. Magnetotransport measurements revealed that this voltage-induced metallic phase in the irradiated material is ferromagnetic, exhibiting clear anisotropic magnetoresistance. This work, thus, reports the discovery of a unique material in which the electrical triggering of the electronic phase transition results in the onset of magnetism, in stark contrast to the magnetic order suppression commonly observed in other metal-insulator transition switching materials. We demonstrate that local focused ion beam irradiation provides new and exciting opportunities to engineer electronic and magnetic functionalities that can find practical applications ranging from spintronics to neuromorphic hardware.</description>

Abstract: In this research, we report the fabrication and characterization of a Ta/HfO2-x/Mo memristor. The synaptic behavior of a Ta/HfO2-x/Mo memristor has been investigated. HfO2-x (15 nm) was grown using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. Electrodes were fabricated using a sputtering system and photolithography method. The metal oxide stoichiometry was ascertained via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A pinched hysteresis loop is demonstrated through I-V measurements, confirming SET and RESET states. I-V measurement is supported by conduction mechanism analysis. A clear separation between high- and low-resistance states is shown during repeated reads. The neuromorphic characteristics of the device are confirmed through long-term potentiation/depression and paired-pulse facilitation. These results demonstrate that Ta/HfO2-x/Mo is a promising configuration for resistive switching device research and neuromorphic applications.</description>

      <title>Optical Coherence Elastography Measures Mechanical Tension in the Lens and Capsule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lens tension is essential for accommodative vision but remains difficult to measure with precision. Here, we present an optical coherence elastography (OCE) technique that quantifies both tension and elastic modulus in the lens capsule and underlying tissue. This method derives mechanical parameters from surface wave dispersion across a critical frequency range of 1-30 kHz. Using isolated lenses from six-month-old pigs, we measured intrinsic anterior capsular tensions of 0-20 kPa and posterior capsular tensions of 40-50 kPa, induced by intra-lenticular pressure at the cortical surface. The mean shear moduli of anterior and posterior capsules were 630 kPa and 400 kPa, respectively, nearly 100-fold greater than that of the cortical tissues, where tensions were below 1 kPa. Biaxial zonular stretching (~4% strain) increased anterior capsular tension by 67 kPa, with a low uncertainty of only 2 kPa. This optical method holds significant promise for diagnosing and managing accommodative dysfunctions through lens mechanics assessment in clinical settings.</description>

Abstract: Visualization of internal deformation fields in crystalline materials helps bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical applications. Applying Bragg coherent diffraction imaging under X-ray dynamical diffraction conditions provides a promising approach to the longstanding challenge of investigating the deformation fields in micron-sized crystals. Here, we present an automatic differentiation-based reconstruction method that integrates dynamical scattering theory to accurately reconstruct deformation fields in large crystals. Using this forward model, our simulated and experimental results demonstrate that three-dimensional local strain information inside a large crystal can be accurately reconstructed under coherent X-ray dynamical diffraction conditions with Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging. These findings open an avenue for extending the investigation of local deformation fields to microscale crystals while maintaining nanoscale resolution, leveraging the enhanced coherence and brightness of advanced X-ray sources.</description>

Abstract: Imaging and hyperspectral data analysis is central to progress across biology, medicine, chemistry, and physics. The core challenge lies in converting high-resolution or high-dimensional datasets into interpretable representations that enable insight into the underlying physical or chemical properties of a system. Traditional analysis relies on expert-designed, multistep workflows, such as denoising, feature extraction, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and physics-based deconvolution, or on machine learning (ML) methods that accelerate individual steps. Both approaches, however, typically demand significant human intervention, including hyperparameter tuning and data labeling. Achieving the next level of autonomy in scientific imaging requires designing effective reward-based workflows that guide algorithms toward best data representation for human or automated decision-making. Here, we discuss recent advances in reward-based workflows for image analysis, which capture key elements of human reasoning and exhibit strong transferability across various tasks. We highlight how reward-driven approaches enable a shift from supervised black-box models toward explainable, unsupervised optimization on the examples of Scanning Probe and Electron Microscopies. Such reward-based frameworks are promising for a broad range of applications, including classification, regression, structure-property mapping, and general hyperspectral data processing.</description>

      <title>All-electrically controlled spintronics in altermagnetic heterostructures</title>

Abstract: The recent discovery of altermagnets, which exhibit spin splitting without net magnetization, opens new directions for spintronics beyond the limits of ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and spin orbit coupled systems. We investigate spin selective quantum transport in heterostructures composed of a normal metal and a two dimensional d-wave altermagnet, and identify a universal mechanism for achieving perfect spin polarization. The mechanism is dictated by Fermi surface geometry: closed Fermi surfaces in weak altermagnets yield partial and oscillatory spin filtering, whereas open Fermi surfaces in strong altermagnets intrinsically enforce fully spin polarized conductance. Exploiting these distinct transport regimes, we propose all electrical spin filter and spin valve architectures, where resonant tunneling produces highly spin polarized conductance tunable by gate voltage and interface transparency. Altermagnets with open Fermi surfaces further support gate reversible perfect spin polarization that remains robust against interface scattering, disorder, and temperature. We also demonstrate an electrically controlled spin valve that reproduces the functionality of magnetic tunnel junctions without magnetic fields or relativistic mechanisms. d-wave altermagnets with open Fermi surfaces thus provide a promising platform for low dissipation, scalable, and magnetic field free spintronic devices with potential for integration into next generation quantum and CMOS compatible technologies.</description>

Abstract: An RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of an RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing textbook model \cite{ZhigarevBook, Gevorgian2015}, interpret them and provide understanding of them. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: Nanopores (NPs) grown by anodizing can be partially hidden beneath a relatively compact surface oxide layer, which limits the volumetric surface area of these nanostructures. In this work, nitinol (NiTi) alloy was anodized in an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol, water, and sodium chloride in static and stirred electrolyte stages with the aim of removing the irregular surface array while achieving a thick NP layer. Electron micrographs showed that anodization in the static electrolyte provides a controlled thickness of NP layers covered by an irregular surface layer. In contrast, anodizing in the stirred electrolyte reduced the thickness and the degree of irregularity, which were controlled by the different kinetics of dissolution at the tops, perimeters and bottoms of NPs. To benefit simultaneously from the thickness and regularity of the oxide layers, two-stage anodizing under static and then stirred electrolyte conditions was found to be effective. Following a 30 min anodization in the static electrolyte, anodizing for 30 min under the stirred conditions provided the highest regularity in the oxide array, resulting in NPs of almost 40 nm and 11 {\mu}m in diameter and layer thickness, respectively. Two-stage anodizing under static then stirred electrolyte conditions is proposed in order to promote NP structures for applications demanding higher surface areas.</description>
