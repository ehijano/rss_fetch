Abstract: Monitored quantum circuits in which entangling unitary dynamics compete with projective local measurements can host measurement-induced phase transitions witnessed by entanglement measures at late times. Adding feedback conditioned on the measurement outcomes gives rise to another type of phase transition witnessed by local order parameters and correlation functions. These transitions, known as control or absorbing-state transitions, generically occur within the area-law entanglement phase and are thought to be governed by classical physics in that their critical exponents match those of the classical limit of the model. In this work, we examine quantum features of these transitions, focusing on a Bernoulli circuit model with a well-defined classical limit. First we demonstrate that, in the local basis defined by the absorbing state, the steady-state quantum coherence undergoes a phase transition at the control transition, where its logarithm changes discontinuously from volume- to area-law scaling. Second, we analyze the control transition from the perspective of fluctuations in observables, which carry two contributions: classical fluctuations over circuit realizations (present in the classical limit), and quantum fluctuations over trajectories and states (both absent in the classical limit). Both contributions can be estimated in experiments without post-selection. The circuit-to-circuit fluctuations, the dominant contribution, carry the critical behavior of the classical limit. However, the subleading quantum fluctuations that represent fluctuations between different quantum "worlds" also go critical at the control transition. These critical quantum fluctuations at the control transition also occur in other models, and we discuss how they can be measured experimentally without post-selection.</description>
