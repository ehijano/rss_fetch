      <title>Fock-space relativistic coupled-cluster calculations of clock transition properties in Pb$^{2+}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have employed an all-particle Fock-space relativistic coupled-cluster theory to probe $6s^2{\;^1}S_{0} - 6s6p{\;^3P^o_{0}}$ clock transition in an even isotope of Pb$^{2+}$. We have computed the excitation energies for several low lying states, E1 and M1 transition amplitudes, and the lifetime of the clock state. Moreover, we have also calculated the electric dipole polarizability of the ground state using perturbed relativistic coupled-cluster theory. To improve the accuracy of results, we incorporated the corrections from the relativistic and QED effects in all our calculations. Contributions from the triple excitations are accounted perturbatively. Our computed excitation energies are in excellent agreement with the experimental values for all states. Our computed lifetime, $10.45\times10^{6}$ s, of clock state is $\approx$ 16\% larger than the previously reported value using CI+MBPT [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 127}, 013201 (2021)]. Based on our analysis, we find that the contributions from the {\em valence-valence} electron correlations from higher energy configurations and the corrections from the perturbative triples and QED effects are essential to get accurate clock properties in Pb$^{2+}$. Our computed value of dipole polarizability is in good agreement with the available theory and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Directional superradiance in a driven ultracold atomic gas in free-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-cold atomic systems are among the most promising platforms that have the potential to shed light on the complex behavior of many-body quantum systems. One prominent example is the case of a dense ensemble illuminated by a strong coherent drive while interacting via dipole-dipole interactions. Despite being subjected to intense investigations, this system retains many open questions. A recent experiment carried out in a pencil-shaped geometry reported measurements that seemed consistent with the emergence of strong collective effects in the form of a ``superradiant'' phase transition in free space, when looking at the light emission properties in the forward direction. Motivated by the experimental observations, we carry out a systematic theoretical analysis of the system's steady-state properties as a function of the driving strength and atom number, $N$. We observe signatures of collective effects in the weak drive regime, which disappear with increasing drive strength as the system evolves into a single-particle-like mixed state comprised of randomly aligned dipoles. Although the steady-state features some similarities to the reported superradiant to normal non-equilibrium transition, also known as cooperative resonance fluorescence, we observe significant qualitative and quantitative differences, including a different scaling of the critical drive parameter (from $N$ to $\sqrt{N}$). We validate the applicability of a mean-field treatment to capture the steady-state dynamics under currently accessible conditions. Furthermore, we develop a simple theoretical model that explains the scaling properties by accounting for interaction-induced inhomogeneous effects and spontaneous emission, which are intrinsic features of interacting disordered arrays in free space.</description>

      <title>Fast real-time arbitrary waveform generation using graphic processing units</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time Arbitrary Waveform Generation (AWG) is essential in various engineering and research applications, and often requires complex bespoke hardware and software. This paper introduces an AWG framework using an NVIDIA Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and a commercially available high-speed Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) card, both running on a desktop personal computer (PC). The GPU accelerates the "embarrassingly" data parallel additive waveform synthesis framework for AWG, and the DAC reconstructs the generated waveform in the analog domain at high speed. The AWG framework is programmed using the developer-friendly Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) runtime application programming interface from NVIDIA and is readily customizable, and scalable with additional parallel hardware. We present and characterize two different pathways for computing modulated radio-frequency (rf) waveforms: one pathway offers high-complexity simultaneous chirping of 1000 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones for 35 ms at a sampling rate of 560 MB/s, and the other pathway allows simultaneous continuous chirping of 194 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at 100 MB/s, or 20 individual tones at 560 MB/s. This AWG framework is designed for fast on-the-fly rearrangement of a large stochastically-loaded optical tweezer array of single atoms or molecules into a defect-free array needed for quantum simulation and quantum computation applications.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle in garland-like MIL-101(Fe)/MoS2 nanosheets to promote peroxymonosulfate activation for sulfamethoxazole degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iron-based molybdenum disulfide (Fe-MoS2) has emerged as a Fenton-like catalyst for the highly efficient degradation of antibiotics, but the structure-activity relationship remains elusive. Herein, garland-like MIL-101(Fe)/MoS2 nanosheets (MMS) with dual metal active sites (Fe and Mo) and rich sulfur vacancies were fabricated to directly activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for fast degradation of different organic pollutants (phenols, dyes and drugs), even in real water bodies. The MMS exhibited extremely fast catalytic rate constant of 0.289 min-1 in the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), which was about 36 and 29 times that of single MoS2 (0.008 min-1) and MIL-101(Fe) (0.01 min-1). Moreover, MMS with good stability and reusability could reach 92% degradation of SMX after 5 cycles. Quenching experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR) tests revealed that hydroxyl radicals (.OH) and singlet oxygen (1O2) were the dominant reactive oxygen species (ROS) for SMX degradation. The integration of experimental works, characterization techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations unraveled that the formation of sulfur vacancies in MMS catalyst could expose more Mo sites, improve the charge density and boost the electron transfer, which was conducive to accelerating the Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle for enhancing the activation of PMS. Finally, the C-N, N-O, S-N, C-O and C-S bonds of SMX were easily attacked by ROS to generate the nontoxic intermediates in the MMS/PMS/SMX system. This study offers a new approach to designing high-performance Fe-MoS2 catalysts for the removal of organic pollutants.</description>

      <title>Parity-sensitive inhomogeneous dephasing of macroscopic spin ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin ensembles play a pivotal role in various quantum applications such as metrology and simulating many-body physics. Recent research has proposed utilizing spin cat states to encode logical quantum information, with potentially logical lifetimes on the order of seconds via enhanced collective interactions that scale with system size. We investigate the dynamics of spin cat states under inhomogeneous broadening, revealing a phenomenon termed `parity-sensitive inhomogeneous dephasing': odd cat states are significantly more susceptible to inhomogeneous dephasing compared to even cat states due to parity symmetry. Additionally, from a mean-field analysis of the driven-dissipative dynamics, we identify a synchronization phase transition wherein the ensemble becomes completely dephased beyond a critical inhomogeneous linewidth. Our findings shed light on the stability of collective spin states, important for advancing quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>CHIANTI -- an atomic database for emission lines -- Paper XVIII. Version 11, advanced ionization equilibrium models: density and charge transfer effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Version 11 of the CHIANTI database and software package is presented. Advanced ionization equilibrium models have been added for low charge states of seven elements (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si and S), and represent a significant improvement especially when modelling the solar transition region. The models include the effects of higher electron density and charge transfer on ionization and recombination rates. As an illustration of the difference these models make, a synthetic spectrum is calculated for an electron pressure of 7$\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ K and compared with an active region observation from HRTS. Increases are seen of factors of two to five in the predicted radiances of the strongest lines in the UV from Si IV, C IV, and N V, compared to the previous modelling using the coronal approximation. Much better agreement (within 20\%) with the observation is found for the majority of the lines. The new atomic models better equip both those who are studying the transition region and those who are interpreting emission from higher density astrophysical and laboratory plasma. In addition to the advanced models, several ion datasets have been added or updated, and data for the radiative recombination energy loss rate have been updated.</description>

Abstract: We report on the observation of the $4f^{14}6s^{2}~^1S_0- 4f^{13}5d6s^{2}(J=2)$ transition at 431 nm in $^{171}$Yb by depleting atoms in a magneto-optical trap formed by the $6s^{2}~^1S_0-6s6p~^3P_1$ intercombination transition. The absolute frequency of the transition to the $F=3/2$ state is determined to be $695~171~054~858.1(8.2)$~kHz against physical realization of Coordinated Universal Time maintained by the National Metrology Institute of Japan with a frequency comb. The $g$ factor of the transition to the $F=3/2$ state and the A hyperfine constant are measured to be $g_J=1.54(13)$ and 1123.354(13)~MHz, respectively. More precise spectroscopy of this transition can lead to searches for time variation of the fine structure constant and searches for new physics with isotope shift measurements.</description>

      <title>Geophysical survey based on Hybrid Gravimetry using Relative Measurements and an Atomic Gravimeter as an Absolute Reference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravimetry is a versatile metrological approach in geophysics to accurately map subterranean mass and density anomalies. There is a broad diversification regarding the working principle of gravimeters, wherein atomic gravimeters are one of the most technologically progressive class of gravimeters which can monitor gravity at an absolute scale with a high-repetition without exhibiting drift. Despite the apparent utility for geophysical surveys, atomic gravimeters are (currently) laboratory-bound devices due to the vexatious task of transportation. Here, we demonstrated the utility of an atomic gravimeter on-site during a gravity survey, where the issue of immobility was circumvented with a relative spring gravimeter. The atomic gravimeter served as a means to map the relative data from the spring gravimeter to an absolute measurement with an effective precision of 7.7$\mu$Gal. Absolute measurements provide a robust and feasible method to define and control gravity data taken at different sites, or a later date, which is critical to analyze underground geological units, in particular when it is combined with other geophysical approaches.</description>

      <title>Topology and entanglement of molecular phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a quantum phase space for molecular rotational and nuclear-spin states. Taking in molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, our framework yields admissible position and momentum states, inter-convertible via a generalized Fourier transform. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We identify two features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, many molecular species are intrinsically rotation-spin entangled in a way that cannot be broken without transitioning to another species or breaking symmetry. Second, each molecular position state houses an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed.</description>
