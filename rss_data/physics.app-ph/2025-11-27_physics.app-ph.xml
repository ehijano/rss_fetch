      <title>Thickness-Dependent Charge-Carrier Mobility in Home-Grown High-Purity Germanium Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how charge-carrier mobility evolves as high-purity germanium (HPGe) is thinned from bulk to micrometer scale is essential for optimizing advanced radiation detectors, thin-body Ge electronics, and emerging quantum devices. We report, to our knowledge, the first systematic thickness-dependent mobility study on bulk-grown, detector-grade HPGe, performing Hall-effect measurements on $n$- and $p$-type samples thinned from $2.7~\mathrm{mm}$ down to $7~\mathrm{\mu m}$ at room temperature. The mobility follows an extended-exponential dependence $\mu(t) = \mu_0 \left[ 1 - \exp\big( - (t/\tau)^{\beta} \big) \right]$ with characteristic electrostatic lengths $\tau = 6$--$50~\mathrm{\mu m}$. Comparison with boundary-scattering and depletion-based models shows that mobility degradation is dominated not by Fuchs--Sondheimer surface scattering but by electrostatic depletion that reduces the effective conducting channel thickness. Across all samples, the hierarchy $\lambda_D &lt; \tau \lesssim W_0$ identifies long-range screening and near-surface electric fields as the primary mechanisms governing the mobility crossover. This connection provides a simple device-level design rule: maintaining $t \gtrsim 3\tau$ preserves most of the bulk mobility, while thinner devices enter a depletion-controlled regime with sharply reduced transport. The extracted parameters thus supply quantitative benchmarks for mobility engineering in ultrathin HPGe and a predictive framework for Ge-on-insulator structures, fully depleted channels, and future Ge-based quantum and electronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Electrically Pumped Terahertz Frequency Comb Based on Actively Mode-locked Resonant Tunneling Diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) frequency combs (TFCs) are promising for numerous applications in spectroscopy, metrology, sensing, and wireless communications. However, the practical applications of TFCs have been hindered thus far by the need for cryogenic cooling, limited bandwidth, and bulky configuration, largely due to the lack of advanced THz sources. Here, we report an electrically pumped, room-temperature, broadband, compact, and tunable TFC by integrating an actively mode-locked resonant tunneling diode (RTD) in a metallic waveguide. By injecting a strong, continuous-wave radio frequency (RF) signal into a direct-current-driven RTD oscillator, we experimentally demonstrate a broadband, offset-free comb spectrum spanning more than one octave, from 0.14 to 0.325 THz at room temperature. Moreover, we show that the repetition frequency of the TFC can be tuned from 0.9 to 50 GHz by the injected RF signal, and a 120 Gbps (16 Gbps per channel) data rate can be achieved in the TFC-based high-speed single-channel (multi-channel) wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Half-Vortex Polariton Condensate in a Topological BIC Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling in exciton-polariton condensates governs spinor interactions among quasi-particles and shapes the emergence of topological excitations, such as vortices, solitons, and strings. Conventional approaches to generate and manipulate these excitations rely on external gauge fields and structured light modulation, or microcavity TE-TM polarization splitting. While the former can only access the polariton pseudospin indirectly, through separate coupling of the excitonic or photonic component, the latter suffers from a lack of deterministic control over the resulting topological defects. Here, we report the generation of topology-induced spin polaritons in a monolithic bound state in the continuum (BIC) perovskite metasurface with broken inversion symmetry. Upon condensation, spin-momentum locking enables the generation of a pair of half-vortex within the polariton fluid, which display mutual attraction due to the connecting polarization string linking their opposite spins. We find that an increase in polariton density, enhancing the characteristic blueshift of the emission spectrum, leads to a narrowing of the inter-vortex separation, revealing deterministic interactions pinned to the cavity topology. By harnessing structural control alone, our approach enables robust engineering of the intrinsic pseudospin texture of the polariton fluid, offering a versatile platform for manipulating vortex nucleation, interaction, and annihilation without employing external fields.</description>

      <title>Fly-by transit: A novel door-to-door shared mobility with minimal stops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces fly-by transit (FBT), a novel mobility system that employs modular mini-electric vehicles (mini-EVs) to provide door-to-door shared mobility with minimal stops. Unlike existing modular minibus concepts that rely on in-motion coupling and passenger transfers -- technologies unlikely to mature soon -- FBT lowers the technological barriers by building upon near-term feasible solutions. The system comprises two complementary mini-EV modules: low-cost trailers for on-demand feeder trips and high-performance leaders that guide coupled trailers in high-speed platoons along trunk lines. Trailers operate independently for detour-free feeder services, while stationary coupling at designated hubs enables platoons to achieve economies of scale (EoS). In-motion decoupling of the tail trailer allows stop-less operation without delaying the main convoy.
  As a proof of concept, a stylized corridor model is developed to analyze optimal FBT design. Results indicate that FBT can substantially reduce travel times relative to conventional buses and lower operating costs compared with e-hailing taxis. Numerical analyses further demonstrate that FBT achieves stronger EoS than both buses and taxis, yielding more than 13\% savings in generalized system costs. By addressing key limitations of existing transit systems, this study establishes FBT as a practical and scalable pathway toward transformative urban mobility and outlines directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Transportation of Deformable Axisymmetric Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A particle on a substrate supporting a surface acoustic wave can experience horizontal drift excited by the dry friction force. The effect is referred to as vibrational transportation, or as a surface acoustic wave motor. A traditional theory of vibrational transportation considers a particle as a material point moving on a rigid substrate. A more realistic representation is a contact model based on Cattaneo-Mindlin (also called Hertz-Mindlin) mechanics applicable to an axisymmetric deformable particle. A recent semi-analytical extension of the Cattaneo-Mindlin solution called the Method of Memory Diagrams allows one to compute the hysteretic friction force for an arbitrary loading history in terms of contact displacements, and, subsequently, to numerically solve the equations of motion. Depending on the materials' and excitation parameters, the particle can stay in permanent contact with the substrate or experience multiple jumps. In the former case, the particle can slide along the surface, during each wave period, advancing and receding with different efficiencies, which finally results in a drift. The drift can occur both in the wave propagation direction and against it. In the regime of multiple jumps, directed horizontal motion is also possible. It is based on synchronization between the wave period and rebounding events. A rebound occurs once per period and consistently at the same phase. At the beginning of the process, the particle moves with an acceleration that decreases and finally disappears. Exactly the same type of motion against the wave has been observed in our preliminary experiments. We demonstrate that a point mass behaves differently: in a regime of permanent contact, negative and positive sliding are equilibrated, which produces no drift, whereas multiple rebounds of a point mass are always chaotic, at least for fully conservative collisions.</description>

      <title>Thermomechanical model of solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers a model for the solar cell as a mechanical open-cycle thermodynamic engine where the chemical potential is produced in an isochoric process corresponding to the thermalization of electron-hole pairs. Expansion of the beam under one-sun illumination and current generation are described as isothermal lost work. More generally, voltage produced in an open cycle process corresponds to availability, leading to a correction to the Shockley-Queisser detailed balance limit.</description>

      <title>Tungsten Germanide Single-Photon Detectors with Saturated Internal Detection Efficiency at Wavelengths up to 29 {\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are among the most sensitive single-photon detectors available and have the potential to transform fields ranging from infrared astrophysics to molecular spectroscopy. However, extending their performance into the mid-infrared spectral region - crucial for applications such as exoplanet transit spectroscopy and vibrational fingerprinting of molecules - has remained a major challenge, primarily due to material limitations and scalability constraints. Here, we report on the development of SNSPDs based on tungsten germanide, a novel material system that combines high infrared sensitivity with compatibility for large-scale fabrication. Our detectors exhibit saturated internal detection efficiency at wavelengths up to 29 $\mathrm{\mu m}$. This advance enables scalable, high-performance single-photon detection in a spectral region that was previously inaccessible, opening new frontiers in remote sensing, thermal imaging, environmental monitoring, molecular physics, and astronomy.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Effective Segregation Coefficient in High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) Crystals for Ge Detector Development in Rare-Event Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance and scalability of rare-event physics experiments depend on large-volume, detector-grade high-purity germanium (HPGe) crystals with precise control of impurity segregation during growth. We report a detailed study of impurity distribution in a single Czochralski-grown HPGe crystal produced at University of South Dakota (USD). The crystal was sectioned longitudinally into 37 segments, enabling the first high-resolution and systematic mapping of dopant profiles along the length of a detector-grade HPGe boule. Hall-effect measurements were used to extract impurity concentrations for boron (B), aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), and phosphorus (P) in each segment. From these data, we determine effective segregation coefficients ($K_{eff}$) and initial melt concentrations ($C_0$) for the dominant dopants and compare them with classical Burton-Prim-Slichter expectations. The results provide quantitative insight into impurity transport and melt-solid partitioning under realistic detector growth conditions. These findings inform process-optimization strategies for HPGe crystal pulling, improve impurity control along the boule, and support the reliable fabrication of large, low-background HPGe detectors for next-generation rare-event searches.</description>

      <title>Cr2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 Heterojunction Diodes with Orientation-Dependent Breakdown Electric Field up to 12.9 MV/cm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the fabrication of Cr2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterojunction diodes using reactive magnetron sputtering of Cr2O3 on highly doped \b{eta}-Ga2O3 bulk substrates along (100), (010), (001), (110), and (011) orientation dependence of high electric field handling capability in \b{eta}-Ga2O3. Additional relative permittivity values in (110) and (011) orientations of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 were computed by using first-principles calculation methods for accurate apparent charge density (ND-NA) extraction and breakdown electric field analysis from capacitance-voltage measurements. The HJDs fabricated on n+ (110) exhibited breakdown electric fields &gt;10 MV/cm up to 12.9 MV/cm, showing the highest experimentally observed parallel-plane junction electric field among \b{eta}-Ga2O3-based junctions. Breakdown electric fields among (100), (010), (001), and (011) orientations showed distinct distribution in the range of 5.13-5.26 MV/cm, 5.10-7.05 MV/cm, 2.70-3.33 MV/cm, and 3.88-4.38 MV/cm, respectively, validating the orientational dependence of parallel-plane junction electric field at breakdown in low-symmetry monoclinic \b{eta}-Ga2O3. The parallel-plane breakdown electric fields (EBr,||) reported in this work were extracted when the device experienced catastrophic breakdown at 100 mA/cm^2 current density compliance, and should not be confused with critical electric field (Ec) as a function of drift layer doping concentration, which accounts for electric-field dependent impact ionization coefficients in Si, SiC and GaN. This study can guide the choice of crystal orientation for high performance gallium oxide-based devices that require high electric field handling capability.</description>

      <title>A universal framework for nonlinear frequency combs under electro-optic modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear frequency combs, including electro-optic and Kerr combs, have become central platforms for chip-scale frequency synthesis. Recent breakthroughs in strong-coupling electro-optic modulation further expanded their accessible nonlinear dynamics, unlocking new phenomena and functionalities, but the underlying foundation remains largely unexplored. Here we establish a universal theoretical and experimental framework for nonlinear combs under arbitrary electro-optic modulation by introducing a general evolution equation (GEE) that transcends the mean-field Lugiato-Lefever equation. The GEE reduces to a discrete-time Integration Hamiltonian that provides a frequency-domain formalism unifying strong-coupling electro-optic modulation with photonic synthetic dimensions. Together with a band-wave correspondence linking modulation waveforms to synthetic band structures, the formalism enables programmable spectral control. We further show compatibility between Kerr nonlinearity and strong-coupling electro-optic modulation, highlighting their cooperative dynamics. Our work provides a foundational model for strong-coupling electro-optics in nonlinear combs, opening a route toward chip-integrated, microwave-programmable comb sources for metrology, spectroscopy, and emerging photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Low-dose Chemically Specific Bioimaging via Deep-UV Lensless Holographic Microscopy on a Standard Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep-ultraviolet (DUV) microscopy can provide label-free biochemical contrast by exploiting the intrinsic absorption of nucleic acids, proteins and lipids, offering chemically specific morphological information that complements structural optical thickness contrast from phase-sensitive imaging. However, existing DUV microscopes typically rely on specialized optics and DUV-sensitive cameras, which restrict field of view, increase system complexity and cost, and often require high illumination doses that risk photodamage. Here, we report a low-dose deep-UV lensless holographic microscopy platform that uses standard board-level CMOS sensors designed for visible light, eliminating all imaging optics and dedicated DUV detectors. Our system achieves large field-of-view (up to 116 mm2) DUV imaging with low illumination and label-free phase and chemically specific amplitude contrast. A specialized defocus/wavelength diverse pixel super-resolution reconstruction with total-variation regularization and robust autofocusing halves the effective sensor pixel pitch and yields down to 870 nm lateral resolution. We demonstrate chemically specific, label-free bioimaging on challenging specimens, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, extracellular vesicles and unstained mouse liver tissue. In liver sections, imaging at {\lambda} = 330 nm reveals lipid- and retinoid-rich accumulations that co-localize with Oil Red O staining, enabling label-free identification of hepatic stellate (Ito) cells. This combination of low-dose operation, chemically specific contrast and standard CMOS hardware establishes DUV lensless holographic microscopy as a practical and scalable route to high-content submicron-resolution whole-slide preparation-free bioimaging without exogenous labels.</description>

      <title>Acoustic neural networks: Identifying design principles and exploring physical feasibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave-guide-based physical systems provide a promising route toward energy-efficient analog computing beyond traditional electronics. Within this landscape, acoustic neural networks represent a promising approach for achieving low-power computation in environments where electronics are inefficient or limited, yet their systematic design has remained largely unexplored. Here we introduce a framework for designing and simulating acoustic neural networks, which perform computation through the propagation of sound waves. Using a digital-twin approach, we train conventional neural network architectures under physically motivated constraints including non-negative signals and weights, the absence of bias terms, and nonlinearities compatible with intensity-based, non-negative acoustic signals. Our work provides a general framework for acoustic neural networks that connects learnable network components directly to physically measurable acoustic properties, enabling the systematic design of realizable acoustic computing systems. We demonstrate that constrained recurrent and hierarchical architectures can perform accurate speech classification, and we propose the SincHSRNN, a hybrid model that combines learnable acoustic bandpass filters with hierarchical temporal processing. The SincHSRNN achieves up to 95% accuracy on the AudioMNIST dataset while remaining compatible with passive acoustic components. Beyond computational performance, the learned parameters correspond to measurable material and geometric properties such as attenuation and transmission. Our results establish general design principles for physically realizable acoustic neural networks and outline a pathway toward low-power, wave-based neural computing.</description>

Abstract: Diamonds offer unique benefits for optical technology development due to their optical, chemical, electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties. These attributes also contribute to their aesthetic appeal, high commercial value, and utility in geological studies. Thus, there is high demand for nondestructive techniques that enable rapid analysis of natural and synthetic diamonds as well as diamond-like simulants. Here, we demonstrate sub-micrometer, nondestructive, three-dimensional imaging and spectral analysis of diamonds using multiphoton microscopy (MPM). This approach stimulates nonlinear optical emissions to provide unique insights into the interior structure, fluorescent defects, and formational conditions of diamonds. As a result, MPM can be used to investigate gemstone quality, vacancy centers used in quantum technologies, and the various inclusions and fluorescent emitters that may trace gemstone provenance and treatment history.</description>

      <title>Optical characterization of deep level defects in n-type Al$_x$In$_y$Ga$_{1-x-y}$P for development of solid-state photomultiplier analogs</title>

Abstract: Characterizing intrinsic defects is an important step in evaluating materials for new optoelectronic device applications. For photomultipliers, suppressing dark currents is critical, but there exists a tradeoff between maximizing the band gap while remaining sensitive to the wavelength of interest, and minimizing the incorporation of new defects by growing not-yet-optimized alloys. We present a series of capacitance-based measurements, including deep level optical spectroscopy, steady-state photocapacitance and illuminated capacitance-voltage, on photodiodes with lightly \textit{n}-type Al$_x$In$_y$Ga$_{1-x-y}$P absorber regions. Several deep levels are identified, including one near midgap. While the inclusion of aluminum increases each trap density by approximately 10x, the hole capture cross section also appears to decrease, suggesting that Shockley-Read-Hall dark currents may be suppressed. These materials may be good candidates for development into silicon photomultiplier analogs with wider bandgap for scintillator applications.</description>

      <title>Thermal Endurance of Suspended Thin-Film Lithium Niobate up to 800 {\deg}C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13568</link>

Abstract: The need for high-temperature piezoelectric microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) requires pushing piezoelectric platforms to their thermal limits. In harsh thermal environments, piezoelectric MEMS devices are expected to sustain severe damage because of material degradation and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatches between the functional layers and the carrier wafer. This paper investigates the thermal endurance of the suspended thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platform by observing the structural integrity and performance of acoustic Lamb wave resonators after annealing rounds at increasing temperatures, with a focus on temperatures between 550 $^\circ$C and 800 $^\circ$C, with 50 $^\circ$C temperature increments. Fundamental symmetric (S0) mode acoustic resonators are fabricated on 600 nm stoichiometric LN (sLN) with 40 nm thick platinum top electrodes and a thin titanium adhesion layer. After each annealing round, changes in the devices' resonant frequency and quality factor (\emph{Q}) are quantitatively studied. The devices and material stack are further analyzed with resistivity structures, optical microscope images, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The results provide valuable insights into the design and material selection necessary to optimize the suspended thin-film LN platform for high temperatures. Understanding the thermal limit of the platform enables its use for sensors, actuators, resonators, and potentially other thin-film LN microsystems, e.g, photonics, electro-optical, and acousto-optical systems in harsh thermal environments.</description>

      <title>Improved composable key rates for CV-QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10270v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) must take finite-size effects and composable aspects into consideration. This is also the case for continuous-variable (CV) protocols which are based on the transmission and detection of bosonic coherent states. In this paper, we refine and advance the previous theory in this area providing a more rigorous formulation for the composable key rate of a generic CV-QKD protocol. Thanks to these theoretical refinements, our general formulas allow us to prove more optimistic key rates with respect to previous literature.</description>

      <title>Perfectly Matched Metamaterials</title>

Abstract: Fully harnessing the vast design space enabled by metamaterials to control electromagnetic (EM) fields remains an open problem for researchers. Inverse-design techniques have shown to best exploit the degrees of freedom available in design, resulting in high-performing systems for wireless communications, sensing and analog signal processing. Nonetheless, fundamental yet powerful properties of metamaterials are still to be revealed. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Perfectly Matched Metamaterials (PMMs). PMMs are passive, inhomogeneous media that perform purely refractive field transformations under different excitations. Their advantage lies in their simplicity, reflectionless behavior and suitability for both analytical and numerical design methods. Unlike Transformation Optics, PMM-based designs are devoid of coordinate transformations. Anisotropic unit cells are configured to control EM fields in a true-time delay manner. Simple analytical designs are reported which demonstrate the broadband capability of PMM devices. Proposed PMMs may find application in wideband beamforming and analog computing, realizing functionalities such as spatial filtering and signal pre-processing.</description>
