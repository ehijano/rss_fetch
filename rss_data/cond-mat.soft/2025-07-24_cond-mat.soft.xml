      <title>Hydrodynamic Theory of Two-dimensional Chiral Malthusian Flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic behavior of two-dimensional chiral dry Malthusian flocks; that is, chiral polar-ordered active matter with neither number nor momentum conservation. We show that, in the absence of fluctuations, such systems generically form a ``time cholesteric", in which the velocity of the entire system rotates uniformly at a fixed frequency b. Fluctuations about this state belong to the universality class of (2+1)-Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, which implies short-ranged orientational order in the hydrodynamic limit. We then show that, in the limit of weak chirality, the hydrodynamics of a system with reasonable size is expected to governed by the linear regime of the KPZ equation, exhibiting quasi-long-ranged orientational order. Our predictions for the velocity and number density correlations are testable in both simulations and experiments.</description>

      <title>Differential Crosslinking and Contractile Motors Drive Nuclear Chromatin Compaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During interphase, a typical cell nucleus features spatial compartmentalization of transcriptionally active euchromatin and repressed heterochromatin domains. In conventional nuclear organization, euchromatin predominantly occupies the nuclear interior, while heterochromatin, which is approximately 50% more dense than euchromatin, is positioned near the nuclear periphery. Peripheral chromatin organization can be further modulated by the nuclear lamina, which is itself a deformable structure. While a number of biophysical mechanisms for compartmentalization within rigid nuclei have been explored, we study a chromatin model consisting of an active, crosslinked polymer tethered to a deformable, polymeric lamina shell. Contractile motors, the deformability of the shell, and the spatial distribution of crosslinks all play pivotal roles in this compartmentalization. We find that a radial crosslink density distribution, even with a small linear differential of higher crosslinking density at the edge of the nucleus, combined with contractile motor activity, drives genomic segregation, in agreement with experimental observations. This arises from contractile motors preferentially drawing crosslinks into their vicinity at the nuclear periphery, forming high-density domains that promote heterochromatin formation. We also find an increased stiffness of nuclear wrinkles given the preferential heterochromatin compaction below the lamina shell, which is consistent with instantaneous nuclear stiffening under applied nanoindentation. We conclude with the potential for experimental validation of our model predictions.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Surfactant Synergies for Fluorine Replacements: A Microfluidic Exploration of Emulsion Stability and Coalescence Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorinated surfactants are widely utilized in various applications, including firefighting foams, coatings, and lubricants. Their wide utility is due to their unique properties, such as their ability to effectively lower surface/interfacial tension. However, the excessive use of fluorinated surfactants has raised environmental and health concerns due to their persistence in the environment and potential toxicity. The need for effective and sustainable surfactant replacements has therefore become critical. Our study investigates alternative surfactants mixtures that have been proposed to replicate the performance of traditional fluorinated surfactants, while minimizing environmental impact. Here, we study the stability of thin aqueous liquid bridges found in water in oil emulsions, with surfactant mixtures shown to provide synergistic fire suppression in fluorine-free fire fighting foams. Binary surfactant-water solutions of TritonX-100, Glucopon 215, Dow 502W were used, in addition to a ternary surfactant-surfactant-water mixtures of Glucopon 215 and Dow502W. Emulsion stability is assessed using a microfluidic device designed to measure the coalescence frequency. Coalescence frequency is measured as a function of total flow rate and surfactant concentration. A non-monotonic trend of coalescence frequency with flow rate is found for all the surfactants used. In addition, a non-dimensional frequency is introduced and is found to decrease with the Capillary number. The coalescence frequency of the surfactant mixture is found to be close to that of Dow502W, suggesting a synergistic behavior between Glucopon215 and Dow502W, even with less of the siloxane surfactant present in the formulation. This behavior highlights the potential for pairing slower hydrocarbon surfactants with faster siloxane surfactants to achieve an effective alternative stabilizing agent for fluorine free formulation.</description>

      <title>Surface Material Dependence in Powder Triboelectric Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triboelectric charging of granular materials against container walls is a critical yet poorly understood phenomenon affecting many industrial powder handling processes. Charge accumulation can cause material flow disruptions, adhesion issues, and pose serious safety risks, such as providing ignition sources for dust cloud explosions. This study investigates particle-wall charging behaviour for materials with varying size, shape, and electrical resistivity. Aluminium surfaces are used as a reference case, followed by analysis of labradorite, an analogue for volcanic ash, to examine charging interactions with various wall materials. Finally, the triboelectric response of industrially relevant materials used in flexible intermediate bulk containers, including both lined and unlined variants, is assessed. Results show that stainless steel surfaces generate the least charge, while the presence of insulating polyethene liners increases charging significantly. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of triboelectric charging mechanisms in powder transfer operations and inform safer industrial practice.</description>

      <title>Static and dynamic properties of a binary, symmetric mixture of ultrasoft particles in the vicinity of criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the static and the dynamic properties of an binary, equimolar, size-symmetric mixture of ultrasoft particles in the vicinity of the critical point of the system. Based on the generalized exponential potential (GEM) of order four for the particle interaction and using extensive molecular dynamics simulations in the canonical ensemble we investigate the above mentioned properties for various scenarios: we consider several super- and subcritical states, we expose the system to rapid quenches and to external shearing forces. Based on an accurate determination of the phase diagram and of the location of the critical point we study the static structure of the system in terms of particle-based radial distribution functions. As systems of GEM particles are prone to cluster formation we complement these investigations by a detailed analysis of the composition of the clusters and of their spatial correlations for the different scenarios introduced above. Furthermore we analyse the temperature dependence of the diffusivity of the particles and of the shear viscosity of the system. All these data provide a detailed and profound insight into the properties of the system under phase separation conditions and near criticality.</description>

      <title>How Soft is Too Soft? Tuning Order and Disorder in Dimeric Core-Soft Colloids with Bond Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ molecular dynamics simulations to explore how internal flexibility affects phase transitions in soft-matter systems composed of dimers interacting via a core-softened potential with two characteristic length scales. Monomers are connected by harmonic springs with varying stiffness, allowing us to tune the dimer rigidity from highly flexible to nearly rigid. Flexible dimers reproduce the behavior of monomeric systems, displaying well-defined BCC and HCP crystalline phases separated by a narrow amorphous region. As the bond stiffness increases, this amorphous phase gives way to a coexistence region between BCC and HCP structures. In the rigid limit, amorphous regions reemerge and expand, and high-density systems fail to crystallize completely, instead forming mixed phases with HCP-like and disordered local environments. This transition arises from geometric frustration: rigid dimers are unable to adjust their internal configuration to optimize local packing, thereby suppressing crystallization and promoting amorphization. Our findings reveal that bond flexibility is a key control parameter governing structural organization in core-softened colloidal and molecular systems, offering insights for the design of tunable soft materials.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Non-equilibrium Structures of Active Dipolar Particles by an External Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of an external alignment field on the structure formation and polarization behavior of low-density dipolar active particles in three dimensions. Performing extensive Brownian dynamics simulations, we characterize the interplay between long-range dipolar interactions, field alignment, and self-propulsion. We find that the competition between activity (favoring bond breaking) and the field's orientational constraint (promoting bond formation) gives rise to a rich variety of self-assembled, actuated structures. At low to intermediate field strengths, disordered fluids composed of active chains and active percolated networks can emerge, whereas strong fields drive the formation of polarized columnar clusters. Counterintuitively, low activity levels significantly extend the range of field strengths over which percolated networks persist. This structural evolution manifests in the polarization response of strongly dipolar systems, which exhibit a transition from super-Langevin to sub-Langevin behavior with increasing activity, as a result of the coupling between structure formation and activity-induced bond breaking.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Inverse Design of Metasurfaces for Tailored Narrow Band Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inverse design of metasurfaces poses a considerable challenge because of the intricate interdependencies that exist between structural characteristics and electromagnetic responses. Traditional optimization methods require significant computational resources and frequently do not produce the most effective solutions. This study presents a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning approach known as Latent Style-based Quantum GAN (LaSt-QGAN). This method integrates a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) to enhance the optimization of metasurface designs aimed at achieving narrow-band absorption and unidirectionality. The proposed method results in a reduction of training time by one-third and a decrease in data requirements by 30\% when compared to traditional GAN-based approaches. The produced metasurface designs demonstrate a high fidelity of 95\% in relation to the target absorption spectra. Additionally, the integration of a material look-up table facilitates manufacturability by allowing for the substitution of predicted material properties with viable alternatives, all while preserving performance accuracy. Moreover the model is able to generate Q-factor upto the order of $10^4$, while the training dataset has Q-factor upto the order of $10^3$.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design using Physics-Informed Quantum GANs for Tailored Absorption in Dielectric Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High Q-factor narrow-band absorption exhibits high spectral selectivity enabling high-sensitive photodetectors, sensors and thermal emitters. All-dielectric metasurfaces are widely regarded as excellent candidates for giving rise to such narrow-band absorption. However, designing metasurfaces with specific functionalities remains a challenging task both experimentally and computationally, which is why inverse design methods are increasingly being explored. Inverse design process is highly complex due to its non-unique solutions and the higher dimensionality of the design space, making it challenging to precisely control the resonance wavelength, linewidth, and absorption intensity. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid methodology that integrates generative adversarial networks (GANs) (both classical and quantum) with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for the inverse design of narrow-band absorbing metasurfaces. By introducing a Fano-shaped absorption spectrum equation into the PINN loss function, we enforce physical constraints on the resonance behavior, ensuring outputs that are both spectrally accurate and physically consistent. The study presents a comparison between a conventional GAN + PINN framework and a PINN augmented by a hybrid quantum-classical GAN (QGAN). The findings indicate that the integrated PINN + QGAN model achieves faster convergence, requires 99.5\% fewer training samples, and yields an order of magnitude lower MSE compared to conventional GANs. Remarkably, even though the training dataset only contains metasurfaces with Q-factors on the order of $10^3$, the model is able to generate highly asymmetric metasurface structures with Q-factors exceeding $10^5$. This study presents a novel framework that integrates quantum machine learning with physics-based modeling, providing a promising method for quantum-enhanced inverse design in nanophotonic systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal chirality enhances long-range fluctuation-induced interactions in active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding interactions between chiral active particles -- self-propelling and self-rotating entities -- is crucial for uncovering how chiral active matter self-organizes into dynamic structures. Although fluctuation-induced forces in nonequilibrium active systems can drive structure formation, the role of chirality remains largely unexplored. We investigate effective fluctuation-induced forces between intruders immersed in chiral active fluids and reveal that the impact of chirality depends sensitively on particle shape. For circular particles, increasing the self-rotation to self-propulsion ratio suppresses the interaction, reflecting a transition from rotating flocks to localized spinners. Contrarily, a striking collective behavior emerges for rodlike particles: vortices spontaneously form around the intruders, most pronounced at an optimal chiral angle where the mean curvature of particle trajectories matches the intruder boundary curvature, maximizing the effective force. We map the attractive and repulsive force regimes across chirality, propulsion, and intruder separation, offering new insights and principles for designing and controlling self-assembled active systems.</description>

      <title>Form and function in biological filaments: A physicist's review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nature uses elongated shapes and filaments to build stable structures, generate motion, and allow complex geometric interactions. In this Review, we examine the role of biological filaments across different length scales. From the molecular scale, where cytoskeletal filaments provides a robust but dynamic cellular scaffolding, over the scale of cellular appendages like cilia and flagella, to the scale of filamentous microorganisms like cyanobacteria, among the most successful genera on Earth, and even to the scale of elongated animals like worms and snakes, whose motility modes inspire robotic analogues. We highlight the general mechanisms that couple form and function. We discuss physical principles and models, such as classical elasticity and the non-reciprocity of active matter, that can be used to trace unifying themes linking these systems across about nine orders of magnitude in length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study large deformations of hyperelastic membranes using a purely two-dimensional formulation derived from basic balance principles within a modern geometric setting, ensuring a framework that is independent of an underlying three-dimensional formulation. To assess the predictive capabilities of membrane theory, we compare numerical solutions to experimental data from axisymmetric deformations of a silicone rubber film. Five hyperelastic models - Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, Gent, Yeoh, and Ogden - are evaluated by fitting their material parameters to our experimental data using TensorFlow. Our results provide a systematic comparison of these models based on their accuracy in capturing observed deformations, establishing a framework for integrating theory, experiment, and data-based parameter identification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical tweezers are widely used as a highly sensitive tool to measure forces on micron-scale particles. One such application is the measurement of the electric charge of a particle, which can be done with high precision in liquids, air, or vacuum. We experimentally investigate how the trapping laser itself can electrically charge such a particle, in our case a $\sim 1\,\mathrm{\mu m\;SiO_2}$ sphere in air. We model the charging mechanism as a two-photon process which reproduces the experimental data with high fidelity.</description>
