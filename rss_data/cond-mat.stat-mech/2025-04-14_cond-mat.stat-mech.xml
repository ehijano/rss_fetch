      <title>A machine learning approach to fast thermal equilibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to design driving protocols that achieve fast thermal equilibration of a system of interest using techniques inspired by machine learning training algorithms. For example, consider a Brownian particle manipulated by optical tweezers. The force on the particle can be controlled and adjusted over time, resulting in a driving protocol that transitions the particle from an initial state to a final state. Once the driving protocol has been completed, the system requires additional time to relax to thermal equilibrium. Designing driving protocols that bypass the relaxation period is of interest so that, at the end of the protocol, the system is either in thermal equilibrium or very close to it. Several studies have addressed this problem through reverse engineering methods, which involve prescribing a specific evolution for the probability density function of the system and then deducing the corresponding form of the driving protocol potential. Here, we propose a new method that can be applied to more complex systems where reverse engineering is not feasible. We simulate the evolution of a large ensemble of trajectories while tracking the gradients with respect to a parametrization of the driving protocol. The final probability density function is compared to the target equilibrium one. Using machine learning libraries, the gradients are computed via backpropagation and the protocol is iteratively adjusted until the optimal protocol is achieved. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with several examples.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous entanglement structure in monoaxial chiral ferromagnetic quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral magnets, characterized by inhomogeneous magnetic moment arrangements, have attracted significant attention recently due to their topological orders, such as magnetic skyrmion lattices and chiral soliton lattices. In this work, we investigate the entanglement entropy of \textit{quantum} chiral magnets and demonstrate that it reflects the inhomogeneous nature of the ground state. We perform numerical simulations of a one-dimensional monoaxial chiral ferromagnetic chain with Zeeman term using the density matrix renormalization group method. Our results show that the entanglement entropy exhibits oscillatory behavior, which can be tuned by varying the external magnetic field. Analysis of the local magnetization and spin chirality further confirms that these oscillations correspond to solitonic structures. Moreover, our findings suggest that the entanglement entropy can serve as a probe for detecting the vacuum structure, providing new insights into quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Integrator Scheme for Sampling the (Quantum) Isobaric-Isothermal Ensemble in (Path Integral) Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because most chemical or biological experiments are performed under conditions of controlled pressure and temperature, it is important to simulate the isobaric-isothermal ensemble at the atomic level to reveal the microscopic mechanism. By extending our configuration sampling protocol for the canonical ensemble, we propose a unified middle scheme to sample the coordinate (configuration) and volume distribution and thereby are able to accurately simulate either classical or quantum isobaric-isothermal processes. Various barostats and thermostats can be employed in the unified middle scheme for simulating real molecular systems with or without holonomic constraints. In particular, we demonstrate the recommended middle scheme by employing the Martyna-Tuckerman-Tobias-Klein barostat and stochastic cell-rescaling barostat, with the Langevin thermostat, in molecular simulation packages (DL_POLY, Amber, Gromacs, etc.). Benchmark numerical tests show that, without additional numerical effort, the middle scheme is competent in increasing the time interval by a factor of 5~10 to achieve the same accuracy of converged results for most thermodynamic properties in (path integral) molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>A comparative review of recent results on supercritical anomalies in two-dimensional kinetic Ising and Blume-Capel ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the unexpected experimental discovery of ``sideband'' peaks in the fluctuation spectrum of thin Co films driven by a slowly oscillating magnetic field with a constant bias [P.~Riego et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 117202 (2017)] numerical studies of two-state Ising and three-state Blume-Capel (BC) ferromagnets in this dynamically supercritical regime have flourished and been successful in explaining this phenomenon. Here, we give a comparative review of this new literature and its connections to earlier work. Following an introduction and a presentation of the two models and the computational method used in many of these studies, we present numerical results for both models. Particular attention is paid to the fact that zero spins in the BC model tend to collect at he interfaces between regions of the two nonzero spin values, +/-1. We present strong arguments that this phenomenon leads to a reduction of the effective interface tension in the BC model, compared to the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Stationary-state dynamics of interacting phase oscillators in presence of noise and stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of global resetting on Kuramoto-type models of coupled limit-cycle oscillators with distributed frequencies both in absence and presence of noise. The dynamics comprises repeated interruption of the bare dynamics at random times with simultaneous resetting of phases of all the oscillators to a predefined state. To characterize the stationary-state behavior, we develop an analytical framework that spans across different generalizations of the Kuramoto model involving either quenched or annealed disorder or both, and for any choice of the natural frequency distribution. The framework applies to the dynamics both in absence and presence of resetting, and is employed to obtain in particular the stationary-state synchronization order parameter of the system, which is a measure of spontaneous ordering among the oscillator phases. A key finding is unveiling of the role of correlations in shaping the ordering dynamics under resetting.</description>

      <title>Probes of Full Eigenstate Thermalization in Ergodicity-Breaking Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is the leading interpretation in our current understanding of quantum thermalization. Recent results uncovered strong connections between quantum correlations in thermalizing systems and the structure of free probability theory, leading to the notion of full ETH. However, most studies have been performed for ergodic systems and it is still unclear whether or how full ETH manifests in ergodicity-breaking models. We fill this gap by studying standard probes of full ETH in ergodicity-breaking quantum circuits, presenting numerical and analytical results for interacting integrable systems. These probes can display distinct behavior and undergo a different scaling than the ones observed in ergodic systems. For the analytical results we consider an interacting integrable dual-unitary model and present the exact eigenstates, allowing us to analytically express common probes for full ETH. We discuss the underlying mechanisms responsible for these differences and show how the presence of solitons dictates the behavior of ETH-related quantities in the dual-unitary model. We show numerical evidence that this behavior is sufficiently generic away from dual-unitarity when restricted to the appropriate symmetry sectors.</description>

      <title>Symmetries, Conservation Laws and Entanglement in Non-Hermitian Fermionic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems feature steady-state entanglement transitions driven by the competition between unitary dynamics and dissipation. In this work, we reveal the fundamental role of conservation laws in shaping this competition. Focusing on translation-invariant non-interacting fermionic models with U(1) symmetry, we present a theoretical framework to understand the structure of the steady-state of these models and their entanglement content based on two ingredients: the nature of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and the constraints imposed on the steady-state single-particle occupation by the conserved quantities. These emerge from an interplay between Hamiltonian symmetries and initial state, due to the non-linearity of measurement back-action. For models with complex energy spectrum, we show that the steady state is obtained by filling single-particle right eigenstates with the largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue. As a result, one can have partially filled or fully filled bands in the steady-state, leading to an entanglement entropy undergoing a filling-driven transition between critical sub volume scaling and area-law, similar to ground-state problems. Conversely, when the spectrum is fully real, we provide evidence that local observables can be captured using a diagonal ensemble, and the entanglement entropy exhibits a volume-law scaling independently on the initial state, akin to unitary dynamics. We illustrate these principles in the Hatano-Nelson model with periodic boundary conditions and the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, uncovering a rich interplay between the single-particle spectrum and conservation laws in determining the steady-state structure and the entanglement transitions. These conclusions are supported by exact analytical calculations and numerical calculations relying on the Faber polynomial method.</description>

      <title>Exact large-scale correlations in diffusive systems with general interactions: explicit characterisation without the Dean--Kawasaki equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterising the statistical properties of classical interacting particle systems is a long-standing question. For Brownian particles the microscopic density obeys a stochastic evolution equation, known as the Dean--Kawasaki equation. This equation remains mostly formal and linearization (or higher-order expansions) is required to obtain explicit expressions for physical observables, with a range of validity not easily defined. Here, by combining macroscopic fluctuation theory with equilibrium statistical mechanics, we provide a systematic alternative to the Dean--Kawasaki framework to characterize large-scale correlations. This approach enables us to obtain explicit and exact results for dynamical observables such as tracer cumulants and bath-tracer correlations in one dimension, both in and out of equilibrium. In particular, we reveal a generic non-monotonic spatial structure in the response of the bath following a temperature quench. Our approach applies to a broad class of interaction potentials and extends naturally to higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder and noise in physical systems often disrupt spatial and temporal regularity, yet chaotic systems reveal how order can emerge from unpredictable behavior. Complex networks, spatial analogs of chaos, exhibit disordered, non-Euclidean architectures with hidden symmetries, hinting at spontaneous order. Finding low-dimensional embeddings that reveal network patterns and link them to dimensionality that governs universal behavior remains a fundamental open challenge, as it needs to bridge the gap between microscopic disorder and macroscopic regularities. Here, the minimal space revealing key network properties is introduced, showing that non-integer dimensions produce chaotic-like attractors.</description>

      <title>Non-Haar random circuits form unitary designs as fast as Haar random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unitary design formation in random circuits has attracted considerable attention due to its wide range of practical applications and relevance to fundamental physics. While the formation rates in Haar random circuits have been extensively studied in previous works, it remains an open question how these rates are affected by the choice of local randomizers. In this work, we prove that the circuit depths required for general non-Haar random circuits to form unitary designs are upper bounded by those for the corresponding Haar random circuits, up to a constant factor independent of the system size. This result is derived in a broad range of circuit structures, including one- and higher-dimensional lattices, geometrically non-local configurations, and even extremely shallow circuits with patchwork architectures. We provide specific applications of these results in randomized benchmarking and random circuit sampling, and also discuss their implications for quantum many-body physics. Our work lays the foundation for flexible and robust randomness generation in real-world experiments, and offers new insights into chaotic dynamics in complex quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The canonical ensemble of a self-gravitating matter thin shell in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build the canonical ensemble of a hot self-gravitating matter thin shell in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space by finding its partition function through the Euclidean path integral approach with fixed temperature at the conformal boundary. We obtain the reduced action of the system by restricting the path integral to spherically symmetric metrics with given boundary conditions and with the Hamiltonian constraint satisfied. The stationary conditions, i.e., the mechanical equilibrium and the thermodynamic equilibrium, are obtained from minimizing the reduced action. Evaluating the perturbed reduced action at the stationary points yields the mechanical stability condition and the thermodynamic stability condition. The reduced action calculated at the stationary points gives the partition function in the zero-loop approximation and from it the thermodynamic properties of the system are acquired. Within thermodynamics alone, the only stability condition that one can establish is thermodynamic stability, which follows from the computation of the heat capacity. For given specific pressure and temperature equations of state for the shell, we obtain the solutions of the ensemble. There are four different thin shell solutions, one of them is fully stable, i.e., is stable mechanically and thermodynamically. For the equations of state given, we find a first order phase transition from the matter thermodynamic phase to the Hawking-Page black hole phase. Moreover, there is a maximum temperature above which the shell ceases to exist, presumably at these high temperatures the shell inevitably collapses to a black hole.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Field: A Conceptually Novel Approach for Nonadiabatic Quantum Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable trajectory-based nonadiabatic quantum dynamics methods at the atomic level are critical for understanding many important processes in real systems. The paper reports latest progress of nonadiabatic field (NaF), a conceptually novel approach for nonadiabatic quantum dynamics with independent trajectories. Substantially different from the mainstreams of Ehrenfest-like dynamics and surface hopping methods, the nuclear force in NaF involves the nonadiabatic force arising from the nonadiabatic coupling between different electronic states, in addition to the adiabatic force contributed by a single adiabatic electronic state. NaF is capable of faithfully describing the interplay between electronic and nuclear motion in a broad regime, which covers where the relevant electronic states keep coupled in a wide range or all the time and where the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion is essential. NaF is derived from the exact generalized phase space formulation with coordinate-momentum variables, where constraint phase space (CPS) is employed for discrete electronic-state degrees of freedom. We propose efficient integrators for the equations of motion of NaF in both adiabatic and diabatic representations. Since the formalism in the CPS formulation is not unique, NaF can in principle be implemented with various phase space representations of the time correlation function (TCF) for the time-dependent property. They are applied to a suite of representative gas-phase and condensed-phase benchmark models where numerically exact results are available for comparison. It is shown that NaF is relatively insensitive to the phase space representation of the electronic TCF and will be a potential tool for practical and reliable simulations of the quantum mechanical behavior of both electronic and nuclear dynamics of nonadiabatic transition processes in real systems.</description>

      <title>A mesoscopic model for the rheology of dilute and semidilute solutions of wormlike micelles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of a `persistent worm' is introduced, representing the smallest possible length of a wormlike micelle, and modelled by a bead-spring chain with sticky beads at the ends. Persistent worms are allowed to combine with each other at their sticky ends to form wormlike micelles with a distribution of lengths, and the semiflexibility of a wormlike micelle is captured with a bending potential between springs, both within and across persistent worms that stick to each other. Multi-particle Brownian dynamics simulations of such polydisperse and `polyflexible' wormlike micelles, with hydrodynamic interactions included and coupled with reversible scission/fusion of persistent worms, are used to investigate the static and dynamic properties of wormlike micellar solutions in the dilute and unentangled semidilute concentration regimes. The influence of the sticker energy and persistent worm concentration are examined and simulations are shown to validate theoretical mean-field predictions of the universal scaling with concentration of the chain length distribution of linear wormlike micelles, independent of the sticker energy. The presence of wormlike micelles that form rings is shown not to affect the static properties of linear wormlike micelles, and mean-field predictions of ring length distributions are validated. Linear viscoelastic storage and loss moduli are computed and the unique features in the intermediate frequency regime compared to those of homopolymer solutions are highlighted. The distinction between Rouse and Zimm dynamics in wormlike micelle solutions is elucidated, with a clear identification of the onset of the screening of hydrodynamic interactions with increasing concentration.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Distinguishability of Black Hole Microstates from AdS/CFT Correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish direct evidence for the perturbative distinguishability between black hole microstates and thermal states using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories, we obtain the short interval expansion of subsystem fidelity and quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence, both of which provide rigorous lower and upper bounds for trace distance. This result demonstrates that quantum gravity corrections break semiclassical indistinguishability, thereby supporting the recovery of information even from a small amount of the Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Standardization of Weighted Ranking Correlation Coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relevant problem in statistics is defining the correlation of two rankings of a list of items. Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho are two well established correlation coefficients, characterized by a symmetric form that ensures zero expected value between two pairs of rankings randomly chosen with uniform probability. However, in recent years, several weighted versions of the original Spearman and Kendall coefficients have emerged that take into account the greater importance of top ranks compared to low ranks, which is common in many contexts. The weighting schemes break the symmetry, causing a non-zero expected value between two random rankings. This issue is very relevant, as it undermines the concept of uncorrelation between rankings. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a standardization function $g(x)$ that maps a correlation ranking coefficient $\Gamma$ in a standard form $g(\Gamma)$ that has zero expected value, while maintaining the relevant statistical properties of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Towards quantitative understanding of quantum dot ensemble capacitance-voltage spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous ensembles of quantum dots (QDs) coupled to a charge reservoir are widely studied by using, e.g., electrical methods like capacitance-voltage spectroscopy. We present experimental measurements of the QD capacitance as a function of varying parameters such as ac frequency and bath temperature. The experiment reveals distinct shifts in the position of the capacitance peaks. While temperature-induced shifts have been explained by previous models, the observation of frequency-dependent shifts has not been explained so far. Given that existing models fall short in explaining these phenomena, we propose a refined theoretical model based on a master equation approach which incorporates energy-dependent tunneling effects. This approach successfully reproduces the experimental data. We highlight the critical role of energy-dependent tunneling in two distinct regimes: at low temperatures, ensemble effects arising from energy-level dispersion in differently sized QDs dominate the spectral response; at high temperatures and frequencies, we observe a peak shift of a different nature, which is best described by optimizing the conjoint probability of successive in- and out-tunneling events. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of tunnel processes and the physical properties of QD ensembles coupled to a common reservoir, with implications for their development in applications such as single-photon sources and spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Fixation and extinction in time-fluctuating spatially structured metapopulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations, and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. We consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment where demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated with harsh and mild environmental conditions. When the rate of switching is neither too slow nor too fast, the dynamics is characterised by bottlenecks and the population is prone to fluctuations or extinction. We analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak, and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to what happens in static environments, the fixation probability depends on the migration rate. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment and discuss possible generalisations of our models.</description>

      <title>Phase separation in a chiral active fluid of inertial self-spinning disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that systematic particle rotations in a fluid composed of disk-shaped spinners can spontaneously lead to phase separation. The phenomenon arises out of a homogeneous and hydrostatic stationary state, due to a pressure feedback mechanism that increases local density fluctuations. We show how this mechanism induces phase separation, coined as Rotation Induced Phase Separation (RIPS), when the active rotation is not properly counterbalanced by translational friction. A low density phase can coexist with a dense chiral liquid due to the imbalance between pressure and stress transmitted through chiral flows when a significant momentum transfer between rotational and translational motion can be sustained. As a consequence, RIPS is expected to appear generically in chiral fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider quantum spin chains with a hidden free fermionic structure, distinct from the Jordan-Wigner transformation and its generalizations. We express selected local operators with the hidden fermions. This way we can exactly solve the real time dynamics in various physical scenarios, including the computation of selected dynamical two point functions, in continuous or discrete time. In the latter case we build a quantum circuit that can be implemented on a quantum computer. With this we extend the family of classically simulable quantum many-body processes.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in the XY model on the honeycomb lattice: A comprehensive Monte Carlo analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12076v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we thoroughly examined the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition in the two-dimensional XY model on the honeycomb lattice. To address its thermodynamical behavior, we combined standard numerical Monte Carlo simulations with the simulated annealing (SA) protocol and entropic simulations based on the Wang-Landau (WL) algorithm. The transition temperature was determined using the second ($\Upsilon$) and fourth-order ($\Upsilon_4$) helicity modulus as the order parameter. Our best finite-size scaling analysis suggests $T_{BKT} = 0.575(8)$ from SA and $T_{BKT}=0.576(3)$ from WL. These values deviate significantly from the expected theoretical value of $1/\sqrt{2}$. We believe that this discrepancy suggests that the theoretical assumptions regarding the analytical calculation may need to be revisited. Additionally, we calculated the vortex density and the formation energy of the vortex-antivortex pairs, where the obtained vortex formation energy is $2\mu=5.80(12)$. Upon comparison with the square lattice, our results support the notion of instability of the honeycomb lattice to support the spin long-range order and give additional backing to the critical behavior we found.</description>

      <title>Infinite-temperature thermostats by energy localization in a nonequilibrium setup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some lattice models having two conservation laws may display an equilibrium phase transition from a homogeneous (positive temperature - PT) to a condensed (negative temperature) phase, where a finite fraction of the energy is localized in a few sites. We study one such stochastic model in an out-of-equilibrium setup, where the ends of the lattice chain are attached to two PT baths. We show that localized peaks may spontaneously emerge, acting as infinite-temperature heat baths. The number $N_b$ of peaks is expected to grow in time $t$ as $N_b \sim \sqrt{\ln t}$, as a consequence of an effective freezing of the dynamics. Asymptotically, the chain spontaneously subdivides into three intervals: the two external ones lying inside the PT region; the middle one characterized by peaks superposed to a background lying along the infinite-temperature line. In the thermodynamic limit, the Onsager formalism allows determining the shape of the whole profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15475v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Sociohydrodynamics: data-driven modelling of social behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living systems display complex behaviors driven by physical forces as well as decision-making. Hydrodynamic theories hold promise for simplified universal descriptions of socially-generated collective behaviors. However, the construction of such theories is often divorced from the data they should describe. Here, we develop and apply a data-driven pipeline that links micromotives to macrobehavior by augmenting hydrodynamics with individual preferences that guide motion. We illustrate this pipeline on a case study of residential dynamics in the United States, for which census and sociological data is available. Guided by Census data, sociological surveys, and neural network analysis, we systematically assess standard hydrodynamic assumptions to construct a sociohydrodynamic model. Solving our simple hydrodynamic model, calibrated using statistical inference, qualitatively captures key features of residential dynamics at the level of individual US counties. We highlight that a social memory, akin to hysteresis in magnets, emerges in the segregation-integration transition even with memory-less agents. This suggests an explanation for the phenomenon of neighborhood tipping, whereby a small change in a neighborhood's population leads to a rapid demographic shift. Beyond residential segregation, our work paves the way for systematic investigations of decision-guided motility in real space, from micro-organisms to humans, as well as fitness-mediated motion in more abstract genomic spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of a continuously monitored qubit in the limit of strong measurement rate where the quantum trajectory is described by a stochastic master equation with Poisson noise. Such limits are expected to give rise to quantum jumps between the pointer states associated with the non-demolition measurement. A surprising discovery in earlier work [Tilloy et al., Phys. Rev. A 92, 052111 (2015)] on quantum trajectories with Brownian noise was the phenomena of spikes observed in between the quantum jumps. Here, we show that spikes are observed also for Poisson noise. We consider three cases where the non-demolition is broken by adding, to the basic strong measurement dynamics, either unitary evolution or thermal noise or additional measurements. We present a complete analysis of the spike and jump statistics for all three cases using the fact that the dynamics effectively corresponds to that of stochastic resetting. We provide numerical results to support our analytic results.</description>

      <title>A geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A standard description of superfluid helim-4 is based on the concept of two components (superfluid and normal), which leads to the so called two-fluid models. However, as there are no two kinds of atoms in helium-4, the two components can not be separated. Superfluid helium-4 is not a mixture of two components, being rather a single fluid with two motions. Here, we present a geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4, which is based on the Hamiltonian formulation of fluid mechanics. The model is derived from the kinetic theory of excitations and average particle motions. It can be simplified to the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) two-fluid model, where it removes one fitting parameter from the HVBK model, but it also gives extra terms beyond HVBK. Actually, we show that the two-fluid models are problematic in case of higher normal velocities, where the splitting of total momentum to the superfluid and normal component becomes impossible. Finally, we show how vortex line density may be added to the state variables. The one-component model can be seen as a generalization of the two-fluid models that is geometrically consistent, fully compressible, with non-zero superfluid vorticity, and compatible with classical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Many-body quantum geometry in time-dependent quantum systems with emergent quantum field theory instantaneously</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study many-body quantum geometric effects in time-dependent system with emergent quantum integrable field theory instantaneously. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the system can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two particles from the initial quantum integrable system. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze an Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined,where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhibits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. As the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener tunneling.Our results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Entanglement as a Magic Highway</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness is a key resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet its interplay with entanglement in dynamical settings remains underexplored. We study a well-controlled, analytically tractable setup that isolates entanglement generation from magic injection. We analytically and numerically demonstrate that stabilizer entanglement functions as a highway that facilitates the spreading of locally injected magic throughout the entire system. Specifically, for an initial stabilizer state with bipartite entanglement $E$, the total magic growth, quantified by the linear stabilizer entropy $Y$, follows $\overline{Y}\propto 2^{-|A|-E}$ under a Haar random unitary on a local subregion $A$. Moreover, when applying a tensor product of local Haar random unitaries, the resulting state's global magic approaches that of a genuine Haar random state if the initial stabilizer state is sufficiently entangled by a system-size-independent amount. Similar results are also obtained for tripartite stabilizer entanglement. We further extend our analysis to non-stabilizer entanglement and magic injection via a shallow-depth brickwork circuit, and find that the qualitative picture of our conclusion remains unchanged.</description>

Abstract: A dynamic concordia discors, a finely tuned equilibrium between opposing forces, is hypothesized to drive historical transformations. Similarly, a precise interplay of excitation and inhibition, the 80:20 ratio, is at the basis of the normal functionality of neural systems. In artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning allows for fine-tuning internal signed connections, optimizing adaptive responses to complex stimuli, and ensuring robust performance. At present, engineered structures of competing components are, however, largely unexplored, particularly because their emergent phases are closely linked with frustration mechanisms in the hosting network. In this context, the spin glass theory has shown how an apparently uncontrollable non-ergodic chaotic behavior arises from the complex interplay of competing interactions and frustration among units, leading to multiple metastable states preventing the system from exploring all accessible configurations over time. Here, we tackle the problem of disentangling topology and dynamics in systems with antagonistic interactions. We make use of the signed Laplacian operator to demonstrate how fundamental topological defects in lattices and networks percolate, shaping the geometrical arena and complex energy landscape of the system. This unveils novel, highly robust multistable phases and establishes deep connections with spin glasses when thermal noise is considered, providing a natural topological and algebraic description of their still-unknown set of pure states at zero temperature.</description>
