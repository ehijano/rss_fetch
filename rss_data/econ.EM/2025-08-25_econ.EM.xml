      <title>A bias test for heteroscedastic linear least-squares regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear least squares regression is subject to bias due to an omitted variable, a mismeasured regressor, or simultaneity. A simple test to detect the bias is proposed and explored in simulation and in real data sets.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Many Instruments Problem using Random Matrix Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instrumental variables estimation with many instruments is biased. Traditional bias-adjustments are closely connected to the Silverstein equation. Based on the theory of random matrices, we show that Ridge estimation of the first-stage parameters reduces the implicit price of bias-adjustments. This leads to a trade-off, allowing for less costly estimation of the causal effect, which comes along with improved asymptotic properties. Our theoretical results nest existing ones on bias approximation and adjustment with ordinary least-squares in the first-stage regression and, moreover, generalize them to settings with more instruments than observations. Finally, we derive the optimal tuning parameter of Ridge regressions in simultaneous equations models, which comprises the well-known result for single equation models as a special case with uncorrelated error terms.</description>

      <title>Factor Models of Matrix-Valued Time Series: Nonstationarity and Cointegration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the nonstationary matrix-valued time series with common stochastic trends. Unlike the traditional factor analysis which flattens matrix observations into vectors, we adopt a matrix factor model in order to fully explore the intrinsic matrix structure in the data, allowing interaction between the row and column stochastic trends, and subsequently improving the estimation convergence. It also reduces the computation complexity in estimation. The main estimation methodology is built on the eigenanalysis of sample row and column covariance matrices when the nonstationary matrix factors are of full rank and the idiosyncratic components are temporally stationary, and is further extended to tackle a more flexible setting when the matrix factors are cointegrated and the idiosyncratic components may be nonstationary. Under some mild conditions which allow the existence of weak factors, we derive the convergence theory for the estimated factor loading matrices and nonstationary factor matrices. In particular, the developed methodology and theory are applicable to the general case of heterogeneous strengths over weak factors. An easy-to-implement ratio criterion is adopted to consistently estimate the size of latent factor matrix. Both simulation and empirical studies are conducted to examine the numerical performance of the developed model and methodology in finite samples.</description>
