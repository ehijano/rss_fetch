      <title>On sharp constants in higher order Adams-Cianchi inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main results of this paper are the establishment of sharp constants for several families of critical Sobolev embeddings. These inequalities were pioneered by David R. Adams, while the sharp constant in the first order case is due to Andrea Cianchi. We also prove a trace improvement of an inequality obtained independently by K. Hansson and H. Brezis and S. Wainger.</description>

      <title>Applications of Interpolation theory to the regularity of some equasilinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present some regularity results on the gradient of the weak or entropic-renormalized solution $u$ to the homogeneous Dirichlet problem for the quasilinear equations of the form
  \begin{equation*}\label{p-laplacian_eq}
  -{\rm div~}(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u)+V(x;u)=f,
  \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is a bounded smooth domain of $\mathbb R^n$, $V$ is a nonlinear potential and $f$ belongs to non-standard spaces like Lorentz-Zygmund spaces.
  Moreover, we collect some well-known and new results for identifying some interpolation spaces and enrich some contents with details.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal $H$-convergence for topologically nontrivial domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of nonlocal $H$-convergence is extended to domains with nontrivial topology, that is, domains with non-vanishing harmonic Dirichlet and/or Neumann fields. If the space of harmonic Dirichlet (or Neumann) fields is infinite-dimensional, there is an abundance of choice of pairwise incomparable topologies generalising the one for topologically trivial $\Omega$. It will be demonstrated that if the domain satisfies the Maxwell's compactness property the corresponding natural version of the corresponding (generalised) nonlocal $H$-convergence topology has no such ambiguity. Moreover, on multiplication operators the nonlocal $H$-topology coincides with the one induced by (local) $H$-convergence introduced by Murat and Tartar. The topology is used to obtain nonlocal homogenisation results including convergence of the associated energy for electrostatics. The derived techniques prove useful to deduce a new compactness criterion relevant for nonlinear static Maxwell problems.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds and applications I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are frequently used in many branches of mathematics. Most of the classical results in this area are optimal, in the worst case analysis. However, in modern applications, both the ground and the nose matrices frequently have extra structural properties. For instance, it is often assumed that the ground matrix is essentially low rank, and the nose matrix is random or pseudo-random. We aim to rebuild a part of perturbation theory, adapting to these modern assumptions. The key idea to to exploit the skewness between the leading eigenvectors of the ground matrix and the noise matrix. We will do this by combining the classical contour integration method with new combinatorial ideas, resulting in a new machinery, which has a wide range of applications. Our new bounds are optimal under mild assumptions, with direct applications to central problems in many different areas. Among others, we derive a sharp result for the perturbation of a low rank matrix with random perturbation, answering an open question in this area. Next, we derive new, optimal, results concerning covariance estimator of the spiked model, an important model in statistics, bridging two different directions of current research. Finally, we use our results on the perturbation of eigenspaces to derive new results concerning eigenvalues of deterministic and random matrices. In particular, we obtain new results concerning the outliers in the deformed Wigner model and the least singular value of random matrices with non-zero mean.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to nonlinear spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A seminal open question of Pisier and Mendel--Naor asks whether every degree-regular graph which satisfies the classical discrete Poincar\'e inequality for scalar functions, also satisfies an analogous inequality for functions taking values in \textit{any} normed space with non-trivial cotype. Motivated by applications, it is also greatly important to quantify the dependence of the corresponding optimal Poincar\'e constant on the cotype $q$. Works of Odell--Schlumprecht (1994), Ozawa (2004), and Naor (2014) make substantial progress on the former question by providing a positive answer for normed spaces which also have an unconditional basis, in addition to finite cotype. However, little is known in the way of quantitative estimates: the mentioned results imply a bound on the Poincar\'e constant depending super-exponentially on $q$.
  We introduce a novel combinatorial framework for proving quantitative nonlinear spectral gap estimates. The centerpiece is a property of regular graphs that we call \emph{long range expansion}, which holds with high probability for random regular graphs. Our main result is that any regular graph with the long-range expansion property satisfies a discrete Poincar\'{e} inequality for any normed space with an unconditional basis and cotype $q$, with a Poincar\'{e} constant that depends \emph{polynomially} on $q$, which is optimal. As an application, any normed space with an unconditional basis which admits a low distortion embedding of an $n$-vertex random regular graph, must have cotype at least polylogarithmic in $n$. This extends a celebrated lower-bound of Matou\v{s}ek for low distortion embeddings of random graphs into $\ell_q$ spaces.</description>
