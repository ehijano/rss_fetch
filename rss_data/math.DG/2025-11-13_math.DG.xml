      <title>On $7$-manifolds with $b_{2}=2$: diffeomorphism classification and nonconnected moduli spaces of positive Ricci curvature metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the $s$-invariants of certain simply connected $7$-manifolds whose second homology groups are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. We apply the $s$-invariants to give a partial classification of simply connected total spaces of circle bundles over $\left(\mathbb{C}P^{1}\times\mathbb{C}P^{2}\right)\#\mathbb{C}P^{3}$ up to diffeomorphism. As an application, we show that there is a simply connected $7$-manifold whose space and moduli space of positive Ricci curvature metrics both have infinitely many path components. We also determine bordism groups $\Omega_{8}^{Spin}\left(K_{2}\right)$ and $\Omega_{8}^{Spin}\left(K_{2};\mathrm{pr}_{1}^{*}\gamma^{1}\right)$ that are required in the deduction of $s$-invariants.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler geometry on total spaces of vector bundles over elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study function theory and K\"ahler geometry on total spaces of vector bundles on an elliptic curve. For rank two vector bundles of degree zero, we show that any two total spaces are biholomorphic if and only if the corresponding vector bundles are isomorphic. We also construct complete Gauduchon Hermitian metrics with flat Chern-Ricci curvature on these total spaces. These metrics are natural in the sense that the corresponding spaces of holomorphic functions of polynomial growth coincide with `polynomials' on these spaces. Moreover, we characterize all complete K\"ahler metrics with nonnegative bisectional curvature on total spaces of line bundles over an elliptic curve.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Locally Conformal Spin(7) Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the deformation theory of instantons on locally conformal (LC) $Spin(7)$ manifolds. These structures, characterized by a non-parallel fundamental 4-form $\Phi$ satisfying $d\Phi = \theta \wedge \Phi$, represent a significant, yet geometrically constrained, class of non-integrable $G$-structures. We analyze the infinitesimal deformation complex for $Spin(7)$-instantons in this setting.
  Our primary contribution is the reformulation of the linearized deformation equations -- comprising the linearized instanton condition and a gauge-fixing term -- using a $t$-parameter family of Dirac operators. We demonstrate that the $t$-dependent torsion terms arising from the Lee form $\theta$ cancel precisely. This unexpected simplification reveals that the deformation space $\mathcal{H}^1$ is governed entirely by the Levi-Civita geometry, effectively reducing the torsion-full problem to a more classical, torsion-free (Levi-Civita) setting.
  Using a Lichnerowicz-type rigidity theorem, we establish a general condition for an (LC) $Spin(7)$-instanton to be rigid (i.e., $\mathcal{H}^1 = \{0\}$). We apply this theory to the flat instanton ($A=0$) on known compact homogeneous (LC) $Spin(7)$ manifolds and conclude that the flat instanton on these spaces is non-rigid, thus possessing a non-trivial moduli space.</description>

      <title>The qualitative behavior for biharmonic functions on open manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a complete noncompact Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature, we show that bounded biharmonic functions are constant and the space consists of biharmonic functions with polynomial growth of a fixed rate is finite dimensional. Also, we derive a Weyl type bound for this space. Finally, we present a finite dimensional result for a class of fourth-order operators on $\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfying certain coefficient conditions.</description>

      <title>Fast $k$-means clustering in Riemannian manifolds via Fr\'{e}chet maps: Applications to large-dimensional SPD matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fr\'{e}chet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.</description>

      <title>Foliation surgeries and the concordance groups of foliated spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a general procedure extending surgery to manifolds with foliation or Haefliger structure, the resulting Haefliger structure defined on the underlying surgered manifold. We find a single obstruction, whose vanishing characterizes the existence of a foliation surgery along an attaching sphere. When unobstructed, the resulting Haefliger structure can be chosen so that characteristic numbers are unchanged. Moreover, the obstructions are highly tractable for attaching spheres of dimension small relative the foliation codimension. This allows us to show that on every stably trivial manifold of dimension \( n \le 2q+2 \), a codimension-\( q \) Haefliger structure with trivial normal bundle admits a sequence of foliation surgeries to a Haefliger structure on the sphere \( S^{n} \), characteristic numbers unchanged.
  The obstruction always vanishes for \( 0 \)-sphere surgeries. It follows that the foliation connected sum gives, for each sphere \( S^{n} \) and codimension \( q \), a group structure on the set of concordance classes of transversely oriented Haefliger structures on \( S^{n} \). The resulting groups may be identified with the homotopy groups of the Haefliger classifying spaces \( B\Gamma^{+}_{q} \). Using this, we recover a result of Hurder that \( \pi_{2q+1}(B\Gamma^{+}_{q}) \) surjects onto a vector space of positive dimension for each codimension \( q \). We also apply the techniques here to a construction of Thurston's, to construct explicit Haefliger structures on \( (2q+1) \)-spheres whose Godbillon-Vey numbers surject to the real line.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of infinite circle patterns and convex polyhedra in hyperbolic 3-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since Thurston pioneered the connection between circle packing (abbr. CP) and three-dimensional geometric topology, the characterization of CPs and hyperbolic polyhedra has become increasingly profound. Some milestones have been achieved, for example, Rodin-Sullivan \cite{Rodin-Sullivan} and Schramm \cite{schramm91} proved the rigidity of infinite CPs with the intersection angle $\Theta=0$. Rivin-Hodgson \cite{RH93} fully characterized the existence and rigidity of compact convex polyhedra in $\mathbb{H}^3$. He \cite{He} proved the rigidity and uniformization theorem for infinite CPs with $0\leq\Theta\leq \pi/2$. \cite{He} also envisioned that "in a future paper, the techniques of this paper will be extended to the case when $0\leq\Theta&lt;\pi$. In particular, we will show a rigidity property for a class of infinite convex polyhedra in the 3-dimentional hyperbolic space".
  The article aims to accomplish the work claimed in \cite{He} by proving the rigidity and uniformization theorem for infinite CPs with $0\leq\Theta&lt;\pi$, as well as infinite trivalent hyperbolic polyhedra. We will pay special attention to CPs whose contact graphs are disk triangulation graphs. Such CPs are called regular because they exclude some singular configurations and correspond well to hyperbolic polyhedra. We will establish the existence and the rigidity of infinite regular CPs. Moreover, we will prove a uniformization theorem for regular CPs, which solves the classification problem for regular CPs. Thereby, the existence and rigidity of infinite convex trivalent polyhedra are obtained.</description>

      <title>A $k$-contact Geometrical Approach to Pseudo-Gauge Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a starting point to the geometric description for the pseudo-gauge ambiguity in relativistic hydrodynamics, showing that it corresponds to the freedom to redefine the thermodynamic equilibrium state of the system. To do this, we develop for the first time a description of a relativistic hydrodynamic-like theory using $k$-contact geometry. In this approach, thermodynamic laws are encoded in a $k$-contact form, thermodynamical states are described via $k$-contact Legendrian submanifolds, and conservation laws emerge as a consequence of Hamilton-de Donder-Weyl (HdDW) equations. The inherent non-uniqueness of these solutions is identified as the source of the pseudo-gauge freedom. We explicitly demonstrate how this redefinition of equilibrium works in a model of a Bjorken-like expansion, where a pseudo-gauge transformation is shown to leave the physical dissipation invariant.</description>

      <title>Properness and finiteness of totally geodesic submanifolds in the convex core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that in any geometrically finite rank-one manifold of infinite volume, every maximal totally geodesic submanifold of dimension at least two contained in the convex core is properly immersed and has finite volume. Moreover, there are only finitely many such submanifolds. This finiteness result, combined with the work of Bader-Fisher-Miller-Stover and of Gromov-Schoen, implies that any geometrically finite rank-one manifold with infinitely many maximal totally geodesic submanifolds of dimension at least two and of finite volume must be arithmetic.
  These results follow from rigidity theorems for totally geodesic submanifolds contained in the convex core of a geometrically finite manifold, whose proofs rely on deep results in unipotent dynamics and measure classification in the infinite-volume setting, due to Ratner, Dani-Margulis, and Mozes-Shah.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Formation of Apparent Horizons due to Boundary Effect in Vacuum Einstein Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that an apparent horizon can form as a result of Einsteinian evolution in pure vacuum spacetime starting from regular initial data free of apparent horizons due to pure boundary effects. We adapt a Cauchy-double-null framework and use the boundary generalized mean curvature condition for the existence of an interior apparent horizon imposed by the author S-T Yau in \cite{yau}. In particular, we prove that the condition of \cite{yau} can be met dynamically starting from a configuration that does not verify the same through a focusing mechanism. This is the first part of a two-part sequence, and in the sequel, we will focus on explicitly constructing the Cauchy data.</description>

      <title>Quantitative tightness for three-dimensional contact manifolds: a sub-Riemannian approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through the use of sub-Riemannian metrics we provide quantitative estimates for the maximal tight neighbourhood of a Reeb orbit on a three-dimensional contact manifold. Under appropriate geometric conditions we show how to construct closed curves which are boundaries of overtwisted disks. We introduce the concept of \emph{contact} Jacobi curve, and prove lower bounds of the so-called tightness radius (from a Reeb orbit) in terms of Schwarzian derivative bounds. We compare these results with the corresponding ones from [Etnyre, Komendarczyk, Massot - Invent. Math. 2012 and Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 2016], and we show that our estimates are sharp for classical model structures. We also prove similar, but non-sharp, estimates in terms of sub-Riemannian canonical curvature bounds. We apply our results to K-contact sub-Riemannian manifolds. In this setting, we prove a contact analogue of the celebrated Cartan--Hadamard theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classic Lusternik--Schnirelmann theorem states that there are three distinct simple periodic geodesics on any Riemannian 2-sphere $M$. It has been proven by Y. Liokumovich, A. Nabutovsky and R. Rotman that the shortest three such curves have lengths bounded in terms of the diameter $d$ of $M$. We show that at any point $p$ on $M$ there exist at least two distinct simple geodesic loops (geodesic segments that start and end at $p$) whose lengths are respectively bounded by $8d$ and $14d$.</description>

      <title>A Concurrent Generalized Kropina Change</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a generalized Kropina metric featuring a specific $\pi$-form. Start with a Finsler manifold $(M,F)$ admits a concurrent $\pi$-vector field $\overline{\varphi}$, then, examine the $\phi$-concurrent generalized Kropina change defined by $\widehat{F}=\frac{F^{m+1}}{\Phi^{m}},\,\, \Phi^{m}&gt;0$, where $\Phi$ represents the corresponding $1$-form. We investigate the fundamental geometric objects associated with $\widehat{F}$ in an intrinsic manner after adopting this modification and present an example of a Finsler metric that admits a concurrent vector field along with $\widehat{F}$. Also, we prove that the geodesic sprays of $F$ and $\widehat{F}$ can never be projectively related. Moreover, we show $\overline{\varphi}$ is not concurrent with respect to $\widehat{F}$. Eventhough, we give a sufficient condition for $\overline{\varphi}$ to be concurrent with respect to $\widehat{F}$. Finally, we prove that the $\phi$-concurrent generalized Kropina change ($F \longrightarrow \widehat{F}$) preserves the almost rational property of the initial Finsler metric ${F}$.</description>

Abstract: We explore existence of invariant metrics with positive intermediate Ricci curvature on closed, low-dimensional cohomogeneity one manifolds. For a certain cohomogeneity one $\mathsf{Spin}(4)$-action on $S^3 \times \mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^2$, we construct an invariant metric with positive 4th-intermediate Ricci curvature and show it cannot admit one with positive 3rd-intermediate Ricci curvature. We further establish similar symmetry obstructions to positive curvature for $S^3 \times S^3$, $S^3 \times S^4$, and several families of cohomogeneity one manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the concept of \textit{Clairaut Riemannian warped product submersions} between Riemannian warped product manifolds. By generalizing the notion of Clairaut Riemannian submersions to the setting of Riemannian warped product submersions, we define such submersions via a warping function satisfying a Clairaut relation along geodesics. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which a Riemannian warped product submersion satisfies the Clairaut condition, showing that it holds if and only if the girth function defining the Clairaut condition has a horizontal gradient, one component of the fibers is totally geodesic, and the other is totally umbilical with mean curvature vector governed by the warping function. We examine the geometric consequences of this structure, study the harmonicity conditions, and the behavior of the Weyl tensor, etc. Additionally, we illustrate the theory with several non-trivial examples. In the latter part of the paper, we explore a detailed study of the curvature behavior of such submersions. Explicit formulas for the Riemannian, Ricci, and sectional curvature tensors of the source space are derived in terms of the geometry of the target and fiber manifolds, as well as the warping and girth functions. These computations provide geometric insight into how warping and the Clairaut condition affect curvature properties, such as conformal flatness and the non-positivity of certain mixed curvatures. We also analyze the conditions for a trivial warping of the source manifold and for the fibers to be locally symmetric. Furthermore, the Einstein condition has been explored in various scenarios. Finally, we also extend and answer a question posed in [2] to the setting of Clairaut warped product submersion.</description>

Abstract: Algebraists asked whether or not an operator on the module of smooth sections of the tangent bundle over the commutative ring of smooth functions of a smooth (orientable) manifold (can be any piece of a compact or a complete manifold) can be characterized by two axioms. In this note we confirm this for any smooth manifold M under the assumption that H^1(M, R) = {0}.</description>

      <title>Jet Functors and Weil Algebras in Automatic Differentiation: A Geometric Analysis</title>

Abstract: We present a differential-geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) based on jet functors and Weil algebras. In this framework, forward- and reverse-mode differentiation arise naturally as pushforward and cotangent pullback, while higher-order differentiation corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. This construction provides a unified, coordinate-free view of derivative propagation and clarifies the algebraic structure underlying AD. All results are realized in modern JAX code, where the Weil-mode formulation computes all mixed derivatives in a single forward pass with cost linear in the algebra dimension. The resulting implementation achieves algebraically exact and numerically stable differentiation with predictable scaling, demonstrating that geometric abstraction can yield more efficient and transparent computational differentiation systems.
