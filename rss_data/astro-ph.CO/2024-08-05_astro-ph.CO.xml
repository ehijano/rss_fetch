      <title>Diverse dark matter haloes in Two-field Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is a compelling candidate for dark matter, offering a natural explanation for the structure of diffuse low-mass haloes. However, the canonical FDM model with a mass of $10^{-22}~{\rm eV}$ encounters challenges in reproducing the observed diversity of dwarf galaxies, except for possibly scenarios where strong galactic feedback is invoked. The introduction of multiple-field FDM can provide a potential resolution to this diversity issue. The theoretical plausibility of this dark matter model is also enhanced by the fact that multiple axion species with logarithmically-distributed mass spectrum exist as a generic prediction of string theory. In this paper we consider the axiverse hypothesis and investigate non-linear structure formation in the two-field fuzzy dark matter (2FDM) model. Our cosmological simulation with an unprecedented resolution and self-consistent initial conditions reveals the diverse structures of dark matter haloes in the 2FDM model for the first time. Depending on the formation time and local tidal activities, late-time haloes can host solitons of nested cores or solitons of one dominant species.</description>

      <title>On the Generality and Persistence of Cosmological Stasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical decays of $N$ matter species to radiation may balance against Hubble expansion to yield stasis, a new phase of cosmological evolution with constant matter and radiation abundances. We analyze stasis with various machine learning techniques on the full $2N$-dimensional space of decay rates and abundances, which serve as inputs to the system of Boltzmann equations that governs the dynamics. We construct a differentiable Boltzmann solver to maximize the number of stasis $e$-folds $\mathcal{N}$. High-stasis configurations obtained by gradient ascent motivate log-uniform distributions on rates and abundances to accompany power-law distributions of previous works. We demonstrate that random configurations drawn from these families of distributions regularly exhibit many $e$-folds of stasis. We additionally use them as priors in a Bayesian analysis conditioned on stasis, using stochastic variational inference with normalizing flows to model the posterior. All three numerical analyses demonstrate the generality of stasis and point to a new model in which the rates and abundances are exponential in the species index. We show that the exponential model solves the exact stasis equations, is an attractor, and satisfies $\mathcal{N}\propto N$, exhibiting inflation-level $e$-folding with a relatively low number of species. This is contrasted with the $\mathcal{N}\propto \log(N)$ scaling of power-law models. Finally, we discuss implications for the emergent string conjecture and string axiverse.</description>

      <title>Inpainting Galaxy Counts onto N-Body Simulations over Multiple Cosmologies and Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, while the current state-of-the art methodology for generating theoretical predictions for the large scale structures of the Universe, are among the most expensive simulation tools, requiring upwards of 100 millions CPU hours per simulation. N-body simulations, which exclusively model dark matter and its purely gravitational interactions, represent a less resource-intensive alternative, however, they do not model galaxies, and as such cannot directly be compared to observations. In this study, we use conditional score-based models to learn a mapping from N-body to hydrodynamical simulations, specifically from dark matter density fields to the observable distribution of galaxies. We demonstrate that our model is capable of generating galaxy fields statistically consistent with hydrodynamical simulations at a fraction of the computational cost, and demonstrate our emulator is significantly more precise than traditional emulators over the scales 0.36 $h\ \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ $\leq$ k $\leq$ 3.88 $h\ \text{Mpc}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Enhancing weak lensing redshift distribution characterization by optimizing the Dark Energy Survey Self-Organizing Map Photo-z method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of the redshift distribution of ensembles of galaxies is pivotal for large scale structure cosmological studies. In this work, we focus on improving the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) methodology for photometric redshift estimation (SOMPZ), specifically in anticipation of the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 (DES Y6) data. This data set, featuring deeper and fainter galaxies than DES Year 3 (DES Y3), demands adapted techniques to ensure accurate recovery of the underlying redshift distribution. We investigate three strategies for enhancing the existing SOM-based approach used in DES Y3: 1) Replacing the Y3 SOM algorithm with one tailored for redshift estimation challenges; 2) Incorporating $\textit{g}$-band flux information to refine redshift estimates (i.e. using $\textit{griz}$ fluxes as opposed to only $\textit{riz}$); 3) Augmenting redshift data for galaxies where available. These methods are applied to DES Y3 data, and results are compared to the Y3 fiducial ones. Our analysis indicates significant improvements with the first two strategies, notably reducing the overlap between redshift bins. By combining strategies 1 and 2, we have successfully managed to reduce redshift bin overlap in DES Y3 by up to 66$\%$. Conversely, the third strategy, involving the addition of redshift data for selected galaxies as an additional feature in the method, yields inferior results and is abandoned. Our findings contribute to the advancement of weak lensing redshift characterization and lay the groundwork for better redshift characterization in DES Year 6 and future stage IV surveys, like the Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the Absolute Magnitude of Type Ia Supernovae in Nearby Galaxies using [OII] and Implications for $H_{0}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present state of cosmology is facing a crisis where there is a fundamental disagreement in measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_{0}$), with significant tension between the early and late universe methods. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are important to measuring $H_{0}$ through the astronomical distance ladder. However, there remains potential to better standardise SN Ia light curves by using known dependencies on host galaxy properties after the standard light curve width and colour corrections have been applied to the peak SN Ia luminosities. To explore this, we use the 5-year photometrically identified SNe Ia sample obtained by the Dark Energy Survey, along with host galaxy spectra obtained by the Australian Dark Energy Survey. Using host galaxy spectroscopy, we find a significant trend with the equivalent width (EW) of the [OII] $\lambda\lambda$ 3727, 29 doublet, a proxy for specific star formation rate, and Hubble residuals. We find that the correlation with [OII] EW is a powerful alternative to the commonly used mass step after initial light curve corrections. We applied our [OII] EW correction to a sample of 20 SN Ia hosted by calibrator galaxies observed using WiFeS, and examined the impact on both the SN Ia absolute magnitude and $H_{0}$. We then explored different [OII] EW corrections and found $H_{0}$ values ranging between $72.80$ to $73.28~\mathrm{km} \mathrm{s}^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Notably, even after using an additional [OII] EW correction, the impact of host galaxy properties in standardising SNe Ia appears limited in reducing the current tension ($\sim$5$\sigma$) with the Cosmic Microwave Background result for $H_{0}$.</description>

      <title>Dark Dwarfs: Dark Matter-Powered Sub-Stellar Objects Awaiting Discovery at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of dark matter annihilation on objects with masses close to the sub-stellar limit, finding that the minimum mass for stable hydrogen burning is larger than the $\sim0.075 M_\odot $ value predicted in the Standard Model. Below this limit, cooling brown dwarfs evolve into stable dark matter-powered objects that we name dark dwarfs. The timescale of this transition depends on the ambient dark matter density $\rho_{\rm DM}$ and circular velocity $v_{\rm DM}$ but is independent of the dark matter mass. We predict a population of dark dwarfs close to the galactic center, where the dark matter density is expected to be $\rho_{\rm DM}\gtrsim 10^{3}$ GeV/cm$^3$. At larger galactic radii the dark matter density is too low for these objects to have yet formed within the age of the universe. Dark dwarfs retain their initial lithium-7 in mass ranges where brown/red dwarfs would destroy it, providing a method for detecting them.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Time-Dependent Instrumental Noise for LISA SGWB Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variations in the instrumental noise of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) over time are expected as a result of e.g. scheduled satellite operations or unscheduled glitches. We demonstrate that these fluctuations can be leveraged to improve the sensitivity to stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) compared to the stationary noise scenario. This requires optimal use of data segments with downward noise fluctuations, and thus a data analysis pipeline capable of analysing and combining shorter time segments of mission data. We propose that simulation based inference is well suited for this challenge. In an approximate, but state-of-the-art, modeling setup, we show by comparison with Fisher Information Matrix estimates that the optimal information gain can be achieved in practice.</description>

      <title>Measuring the ICM velocity structure within the A3266 galaxy cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the velocity structure of the hot intracluster medium (ICM) within the A3266 galaxy cluster, including new observations taken between June and November 2023. Firstly, morphological structures within the galaxy cluster were examined using a Gaussian Gradient Magnitude (GGM) and adaptively smoothed GGM filter applied to the EPIC-pn X-ray image. Then, we applied a novel {\it XMM-Newton} EPIC-pn energy scale calibration, which uses instrumental Cu K$\alpha$ as reference for the line emission, to measure line-of-sight velocities of the hot gas within the system. This approach enabled us to create two-dimensional projected maps for velocity, temperature, and metallicity, showing that the hot gas displays a redshifted systemic velocity relative to the cluster redshift across all fields of view. Further analysis of the velocity distribution through non-overlapping circular regions demonstrated consistent redshifted velocities extending up to 1125 kpc from the cluster core. Additionally, the velocity distribution was assessed along regions following surface brightness discontinuities, where we observed redshifted velocities in all regions, with the largest velocities reaching $768 \pm 284$ km/s. Moreover, we computed the velocity Probability Density Function (PDF) from the velocity map. We applied a normality test, finding that the PDF adheres to an unimodal normal distribution consistent with theoretical predictions. Lastly, we computed a velocity structure function (VSF) for this system using the measured line-of-sight velocities. These insights advance our understanding of the dynamic processes within the A3266 galaxy cluster and contribute to our broader knowledge of ICM behavior in merging galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>A study of the dynamical structures in a Dark Matter Halo using UMAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a dimension reduction algorithm, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), to study dynamical structures inside a dark matter halo. We use a zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way mass dark matter halo, and apply UMAP on the 6 dimensional phase space in the dark matter field at z = 0. We find that particles in the field are mapped to distinct clusters in the lower dimensional space in a way that is closely related to their accretion history. The largest cluster in UMAP space does not contain the entire mass of the Milky Way virial region and neatly separates the older halo from the recently accreted matter. Particles within this cluster, which only comprise $\sim 70\%$ of the Milky Way particles, have had several pericenter passages and are, therefore, likely to be phase mixed, becoming dynamically uniform. The infall region and recently accreted particle and substructure, even up to splashback, form distinct components in the lower dimensional space; additionally, higher angular momentum particles also take longer times to mix. Our work shows that the current state of the Milky Way halo retains historical information, particularly about the recent accretion history, and even a relatively old structure is not dynamically uniform. We also explore UMAP as a pre-processing step to find coherent subhalos in dark matter simulations.</description>

      <title>Evolution of an effective Hubble constant in $f(R)$ modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Hubble constant tension within $f(R)$ modified gravity in the Jordan frame, focusing on its application to the dynamics of an isotropic Universe. A scalar field, non-minimally coupled to the metric, provides an extra degree of freedom compared to General Relativity. We analyze the impact of such a scalar field on the cosmic expansion, leading to an effective Hubble constant $H_{0}^{\text{eff}}(z)$, dependent on redshift $z$. We show that our $f(R)$ model might mimic dark energy and provide an apparent variation of the Hubble constant. Our results align with recent cosmological data analysis in redshift bins, indicating a decreasing trend of the Hubble constant. The redshift dependence of $H_{0}^{\text{eff}}(z)$ might potentially reconcile measurements of the Hubble constant from probes at different redshifts.</description>

      <title>Inflation with vector fields revisited: heavy entropy perturbations and primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit inflation coupled with vector fields employing kinetic coupling in the comoving gauge. It is known that there is a cumulative effect $\tilde{I}N^2$ on curvature power spectrum. For a large number of e-foldings $N$, this contribution is so significant that it could violate observational constraints when the ratio of kinetic energy between vector fields and inflaton $\tilde{I}$ is not extremely small. In this paper, we explore the regime where $\tilde{I}\gg 1$, a realm that has not been extensively explored due to the limitations of perturbative methods. We found that the entropy perturbation becomes heavy in this regime and the cumulative effect decays away on super-horizon scales. Consequently, the power spectrum retains its scale invariance in the decoupling limit. By straightforwardly integrating out the heavy modes near horizon-crossing, we derive a low-energy effective field theory describing a massless adiabatic perturbation with an imaginary speed of sound $c_s^2= -1/3$. Namely, the inflation with vector fields presents a potential mechanism for generating primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>LoVoCCS. II. Weak Lensing Mass Distributions, Red-Sequence Galaxy Distributions, and Their Alignment with the Brightest Cluster Galaxy in 58 Nearby X-ray-Luminous Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS) is an on-going program to observe nearly a hundred low-redshift X-ray-luminous galaxy clusters (redshifts $0.03&lt;z&lt;0.12$ and X-ray luminosities in the 0.1-2.4 keV band $L_{{\rm X500c}}&gt;10^{44}$ erg/s) with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), capturing data in $u,g,r,i,z$ bands with a $5\sigma$ point source depth of approximately 25-26th AB magnitudes. Here, we map the aperture masses in 58 galaxy cluster fields using weak gravitational lensing. These clusters span a variety of dynamical states, from nearly relaxed to merging systems, and approximately half of them have not been subject to detailed weak lensing analysis before. In each cluster field, we analyze the alignment between the 2D mass distribution described by the aperture mass map, the 2D red-sequence (RS) galaxy distribution, and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We find that the orientations of the BCG and the RS distribution are strongly aligned throughout the interiors of the clusters: the median misalignment angle is 19 deg within 2 Mpc. We also observe the alignment between the orientations of the RS distribution and the overall cluster mass distribution (by a median difference of 32 deg within 1 Mpc), although this is constrained by galaxy shape noise and the limitations of our cluster sample size. These types of alignment suggest long-term dynamical evolution within the clusters over cosmic timescales.</description>

      <title>New AGN diagnostic diagrams based on the [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ auroral line</title>

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our understanding of black holes formation and growth in the early Universe. However, JWST has also revealed that some of the classical diagnostics, such as the BPT diagrams and X-ray emission, often fail to identify narrow line TypeII active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshift. Here we present three new rest-frame optical diagnostic diagrams leveraging the [OIII]$\lambda4363$ auroral line, which has been detected in several JWST spectra. Specifically, we show that high values of the [OIII]$\lambda4363/$H$\gamma$ ratio provide a sufficient (but not necessary) condition to identify the presence of an AGN, both based on empirical calibrations (using local and high-redshift sources) and a broad range of photoionization models. These diagnostics are able to separate much of the AGN population from Star Forming Galaxies (SFGs). This is because the average energy of AGN's ionizing photons is higher than that of young stars in SFGs, hence AGN can more efficiently heat the gas, therefore boosting the [OIII]$\lambda4363$ line. We also found independent indications of AGN activity in some high-redshift sources that were not previously identified as AGN with the traditional diagnostics diagrams, but that are placed in the AGN region of the diagnostics presented in this work. We note that, conversely, low values of [OIII]$\lambda4363/$H$\gamma$ can be associated either with SFGs or AGN excitation. We note that the fact that strong auroral lines are often associated with AGN does not imply that they cannot be used for direct metallicity measurements (provided that proper ionization corrections are applied), but it does affect the calibration of strong line metallicity diagnostics.</description>

      <title>A hidden population of active galactic nuclei can explain the overabundance of luminous $z&gt;10$ objects observed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first wave of observations with JWST has revealed a striking overabundance of luminous galaxies at early times ($z&gt;10$) compared to models of galaxies calibrated to pre-JWST data. Early observations have also uncovered a large population of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at $z&gt;6$. Because many of the high-$z$ objects appear extended, the contribution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to the total luminosity has been assumed to be negligible. In this work, we use a semi-empirical model for assigning AGNs to galaxies to show that active galaxies can boost the stellar luminosity function (LF) enough to solve the overabundance problem while simultaneously remaining consistent with the observed morphologies of high-$z$ sources. We construct a model for the composite AGN+galaxy LF by connecting dark matter halo masses to galaxy and SMBH masses and luminosities, accounting for dispersion in the mapping between host galaxy and SMBH mass and luminosity. By calibrating the model parameters -- which characterize the $M_\bullet-M_\star$ relation -- to a compilation of $z&gt;10$ JWST UVLF data, we show that AGN emission can account for the excess luminosity under a variety of scenarios, including one where 10\% of galaxies host BHs of comparable luminosities to their stellar components. Using a sample of simulated objects and real observations, we demonstrate that such low-luminosity AGNs can be `hidden' in their host galaxies and be missed in common morphological analyses. We find that for this explanation to be viable, our model requires a population of BHs that are overmassive ($M_\bullet/M_\star\sim10^{-2}$) with respect to their host galaxies compared to the local relation and are more consistent with the observed relation at $z=4-8$. We explore the implications of this model for BH seed properties and comment on observational diagnostics necessary to further investigate this explanation.</description>

      <title>Black hole in a generalized Chaplygin-Jacobi dark fluid: shadow and light deflection angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a generalized Chaplygin-like gas with an anisotropic equation of state, characterizing a dark fluid within which a static spherically symmetric black hole is assumed. By solving the Einstein equations for this black hole spacetime, we explicitly derive the metric function. The spacetime is parametrized by two critical parameters, $\mathcal{B}$ and $\alpha$, which measure the deviation from the Schwarzschild black hole and the extent of the dark fluid's anisotropy, respectively. We explore the behavior of light rays in the vicinity of the black hole by calculating its shadow and comparing our results with the Event Horizon Telescope observations. This comparison constrains the parameters to $0 \leq \mathcal{B} &lt; 0.03$ and $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 0.1$. Additionally, we calculate the deflection angles to determine the extent to which light is bent by the black hole. These calculations are further utilized to formulate possible Einstein rings, estimating the angular radius of the rings to be approximately $37.6\,\mathrm{\mu as}$. Throughout this work, we present analytical solutions wherever feasible, and employ reliable approximations where necessary to provide comprehensive insights into the spacetime characteristics and their observable effects.</description>

      <title>Unimodular Quadratic Gravity and the Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unimodular gravity addresses the old cosmological constant (CC) problem, explaining why such constant is not at least as large as the largest particle mass scale, but classically it is indistinguishable from ordinary gravity. Conversely, quantum physics may give us a way to distinguish the two theories. Thus, here the unimodular constraint is imposed on a non-perturbative and background-independent quantum version of quadratic gravity, which was recently formulated. It is shown that unimodularity does lead to different predictions for some inflationary quantum observables. Unimodular gravity per se does not solves the new CC problem (why the CC has the observed value?) even in this realization. To address this issue a multiverse made by different eras in a single big bang is considered and the observed scale of dark energy is explained anthropically.</description>
