      <title>Immunological mechanisms and immunoregulatory strategies in intervertebral disc degeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intervertebral discs are avascular and maintain immune privilege. However, during intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), this barrier is disrupted, leading to extensive immune cell infiltration and localized inflammation. In degenerated discs, macrophages, T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) are key players, exhibiting functional heterogeneity. Dysregulated activation of inflammatory pathways, including nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, drives local pro-inflammatory responses, leading to cell apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Innovative immunotherapies, including exosome-based treatments, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, and chemokine-loaded hydrogel systems, have shown promise in reshaping the immunological niche of intervertebral discs. These strategies can modulate dysregulated immune responses and create a supportive environment for tissue regeneration. However, current studies have not fully elucidated the mechanisms of inflammatory memory and the immunometabolic axis, and they face challenges in balancing tissue regeneration with immune homeostasis. Future studies should employ interdisciplinary approaches such as single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to map a comprehensive immune atlas of IDD, elucidate intercellular crosstalk and signaling networks, and develop integrated therapies combining targeted immunomodulation with regenerative engineering, thereby facilitating the clinical translation of effective IDD treatments.</description>

      <title>Surface Induced Frustration of Inherent Dipolar Order in Nanoconfined Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface effects could play a dominant role in modifying the natural liquid order. In some cases, the effects of the surface interactions can propagate inwards, and even can interfere with a similar propagation from opposite surfaces. This can be particularly evident in liquid water under nano-confinement. The large dipolar cross-correlations among distinct molecules that give rise to the unusually large dielectric constant of water (and in turn owe their origin to the extended hydrogen bond (HB) network) can get perturbed by surfaces. The perturbation can propagate inwards and then interfere with the one from the opposite surface if confinement is only a few layers wide. This can give rise to short-to-intermediate range solvent-mediated interaction between two surfaces. Here we study the effects of such interactions on the dielectric constant of nano-confined liquids, not just water but also ordering at protein surfaces. The surfaces work at two levels: (i) induce orientational realignment, and (ii) alter the cross-correlations between water molecules. Molecular dynamics simulations and statistical analyses are used to address these aspects in confinement of slit pores, nano tube/cylinder, and nano sphere. In addition, we consider the hydration layers of multiple proteins with vastly different structural features. These studies give us a measure of the extent or the length scale of cross-correlations between dipole moments of water molecules. We find an interesting orientational arrangement in the protein hydration layers, giving rise to long-range molecular cross-correlations. To decouple the effect of HB from the effect of geometry, we additionally study acetonitrile under nanoconfinement. Importantly, while a protein's interior is characterized by a small dielectric constant, the dipole moment of a peptide bond is large, and thus susceptible to fluctuations in water.</description>

      <title>Discrete-space and -time analogue of a super-diffusive fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss how to construct reliably well "a lattice and an integer time" version of a super-diffusive continuous-space and -time fractional Brownian motion (fBm) -- an experimentally-relevant non-Markovian Gaussian stochastic process with an everlasting power-law memory on the time-evolution of thermal noises extending over the entire past. We propose two algorithms, which are both validated by extensive numerical simulations showing that the ensuing lattice random walks have not only the same power-law covariance function as the standard fBm, but also individual trajectories follow those of the super-diffusive fBm. Finding a lattice and an integer time analogue of a sub-diffusion fBm, which is an anti-persistent process, remains a challenging open problem. Our results also clarify the relevant difference between sub-diffusive and super-diffusive fBm, that are frequently seen as two very analogous realizations of processes with memory. They are indeed substantially different.</description>

      <title>Chem42: a Family of chemical Language Models for Target-aware Ligand Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Revolutionizing drug discovery demands more than just understanding molecular interactions - it requires generative models that can design novel ligands tailored to specific biological targets. While chemical Language Models (cLMs) have made strides in learning molecular properties, most fail to incorporate target-specific insights, restricting their ability to drive de-novo ligand generation. Chem42, a cutting-edge family of generative chemical Language Models, is designed to bridge this gap. By integrating atomic-level interactions with multimodal inputs from Prot42, a complementary protein Language Model, Chem42 achieves a sophisticated cross-modal representation of molecular structures, interactions, and binding patterns. This innovative framework enables the creation of structurally valid, synthetically accessible ligands with enhanced target specificity. Evaluations across diverse protein targets confirm that Chem42 surpasses existing approaches in chemical validity, target-aware design, and predicted binding affinity. By reducing the search space of viable drug candidates, Chem42 could accelerate the drug discovery pipeline, offering a powerful generative AI tool for precision medicine. Our Chem42 models set a new benchmark in molecule property prediction, conditional molecule generation, and target-aware ligand design. The models are publicly available at huggingface.co/inceptionai.</description>
