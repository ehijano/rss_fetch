      <title>The topological complexity of the ordered configuration space of disks in a strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How hard is it to program $n$ robots to move about a long narrow aisle such that only $w$ of them can fit across the width of the aisle? In this paper, we answer that question by calculating the topological complexity of $\text{conf}(n,w)$, the ordered configuration space of open unit-diameter disks in the infinite strip of width $w$. By studying its cohomology ring, we prove that, as long as $n$ is greater than $w$, the topological complexity of $\text{conf}(n,w)$ is $2n-2\big\lceil\frac{n}{w}\big\rceil+1$, providing a lower bound for the minimum number of cases such a program must consider.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Weiss calculi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide two candidates for symplectic Weiss calculus based on two different, but closely related, collections of groups. In the case of the non-compact symplectic groups, i.e., automorphism groups of vector spaces with symplectic forms, we show that the calculus deformation retracts onto unitary calculus as a corollary of the fact that Weiss calculus only depends on the homotopy type of the groupoid core of the diagram category. In the case of the compact symplectic groups, i.e., automorphism groups of quaternion vector spaces, we provide a comparison with the other known versions of Weiss calculus analogous to the comparisons of calculi of the second named author, and classify certain stably trivial quaternion vector bundles over finite cell complexes in a range, using elementary results on convergence of Weiss calculi.</description>

      <title>Persistent interaction topology in data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological data analysis, as a tool for extracting topological features and characterizing geometric shapes, has experienced significant development across diverse fields. Its key mathematical techniques include persistent homology and the recently developed persistent Laplacians. However, classic mathematical models like simplicial complexes often struggle to provide a localized topological description for interactions or individual elements within a complex system involving a specific set of elements. In this work, we introduce persistent interaction homology and persistent interaction Laplacian that emphasize individual interacting elements in the system. We demonstrate the stability of persistent interaction homology as a persistent module. Furthermore, for a finite discrete set of points in the Euclidean space, we provide the construction of persistent interaction Vietoris-Rips complexes and compute their interaction homology and interaction Laplacians. The proposed methods hold significant promise for analyzing heterogeneously interactive data and emphasizing specific elements in data. Their utility for data science is demonstrated with applications to molecules.</description>

      <title>Quantitative bordism over acyclic groups and Cheeger-Gromov $\rho$-invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a bordism version of Gromov's linearity conjecture over a large family of acyclic groups. Since all groups embed into these acyclic groups, it follows that the linear bordism conjecture is true if one allows to enlarge a given group. Our result holds in both PL and smooth categories, and for both oriented and unoriented cases. The method of the proof hinges on quantitative algebraic and geometric techniques over infinite complexes with unbounded local (combinatorial) geometry, which seem interesting on their own. As an application, we prove that there is a universal linear bound for the Cheeger-Gromov $L^2$ $\rho$-invariants of PL $(4k-1)$-manifolds associated with arbitrary regular covers.</description>

      <title>Projected distances for multi-parameter persistence modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relying on sheaf theory, we introduce the notions of projected barcodes and projected distances for multi-parameter persistence modules. Projected barcodes are defined as derived pushforward of persistence modules onto $\mathbb{R}$. Projected distances come in two flavors: the integral sheaf metrics (ISM) and the sliced convolution distances (SCD). We conduct a systematic study of the stability of projected barcodes and show that the fibered barcode is a particular instance of projected barcodes. We prove that the ISM and the SCD provide lower bounds for the convolution distance. Furthermore, we show that the $\gamma$-linear ISM and the $\gamma$-linear SCD which are projected distances tailored for $\gamma$-sheaves can be computed using TDA software dedicated to one-parameter persistence modules. Moreover, the time and memory complexity required to compute these two metrics are advantageous since our approach does not require computing nor storing an entire $n$-persistence module.</description>

      <title>Group actions and higher topological complexity of lens spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain an upper bound on the higher topological complexity of the total spaces of fibrations. As an application, we improve the usual dimensional upper bound on higher topological complexity of total spaces of some sphere bundles. We show that this upper bound on the higher topological complexity of the total spaces of fibrations can be improved using the notion of higher subspace topological complexity. We also show that the usual dimensional upper bound on the higher topological complexity of any path-connected space can be improved in the presence of positive dimensional compact Lie group action. We use these results to compute the exact value of higher topological complexity of higher dimensional lens spaces in many cases.</description>

      <title>Formality of Sphere Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formality of orientable sphere bundles over connected compact manifolds. When the base manifold is formal, we prove that the formality of the bundle is equivalent to the vanishing of the Bianchi-Massey tensor introduced by Crowley-Nordstr\"{o}m. As an example, this implies that the unit tangent bundle over a formal manifold can only be formal when the base manifold has vanishing Euler characteristic or a rational cohomology ring generated by one element. When the base manifold is not formal, we give an obstruction to the formality of sphere bundles whose Euler class is reducible.</description>

      <title>The cohomology of the connective spectra for {K}-theory revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stable mod 2 cohomologies of the spectra for connective real and complex K-theories are well known and easy to work with. However, the known bases are in terms of the anti-automorphism of Milnor basis elements. We offer simple bases in terms of admissible sequences of Steenrod operations that come from the Adem relations. In particular, the basis for the complex case is that you don't use any Steenrod operations in degree one or $2^n+1$, $n &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic representations of 3-periodic entanglements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diagrams enable the use of various algebraic and geometric tools for analysing and classifying knots. In this paper we introduce a new diagrammatic representation of triply-periodic entangled structures (TP tangles), which are embeddings of simple curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that are invariant under translations along three non-coplanar axes. As such, these entanglements can be seen as lifts of links in the 3-torus $\mathbb{T}^3 = \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1$, where two non-isotopic links in $\mathbb{T}^3$ may lift to the same TP tangle. We consider the equivalence of TP tangles in $\mathbb{R}^3$ through the use of diagrams representing links in $\mathbb{T}^3$. These diagrams require additional moves beyond the classical Reidemeister moves, which we define and show that they preserve ambient isotopies of links in $\mathbb{T}^3$. The final definition of a tridiagram of a link in $\mathbb{T}^3$ allows us to then consider additional notions of equivalence that encode global isotopies of a TP tangle, such as a change of basis or lattice in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>
