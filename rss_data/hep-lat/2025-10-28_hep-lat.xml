      <title>QCD in strong magnetic fields: fluctuations of conserved charges and EoS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields can profoundly affect the equilibrium properties, characterized by the equation of state and bulk thermodynamics of strongly interacting matter. Although such fields are expected in off-central heavy-ion collisions, directly measuring their experimental imprints remains extremely challenging. To address this, we propose the baryon-electric charge correlations $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and the chemical potential ratio $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$ as magnetic-field-sensitive probes, based on (2+1)-flavor QCD lattice simulations at physical pion masses. Along the transition line, $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and $(\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B})_{\rm LO}$ in Pb-Pb collisions increase by factors of 2.1 and 2.4 at $eB \simeq 8M_\pi^2$, respectively. To bridge theoretical predictions and experimental observations, we construct HRG-based proxies and apply systematic kinematic cuts to emulate STAR and ALICE detector acceptances. Furthermore, we extend this investigation to the QCD equation of state, and examine the leading-order thermodynamic coefficients for strangeness-neutral scenarios up to $eB \simeq 0.8 {\rm GeV}^2 \sim 45 m_{\pi}^2$, revealing intriguing non-monotonic structures.</description>

      <title>Four loop renormalization of 3-quark operators in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We renormalize generalized 3-quark operators that relate to baryon states using the method devised by Kr\"{a}nkl and Manashov at four loops in the MSbar scheme. The anomalous dimensions of the four core operators used to compute nucleon matrix elements are determined and their associated critical exponents are studied in the conformal window using the Banks-Zaks expansion.</description>

      <title>Pinched geometries in $\mathbf{2}$D Lorentzian quantum Regge calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate pinched geometries in a two-dimensional Lorentzian model of quantum Regge calculus (QRC) using the tensor renormalization group (TRG) method. A pinched geometry refers to a configuration with an infinitely long temporal extent, even when the total spacetime area is fixed. We examine several choices of integration measures and triangulations to study whether such geometries can dominate in the limit of infinitely many triangles. Our results indicate that pinched geometries are strongly suppressed, and this suppression is observed across different integral measures and triangulations. These results suggest the possible emergence of smooth geometries as well as a sort of universality for infinitely many triangles.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Anomalies of Hamiltonian Staggered Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10862v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the shift (translation) and time reversal symmetries of Hamiltonian staggered fermions and their connection to continuum symmetries concentrating in particular on the case of massless fermions and (3+1) dimensions. We construct operators using the staggered fields that implement these symmetries on finite lattices. We show that shifts composed of an odd multiple of the elementary shift anti-commute with time reversal and are related to continuum axial transformations. We argue that the presence of these non-trivial commutation relations implies the existence of lattice 't Hooft anomalies. From the shifts we also construct a set of conserved, quantized charges that generate continuous symmetries of the lattice theory. In general these do not commute with the vector charge signaling further 't Hooft anomalies.</description>

      <title>Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10601v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and enhance it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared, going substantially beyond the previously discovered spectral equivalence. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this enhanced infrared equivalence.</description>

      <title>On the validity of the complex Langevin method near the deconfining phase transition in QCD at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous paper [JHEP 10 (2020) 144], we found that the complex Langevin (CL) method works for QCD at finite density on the $16^3 \times 32$ lattice in the low-temperature high-density regime within the range $\mu / T = 1.6 - 9.6$ with $\mu$ and $T$ being the quark chemical potential and the temperature, which enabled us to see a clear trend towards the formation of the Fermi sphere. Here we investigate the validity of the CL method on the $24^3 \times 12$ lattice in the deconfined phase near the deconfinement phase transition. As before, we use four-flavor staggered fermions and judge the validity using the criterion based on the probability distribution of the drift term. The spatial extent is $L = (1.3 - 2.7 {\rm ~fm} )&gt; \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1} \sim 1{\rm ~fm}$, in contrast to our previous study with $L &lt; \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1}$. We find that the CL method works in a broad region up to $\mu / T = 4.8$, while it starts to fail as we approach the phase boundary due to the singular drift problem, which can be understood qualitatively by extending the Banks-Casher relation to the case at finite density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a $U(1)\otimes U(1)$ system coupled to scalar fields. Initially the model is studied in a novel continuum formulation and study of the appropriate diagonalizations is performed. Three models are examined, in two of which the scalar field couples with both gauge fields while in the third one the scalar field couples only to the dark photon. The model is then treated on a space-time lattice. We determine the phase diagram for various values of the kinetic coupling parameter. Then there follows the determination of masses for the scalar fields and the massive gauge fields, as well as the fine structure constants for the massless gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Construction of general $N$-body lattice operators with arbitrary momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic method for constructing lattice QCD operators for systems of an arbitrary number of particles with arbitrary momentum, spin, and internal quantum numbers. Explicit constructions are provided for one-, two-, three-, and four-hadron operators, covering all irreducible representations of the relevant lattice symmetry groups in both rest and moving frames. The construction procedure has been implemented in the open-source package \texttt{OpTion} (Operator construcTion), available at https://github.com/wittscien/OpTion. The paper and the package are designed to serve as a practical and extensible dictionary for future lattice QCD studies, as lattice calculations advance towards increasingly complex hadronic systems.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions V: complex $\phi^4$ field model in $3+1$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Ref.~\cite{Guo:2024zal} and associated studies, a relativistic finite-volume formalism in $1+1$ dimensions is proposed to extract infinite-volume scattering phaseshift.
  It is based on the difference of integrated correlation functions (ICF) rather than energy spectrum in the finite volume, and can be regarded as complementary to the well-known L\"{uscher} formalism.
  In the present work, the formalism is further extended into $3+1$ dimensional spacetime. The aim is to explore and demonstrate the challenges in applying the formalism to more practical settings. Specifically, Monte Carlo simulations of a complex $\phi^4$ relativistic field model are carried out in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions on lattices of varying sizes, and phaseshifts for the contact interaction are extracted from the formalism using modest computing resources.</description>

      <title>Chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa criticality: honeycomb vs. SLAC fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model at half filling with a single Dirac cone close to the critical point, which separates a Dirac semi-metal from an antiferromagnetically ordered phase where SU(2) spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken. We discuss the implementation of a single Dirac cone in the SLAC formulation for eight Dirac components and the influence of dynamically induced long-range super-exchange interactions. The finite size behavior of dimensionless ratios and the finite size scaling properties of the Hubbard model with a single Dirac cone are shown to be superior compared to the honeycomb lattice. We extract the critical exponent believed to belong to the chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa universality class: The critical exponent ${\nu = 1.02(3)}$ coincides for the two lattice types once honeycomb lattices of linear dimension ${L\ge 15}$ are considered. In contrast to the SLAC formulation, where the anomalous dimensions are estimated to be ${\eta_{\phi}=0.73(1)}$ and ${\eta_{\psi}=0.09(1)}$, they remain less stable on honeycomb lattices, but tend towards the estimates from the SLAC formulation.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a established relation in Refs.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal,Guo:2024pvt} that relates the integrated correlation functions for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral, we propose to extract the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through quantum simulation of the integrated correlation functions of trapped two-particle systems on quantum computers. The integrated correlation function can be computed by an ancilla-based algorithm proposed in Ref.~\cite{PhysRevA.64.022319}. The proposal is demonstrated with a simple contact interaction fermion model.</description>
