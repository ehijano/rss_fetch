      <title>Informational Size in School Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel measurement of informational size to school choice problems, which inherits its ideas from Mount and Reiter (1974). This concept measures a matching mechanism's information size by counting the maximal relevant preference and priority rankings to secure a certain pairwise assignment of a student to a school across all possible matching problems. Our analysis uncovers two key insights. First, the three prominent strategy-proof matching mechanisms, the deferred acceptance (DA) mechanism, the top trading cycles (TTC) mechanism, and the serial dictatorship (SD) mechanism, is (strictly) less informative than the non-strategy-proof immediate acceptance (IA) mechanism. This result highlights a previously omitted advantage of IA in term of its information demand, which partially explain the its popularity in real-world matching problems especially when acquiring information is both pecuniarily and cognitively costly. Second, when the matching problem contains at least four students, the TTC demands less information compared to the DA to implement a desired allocation. The issue of comparison between TTC and DA has puzzled researchers both in theory (Gonczarowski and Thomas, 2023) and in experiment (Hakimov and Kubler, 2021). Our result responds to this issue from an informational perspective: in experiments with relatively fewer students, agents tend to prefer DA over TTC as DA requires fewer information to secure one's allocation in all problems (Guillen and Veszteg, 2021), while the opposite is true when the market size increases (Pais et al., 2011). Among others, our informational size concept offers a new perspective to understand the differences in auditability (Grigoryan and Moller, 2024), manipulation vulnerability (Pathak and Sonmez, 2013), and privacy protection (Haupt and Hitzig, 2022), among some commonly used matching mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Continuous Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an extension of the classical model of DeGroot (1974) to a continuum of agents when they interact among them according to a DiKernel $W$. We show that, under some regularity assumptions, the continuous model is the limit case of the discrete one. We provide some applications of this result. First, we establish a canonical way to reduce the dimensionality of matrices by comparing matrices of different dimensions in the space of DiKernels. Then, we develop a model of Lobby Competition where two lobbies compete to bias the opinion of a continuum of agents. We give sufficient conditions for the existence of a Nash Equilibrium. Furthermore, we establish the conditions under which a Nash Equilibrium of the game induce an $\varepsilon$-Nash Equilibrium of the discretization of the game. Finally, we put forward some elements for the characterization of equilibrium strategies.</description>

      <title>New Solution based on Hodge Decomposition for Abstract Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.14539v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes Hodge Potential Choice (HPC), a new solution for abstract games with irreflexive dominance relations. This solution is formulated by involving geometric tools like differential forms and Hodge decomposition onto abstract games. We provide a workable algorithm for the proposed solution with a new data structure of abstract games. From the view of gaming, HPC overcomes several weaknesses of conventional solutions. HPC coincides with Copeland Choice in complete cases and can be extended to slove games with marginal strengths. It will be proven that the Hodge potential choice possesses three prevalent axiomatic properties: neutrality, strong monotonicity, dominance cycle s reversing independence, and sensitivity to mutual dominance. To compare the HPC with Copeland Choice in large samples of games, we design digital experiments with randomly generated abstract games with different sizes and completeness. The experimental results present the advantage of HPC in the statistical sense.</description>

      <title>Fair Division with Bounded Sharing: Binary and Non-Degenerate Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.00459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of objects is to be divided fairly among agents with different tastes, modeled by additive utility-functions. An agent is allowed to share a bounded number of objects between two or more agents in order to attain fairness.
  The paper studies various notions of fairness, such as proportionality, envy-freeness, equitability, and consensus. We analyze the run-time complexity of finding a fair allocation with a given number of sharings under several restrictions on the agents' valuations, such as: binary generalized-binary and non-degenerate.</description>
