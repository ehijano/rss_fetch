      <title>The cool brown dwarf Gliese 229 B is a close binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to their similarities with giant exoplanets, brown dwarf companions of stars provide insights into the fundamental processes of planet formation and evolution. From their orbits, several brown dwarf companions are found to be more massive than theoretical predictions given their luminosities and the ages of their host stars (e.g. Brandt et al. 2021, Cheetham et al. 2018, Li et al. 2023). Either the theory is incomplete or these objects are not single entities. For example, they could be two brown dwarfs each with a lower mass and intrinsic luminosity (Brandt et al. 2021, Howe et al. 2024). The most problematic example is Gliese 229 B (Nakajima et al. 1995, Oppenheimer et al. 1995), which is at least 2-6 times less luminous than model predictions given its dynamical mass of $71.4\pm0.6$ Jupiter masses ($M_{\rm Jup}$) (Brandt et al. 2021). We observed Gliese 229 B with the GRAVITY interferometer and, separately, the CRIRES+ spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. Both sets of observations independently resolve Gliese 229 B into two components, Gliese 229 Ba and Bb, settling the conflict between theory and observations. The two objects have a flux ratio of $0.47\pm0.03$ at a wavelength of 2 $\mu$m and masses of $38.1\pm1.0$ and $34.4\pm1.5$ $M_{\rm Jup}$, respectively. They orbit each other every 12.1 days with a semimajor axis of 0.042 astronomical units (AU). The discovery of Gliese 229 BaBb, each only a few times more massive than the most massive planets, and separated by 16 times the Earth-moon distance, raises new questions about the formation and prevalence of tight binary brown dwarfs around stars.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Binarity of Gliese 229B, and Constraints on the System's Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two epochs of radial velocities of the first imaged T dwarf Gliese 229B obtained with Keck/NIRSPEC. The two radial velocities are discrepant with one another, and with the radial velocity of the host star, at $\approx$$11\sigma$ significance. This points to the existence of a previously postulated, but as-yet undetected, massive companion to Gl 229B; we denote the two components as Gl 229Ba and Gl 229Bb. We compute the joint likelihood of the radial velocities to constrain the period and mass of the secondary companion. Our radial velocities are consistent with an orbital period between a few days and $\approx$60 days, and a secondary mass of at least $\approx$15\,$M_{\rm Jup}$ and up to nearly half the total system mass of Gl 229B. With a significant fraction of the system mass in a faint companion, the strong tension between Gl 229B's dynamical mass and the predictions of evolutionary models is resolved.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a 25 parsec-long precessing jet emanating from the old nova GK Persei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical nova eruptions result from thermonuclear-powered runaways in, and ejection of, the hydrogen-rich envelopes of white dwarf stars accreted from their close binary companions. Novae brighten to up to 1,000,000 solar luminosities, and recur thousands of times over their lifetimes spanning several billion years. Between eruptions, mass transfer from the donor star to the white dwarf proceeds via an accretion disk unless the white dwarf possesses a strong magnetic field which can partially or totally disrupt the disk. In that case, accretion is focussed by the white dwarf's magnetic field towards its magnetic poles. Optical spectroscopy and interferometric radio maps demonstrate the presence of bipolar jets, typically arcsec in angular size, and orders of magnitude smaller than one parsec in linear size, during the days to months after nova eruptions. These jets expel collimated matter from the white dwarfs in nova binary stars, but well-resolved images of them are lacking. Here we report the Condor telescope's detection of a hitherto unknown, highly resolved and braided jet, three degrees (at least 25 parsecs) in length. The jet originates at the white dwarf of the old nova GK Persei (nova Per 1901 CE). It precesses on a ~ 3600 yr timescale, and must be at least 7200 years old. Detected across four decades of wavelength, the jet's ultimate energy source is likely the strong accretion shocks near the white dwarf's magnetic poles.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Eruption and Shrinkage of Pre-existing Flare Loops during a Subsequent Solar Eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated two consecutive solar eruption events in the solar active region (AR) 12994 at the solar eastern limb on 2022 April 15. We found that the flare loops formed by the first eruption were involved in the second eruption. During the initial stage of the second flare, the middle part of these flare loops (E-loops) erupted outward along with the flux ropes below, while the parts of the flare loops (I-loops1 and I-loops2) on either side of the E-loops first rose and then contracted. Approximately 1 hour after the eruption, the heights of I-loops1 and I-loops2 decreased by 9 Mm and 45 Mm, respectively, compared to before the eruption. Their maximum descent velocities were 30 km/s and 130 km/s, respectively. The differential emission measure (DEM) results indicate that the plasma above I-loops1 and I-loops2 began to be heated about 23 minutes and 44 minutes after the start of the second flare, respectively. Within 20 minutes, the plasma temperature in these regions increased from ~3 MK to 6 MK. We proposed an adiabatic heating mechanism that magnetic energy would be converted into thermal and kinetic energy when the pre-stretched loops contract. Our calculations show that the magnetic energy required to heat the two high-temperature regions are 10^29-10^30 erg, which correspond to a loss of field strength of 2-3 G.</description>

      <title>Nearby Supernova and Cloud Crossing Effects on the Orbits of Small Bodies in the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova blasts envelop many surrounding stellar systems, transferring kinetic energy to small bodies in the systems. Geologic evidence from $^{60}\rm Fe$ points to recent nearby supernova activity within the past several Myr. Here, we model the transfer of energy and resulting orbital changes from these supernova blasts to the Oort Cloud, the Kuiper belt, and Saturn's Phoebe ring. For the Oort Cloud, an impulse approximation shows that a 50 pc supernova can eject approximately half of all objects less than 1 cm while altering the trajectories of larger ones, depending on their orbital parameters. For stars closest to supernovae, objects up to $\sim$100 m can be ejected. Turning to the explored solar system, we find that supernovae closer than 50 pc may affect Saturn's Phoebe ring and can sweep away Kuiper belt dust. It is also possible that the passage of the solar system through a dense interstellar cloud could have a similar effect; a numerical trajectory simulation shows that the location of the dust grains and the direction of the wind (from a supernova or interstellar cloud) has a significant impact on whether or not the grains will become unbound from their orbit in the Kuiper belt. Overall, nearby supernovae sweep micron-sized dust from the solar system, though whether the grains are ultimately cast towards the Sun or altogether ejected depends on various factors. Evidence of supernova-modified dust grain trajectories may be observed by New Horizons, though further modeling efforts are required.</description>

      <title>Hot Star Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties, impact, and fate of hot stars cannot be understood without considering their winds. Revealed to be an almost ubiquitous phenomenon in the regime of massive stars, the winds of hot stars arise from a complex physical mechanism that still provides a major challenge for our understanding of massive stars. Different flavours of hot stars vary significantly in their winds with current evolution models still having problems to connect the zoo of observed phenomena. Moreover, the driving of hot star winds is inherently connected to the opacities arising from spectral line transitions, making the properties and strength of the winds strongly dependent on metallicity and changing them over cosmic time.
  In these proceedings, the current status in our understanding of hot star winds is briefly reviewed and recent progress in our perception of hot star winds and the consequences for the evolution of massive stars are presented. A particular emphasis is given on current efforts with hydrodynamically-consistent atmosphere models towards a better description of radiatively-driven mass loss of Wolf-Rayet stars with remaining hydrogen envelopes.</description>

      <title>Production of Lithium and Heavy Elements in AGB Stars Experiencing PIEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can experience proton ingestion events (PIEs), leading to a rich nucleosynthesis. During a PIE, the intermediate neutron capture process (i-process) develops, leading to the production of trans-iron elements. It is also suggested that lithium is produced during these events. We investigate the production of lithium and trans-iron elements in AGB stars experiencing a PIE with $1&lt;M_{\rm ini}/M_{\odot}&lt; 3$ and $-3&lt; \mathrm{[Fe/H]} &lt;0$. We find that lithium is produced in all PIE models with surface abundances $3&lt;$ A(Li) $&lt;5$. The surface enrichment and overall AGB lithium yield increases with decreasing stellar mass. The lithium enrichment is accompanied by a production of $^{13}$C with $3&lt;^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$&lt;9$ at the surface just after the PIE. AGB stars experiencing PIE may be related to J-type carbon stars whose main features are excesses of lithium and $^{13}$C. In addition to Li and $^{13}$C, heavy elements (e.g., Sr, Ba, Eu, Pb) are significantly produced in low-metallicity stars up to [Fe/H]$\simeq-1$. The yields of our models are publicly available. Additionally, of interest to the Li nucleosynthesis, we provide an updated fitting formula for the $^{7}$Be($e^-,\nu_e$)$^{7}$Li electron capture rate.</description>

      <title>Photometric detection of internal gravity waves in upper main-sequence stars. IV. Comparable SLF variability in SMC, LMC and Galactic massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive main-sequence stars have convective cores and radiative envelopes, and sub-surface convection zones. However, their properties strongly depend on a star's opacity and metallicity. Non-rotating 1D evolution models of main-sequence stars between $7 \leq M \leq 40$ M$_{\odot}$ and metallicity of the SMC suggest tenuous sub-surface convection zones when using the Rayleigh number as a criterion for convection. We test if massive stars of different metallicities inside and outside of stability windows for sub-surface convection exhibit similar properties in their observed SLF variability. We extract customised light curves from the ongoing TESS mission for a sample of massive stars using an effective point spread function (ePSF) method, and compare them using a Gaussian process (GP) regression methodology. We demonstrate that the properties of SLF variability observed in time-series photometry of massive stars are consistent across the metallicity range from the Milky Way down to the SMC galaxy, for stars both inside and outside of the sub-surface stability windows. We conclude that non-rotating 1D stellar structure models of sub-surface convection cannot alone be used to explain the mechanism giving rise to SLF variability in light curves of massive stars. Additionally, the similar properties of SLF variability across a large range in metallicity, which follow the same trends in mass and age in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram at both high and low metallicity, support a transition in the dominant mechanism causing SLF variability from younger to more evolved stars. Specifically, core-excited internal gravity waves (IGWs) are more favourable for younger stars that lack substantial sub-surface convection zones, especially at low-metallicity, and sub-surface convection zones are more favourable for the most massive and evolved stars.

      <title>The Nature of a Recently Discovered Wolf-Rayet Binary: Archetype of Stripping?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LMCe055-1 was recently discovered in a survey for WRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and classified as a WN4/O4, a lower excitation version of the WN3/O3 class discovered as part of the same survey. Its absolute magnitude precluded it from being a WN4+O4 binary. OGLE photometry show shallow primary and secondary eclipses with a 2.2 day period. The spectral characteristics and short period pointed to a possible origin due to binary stripping. Such stripped WR binaries should be common but have proven elusive to identify conclusively. In order to establish its nature, we obtained HST UV and Magellan optical spectra, along with imaging. Our work shows that the WR emission and He II absorption arise in one star, and the He I absorption in another. The He I contributor is the primary of the 2.2-day system and exhibits ~300 km/sed radial velocity variations on that time scale. However, the WR star shows 30-40 km/sed radial velocity variations, with a likely 35-day period and a highly eccentric orbit. Possibly LMCe055-1 is a physical triple, but that would require the 2.2-day pair to have been captured by the WR star. A more likely explanation is that the WR star has an unseen companion in a 35-day orbit and that the 2.2-day pair is in a longer period orbit about the two. Such examples of multiple systems are well known among massive stars, such as HD 5980. Regardless, we argue that it is highly unlikely that the WR component of the LMCe055-1 system resulted from stripping.</description>

      <title>Phoebus: Performance Portable GRRMHD for Relativistic Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09146v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the open source code PHOEBUS (phifty one ergs blows up a star) for astrophysical general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations. PHOEBUS is designed for, but not limited to, high energy astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron star mergers, black-hole accretion disks, and similar phenomena. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamics are modeled in the Valencia formulation with conservative finite volume methods. Neutrino radiation transport is included with Monte Carlo and moment methods. PHOEBUS is built on the PARTHENON (Grete et al. 2022) performance portable adaptive mesh refinement framework, uses a GPU first development strategy, and is capable of modeling a large dynamic range in space and time. PHOEBUS utilizes KOKKOS for on-node parallelism and supports both CPU and GPU architectures. We describe the physical model employed in PHOEBUS, the numerical methods used, and demonstrate a suite of test problems to showcase its abilities. We demonstrate weak scaling to over 500 H100 GPUs.</description>

      <title>ALMA detection of Masers and Dasars in the Hydrogen Recombination Lines of the Planetary Nebula Mz3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrogen recombination lines H30$\alpha$, H40$\alpha$, H42$\alpha$, H50$\beta$ and H57$\gamma$ and the underlying bremsstrahlung continuum emission were detected with ALMA in the bipolar nebula Mz3. The source was not spatially resolved, but the velocity profile of the H30$\alpha$ line shows clear indication of maser amplification, confirming previous reports of laser amplification in the far infrared H recombination lines observed with Herschel Space Observatory. Comparison between the flux densities of the H50$\beta$, H40$\alpha$ and H42$\alpha$ lines show overcooling, or darkness amplification by stimulated absorption (dasar effect) at the LSR velocity of about $-25$ km s$^{-1}$, which constrains the density of the absorbing region to about 10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$. The H30$\alpha$ line, on the other hand, presents maser lines at LSR velocities of $-69$ and $-98$ km s$^{-1}$, which indicates ionized gas with densities close to 10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$. Although the source of emission was not resolved, it was possible to find the central position of the images for each velocity interval, which resulted in a well defined position-velocity distribution.</description>

Abstract: Chemical evidence indicates that an appreciable fraction of Sun-like stars have engulfed rocky planets during their main-sequence lifetimes. We investigate whether the tidal evolution and destruction of ultra-short-period planets (USPs) can explain this phenomenon. We develop a simple parameterized model for the formation and engulfment of USPs in a population of MS stars. With this model, it is possible to reproduce both the observed occurrence rate of USPs and the frequency of planet-engulfing Sun-like stars for a reasonable range of USP formation rates and tidal decay lifetimes. Our results support a theory of USP formation through gradual inward migration over many Gyr and suggest that engulfment occurs $\sim 0.1$-$1 \, {\rm Gyr}$ after formation. This lifetime is set by tidal dissipation in the USP itself instead of the host star, due to the perturbing influence of external companions. If USP engulfment is the main source of pollution among Sun-like stars, we predict a correlation between pollution and compact multi-planet systems; some $5$-$10\%$ of polluted stars should have a transiting planet of mass $\gtrsim 5 M_{\oplus}$ and period $\sim 4$-$12$ days.</description>

      <title>SCExAO/CHARIS Near-Infrared Scattered-Light Imaging and Integral Field Spectropolarimetry of the AB Aurigae Protoplanetary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze near-infrared integral field spectropolarimetry of the AB Aurigae protoplanetary disk and protoplanet (AB Aur b), obtained with SCExAO/CHARIS in 22 wavelength channels covering the J, H, and K passbands ($\lambda_{\rm o}$ = 1.1--2.4 $\mu m$) over angular separations of $\rho$ $\approx$ 0.13" to 1.1" ($\sim$20--175 au). Our images resolve spiral structures in the disk in each CHARIS channel. At the longest wavelengths, the data may reveal an extension of the western spiral seen in previous polarimetric data at $\rho$ $&lt;$ 0.3" out to larger distances clockwise from the protoplanet AB Aur b, coincident with the ALMA-detected $CO$ gas spiral. While AB Aur b is detectable in complementary total intensity data, it is a non-detection in polarized light at $\lambda$ $&gt;$ 1.3 $\mu $m. While the observed disk color is extremely red across $JHK$, the disk has a blue intrinsic scattering color consistent with small dust grains. The disk's polarization spectrum is redder than AB Aur b's total intensity spectrum. The polarization fraction peaks at $\sim$ 0.6 along the major disk axis. Radiative transfer modeling of the CHARIS data shows that small, porous dust grains with a porosity of $p$ = 0.6--0.8 better reproduce the scattered-light appearance of the disk than more compact spheres ($p$ = 0.3), especially the polarization fraction. This work demonstrates the utility of integral field spectropolarimetry to characterize structures in protoplanetary disks and elucidate the properties of the disks' dust.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic neutrinos and the question of Dirac vs. Majorana neutrino nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding out if neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles is known to be extremely difficult. This is generally believed to be due to the smallness of the neutrino mass compared to typical neutrino energies, and to the fact that in the limit of vanishing mass all distinctions between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos disappear. This, however, does not necessarily mean that for non-relativistic neutrinos distinguishing between them is an easy task. We consider this problem in detail. The issues discussed include the possibilities of studying neutrino nature with non-relativistic neutrinos produced in $\beta$ decay in direct neutrino mass measurement experiments and with relic neutrinos, as well as with slow neutrinos in pair production processes and in scattering, both elastic and inelastic. We also discuss processes allowed for only one of the two neutrino types as a means of uncovering neutrino nature.</description>

      <title>The $R$-process Alliance: Enrichment of $R$-process Elements in a Simulated Milky Way-like Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of stars with varying amounts of heavy elements synthesized by the rapid neutron-capture process ($r$-process) based on our detailed cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy with an $N$-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, ASURA. Most stars with no overabundance in $r$-process elements, as well as the strongly $r$-process enhanced $r$-II stars ([Eu/Fe] $&gt;+0.7$), are formed in dwarf galaxies accreted by the Milky Way within the 6 Gyr after the Big Bang. In contrast, over half of the moderately enhanced $r$-I stars ($+0.3 &lt;$ [Eu/Fe] $\leq +0.7$) are formed in the main in-situ disk after 6 Gyr. Our results suggest that the fraction of $r$-I and $r$-II stars formed in disrupted dwarf galaxies is larger the higher their [Eu/Fe] is. Accordingly, the most strongly enhanced $r$-III stars ([Eu/Fe] $&gt; +2.0$) are formed in accreted components. These results suggest that non-$r$-process-enhanced stars and $r$-II stars are mainly formed in low-mass dwarf galaxies that hosted either none or a single neutron star merger, while the $r$-I stars tend to form in the well-mixed in-situ disk. We compare our findings with high-resolution spectroscopic observations of $r$-process-enhanced metal-poor stars in the halo and dwarf galaxies, including those collected by the R-Process Alliance. We conclude that observed [Eu/Fe] and [Eu/Mg] ratios can be employed in chemical tagging of the Milky Way's accretion history.</description>

      <title>Ultra Long Period Cepheids as standard candles from Gaia to Rubin-LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analysis of the Ultra Long Period Cepheids (ULPs) properties could significantly contribute to understanding the Hubble constant tension, e.g. the current discrepancy between determinations based on local distance indicators and those relying on cosmic microwave background measurements. These highly luminous variables are observable beyond 100 Mpc, so if they were confirmed to behave as standard candles, they would allow us a direct measurement of cosmological distances without any secondary distance indicator, thus reducing potential systematic errors in the calibration of the cosmic distance scale. This paper presents an analysis of the largest known sample of 73 ULPs, including 15 objects in nearby galaxies, with new accurate and homogeneous photometry obtained by Gaia DR3, and a new object, in our Galaxy, identified as Long Period Variable in Gaia DR3, but recently reclassified as ULP. The obtained results suggest that, by improving photometric accuracy, the ULP Period-Wesenheit relation shows a smaller dispersion than that obtained in literature and is in better agreement with the Classical Cepheid (CC) one, supporting the hypothesis that ULPs are the extension of the CCs at higher period, mass and luminosity. However, to reach this aim, it is necessary to enrich the sample with high-quality data. The Rubin-LSST survey offers the possibility to achieve this thanks to its photometric characteristics and time extension. In particular, we will explore the capabilities of the Rubin-LSST survey to recover ULP theoretical light-curves by using a new tool called PulsationStarRecovery, built by our group for this type of analysis.</description>

      <title>Global Simulations of Gravitational Instability in Protostellar Disks with Full Radiation Transport. I. Stochastic Fragmentation with Optical-depth-dependent Rate and Universal Fragment Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fragmentation in a gravitationally unstable accretion disk can be an important pathway for forming stellar/planetary companions. To characterize quantitatively the condition for and outcome of fragmentation under realistic thermodynamics, we perform global 3D simulations of gravitationally unstable disks at various cooling rates and cooling types, including the first global simulations of gravitational instability that employ full radiation transport. We find that fragmentation is a stochastic process, with the fragment generation rate per disk area $p_{\rm frag}$ showing an exponential dependence on the parameter $\beta\equiv\Omega_K t_{cool}$, where $\Omega_K$ is the Keplerian rotation frequency and $t_{cool}$ is the average cooling timescale. Compared to a prescribed constant $\beta$, radiative cooling in the optically thin/thick regime makes $p_{\rm frag}$ decrease slower/faster in $\beta$; the critical $\beta$ corresponding to $\sim 1$ fragment per orbit is $\approx$3, 5, 2 for constant $\beta$, optically thin, and optically thick cooling, respectively. The distribution function of the initial fragment mass is remarkably insensitive to disk thermodynamics. Regardless of cooling rate and optical depth, the typical initial fragment mass is $m_{frag} \approx 40 M_{tot}h^3$, with $M_{tot}$ being the total (star+disk) mass and $h=H/R$ being the disk aspect ratio. Applying this result to typical Class 0/I protostellar disks, we find $m_{frag}\sim 20 M_J$, suggesting that fragmentation more likely forms brown dwarfs. Given the finite width of the $m_{frag}$ distribution, forming massive planets is also possible.</description>

      <title>The GALAH Survey: Stellar parameters and abundances for 800,000 Gaia RVS spectra using GALAH DR4 and The Cannon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysing stellar parameters and abundances from nearly one million Gaia DR3 Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) spectra poses challenges due to the limited spectral coverage (restricted to the infrared Ca II triplet) and variable signal-to-noise ratios of the data. To address this, we use The Cannon, a data-driven method, to transfer stellar parameters and abundances from the GALAH Data Release 4 (DR4; R ~ 28,000) catalogue to the lower resolution Gaia DR3 RVS spectra (R ~ 11,500). Our model, trained on 14,484 common targets, predicts parameters such as Teff, log g, and [Fe/H], along with several other elements across approximately 800,000 Gaia RVS spectra. We utilise stars from open and globular clusters present in the Gaia RVS catalogue to validate our predicted mean [Fe/H] with high precision (~0.02-0.10 dex). Additionally, we recover the bimodal distribution of [Ti/Fe] versus [Fe/H], reflecting the high and low alpha-components of Milky Way disk stars, demonstrating The Cannon's capability for accurate stellar abundance determination from medium-resolution Gaia RVS spectra. The methodologies and resultant catalogue presented in this work highlight the remarkable potential of the RVS dataset, which by the end of the Gaia mission will comprise spectra of over 200 million stars.</description>

      <title>Give to Ursa Minor what is Ursa Minor's: an updated census of the RR Lyrae population in the Ursa Minor dwarf galaxy based on Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use RR Lyrae stars identified by the Gaia third data release (DR3) to explore the outskirts of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) and update the census of its variable star population. We adopted different tools based on the Gaia DR3 astrometric and photometric data (proper motions, Period-Wesenheit-Metallicity relations, spatial distribution, colour-magnitude diagram and stellar isochrone fitting) to discriminate between different types of variable stars, and to identify UMi members. We find a total of 129 RR Lyrae stars and Anomalous Cepheids (ACs) that belong to UMi. We report 47 new RR Lyrae stars (46 bona fide and 1 candidate) and 5 new ACs (4 bona fide and 1 candidate), including new possible members in the extreme periphery of the galaxy at a distance of $\sim$ 12 half-light radii. We reclassified 13 RR Lyrae stars identified by the Gaia DR3 Specific Object Study pipeline for Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars (SOS Cep$\&amp;$RRL), using data from the literature and Gaia astrometry and photometry. Specifically, we assigned these 13 DR3 RR Lyrae stars to 10 Anomalous Cepheids and 3 double-mode RR Lyrae (RRd), respectively. From the average luminosity of the RR Lyrae stars we derive for UMi a distance modulus of $(m-M)_{0}=$ 19.23 $\pm$ 0.09 mag in excellent agreement with the literature. Finally, we investigated whether some of UMi's variable stars might be members of the ultra-faint stellar cluster Mu{\~n}oz~1, that lies at a projected distance of 45 arcmin from UMi's centre. Based on the properties of the variable stars (distances, colours and metallicities), we find unlikely that they belong to the cluster.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian process model for stellar activity in 2-D line profile time-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar active regions like spots and faculae can distort the shapes of spectral lines, inducing variations in the radial velocities that are often orders of magnitude larger than the signals from Earth-like planets. Efforts to mitigate these activity signals have hitherto focused on either the time or the velocity (wavelength) domains. We present a physics-driven Gaussian process (GP) framework to model activity signals directly in time series of line profiles or Cross-Correlation Functions (CCFs). Unlike existing methods which correct activity signals in line profile time series, our approach exploits the time correlation between velocity (wavelength) bins in the line profile variations, and is based on a simplified but physically motivated model for the origin of these variations. When tested on both synthetic and real data sets with signal-to-noise ratios down to $\sim$ 100, our method was able to separate the planetary signal from the activity signal, even when their periods were identical. We also conducted injection/recovery tests using two years of realistically sampled HARPS-N solar data, demonstrating the ability of the method to accurately recover a signal induced by a 1.5-Earth mass planet with a semi-amplitude of 0.3 m/s and a period of 33 days during high solar activity.</description>

      <title>Partial tidal disruption of White Dwarfs in off-equatorial planes around intermediate mass spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a suite of numerical simulations to study partial tidal disruption events (TDEs) of white dwarfs (WDs) in off-equatorial planes in intermediate mass spinning (Kerr) black hole backgrounds. We carry out this analysis for both parabolic and eccentric WD orbits and also take into account possible initial WD spins. Our objective here is to quantify the differences in variables like the mass of the self-bound core, the peak fallback rate of debris and gravitational wave signature in off-equatorial orbits compared to equatorial ones. The analysis is carried out using a hybrid numerical scheme, one which involves integrating the exact Kerr geodesics while adopting a Newtonian formalism for the stellar fluid dynamics, justified by our choice of simulation parameters. We find that the physics of TDEs in off-equatorial orbits present several interesting and novel features due to black hole spin, which in some cases enhances when coupled with the rotation of the WD. However, numerical values of observable quantities in TDEs involving off-equatorial orbits cannot possibly distinguish between such orbits from equatorial ones. We further comment on the genericness of our results and argue that these should extend to a general TDE scenario involving a spinning BH.</description>

Abstract: Solar spicules are plasma jets observed in the interface region between the visible solar surface and the corona. At any given time, there are millions of spicules present all over the Sun. While various models attempt to elucidate their origin and characteristics, here, we consider the one driven by the magneto-convection undulations. The radiative magneto-hydrodynamical (rMHD) equations are solved using PENCIL CODE with a spatial resolution of 16 km using various magnetic field strengths. The obtained rMHD simulation data are investigated to unveil the various trends in spicular properties as function of the applied magnetic fields. The important outcome of this study is the finding of a consistent reduction in both the number density and the maximum height reached by spicules as magnetic field strength increases. We also use parabolic fitting on time-distance curves of spicules that are taller than $75^\mathrm{th}$ percentile in the distribution, in order to find a relation between deceleration of the spicule tip and the magnetic field strength. Our results offer insights into the response of solar spicules to magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Fine Structure of the Age-Chromospheric Activity Relation in Solar-Type Stars: II. H$\alpha$ Line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excess chromospheric emissions within deep photospheric lines are effective proxies of stellar magnetism for FGK stars. This emission decays with stellar age and is a potential determinant of this important stellar quantity. We report absolutely calibrated H$\alpha$ chromospheric fluxes for 511 solar-type stars in a wide interval of precisely determined masses, $[$Fe/H$]$, ages, and evolution states from high S/N, moderately high$-$resolution spectra. The comparison of H$\alpha$ and H+K chromospheric fluxes reveals a metallicity bias (absent from H$\alpha$) affecting Ca II H+K fluxes thereby metal-rich stars with deep line profiles mimic low chromospheric flux levels, and vice versa for metal-poor stars. This bias blurs the age-activity relation, precluding age determinations for old, inactive stars unless mass and $[$Fe/H$]$ are calibrated into the relation. The H+K lines being the most widely studied tool to quantify magnetic activity in FGK stars, care should be exercised in its use whenever wide ranges of mass and $[$Fe/H$]$ are involved. The H$\alpha$ age-activity-mass-metallicity calibration appears to be in line with the theoretical expectation that (other parameters being equal) more massive stars possess narrower convective zones and are less active than less massive stars, while more metal-rich stars have deeper convective zones and appear more active than metal-poorer stars. If regarded statistically in tandem with other age diagnostics, H$\alpha$ chromospheric fluxes may be suitable to constrain ages for FGK stars with acceptable precision.</description>

Abstract: The accurate flux calibration of observational data is vital for astrophysics and cosmology because absolute flux uncertainties of stellar standards propagate into scientific results. With the ever higher precision achieved by telescopic missions (e.g. JWST) in the infrared (IR), suitable calibrators are required for this regime. The basis of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) flux scale is defined by model fits of three hot (Teff &gt; 30000 K) hydrogen-atmosphere (DA) white dwarfs, which achieve an accuracy better than 1 per cent at optical wavelengths but falls below this level in the IR range. We present a network of 17 cooler DA white dwarfs with Teff &lt; 20000 K as spectrophotometric flux standards that are equally, if not more, accurate at IR wavelengths. Cooler white dwarfs do not suffer from non-local thermal equilibrium (NLTE) effects in continuum flux or from UV metal line blanketing, have a larger sky density, are generally closer to Earth with little or negligible interstellar reddening, and have energy distributions peaking in the optical or near-IR. Using the latest grid of DA LTE atmosphere models with three-dimensional (3D) convection, the observed Space Telescope Imaging Spectrometer (STIS) and Wide Field Camera three (WFC3) fluxes of our network are accurate to 3 per cent over most of the range 1450 - 16000 AA, with a median standard deviation of 1.41 per cent. Fitting the HST STIS and WFC3 white dwarf SEDs and Balmer lines independently yields SEDs that agree within 3$\sigma$, which demonstrates the precision of the models for our network.</description>

      <title>Proton ingestion in asymptotic giant branch stars as a possible explanation for J-type stars and AB2 grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: J-type stars are a subclass of carbon stars that are generally Li-rich, not enriched in s-elements, and have low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios. They were suggested to be the manufacturers of the pre-solar grains of type AB2 (having low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and supersolar $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N). In this Letter, we investigate the possibility that J-type stars are early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that experienced a proton ingestion event (PIE). We used the stellar evolution code STAREVOL to compute AGB stellar models with initial masses of 1, 2, and 3 $M_{\odot}$ and metallicities [Fe/H] $= -0.5$ and 0.0. We included overshooting above the thermal pulse and used a network of 1160 nuclei coupled to the transport equations. In solar-metallicity AGB stars, PIEs can be triggered if a sufficiently high overshoot is considered. These events lead to low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios, high Li abundances, and no enrichment in s-elements. We find that the $2-3$ $M_{\odot}$ AGB models experiencing a PIE can account for most of the observational features of J-type stars and AB2 grains. The remaining tensions between models and observations are (1) the low $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio of some AB2 grains and of 2 out of 13 J-type stars, (2) the high $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al of some AB2 grains, and (3) the J-type stars with A(Li) $&lt;2$. Extra mixing mechanisms can alleviate some of these tensions, such as thermohaline or rotation. This work highlights a possible match between AGB stellar models that undergo a PIE and J-type stars and AB2 grains. To account for other types of carbon stars, such as N-type stars, PIEs should only develop in a fraction of solar-metallicity AGB stars. Additional work is needed to assess how the occurrence of PIEs depends on mixing parameters and initial conditions, and therefore to further confirm or exclude the proposed scenario.</description>

      <title>History of the Observation of Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are about 6000 stars, that can be seen with the naked eye and have been observed for centuries for various purposes. More modern investigations using advanced telescopes show that our Milky Way, a quite common galaxy, consists of about 100 -- 400 billion stars. And, it is estimated that there are between 200 billion to 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe -- all of them consist mostly of stars, and sending observable signals which also represents nothing more than a superposition of the light of individual stars. So we can conclude that the most common observable objects in the Universe are $\textit{stars}$.
  In this chapter, we focus on the long history of the observation of stars (compared to studies in other fields of science) to find out more about the nature of these objects.</description>

      <title>Whispering in the dark: Faint X-ray emission from black holes with OB star companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08596v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Recent astrometric and spectroscopic surveys of OB stars have revealed a few stellar-mass black holes (BHs) with orbital periods as low as 10 days. No X-ray counterpart has been detected, due to the absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk around the BH. Yet, dissipative processes in the hot, dilute and strongly magnetized plasma around the BH (so-called BH corona) can still lead to non-thermal X-ray emission (e.g. synchrotron).
  Aims. We determine the X-ray luminosity distribution from BH+OB star binaries up to orbital periods of a few thousand days.
  Methods. We use detailed binary evolution models computed with MESA for initial primary masses of 10-90 $M_{\odot}$ and orbital periods from 1-3000 d. The X-ray luminosity is computed for a broad range of radiative efficiencies.
  Results. We show that particle acceleration through magnetic reconnection can heat the BH corona. A substantial fraction of the gravitational potential energy from the accreted plasma is converted into non-thermal X-ray emission. Our population synthesis analysis predicts at least 28 (up to 72) BH+OB star binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to produce X-ray luminosity above 10$^{31}$ erg$\,$s$^{-1}$, observable through focused Chandra observations. We identify a population of SB1 systems in the LMC and HD96670 in the Milky Way comprising O stars with unseen companions of masses above 2.3 $M_{\odot}$ that aligns well with our predictions. The predicted luminosities of the OB companions to these X-ray-emitting BHs are 10$^{4.5-5.5}$ $L_{\odot}$.
  Conclusions. These results make the case for long-time exposure in X-rays of the stellar-mass BH candidates identified around OB stars. It will constrain the underlying population of X-ray-faint BHs, the evolution from single to double degenerate binaries, and the progenitors of gravitational wave mergers. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Measuring the Diffuse Interstellar Bands at 5780, 5797, and 6614 {\AA} in Low-Resolution Spectra of Cool Stars from LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We attempt to measure the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 in over two million low-resolution spectra of cool stars from LAMOST. Based on the DIB measurements, the correlation between DIBs and extinction, the kinematics of DIBs, and the Galactic distribution of DIBs are reviewed and investigated from the perspective of statistics. A pipeline is developed to measure the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 in the LAMOST low-resolution spectra. We obtain the DIB measurements of spectra of late-type stars from LAMOST, and screen out 176,831, 13,473 and 110,152 high-quality (HQ) measurements of the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614, respectively, corresponding to 142,074, 11,480 and 85,301 unique sources. Utilizing these HQ measurements, we present the Galactic maps of the DIBs $\lambda$5780 and $\lambda$6614 in the northern sky for the first time. The central wavelengths of the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 in air are determined to be 5780.48 $\pm$ 0.01, 5796.94 $\pm$ 0.02 and 6613.64 $\pm$ 0.01 {\AA}, respectively, based on their kinematics. The equivalent widths of these three DIBs per unit extinction are statistically fitted to be 0.565, 0.176 and 0.256 {\AA}/mag. As a part of our work, three catalogs of the HQ measurements for the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 are provided online. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest number of measurements of these three DIBs to date. It is also the first time that the Galactic maps of the DIBs $\lambda$5780 and $\lambda$6614 in the northern hemisphere are presented, and the central wavelengths of the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 are estimated from the kinematics.</description>

      <title>A comparative high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of in situ and accreted globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are extremely intriguing systems that help in reconstructing the assembly of the Milky Way via the characterisation of their chemo-chrono-dynamical properties. In this study, we use high-resolution spectroscopic archival data from UVES and UVES-FLAMES at VLT to compare the chemistry of GCs dynamically tagged as either Galactic (NGC 6218, NGC 6522 and NGC 6626) or accreted from distinct merger events (NGC 362 and NGC 1261 from Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, and Ruprecht 106 from the Helmi Streams) in the metallicity regime where abundance patterns of field stars with different origin effectively separate ($-1.3 \le$ [Fe/H] $\le -1.0$ dex). We find remarkable similarities in the abundances of the two Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus GCs across all chemical elements. They both display depletion in the $\alpha$-elements (Mg, Si and Ca) and statistically significant differences in Zn and Eu compared to in situ GCs. Additionally, we confirm that Ruprecht 106 exhibits a completely different chemical makeup from the other target clusters, being underabundant in all chemical elements. This demonstrates that when high precision is achieved, the abundances of certain chemical elements can not only efficiently separate in situ from accreted GCs, but can also distinguish among GCs born in different progenitor galaxies. In the end, we investigate the possible origin of the chemical peculiarity of Ruprecht 106. Given that its abundances do not match the chemical patterns of field stars associated to its most likely parent galaxy (i.e. the Helmi Streams), being depleted in the abundances of $\alpha$-elements in particular, we believe Ruprecht 106 to originate from a less massive galaxy compared to the progenitor of the Helmi Streams.</description>

      <title>Milky Way Insights from Cepheids I: Infrared Period-Luminosit-Metallicity Relations and the Time Evolution of Metallicity Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calibrate the period--luminosity--metallicity (PLZ) relations of classical Cepheid (DCEP) in three near-infrared bands ($J$, $H$, and $K_S$) and four mid-infrared bands ($W1$, $W2$, $[3.6]$, and $[4.5]$). The PLZ relations of $W1$ and $W2$ bands are calibrated for the first time. The distance moduli of the Large Magellanic Cloud estimated by these PLZ relations are in good agreement with the most accurate published value measured by geometric methods. These seven homogenous PLZ relations can aid in obtaining more robust distances for DCEPs. Applying our PLZ relations to trace the metallicity gradient of the Galactic disc, we find that the gradient for sources with logarithmic age less than 7.67 is almost fixed: $-0.056 \,\pm\, 0.002 \,\textrm{dex}\, \textrm{kpc}^{-1}$; the gradient for sources with logarithmic age greater than 7.67 is period--dependent (i.e., age-dependent): $(-0.074 \,\pm\, 0.003)+(-0.022 \,\pm\, 0.002)\log P)\,\textrm{dex}\, \textrm{kpc}^{-1}$. In addition, we find that DCEPs in the $R_{GC} \gtrsim 14.5\,\textrm{kpc}$ region tend to migrate toward the Galactic center, while DCEPs in the $10.5\,\textrm{kpc} \lesssim R_{GC} \lesssim 14.5\,\textrm{kpc}$ region tend to migrate toward the anti-Galactic center, which may be the reason for the obvious break of the metallicity gradient at $R_{GC} \thickapprox 14.5\,\textrm{kpc}$. We conclude that the evolution of the metallicity gradient of DCEPs may be related to their radial migration.</description>
