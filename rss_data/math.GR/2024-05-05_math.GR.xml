      <title>Embedding products of trees into higher rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there exists a quasi-isometric embedding of the product of $n$ copies of $\mathbb{H}_{\mathbb{R}}^2$ into any symmetric space of non-compact type of rank $n$, and there exists a bi-Lipschitz embedding of the product of $n$ copies of the $3$-regular tree $T_3$ into any thick Euclidean building of rank $n$ with co-compact affine Weyl group. This extends a previous result of Fisher--Whyte. The proof is purely geometrical, and the result also applies to the non Bruhat--Tits buildings.</description>

      <title>Convergence and collapsing of CAT$(0)$-lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the theory of convergence for CAT$(0)$-lattices (that is groups $\Gamma$ acting geometrically on proper, geodesically complete CAT$(0)$-spaces) and their quotients (CAT$(0)$-orbispaces). We describe some splitting and collapsing phenomena, explaining precisely how these action can degenerate to a possibly non-discrete limit action. Finally, we prove a compactness theorem for the class of compact CAT$(0)$-homology orbifolds, and some applications: an isolation result for flat orbispaces and an entropy-pinching theorem.</description>

      <title>On dense orbits in the space of subequivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first explain how to endow the space of subequivalence relations of any non-singular countable equivalence relation with a Polish topology, extending the framework of Kechris' recent monograph on subequivalence relations of probability measure-preserving (p.m.p.) countable equivalence relations. We then restrict to p.m.p. equivalence relations and discuss dense orbits therein for the natural action of the full group and of the automorphism group of the relation. Our main result is a characterization of the subequivalence relations having a dense orbit in the space of subequivalence relations of the ergodic hyperfinite p.m.p. equivalence relation. We also show that in this setup, all full groups orbits are meager. We finally provide a few Borel complexity calculations of natural subsets in spaces of subequivalence relations using a natural metric we call the uniform metric. This answers some questions from an earlier version of Kechris' monograph.</description>

      <title>$Out(F_n)$-invariant probability measures on the space of $n$-generated marked groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal G_n$ denote the space of $n$-generated marked groups. We prove that, for every $n\ge 2$, there exist $2^{\aleph_0}$ non-atomic, $Out(F_n)$-invariant, mixing probability measures on $\mathcal G_n$. On the other hand, there are non-empty closed subsets of $\mathcal G_n$ that admit no $Out(F_n)$-invariant probability measure. Acylindrical hyperbolicity of the group $Aut(F_n)$ plays a crucial role in the proof of both results. We also discuss model theoretic implications of the existence of $Out(F_n)$-invariant, ergodic probability measures on $\mathcal G_n$.</description>

      <title>Diameter of classical groups generated by transvections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite classical group generated by transvections, i.e., one of $\operatorname{SL}_n(q)$, $\operatorname{SU}_n(q)$, $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(q)$, or $\operatorname{O}^\pm_{2n}(q)$ ($q$ even), and let $X$ be a generating set for $G$ containing at least one transvection. Building on work of Garonzi, Halasi, and Somlai, we prove that the diameter of the Cayley graph $\operatorname{Cay}(G, X)$ is bounded by $(n \log q)^C$ for some constant $C$. This confirms Babai's conjecture on the diameter of finite simple groups in the case of generating sets containing a transvection.
  By combining this with a result of the author and Jezernik it follows that if $G$ is one of $\operatorname{SL}_n(q)$, $\operatorname{SU}_n(q)$, $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(q)$ and $X$ contains three random generators then with high probability the diameter $\operatorname{Cay}(G, X)$ is bounded by $n^{O(\log q)}$. This confirms Babai's conjecture for non-orthogonal classical simple groups over small fields and three random generators.</description>

      <title>Solvabilizer Numbers of Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a nonsolvable finite group G, where R(G) represents the solvable radical of G. For any element x in G, the solvabilizer of x in G, denoted by Sol_G(x), is defined as the set of all elements y in G such that the subgroup generated by x and y is solvable. Notably, the entirety of G can be expressed as the union over all x in G\R(G) of their respective solvabilizers: $G = \cup_{x\in G\R(G)} Sol_G(x). A solvabilizer covering of G is characterized by a subset X of G\R(G) such that G= \cup_{x\in X} Sol_G(x). The solvabilizer number of G is then defined as the minimum cardinality among all solvabilizer coverings of G. This paper delves into the exploration of the solvabilizer number for diverse nonsolvable finite groups G, shedding light on the interplay between solvability and the structure of these groups.</description>

      <title>Growth in products of matrices: fastest, average, and generic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>

      <title>Global Representation Ring and Knutson Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global representation rings were discovered by Sarah Witherspoon in 1995 and the Knutson Index was introduced by the second author in 2022. In the present paper we introduce the Knutson Index for general commutative rings and study it for Burnside rings and global representation rings. We also introduce the global table of a finite group, that encompasses both the character table and the Burnside table of marks. We discuss what properties of a group can be recovered from its global table.</description>
