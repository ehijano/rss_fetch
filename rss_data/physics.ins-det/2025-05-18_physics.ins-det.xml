      <title>HRPPD photosensors for RICH detectors with a high resolution timing capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new version of DC-coupled High Rate Picosecond Photodetectors (DC-HRPPDs) substantially re-designed for use at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) has been developed. A first batch of seven 'EIC HRPPDs' was manufactured in early 2024. These HRPPDs are DC-coupled photosensors based on Micro-Channel Plates (MCPs) that have an active area of 104 mm by 104 mm, 32 x 32 direct readout pixel array at a pitch of 3.25 mm, peak quantum efficiency in excess of 30%, exceptionally low dark count rates and timing resolution of 15-20 ps for a single photon detection. As such, these photosensors are very well suited for Ring Imaging CHerenkov (RICH) detectors that can also provide high resolution timing capability, especially in a configuration where a detected charged particle passes through the sensor window, which produces a localized flash containing a few dozens of Cherenkov photons in it.</description>

      <title>Detector Designs for Frontier Measurements in Neutrino and Collider Physics in the 21st Century</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last energy-frontier lepton collider, LEP, established several limits that still hold today. A key one is the counting of three light neutrino species from the invisible decay width of the Z boson. From a collider calorimetry standpoint, the missing energy is an invitation to design an experiment to directly measure the neutrino mass. We present a new type of EM spectrometer which leverages the first adiabatic invariant in magnetic gradient drift to achieve exponentially bounded resolution in a highly compact and scalable format, enabling the PTOLEMY experiment to not only measure the neutrino mass at the tritium endpoint, but one day directly detect the Cosmic Neutrino Background. Meanwhile, the next lepton collider promises to expose the Higgs self-coupling and complete the accounting of lepton universality. We present a dual-readout, segmented crystal calorimeter for future collider detectors, combining new hardware capabilities with novel AI/ML reconstruction techniques towards realizing a detector that must definitively and unambiguously surpass its predecessors. Together, these studies confront the most pressing challenges for 21st century particle physics experiments to achieve the sensitivities needed to bridge the gap between the largest and smallest scales of reality.</description>

      <title>Laser, Vacuum, and Gas Reaction Chamber for Operando Measurements at NSLS-II's 28-ID-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a laser reaction chamber that we developed for in-situ/operando X-ray diffraction measurements at the NSLS-II 28-ID-2 XPD (X-Ray Powder Diffraction) beamline. This chamber allows for rapid and dynamic sample heating under specialized gas environments, spanning ambient conditions down to vacuum pressures. We demonstrate the capabilities of this setup through two applications: laser-driven heating in polycrystalline iron oxide and in single crystal WTe2. Our measurements reveal the ability to resolve chemical reaction kinetics over minutes with 1-s time resolution. This setup advances opportunities for in-situ/operando XRD studies in both bulk and single crystal materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dipole-dipole resonance energy transfer for heavy element quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A magnetic dipole-dipole interaction is proposed as a quenching mechanism. The interaction rate follows $R^{-6}$ as the electric dipole-dipole interaction in F$\mathrm{\ddot{o}}$ster resonance energy transfer theory. The proposed mechanism causes a long-range resonance energy transfer, and the resonance condition is that the spins of donor and acceptor electrons both flip, and the energy level differences are the same. When organic molecules including heavy elements are dissolved in a liquid scintillator, these requirements are easier to be satisfied. The proposal in the paper adds a new approach for heavy element quenching in liquid scintillator solution.</description>

      <title>The Dublin Lens: A Cc=1.0 mm Objective Lens Intended for CryoEM at 100 keV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have designed, fabricated and tested a lens with chromatic aberration coefficient (Cc) of 1.0 mm, a 4.0 mm pole-gap and 2.0 mm bore that is wide enough to accommodate an anti-contamination system and an objective aperture. This lens extends the temporal-coherence envelope of the electron microscope beyond 2 Angstrom, using a low-cost Schottky FEG. We hope that this lens design can be used to improve all 100 keV electron microscopes designed for single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM).</description>

      <title>New generation of cavity microscope for quantum simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and assembly of a cavity microscope for quantum simulations with ultracold atoms. The system integrates a high-finesse optical cavity with a pair of high-numerical aperture lenses sharing a common optical axis, enabling simultaneous operation with light close-to-atomic resonance. The system keeps the advantages of a rigid, single-block structure holding the lenses and cavity together, and improves over existing designs by using most of the solid angle left free by the cavity mode for imaging and atomic manipulation purposes. The cavity has a length of $19.786$mm, a finesse of $2.35\times 10^4$ and operates $214\mu\text{m}$ away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.</description>

      <title>Einstein Telescope an Cosmic Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this talk is to give an overview of the current status of the development of the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer ground based gravitational wave (GW) detectors and of their foreseen scientific goals. These detectors will be up to a factor 8 more sensitive across the band covered by current detectors, namely LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA, and will extend the accessible frequency band towards the low frequency regime, i.e., below 10 Hz. These improvements will not only enhance the number and quality of GW observations, but will also enable researchers to have access to sources and physical processes which are out of reach for current detectors and explore the possibility of detecting previously unknown GW sources. The improvement in sensitivity in the low frequency regime will also increase the observation time of compact binary coalescence events, strengthening the collaboration with electromagnetic observatories for multimessenger observations of binary neutron star events. In fact, current detectors proved that joint observations of GW events with electromagnetic observatories are not only possible, but they can also give us unprecedented insights on the underlying physics of astrophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Development of the Beam Monitor Detectors for the Low-E Beamline at the CERN SPS H2 Line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A series of beam tests were conducted at the KEK AR test beamline in ordet to investigate the performance of a prototype detector for instrumentation in the low-E beamline at the CERN H2 line. For the silicon strip detector, the simultaneous readout of all strips of the X-Y detector was evaluated, in addition to the detection efficiency being assessed through coincidences with the trigger scintillators. The results demonstrated the successful acquisition of data with full strip readout and the reconstruction of the two-dimensional beam profile. Furthermore, we are contemplating the incorporation of GAGG crystals, an inorganic scintillator characterized by a high light yield ($\sim$$5 \times 10^{4}$ photons/MeV) and a brief time constant ($\sim$60 ns), within the newly developed time-of-flight detector. We assessed the resolution of time-of-flight based on the data, with the objective of achieving the required performance benchmarks through future improvements to the time-of-tlight detector.</description>

      <title>Pixel column issue in the ATLAS Inner Tracker modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pixel modules are currently being built for the ATLAS ITk Pixel detector upgrade. During the preproduction phase, recurring chip malfunctioning was observed during electrical testing. It was possible to bypass this issue by disabling some pixel core columns in the ITkPix readout chip. Therefore the issue is called "core column issue" which is a direct disqualifier for a pixel module. A concerning number of cases has been observed in pixel modules with ITkPix v1.1 as well as v2 chips which significantly impacts the module yield. However, the behaviour is erratic and there is not any evidence hinting at the origin of this issue. These proceedings outline the investigations of the issue, highlighting the electrical behaviour during testing, present findings from the data collected via our production database and through visual inspection, and point towards possible causes of the issue.</description>

      <title>The vertexing challenge at FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following in the footsteps of the LHC, the Future Circular Collider (FCC) plans to be the next multi-generational collider project. In the first stage, FCC-ee will collide intense beams of electrons and positrons at centre of mass energies between 88 and 365 GeV, making it an electroweak, flavour, Higgs and top factory. The unprecedented statistical precision requires FCC-ee experiments to limit their systematic uncertainties to the very minimum.
  The precise reconstruction of the interaction vertices is central to most measurements at FCC-ee, such as rare flavour physics processes and the measurement of Higgs and Z decays to bottom and charm quarks and taus. This contribution will discuss the requirements of FCC-ee vertex detectors, from the necessary impact parameter resolution via the challenging collision environment at the Z pole to the tight requirement on the material budget, which should be kept below 0.3% of a radiation length per detection layer. Next, the proposed vertex detector designs for FCC-ee are shortly presented, and an outlook is given on novel detector designs and features.
  The requirements for the vertexing performance translate into requirements for the sensors used for the vertex detector. As discussed in this contribution, they need to feature a spatial resolution of about 3 $\mu$m and provide timing information of O(ns-$\mu$s) while keeping power consumption minimal to allow for air-cooling of the detector - minimising the detector material budget.
  The only type of sensor capable of aiming to fulfil such requirements are CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS), which combine signal generation, amplification and readout into a single silicon die. Therefore, the rest of this contribution will present an overview of existing and planned MAPS technologies and prototypes aiming to fulfil the stringent FCC-ee vertex detector requirements.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing neutrinoless double beta decay event kinematics in a xenon gas detector with vertex tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If neutrinoless double beta decay is discovered, the next natural step would be understanding the lepton number violating physics responsible for it. Several alternatives exist beyond the exchange of light neutrinos. Some of these mechanisms can be distinguished by measuring phase-space observables, namely the opening angle $\cos\theta$ among the two decay electrons, and the electron energy spectra, $T_1$ and $T_2$. In this work, we study the statistical accuracy and precision in measuring these kinematic observables in a future xenon gas detector with the added capability to precisely locate the decay vertex. For realistic detector conditions (a gas pressure of 10 bar and spatial resolution of 4 mm), we find that the average $\overline{\cos\theta}$ and $\overline{T_1}$ values can be reconstructed with a precision of 0.19 and 110 keV, respectively, assuming that only 10 neutrinoless double beta decay events are detected.</description>

      <title>Output correction factors in a 1.5 T magnetic field determined at the central axis and at the lateral dose maximum for five detectors using alanine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent literature, the output correction factor in a 1.5T magnetic field, kB,Q,Clin, were determined only for the central axis (CAX), including our last work. At an MR-linac, the determination of the CAX position relies on e.g. MV-imaging and is at small field sizes located at the penumbra, whereas the maximum of the lateral profile (MAX) position is directly measurable. This study determined kB,Q,Ratio - the influence of the magnetic field on the output correction factor without a magnetic field, kQ,Clin - and kB,Q,Clin for both CAX and MAX fully experimentally for two MR-optimized ionization chambers, their conventional counterparts, and a solid-state detector. Additionally, the uncertainty due to intra-type variation for tabulated kB,Q,Clin was estimated. Measurements were conducted using an experimental setup consisting of a mobile electromagnet positioned in front of a standard clinical linac (6MV, 1.5T). Intra-type variation for the solid-state detector was assessed using four detectors. The change of absorbed dose to water was determined with alanine. Within the uncertainty, no difference in kB,Q,Ratio was observed between the MR-optimized chambers and their conventional counterparts. For the solid-state detector, no difference between CAX and MAX was observed. For all detectors, kB,Q,Clin remained constant down to a field size of 3x3cm2. At smaller field sizes, for MAX and for all detectors, kB,Q,Ratio decreased linearly. The maximum intra-type variation standard uncertainty was 0.009 for the smallest field size, with and without a magnetic field. In summary, kB,Q,Ratio and kB,Q,Clin, including its uncertainty, was successfully determined for five detectors at both CAX and MAX. For ionization chambers, kB,Q,Clin is lower at MAX, whereas for the solid-state detector, it remains the same. For the tabulated correction factors uncertainty, intra-type variation must be considered.</description>
