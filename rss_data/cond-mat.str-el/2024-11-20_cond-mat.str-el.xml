      <title>Formations of generalized Wannier-Stark ladders: Theorem and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wannier-Stark ladder (WSL) is a basic concept, supporting periodic oscillation, widely used in many areas of physics. In this paper, we investigate the formations of WSL in generalized systems, including strongly correlated and non-Hermitian systems. We present a theorem on the existence of WSL for a set of general systems that are translationally symmetric before the addition of a linear potential. For a non-Hermitian system, the WSL becomes complex but maintains a real energy level spacing. We illustrate the theorem using 1D extended Bose-Hubbard models with both real and imaginary hopping strengths. It is shown that the Bloch-Zener oscillations of correlated bosons are particularly remarkable under resonant conditions. Numerical simulations for cases with boson numbers $n=2$, $3$, and $4$ are presented. Analytical and numerical results for the time evolution of the $n$-boson-occupied initial state indicate that all evolved states exhibit quasi periodic oscillations, but with different profiles, depending on the Hermiticity and interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Easy-plane ferromagnetic ordering and crystal-field ground state in the Kondo lattice CeCuSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12054v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the successful growth of CeCuSi single crystals using a metallic flux method and the physical properties using structural, magnetic, electrical transport, optical, and heat capacity measurements. CeCuSi crystallizes in a hexagonal-bar shape, and single crystal x-ray diffraction confirms the ZrBeSi-type structure (space group $P6_{3}/mmc$). CeCuSi orders ferromagnetically below $T_\textrm{C}=15.5$ K with easy magnetization direction within the basal plane. The Ce$^{3+}$ ions are situated within a triangular lattice with a point group of $D_{3d}$. We perform a detailed crystalline electric field (CEF) analysis of the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility, the Schottky anomaly in heat capacity, and the Raman-active excitations. The results indicate a ground state doublet with magnetic moment primarily in the basal plane, and a ferromagnetic interaction along both directions. The exponential behavior in resistivity and in heat capacity below $T_\textrm{C}$ can also be well explained by the ferromagnetic magnon model. We found that CeCuSi does not exhibit the CEF hard axis ordering observed in many ferromagnetic Kondo lattice (FM-KL) compounds. Our CEF analysis suggests that the exchange interactions along both axes are ferromagnetic, potentially explaining the absence of hard-axis ordering.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ground state and excitations in mixed 3$d$-4$d$ quasi-1D spin-chain oxide Sr$_3$NiRhO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement of spin and orbital degrees of freedom, via relativistic spin-orbit coupling, in 4$d$ transition metal oxides can give rise to a variety of novel quantum phases. A previous study of mixed 3$d$-4$d$ quasi-1D spin-chain oxide Sr$_3$NiRhO$_6$ using the magnetization measurements by Mohapatra et al. [Phys. Rev. B 75, 214422 (2007)] revealed a partially disordered antiferromagnetic (PDA) structure below 50 K [Mohapatra et al, Phys. Rev. B 75, 214422 (2007)]. We here report the magnetic ground state and spin-wave excitations in Sr$_3$NiRhO$_6$, using muon spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR), and neutron (elastic and inelastic) scattering techniques. Our neutron diffraction study reveals that in the magnetic structure of Sr$_3$NiRhO$_6$, Rh$^{4+}$ and Ni$^{2+}$ spins are aligned ferromagnetically in a spin-chain, with moments along the crystallographic $c$-axis. However, spin-chains are coupled antiferromanetically in the $ab$-plane. $\mu$SR reveals the presence of oscillations in the asymmetry-time spectra below 50 K, supporting the long-range magnetically ordered ground state. Our inelastic neutron scattering study reveals gapped quasi-1D magnetic excitations with a large ratio of gap to exchange interaction. The observed spin-wave spectrum could be well fitted with a ferromagnetic isotropic exchange model (with $J = 3.7 $ meV) and single ion anisotropy ($D=10$ meV) on the Ni$^{2+}$ site. The magnetic excitations survive up to 85 K, well above the magnetic ordering temperature of $\sim 50$ K, also indicating a quasi-1D nature of the magnetic interactions in Sr$_3$NiRhO$_6$.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of a Closed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev System in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of thermalization of a closed quantum systems is of central interest in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here we present one such study analyzing the dynamics in a closed coupled Majorana SYK system. We have a large-$q$ SYK model prepared initially at equilibrium quenched by introducing a random hopping term, thus leading to non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the final stationary state reaches thermal equilibrium with respect to the Green's functions and energy. Accordingly, the final state is characterized by calculating its final temperature and the thermalization rate. We provide a detailed review of analytical methods and derive the required Kadanoff-Baym equations which are then solved using the algorithm developed in this work. Our results display rich thermalization dynamics in a closed quantum system in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Tracing quasiparticle dynamics and hybridization dynamics in PuCoGa5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PuCoGa5 has attracted significant attention due to its record-breaking superconducting transition temperature Tc=18.5 K among known f-electron superconductors. Here we systematically investigated the evolution of correlated electronic states in the plutonium-based unconventional superconductor PuCoGa5 upon temperature using the embedded dynamical mean-field theory merged with density functional theory. The mixed-valence nature of PuCoGa5 leads to intriguing quasiparticle dynamics and hybridization dynamics. Our findings reveal the presence of Dirac fermions and a temperature-driven localized-itinerant crossover of 5f states. As the temperature decreases, the low-energy quasiparticle resonances develop gradually, while the high-energy quasiparticle resonances exhibit quite different behaviors with an initial increase and subsequent decrease. Furthermore, we identified a characteristic temperature of approximately 290 K for the onset of hybridization gaps, which is much lower than the coherence temperature 580 K for 5f electrons. These results provide valuable insight on the the electronic structures, quasiparticle dynamics, and hybridization processes in 5f correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Finite-size scaling on the torus with periodic projected entangled-pair states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient algorithm is constructed for contracting two-dimensional tensor networks under periodic boundary conditions. The central ingredient is a novel renormalization step that scales linearly with system size, i.e. from $L \to L+1$. The numerical accuracy is comparable to state-of-the-art tensor network methods, while giving access to much more date points, and at a lower computational cost. Combining this contraction routine with the use of automatic differentiation, we arrive at an efficient algorithm for optimizing fully translation invariant projected entangled-pair states on the torus. Our benchmarks show that this method yields finite-size energy results that are comparable to those from quantum Monte Carlo simulations. When combined with field-theoretical scaling techniques, our approach enables accurate estimates of critical properties for two-dimensional quantum lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Domain walls from SPT-sewing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic method for constructing gapped domain walls of topologically ordered systems by gauging a lower-dimensional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order. Based on our construction, we propose a correspondence between 1d SPT phases with a non-invertible $G\times \text{Rep}(G)\times G$ symmetry and invertible domain walls in the quantum double associated with the group $G$. We prove this correspondence when $G$ is Abelian and provide evidence for the general case by studying the quantum double model for $G=S_3$. We also use our method to construct \emph{anchoring domain walls}, which are novel exotic domain walls in the 3d toric code that transform point-like excitations to semi-loop-like excitations anchored on these domain walls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy in quasiparticle states where certain unit patterns are excited repeatedly and sequentially in momentum space. We find that in the scaling limit, each unit pattern contributes independently and universally to the entanglement, leading to a volume-law scaling of the entanglement entropy. This characteristic of volume-law entanglement fragmentation is numerically confirmed in both fermionic and bosonic chains. We derive an analytical formula for fermions, which can also be applied to the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with appropriate identifications.</description>

      <title>Disentangling critical quantum spin chains with Clifford circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clifford circuits can be utilized to disentangle quantum state with polynomial cost, thanks to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Based on this idea, Clifford Circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CAMPS) method, which is a seamless integration of Clifford circuits within the DMRG algorithm, was proposed recently and was shown to be able to reduce entanglement in various quantum systems. In this work, we further explore the power of CAMPS method in critical spin chains described by conformal field theories (CFTs) in the scaling limit. We find that the variationally optimized disentangler corresponds to {\it duality} transformations, which significantly reduce the entanglement entropy in the ground state. For critical quantum Ising spin chain governed by the Ising CFT with self-duality, the Clifford circuits found by CAMPS coincide with the duality transformation, e.g., the Kramer-Wannier self-duality in the critical Ising chain. It reduces the entanglement entropy by mapping the free conformal boundary condition to the fixed one. In the more general case of XXZ chain, the CAMPS gives rise to a duality transformation mapping the model to the quantum Ashkin-Teller spin chain. Our results highlight the potential of CAMPS as a versatile tool for uncovering hidden dualities and simplifying the entanglement structure of critical quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in a Topological Lattice Model with Strong Repulsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The highly tunable nature of synthetic quantum materials -- both in the solid-state and cold atom contexts -- invites examining which microscopic ingredients aid in the realization of correlated phases of matter such as superconductors. Recent experimental advances in moir\'e materials suggest that unifying the features of the Fermi-Hubbard model and quantum Hall systems creates a fertile ground for the emergence of such phases. Here, we introduce a minimal 2D lattice model that incorporates exactly these features: time-reversal symmetry, band topology, and strong repulsive interactions. By using infinite cylinder density matrix renormalization group methods (cylinder iDMRG), we investigate the ground state phase diagram of this model. We find that it hosts an interaction-induced quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator and demonstrate that weakly hole-doping this state gives rise to a superconductor at a finite circumference, with indications that this behavior persists on larger cylinders. At the aforementioned circumference, the superconducting phase is surprisingly robust to perturbations including additional repulsive interactions in the pairing channel. By developing a technique to probe the superconducting gap function in iDMRG, we phenomenologically characterize the superconductor. Namely, we demonstrate that it is formed from the weak pairing of holes atop the QSH insulator. Furthermore, we determine the pairing symmetry of the superconductor, finding it to be $p$-wave -- reminiscent of the unconventional superconductivity reported in experiments on twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Motivated by this, we elucidate structural similarities and differences between our model and those of TBG in its chiral limit. Finally, to provide a more direct experimental realization, we detail an implementation of our Hamiltonian in a system of cold fermionic alkaline-earth atoms in an optical lattice.</description>

Abstract: Using bosonization, which maps fermions coupled to a ${\mathbb{Z}}_2$ gauge field to a qubit system, we give a simple form for the non-trivial 3-fermion quantum cellular automaton (QCA) as a unitary operator realizing a phase depending on the framing of flux loops, building off work by Shirley et al. We relate this framing dependent phase to a pump of $8$ copies of a $p+ip$ state through the system. We give a resolution of an apparent paradox, namely that the pump is a shallow depth circuit (albeit with tails), while the QCA is nontrivial. We discuss also the pump of fewer copies of a $p+ip$ state, and describe its action on topologically degenerate ground states. One consequence of our results is that a pump of $n$ $p+ip$ states generated by a free Fermi evolution is a free fermion unitary characterized by a non-trivial winding number $n$ as a map from the third homotopy group of the Brilliouin Zone $3$-torus to that of $SU(N_ b)$, where $N_b$ is the number of bands. Using our simplified form of the QCA, we give higher dimensional generalizations that we conjecture are also nontrivial QCAs, and we discuss the relation to Chern-Simons theory.</description>

Abstract: Supercriticality, characterized by strong fluctuations and a wealth of phenomena, emerges as an intriguing state beyond the classical liquid-gas critical point. In this study, we extend this notable concept to quantum many-body systems near the quantum critical point, by studying the quantum Ising model and Rydberg atom array through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We find two supercritical crossover lines in the quantum phase diagram with universal scaling, $h \propto (g - g_c)^{\beta + \gamma}$, where $g$ ($h$) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, $g_c$ is the critical field, and $\beta, \gamma$ are the related critical exponents. Enclosed by the two crossover lines, there exist supercritical quantum states with universal behaviors in correlations and entanglement. In particular, we reveal a dynamical quantum phase transition occurring when traversing the quantum supercritical crossover line. These dynamical singularities, attributed to the intersection of Lee-Yang-Fisher zero lines with the real-time axis, have no counterpart in classical supercriticality. We propose that the Rydberg atom array offers an ideal platform for studying the quantum supercritical crossovers and measuring the critical exponents. The present work establishes a foundation for exploring quantum supercriticality and related phenomena in correlated many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: The 4d-electron trimer lattice Ba4Nb1-xRu3+xO12 is believed to feature a heavy spinon Fermi surface that underpins both a quantum spin liquid (QSL) and an adjacent heavy-fermion strange metal (HFSM) phase, depending on Nb content. Itinerant spinons act as heat carriers that render the charge-insulating QSL a much better thermal conductor than the HFSM [1]. We find application of magnetic fields up to 14 T below 150 mK induces an abrupt rise in the heat capacity by as much as 5000% and breaks the signature linear temperature dependences of the heat capacity of both phases. In contrast, the AC magnetic susceptibility and the electrical resistivity are insensitive to applied fields up to 14 T over the same milli-Kelvin temperature range, whereas field depresses the thermal conductivity by up to 40% at temperatures below 4 K. These complex phenomena imply applied magnetic field drastically alters the spinons at low temperatures and demand new physics: We propose the steep rise in the heat capacity (and thus entropy) at milli-Kelvin temperatures and strong magnetic fields announces a field-induced localization of spinons.</description>

Abstract: We study a quantum system that consists of two fermionic chains coupled by a driven quantum point contact (QPC). The QPC contains a bond with a periodically varying tunneling amplitude. Initially the left chain is packed with fermions while the right one is empty. We numerically track the evolution of the system and demonstrate that, at frequencies above a critical one, the current through the QPC halts, and the particle imbalance between the chains remains forever. This implies a spectacular breakdown of the Floquet version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis which predicts a homogeneous particle density profile at large times. We confirm the effect for various driving protocols and interparticle interactions.</description>

      <title>Classifying Magnetism, Time-Reversal Symmetries, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$-Equivariant Topology</title>

Abstract: A novel theorem in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant homotopy theory is stated, proven and applied to the topological classification of frustrated magnets in the presence of canonical time-reversal symmetry. This theorem generalises a result which had been key to the homotopical derivation of the renowned Bott-Kitaev periodic table for topological insulators and superconductors. We distinguish between three symmetry classes $\mathrm{AIII}$, $\mathrm{AIII/BDI}$, and $\mathrm{AIII/CII}$ depending on the existence and type of canonical time-reversal symmetry. For each of these classes, the relevant objects to classify are $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant maps into a Stiefel manifold. The topological classification is illustrated through examples of frustrated spin models and is compared to the one of Roychowdhury and Lawler (RL).</description>

      <title>Existence of dual topological phases in Sn-based ternary chalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is quite intriguing to investigate the transition from a topological insulator (TI) phase to topological crystalline insulator (TCI) phase in a material as the latter has an advantage over the former in controlled device applications. This work investigates the existence of this dual topological behavior in Sn-based ternary chalcogenides family PbSnX2 (X=S, Se, Te) under the hydrostatic pressure using first-principles approach. These materials are dynamically sTABLE at ambient and elevated pressure conditions up to which the topological phase transitions (TPTs) are studied. This family have a topologically trivial ground state with direct band gap values 0.338 eV, 0.183 eV and 0.217 eV for PbSnS2, PbSnSe2 and PbSnTe2, respectively. The first TPT i.e., TI phase for these materials is observed, under the effect of external pressure of 5 GPa, 2.5 GPa and 3.5 GPa, with a single band inversion at F-point in the bulk band structure and an odd number of Dirac cones along the (111) surface. A further increase in pressure to 5.5 GPa, 3 GPa and 4 GPa results in another band inversion at {\Gamma}-point and an even number of Dirac cones along the (111) plane. These even number of band inversions suggest that (\(\bar{1}2\bar{1}\)) surface has mirror symmetry around (\(\bar{1}0\bar{1}\)) plane and hence, the TCI phase is obtained. This TCI phase is further corroborated with even value of mirror Chern number calculated using winding of Wannier charge centers.</description>

      <title>Giant Heat Flux Effect in Non-Chiral Transmission Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of heat transport in non-chiral transmission lines (TLs) of quantum Hall edge channels coupled to Ohmic contacts (OCs), where heat transport is driven by charge fluctuations in the heat Coulomb blockade regime. This framework challenges conventional paradigms by revealing a giant heat flux effect-a significant amplification in heat transport arising from non-trivial fluctuation-dissipation relations. Through a Langevin-based approach, we derive the effective noise power in the chiral currents, which underlies this enhanced heat flux. Our findings predict clear experimental signatures unique to non-chiral TLs as well as providing insights into finite-frequency effects, showing crossovers to more conventional diffusive behavior. This work offers a perspective on feedback mechanisms in quasi-1D heat transport with implications for dissipation control in low-dimensional quantum systems.</description>
