      <title>Robust Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maxmin approach to distributional robustness evaluates each mechanism according to its payoff guarantee over all priors in an ambiguity set. We propose a refinement: the guarantee must be approximately satisfied at priors near the ambiguity set (in the weak topology). We call such a guarantee robust. The payoff guarantees from some maxmin-optimal mechanisms in the literature are not robust. We show, however, that over certain standard ambiguity sets (such as continuous moment sets), every mechanism's payoff guarantee is robust. We give a behavioral characterization of our refined robustness notion by imposing a new continuity axiom on maxmin preferences.</description>

      <title>Why do elites extend property rights: unlocking investment and the switch to public goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new rationale for a self-interested economic elite voluntarily extending property rights. When agents make endogenous investment decisions, there is a commitment problem. Ex-post, the elite face strong incentives to expropriate investments from the non-elite (who don't have property rights), which dissuades investment. Extending property rights to new groups can resolve this problem, even for those not given property rights, by making public good provision more attractive to the elite. Unlike other models of franchise extensions, extending property rights in this paper does not involve the elite ceding control to others. Rather, it changes the incentives they face. Additionally, adding identity groups to the model shows that an elite faces weaker incentives to resolve the commitment problem when it is part of a minority identity -- identity fragmentation makes it harder for a society to extend property rights.</description>

      <title>Robust Technology Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze how uncertain technologies should be robustly regulated. An agent develops a new technology and, while privately learning about its harms and benefits, continually chooses whether to continue development. A principal, uncertain about what the agent might learn, chooses among dynamic mechanisms (e.g., paths of taxes or subsidies) to influence the agent's choices in different states. We show that learning robust mechanisms -- those which deliver the highest payoff guarantee across all learning processes -- are simple and resemble `regulatory sandboxes' consisting of zero marginal tax on R&amp;D which keeps the agent maximally sensitive to new information up to a hard quota, upon which the agent turns maximally insensitive. Robustness is important: we characterize the worst-case learning process under non-robust mechanisms and show that they induce growing but weak optimism which can deliver unboundedly poor principal payoffs; hard quotas safeguard against this. If the regulator also learns, adaptive hard quotas are robustly optimal which highlights the importance of expertise in regulation.</description>

      <title>Stable partitions for proportional generalized claims problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a set of agents who have claims on an endowment that is not large enough to cover all claims. Agents can form coalitions but a minimal coalition size $\theta$ is required to have positive coalitional funding that is proportional to the sum of the claims of its members. We analyze the structure of stable partitions when coalition members use well-behaved rules to allocate coalitional endowments, e.g., the well-known constrained equal awards rule (CEA) or the constrained equal losses rule (CEL).For continuous, (strictly) resource monotonic, and consistent rules, stable partitions with (mostly) $\theta$-size coalitions emerge. For CEA and CEL we provide algorithms to construct such a stable partition formed by $\theta$-size coalitions.</description>
