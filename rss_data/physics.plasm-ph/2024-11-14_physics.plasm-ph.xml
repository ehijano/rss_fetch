      <title>On the soliton solutions in a self-gravitating strongly coupled electron-ion-dusty plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of electrostatic strong-coupling of dust particles along with their self-gravitational force has been analyzed in a three component dusty plasma. The electrons and ions forming the charge neutral background where the electron distribution is assumed to be Maxwellian while the ion distribution is non-thermal. These days, one of the key topics in plasma physics is nonlinear waves in plasma. Thus using the reductive perturbation technique to the set of hydrodynamic equation considered for an electron-ion-dusty (e-i-d) plasma, a coupled KdV equation is derived. The impact of strong coupling and self-gravitation on the solitary wave profiles, nonlinear coefficient and dispersive coefficient are studied both analytically and by numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Transformation Toward Improving the Machine-Learned NLTE Models of ICF Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of machine learning techniques into Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) simulations has emerged as a powerful approach for enhancing computational efficiency. By replacing the costly Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) model with machine learning models, significant reductions in calculation time have been achieved. However, determining how to optimize machine learning-based NLTE models in order to match ICF simulation dynamics remains challenging, underscoring the need for physically relevant error metrics and strategies to enhance model accuracy with respect to these metrics. Thus, we propose novel physics-informed transformations designed to emphasize energy transport, use these transformations to establish new error metrics, and demonstrate that they yield smaller errors within reduced principal component spaces compared to conventional transformations.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Solar Wind Charged Particle Energy Deposited and Particle Identification by $\Delta$E-E Discrimination in the SNAPPY Cubesat Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar Neutrino and Astro-Particle PhYsics (SNAPPY) Cubesat is expected to launch in 2025 and it will carry into a polar orbit a prototype test detector for solar neutrino background studies while over the Earth's poles for the neutrino Solar Orbiting Laboratory future project ($\nu$SOL). During this flight it is possible to do other science measurements. One of these is an improved study of the solar wind particles through improved particle identification and energy measurements. This study aimed to understand how well could the solar wind particles be identified using the planned detector but instead of using the veto array as an anti-coincidence it would be used as a $\Delta$E energy sampling of a phoswich particle ID system.</description>

      <title>Viscous Heating and Instabilities in the Partially Ionized Solar Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In weak magnetic fields ($\lesssim 50 \,\mbox{G}$), parallel and perpendicular viscosities, mainly from neutrals, may exceed magnetic diffusivities (Ohm, Hall, ambipolar) in the middle and upper chromosphere. Ion-driven gyroviscosity may dominate in the upper chromosphere and transition region. In strong fields ($\gtrsim 100\, \mbox{G}$), viscosities primarily exceed diffusivities in the upper chromosphere and transition region. Parallel and perpendicular viscosities, being similar in magnitude, dampen waves and potentially compete with ambipolar diffusion in plasma heating, potentially inhibiting Hall and ambipolar instabilities when equal. The perpendicular viscosity tensor has two components, $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$, which differ slightly and show weak dependence on ion magnetization. Their differences, combined with shear, may destabilize waves, though magnetic diffusion introduces a cutoff for this instability. In configurations with a magnetic field $\bf{B}$ having vertical ($b_z=B_z/|\bf{B}|$) and azimuthal ($b_y=B_y/|\bf{B}|$) components, and a wavevector $\bf{k}$ with radial ($\kx=k_x/|\bf{k}|$) and vertical ($\kz=k_z/|\bf{k}|$) components, parallel viscosity and Hall diffusion can generate the viscous-Hall instability. Gyroviscosity further destabilizes waves in the upper regions. These findings indicate that the solar atmosphere may experience various viscous instabilities, revealing complex interactions between viscosity, magnetic fields, and plasma dynamics across different atmospheric regions.</description>

      <title>Zones of Tayler Instability in Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tayler instability (TI) of toroidal magnetic fields is a candidate mechanism for driving turbulence, angular momentum transport, and dynamo action in stellar radiative zones. Recently Skoutnev &amp; Beloborodov (2024) revisited the linear stability analysis of a toroidal magnetic field in a rotating and stably stratified fluid. In this paper, we extend the analysis to include both thermal and compositional stratification, allowing for general application to stars. We formulate an analytical instability criterion for use as a ``toggle switch" in stellar evolution codes. It determines when and where in a star the Tayler-Spruit dynamo may be responsible for angular momentum transport. We implement such a ``toggle switch" in the MESA stellar evolution code and map out the stability of each mode of the TI on a grid of stellar evolution models. In evolved lower mass stars, the TI becomes suppressed in compositionally stratified regions, undermining the Tayler-Spruit dynamo as an explanation of the core-envelope coupling. In higher mass stars, the TI is active throughout the radiative zones, but at different wavenumbers than previously expected.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production using polarized photons from inverse Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observing multiphoton electron-positron pair production (the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process) requires high-energy $\gamma$ rays to interact with strong electromagnetic fields. In order for these observations to be as precise as possible, the $\gamma$ rays would ideally be both mono-energetic and highly polarized. Here we perform Monte Carlo simulations of an experimental configuration that accomplishes this in two stages. First, a multi-GeV electron beam interacts with a moderately intense laser pulse to produce a bright, highly polarized beam of $\gamma$ rays by inverse Compton scattering. Second, after removing the primary electrons, these $\gamma$ rays collide with another, more intense, laser pulse in order to produce pairs. We show that it is possible to measure the $\gamma$-ray polarization dependence of the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process in near-term experiments, using a 100-TW class laser and currently available electron beams. Furthermore, it would also be possible to observe harmonic structure and the perturbative-to-nonperturbative transition if such a laser were colocated with a future linear collider.</description>

      <title>Multiscale simulation of neutral particle flows in the plasma edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The plasma edge flow, situated at the intricate boundary between plasma and neutral particles, plays a pivotal role in the design of nuclear fusion devices such as divertors and pumps. Traditional numerical simulation methods, such as the direct simulation Monte Carlo approach and the discrete velocity method, are hindered by extensive computation times when dealing with near-continuum flow conditions. This paper presents a general synthetic iterative scheme to deterministically simulate the plasma edge flows. By alternately solving the kinetic equations and macroscopic synthetic equations, our method substantially decreases the number of iterations, while maintains asymptotic-preserving properties even when the spatial cell size is much larger than the mean free path. Consequently, our approach achieves rapid convergence and high accuracy in plasma edge flow simulations, particularly in near-continuum flow regimes. This advancement provides a robust and efficient computational tool, essential for the advancement of next-generation nuclear fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions for weak turbulence models in electrostatic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12430v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weak turbulence model, also known as the quasilinear theory in plasma physics, has been a cornerstone in modeling resonant particle-wave interactions in plasmas. This reduced model stems from the Vlasov-Poisson/Maxwell system under the weak turbulence assumption, incorporating the random phase approximation and ergodicity. The interaction between particles and waves (plasmons) can be treated as a stochastic process, whose transition probability bridges the momentum space and the spectral space. Therefore, the operators on the right hand side resemble collision forms, such as those in Boltzmann and Landau interacting models. For them, there have been results on well-posedness and regularity of solutions. However, as far as we know, there is no such preceding work for the quasilinear theory addressed in this manuscript.
  In this paper, we establish the existence of global weak solutions for the system modeling electrostatic plasmas in one dimension. Our key contribution consists of associating the original integral-differential system to a degenerate inhomogeneous porous medium equation(PME) with nonlinear source terms, and leveraging advanced techniques from the PME literature. This approach opens a novel pathway for analyzing weak turbulence models in plasma physics. Moreover, our work offers new tools for tackling related problems in the broader context of nonlinear nonlocal PDEs.</description>
