      <title>Incommensurate gapless ferromagnetism connecting competing symmetry-enriched deconfined quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpolating between distinct symmetry-enriched critical points is believed to require going through either a multicritical point or an intervening gapped phase. We present a scenario, in which a gapless extended phase serves as a "hub" connecting multiple symmetry-enriched deconfined quantum critical points. As a concrete example, we construct a lattice model with $\mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}\times \mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}\times \mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}$ symmetry for quantum spin-1/2 degrees of freedom that realizes four distinct gapful phases supporting antiferromagnetic long-range order and one extended incommensurate gapless ferromagnetic phase. The quantum phase transition between any two of the four gapped and antiferromagnetic phases goes through either a (deconfined) quantum critical point, a quantum tricritical point, or the incommensurate gapless ferromagnetic phase. In this phase diagram, it is possible to interpolate between four deconfined quantum critical points by passing through the extended gapless ferromagnetic phase. We identify the phases in the model and the nature of the transitions between them through a combination of analytical arguments and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) studies.</description>

      <title>Soft phonon and the central peak at the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition in SrTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous displacive phase transition in SrTiO$_3$ near $T_c \approx 105$ K features a central elastic peak in neutron scattering investigations at temperatures above $T_c$, i.e., before the corresponding soft phonon mode is overdamped upon cooling. The origin of this central peak is still not understood. Here, we report an inelastic x-ray scattering investigation of the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition in SrTiO$_3$. We compare quantitatively measurements of the soft phonon mode on two differently grown samples and discuss the findings regarding results from thermodynamic probes such as specific heat and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, we use inelastic x-ray scattering to perform elastic scans with both high momentum- and milli-electronvolt energy-resolution and, thus, be able to separate elastic intensities of the central peak from low-energy quasielastic phonon scattering. Our results indicate that the evolution of the soft mode is similar in both samples though the intensities of the central peak differ by a factor of four. Measurements revealing anisotropic correlation lengths on cooling towards $T_c$, indicate that local properties of the crystals to which collective lattice excitations are insensitive are likely at the origin of the central elastic line in SrTiO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Constructing a variational ground state of matter fermions coupled to a vison pair in Kitaev's honeycomb model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new method to construct simple and explicit variational approximations for the ground state of Kitaev's honeycomb model with a non-trivial Z2 flux configuration consisting of a pair of visons on neighbouring plaquettes. The method consists of retaining only the largest singular values of the generator of the transformation between the vison-pair and flux-free ground states. We compare physical quantities calculated using the approximate state to those obtained by extrapolating results of exact diagonalisation of finite lattices, finding them to be in very good agreement. We discuss ways to extend the method to more complicated flux configurations.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution for the relaxed atomic configuration of twisted bilayer graphene including heterostrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuum atomic relaxation models for twisted bilayer graphene involve minimization of the sum of intralayer elastic energy and interlayer adhesion energy. The elastic energy favors a rigid twist i.e. no distortion in the twisted honeycomb lattices, while the adhesion energy favors Bernal stacking and breaking the relaxation into triangular AB and BA stacked domains. We compare the results of two relaxation models with the published Bragg interferometry data, finding good agreement with one of the models. We then provide a method for finding a highly accurate approximation to the solution of this model which holds above the twist angle of $\approx0.7^\circ$ and thus covers the first magic angle. We find closed form expressions in the absence, as well as in the presence, of external heterostrain. These expressions are not written as a Taylor series in the ratio of adhesion and elastic energy, because, as we show, the radius of convergence of such a series is too small to access the first magic angle.</description>

      <title>Mass enhancement and metal-nonmetal transition driven by d-f hybridization in perovskites La1-xPrxCuO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the large electron-mass enhancement and the metal to nonmetal transition upon the Pr doping in perovskite-type La1-xPrxCuO3. With increasing the Pr content x around 0.6, the LaCuO3-type three-dimensional structure with trivalent Cu ions changes to the quasi-one-dimensional structure with nearly divalent Cu ions, which accompanies significant changes in the electronic properties. Based on the resistivity, optical conductivity, specific heat measurements and the first-principles calculations, we discuss the formation of a nearly localized nonmetallic state stabilized by the hybridization between Cu 3d, O 2p, and Pr 4f orbitals in the quasi-one-dimensional lattice. The present perovskite-type cuprates offer a unique opportunity to explore novel quantum phases of correlated electrons in low-dimensional lattice, where the spin/charge/orbital degrees of freedom of A- and B-site ions are entangled.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics and spin-phonon coupling in the kagome spin ice HoAgGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy and first-principles phonon calculations to study the lattice dynamics and spin-phonon coupling in the kagome spin ice compound HoAgGe. Upon cooling, HoAgGe shows transitions from a nonmagnetic state at 300 K to a partially magnetic-ordered phase below T2 = 11.6 K, eventually reaching a fully-magnetic ordered phase below T1 = 7 K. We detect eight of ten Raman-active phonon modes at room temperature, with frequencies consistent with first-principles phonon calculations. We find that the low-energy phonon modes harden upon cooling, soften slightly below T2, and finally harden again below T1, suggesting finite spin-phonon coupling in HoAgGe. Furthermore, one high-energy mode at 185 cm-1 with E' symmetry exhibits a Fano lineshape due to electron-phonon coupling. Our Raman results establish finite spin-phonon coupling and electron-phonon coupling in the magnetic phase of HoAgGe, providing a foundation for future studies of the novel field-induced phases at low temperatures in HoAgGe.</description>

      <title>Local signatures of altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a class of collinear compensated N\'eel ordered magnets that break time-reversal symmetry and feature spin-split band structures. Based on versatile microscopic models able to capture the altermagnetic sublattice degrees of freedom, we study characteristic local signatures of altermagnetism near disorder sites. We give a complete list of two-dimensional models that exhibit altermagnetism classified by their corresponding layer groups. Specifically, we calculate the local density of states in the vicinity of pointlike nonmagnetic impurities and expose its spatial dependence for two minimal models showcasing $d$-wave and $g$-wave altermagnetism. The momentum structure of the nodes ($d$-wave, $g$-wave, etc.) is directly imprinted on the total local density of states, thus measurable by scanning tunneling conductance experiments. This signature is present both in the spin-resolved as well as the spin-summed local density of states. We find a weaker response in the nonmagnetic state from the anisotropic crystal environment and uncover the importance of the sublattice degree of freedom to model altermagnets. We also study coexistence phases of altermagnetism and superconductivity and provide predictions for the local impurity response of in-gap bound states. The response of impurity bound states strongly enhances the distinct altermagnetic signature.</description>

      <title>Boundary Operator Product Expansion Coefficients of the Three-dimensional Ising Universality Class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in field theory and critical phenomena have focused on the characterization of boundary or defects in a conformally-invariant system. In this Letter we study the critical behavior of the three-dimensional Ising universality class in the presence of a surface, realizing the ordinary, the special, and the normal universality classes. By using high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of an improved model, where leading scaling corrections are suppressed, and a finite-size scaling analysis, we determine unbiased, accurate estimates of universal boundary operator product expansion coefficients. Furthermore, we improve the value of the scaling dimension of the surface field at the special transition by the estimate $\hat{\Delta}_\sigma = 0.3531(3)$.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Computation with the $S_3$ Quantum Double: A Pedagogical Exposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian topological order (TO) enables topologically protected quantum computation with its anyonic quasiparticles. Recently, TO with $S_3$ gauge symmetry was identified as a sweet spot -- simple enough to emerge from finite-depth adaptive circuits yet powerful enough to support a universal topological gate-set. In these notes, we review how anyon braiding and measurement in $S_3$ TO are primitives for topological quantum computation and we explicitly demonstrate universality. These topological operations are made concrete in the $S_3$ quantum double lattice model, aided by the introduction of a generalized ribbon operator. This provides a roadmap for near-term quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Single monolayer ferromagnetic perovskite SrRuO3 with high conductivity and strong ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving robust ferromagnetism and high conductivity in atomically thin oxide materials is critical for advancing spintronic technologies. Here, we report the growth of a highly conductive and ferromagnetic single monolayer SrRuO3 having a high Curie temperature of 154 K on DyScO3 110 substrates. The SrTiO3 capping layer effectively suppresses surface reactions, which typically hinder ferromagnetism in atomically thin films. X ray absorption spectroscopy and X ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements revealed strong orbital hybridization between Ru 4d and O 2p orbitals in the SRO monolayer, which contributes to enhancement of the conductivity and ferromagnetic ordering of both the Ru 4d and O 2p orbitals. The resistivity of the single monolayer SrRuO3 on the better lattice matched DyScO3 substrate is approximately one-third of that of previously reported single monolayer SrRuO3 grown on an SrTiO3 substrate. This study highlights the potential of monolayer SrRuO3 as a platform for two dimensional magnetic oxide systems, offering new opportunities for the eploration of spintronic devices and quantum transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>A toolbox of spin-adapted generalized Pauli constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a toolbox for studying and applying spin-adapted generalized Pauli constraints (GPCs) in few-electron quantum systems. By exploiting the spin symmetry of realistic $N$-electron wave functions, the underlying one-body pure $N$-representability problem simplifies, allowing us to calculate the GPCs for larger system sizes than previously accessible. We then uncover and rigorously prove a superselection rule that highlights the significance of GPCs: whenever a spin-adapted GPC is (approximately) saturated - referred to as (quasi)pinning - the corresponding $N$-electron wave function assumes a simplified structure. Specifically, in a configuration interaction expansion based on natural orbitals only very specific spin configuration state functions may contribute. To assess the nontriviality of (quasi)pinning, we introduce a geometric measure that contrasts it with the (quasi)pinning induced by simple (spin-adapted) Pauli constraints. Applications to few-electron systems suggest that previously observed quasipinning largely stems from spin symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Researchers in physical science aim to uncover universal features in strongly interacting many-body systems, often hidden in complicated observables like entanglement entropy (EE). The non-local nature of EE makes it challenging to compute numerically, necessitating the development of an unbiased and convenient algorithm. In this paper, we use quantum Monte Carlo to reveal that the coefficient of variation in direct EE calculations increases exponentially with system size, leading to inaccuracies. To address this issue, we develop a power incremental algorithm and a technique for straightforwardly calculating the universal term of EE, successfully evaluating the EE of a 2D Hubbard model. Our numerical results demonstrate the consistency of the universal coefficient of EE from sharp corners at the Gross-Neveu quantum critical point and for free Dirac fermions. Our method can also be applied to other unstable observables, such as partition functions, entanglement spectra, and negativity, thereby fostering computational and theoretical progress.</description>

      <title>Relaxation to persistent currents in a Hubbard trimer coupled to fermionic baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a ring of fermionic quantum sites, modeled by the Fermi--Hubbard Hamiltonian, in which electrons can move and interact strongly via the Coulomb repulsion. The system is coupled to fermionic cold baths which by the exchange of particles and energy induce relaxation in the system. We eliminate the environment and describe the system effectively by Lindblad master equations in various versions valid for different coupling parameter regimes. The early relaxation phase proceeds in a universal way, irrespective of the relative couplings and approximations. The system settles down to its low--energy sector and is consecutively well approximated by the Heisenberg model. We compare different Lindblad approaches which, in the late relaxation, push the system towards different final states with opposite, extreme spin orders, from ferromagenetic to antiferromagnetic. Due to spin frustration in the trimer (a three site ring), degenerate ground states are formed by spin waves (magnons). The system described by the global coherent version of the Lindblad operators relaxes towards the final states carrying directed persistent spin currents. We numerically confirm these predictions.</description>

      <title>Order-by-disorder without quantum zero-point fluctuations in the pyrochlore Heisenberg ferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Order-by-disorder, whereby fluctuations lift an accidental classical ground state degeneracy to stabilize a subset of ordered states, is a recurrent and prominent theme in the field of frustrated magnetism where magnetic moments are subject to competing interactions. Thus far, such a phenomenon has been discussed in systems where the quantum ground state is not a classical product state. In such a case, both thermal and quantum fluctuations act to lift the accidental classical degeneracy, begging the question of whether one mechanism of order-by-disorder is possible without the other. In this paper, we present results exposing an uncharted route to order-by-disorder, one without quantum zero-point fluctuations, in the ferromagnetic pyrochlore Heisenberg system with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction as the leading perturbation. We prove that any colinear ferromagnetic state is an exact eigenstate while thermal fluctuations give rise to a preference in the magnetization direction. Using linear spin wave theory, we find that the anisotropy appears at lowest order as a sub-leading term in the low-temperature expansion of the free energy, proportional to $T^{7/2}$. Our results thus show that the phenomenon of thermal order-by-disorder can occur even in the absence of quantum zero-point fluctuations driving quantum order-by-disorder, this being so in particular when the accidentally degenerate ground state of the classical model turns out to be an exact eigenstate of the quantum version of the model. In addition, we find that when the DM interaction is large, the fully polarized ferromagnetic ground state becomes unstable for a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system within the framework of non-linear spin wave theory, a result that is presumably closely related to the recent report of a quantum spin liquid in this spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ model reported in [https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2403487121].</description>

Abstract: Moir\'e materials provide a remarkably tunable platform for topological and strongly correlated quantum phases of matter. Very recently, the first zero field Abelian fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) have been experimentally demonstrated and it has been theoretically predicted that non-Abelian states with Majorana fermion excitations may be realized in the nearly dispersionless minibands of these systems. Here we provide telltale evidence in terms of low-energy quantum numbers, spectral flow and entanglement spectra for the even more exotic possibility of moir\'e-based non-Abelian FCIs exhibiting Fibonacci parafermion excitations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous shot noise in a bad metal beta-tantalum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18349</link>

Abstract: We investigate the electronic shot noise produced by nanowires of $\beta$-Ta, an archetypal ``bad" metal with resistivity near the Ioffe-Regel localization limit. The Fano factor characterizing the shot noise exhibits a strong dependence on temperature and is suppressed compared to the expectations for quasiparticle diffusion, but hopping transport is ruled out by the analysis of scaling with the nanowire length. These anomalous behaviors closely resemble those of strange metal nanowires, suggesting that $\beta$-Ta may host a correlated electron liquid. This material provides an accessible platform for exploring exotic electronic states of matter.</description>

      <title>Magnetorotons in Moir\'e Fractional Chern Insulators</title>

Abstract: The discovery of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) unlocks exciting opportunities to explore emergent physical excitations arising from topological and geometric effects in novel phases of quantum matter. Here we investigate the intraband neutral excitations, namely magnetorotons, in moir\'e FCIs within twisted $\rm{MoTe}_2$ by applying the Girvin, MacDonald, and Platzman (GMP) ansatz together with the method of dynamical geometric response. We reveal the universal existence of the finite-momentum magnetorotons in moir\'e FCIs and predict their characteristic scales. Furthermore, we explore the geometric nature of magnetorotons in the long-wavelength limit, identifying their gapped chiral nature with angular momentum-2, which originates from the momentum-space incompressibility of FCIs. Utilizing the excellent tunability of moir\'e systems, we extend our analysis to other incompressible phases and uncover the dynamical properties of geometric excitations influenced by quantum phase transitions. Finally, we provide experimental proposals for detecting and advancing the study of intraband neutral excitations in moir\'e FCIs.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian interlayer coherent fractional quantum Hall states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall state in double layer systems at total filling factor $1/2$. Recent progresses in two-dimensional van der Waals materials made it possible to explore the regime with very small interlayer distance. Numerical calculations suggests interlayer phase coherence can develop between the layers such that the electrons may redistribute between them without changing the Hall response. It corresponds to spontaneous breaking of the U(1) symmetry associated with the particle number difference in the layers. This state manifests itself as superfluid in counterflow measurement and has characteristic Hall response when current is passed through one layer and voltages in both layers are measured. As the interlayer distance increases, a phase transition to the Halperin 331 state occurs. We also discuss similar physics for bosonic systems with specially designed interactions.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals and applications of Van der Waals magnets in magnon spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spintronics is concerned with replacing charge current with current of spin, the electron's intrinsic angular momentum. In magnetic insulators, spin currents are carried by magnons, the quanta of spin-wave excitations on top of the magnetically ordered state. Magnon spin currents are especially promising for information technology due to their low intrinsic damping, non-reciprocal transport, micrometer wavelengths at microwave frequencies, and strong interactions that enable signal transduction. In this perspective, we give our view on the progress and challenges towards realizing magnon spintronics based on atomically thin Van der Waals magnets, a recently discovered class of magnetic materials of which the tunability and versatility has attracted a great deal of ongoing research.</description>

      <title>Elasto-Hall conductivity and the anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets break time-reversal symmetry, preserve the crystal translation invariance, and have a spin density with $d$-wave, $g$-wave, etc. momentum dependencies which do not contribute to the magnetization. When an $s$-wave spin-density contribution cannot be excluded by symmetry a small magnetization and an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) emerge. However, for so-called "pure" altermagnets, where the $s$-wave component is symmetry forbidden even in the presence of SOC, both the zero-field magnetization and the AHE vanish. We show that altermagnets generally exhibit a non-zero elasto-Hall-conductivity, by which application of strain leads to a non-zero AHE. For pure altermagnets it is the only contribution to the AHE. This elasto-Hall-conductivity is caused by strain coupling to the Berry curvature quadrupole that characterizes altermagnets and allows for the determination of the altermagnetic order using transport measurements that are linear in the electrical field. We further show that the emergence of a non-zero magnetization in the presence of strain arises from a different response function: piezomagnetism. While this magnetization gives rise to an additional contribution to the elasto-Hall conductivity, the corresponding Berry curvature is qualitatively different from the distorted Berry curvature quadrupole originating from the altermagnetic order parameter. This insight also helps to disentangle AHE and weak ferromagnetism for systems with symmetry-allowed $s$-wave contribution. Quantitatively, the elasto-Hall conductivity is particularly pronounced for systems with a Dirac spectrum in the altermagnetic state. The same mechanism gives rise to anomalous elasto-thermal Hall, Nernst, and Ettinghausen effects.</description>
