      <title>Gravitational waves from magnetorotational core-collapse supernovae using 3D GRMHD simulations: effect of rotation and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational wave emission for 10 supernova progenitors from magnetorotational core-collapse to the supernova explosion using fully three-dimensional dynamical-spacetime general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations with the GPU-accelerated code $\texttt{GRaM-X}$. We consider 2 progenitors of zero-age-main-sequence mass $25M_\odot$ and 8 with zero-age-main-sequence masses of $35M_\odot$. For these models, we explore a range of rotation rates between $0.0$ and $3.5 \mathrm{rad}\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, along with initial seed magnetic field of either $10^{12}\mathrm{G}$ or $10^{13}\mathrm{G}$. The analysis of the 10 models presented provides a comprehensive and systematic initial investigation of the interplay between progenitor rotation, magnetic field strength, and progenitor structure in shaping the explosion dynamics and gravitational wave (GW) emission. We find that stronger seed magnetic fields ($10^{13}\mathrm{G}$) suppress the GW strain amplitude relative to models with weaker initial fields ($10^{12}\mathrm{G}$). Increasing the initial rotation rate results in a more dynamical explosion, yielding correspondingly stronger gravitational waves. In addition, the progenitor mass/composition also exhibit a significant impact on the explosion dynamics and the morphology of the resulting waveforms. Finally, we find that all of our models lie above the detectability threshold for 3rd generation detectors aLIGO, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic explorer at a $10\mathrm{kpc}$ distance and most would even still be detectable at $10\mathrm{Mpc}$, opening the possibility for observing gravitational wave emission for CCSNe beyond our galaxy.</description>

      <title>Vacuum birefringence in the polarized X-ray emission of a radio magnetar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory predicts that the quantum vacuum becomes birefringent in the presence of ultra-strong magnetic fields -- a fundamental effect yet to be directly observed. Magnetars, isolated neutron stars with surface fields exceeding $10^{14}$~G, provide unique astrophysical laboratories to probe this elusive prediction. Here, we report phase- and energy-resolved X-ray polarization measurements of the radio-emitting magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 obtained with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), in coordination with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and Parkes/Murriyang radio observations. We detect a high phase-averaged polarization degree of 65% at 2 keV, where the surface thermal emission is dominant, rising to nearly 80% at certain rotational phases, and remaining at $\gtrsim40\%$ throughout the radio beam crossing. We also observe a strong decrease in polarization from 2~keV to 4~keV. Detailed atmospheric radiative transfer modeling, coupled with geometrical constraints from radio polarization, demonstrate that the observed polarization behavior cannot be consistently explained without invoking magnetospheric vacuum birefringence (VB) influences. These observational findings combined with the theoretical results represent compelling evidence for naturally occurring quantum VB. This work marks a significant advance toward confirming this hallmark prediction of QED and lays the foundation for future tests of strong-field quantum physics using next-generation X-ray polarimeters.</description>

      <title>A Yin-Yang Galaxy Cluster Merger in Abell 1914 Revealed by XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical mergers of galaxy clusters play a key role in converting gravitational energy into thermal and kinetic energy in the local universe. Understanding this process requires the reconstruction of cluster merger geometry, with careful consideration of projection effects. With its unprecedented spectral resolution, XRISM enables the disentanglement of merging cluster components along the line-of-sight via X-rays for the first time. In this letter, we focus on the massive cluster A1914, a puzzling case wherein the galaxy and dark matter distribution appear to be in tension with the X-ray morphology. We present XRISM observations of A1914 focusing on the velocity structure of the intracluster medium (ICM). The Resolve full-array spectrum requires two merging components along the line-of-sight, with bulk velocities offset by $\sim$1000 km/s and velocity dispersions of $\sim$200 km/s. The sub-array maps of flux ratios, bulk velocity, and velocity dispersion show the two components are offset and overlapping in the plane of the sky, consistent with a major (mass ratio $\sim$3), near line-of-sight merger with a pericenter distance of $\sim$200 kpc. We conclude that the two subclusters create an overlapping spiral pattern, referred to as a ''yin-yang'' merger. This scenario is further supported by tailored hydrodynamical simulations of the A1914 merger, demonstrating that this type of merger can broadly reproduce the observed X-ray morphology, gas temperature map, gas velocity maps, dark matter distribution, and galaxy velocities. This work demonstrates the power of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, provided by XRISM, to resolve complex cluster merger geometries.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Dark Matter Prompt and Secondary Signatures in Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf Spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are very promising laboratories for the indirect search for dark matter (DM), due to their low astrophysical background in radio and gamma-ray frequencies. This is convenient when considering Weakly Interacting Dark Matter (WIMP) that can annihilate and produce radio continuum emission. Radio detections of dSph galaxies, however, prove to be difficult and motivate the consideration of transient galaxies that have just recently become quiescent.
  For the past several decades, the prompt emission from DM annihilation signatures has been explored through modeling and the setting of limits. In addition to the prompt annihilation signatures from neutrinos, gamma-rays, electrons, positrons, and antimatter, the secondary emission from charged annihilation products undergoing radiative loss processes also contributes to the picture. For instance, synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering of charged products such as electrons and positrons can provide a significant signal. The quantitative modeling of this secondary emission with the astrophysical background is necessary to place stringent constraints on the nature of DM.
  In this work, the multi-wavelength secondary spectrum of DM annihilation for a dwarf galaxy is calculated using the open-source code CRPropa 3.2, which enables the self-consistent treatment of the astrophysical background and secondary emissions. We present a systematic comparison of signatures from conventional astrophysical processes to those expected from DM annihilation. The morphological differences between the two scenarios are investigated. Tests of the impact of different magnetic fields, DM masses, and DM profiles will be performed in the next steps.</description>

      <title>Where did heavy binaries go? Gravitational-wave populations using Delaunay triangulation with optimized complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the joint mass-redshift evolution of the binary black hole merger rate in the latest gravitational-wave detection catalog, GWTC-4.0. We present and apply a novel non-parametric framework for modeling multi-dimensional, correlated distributions based on Delaunay triangulation. Crucially, the complexity of the model -- namely, the number, positions, and weights of triangulation nodes -- is inferred directly from the data, resulting in a highly efficient approach that requires about one to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and significantly less calibration than current state-of-the-art methods. We find no evidence for a peak at $M_{\mathrm{tot}} \sim 70\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ at low redshift ($z \sim 0.2$), where it would correspond to the $m_1 \sim 35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ feature reported in redshift-independent mass spectrum analyses, and we infer an increased merger rate at high redshift $(z \sim 1)$ around those masses, compatible with such a peak. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these results.</description>

      <title>Probing the Origin of X-ray Flares in the Low-Hard State of GRS 1915+105 Using AstroSat and NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a detailed time-resolved spectral study of GRS 1915+105 during its low-flux rebrightening phase using the broadband capabilities of AstroSat and NuSTAR in May-June 2019. The AstroSat light curves revealed erratic X-ray flares with count rates rising by a factor of $\sim$5. Flares with simultaneous LAXPC and SXT coverage were segmented and fitted using two degenerate but physically motivated spectral models: a reflection-dominated model (hereafter Model A) and an absorption-dominated model (hereafter Model B). In Model A, the inner disk radius $(R_{in})$ shows a broken power-law dependence on flux, indicating rapid inward motion of the disk at higher flux levels. In contrast, Model B shows variable column density in the range of $10^{23}$ to $10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, displaying a strong anti-correlation with flux. Both models exhibit significant variation in the ionization parameter between low- and high-flux segments. The total unabsorbed luminosity in the 0.7--30~keV energy range ranged from $6.64 \times 10^{36}$ to $6.33 \times 10^{38}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. Across both models, several spectral parameters exhibited step-function-like behavior around flux thresholds of $5$--$10 \times 10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, indicating multiple spectral regimes. The disc flux contribution, more evident in Model B, increased with total flux, supporting an intrinsic origin for the variability. These findings point to a complex interplay between intrinsic disk emission, structured winds, and variable local absorption in driving the flare activity.</description>

      <title>Jet-driven explosion of an accretion-induced white-dwarf collapse via a magnetorotational dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a rotating white dwarf (WD) offers a potential site of millisecond pulsars/magnetars, gamma-ray bursts, and r-process nucleosynthesis. We present three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations including neutrinos of magnetorotational AIC, assuming the WD is rapidly spinning with a weak magnetic field confined below its surface (likely a prerequisite for rapid rotation). Within milliseconds after core bounce, the magnetic field is exponentially amplified near the surface of the proto-neutron star (PNS). We witness the emergence of a small-scale turbulent and mean-field, large-scale MRI-driven dynamo in the neutrino-cooled centrifugally supported disk formed around the PNS, which generates bundles of large-scale toroidal field with alternating polarity. The amplified field becomes buoyant and is advected above the PNS, generating a magnetic tower that drives a mildly relativistic striped jet. The jet breaks out of the WD, clearing the way for a powerful magnetized neutron-rich wind from the disk. Although our simulation cannot follow the long-term Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling phase of the PNS, the conditions are ripe for the formation of a GRB powered by magnetar spin-down. A similar dynamo may operate in magnetorotational core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers.</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties of oscillating, viscous, transonic accretion disks around black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the time evolution of sub-Keplerian transonic accretion flow onto a non-rotating black hole using axisymmetric viscous hydrodynamic simulations. We simulate the accretion flow using boundary values from semi-analytical analysis and set up three different models. Two of the models do not predict accretion shocks from the semi-analytic analysis, while one of them does. We also consider radiative cooling along with viscosity in the simulation. Our two-dimensional simulation deviated from the one-dimensional semi-analytical solution and admitted shocks in all three models. Viscous dissipation tends to push the shock front outward, and radiative cooling will push it in. Additionally, gravity is attractive. Depending on the competing strengths of all three processes, it may trigger shock oscillation. Different rates of angular-momentum transport in various layers may trigger eddies, which will enhance the shock oscillation. We show that any simple power law cannot approximate these solutions. We find that hot and higher angular-momentum flow requires higher viscosity to produce oscillatory shocks. From the temporal variation of the luminosity, shock oscillations generate QPOs in the range of sub-Hertz to a few Hertz frequencies if a ten solar mass black hole is assumed.</description>

      <title>Empirical correlation between masses of black holes and Wolf-Rayet stars derived from their mass distributions in spectroscopic binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observationally determined mass distributions of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in WR+OB binaries and black holes (BH) in spectroscopic binaries. Both WR and BH mass probability distributions can be well approximated by unbiased log-normal functions. Assuming that all WR stars with $M_\mathrm{WR}\gtrsim 6 M_\odot$ after core collapse are progenitors of the BHs, the similar shape of their mass distributions before and after collapse suggests a power-law relation between them $M_{\mathrm{BH}} \simeq (0.39\pm0.09) {M_{\mathrm{WR}}}^{1.13\pm0.09}$. Using the relation between masses of a WR star and its CO-core, we obtain the empirical relation between the BH mass and CO-core of the collapsing WR star $M_\mathrm{BH}\sim 0.9 M_\mathrm{CO}$, which can be used in the population synthesis calculations.</description>

      <title>A Search for High-Energy Emission from the Remnant of Supernova 1181</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the previous millennium, only five Galactic supernovae were observed and recorded by contemporary astronomers, and their current-day counterparts subsequently identified. The remnants of four of these have all been very deeply studied, and ultimately detected, by TeV instruments after exposures of typically hundreds of hours. The measured TeV fluxes range from 1 Crab (by definition) down to 0.3% Crab. The location of the fifth supernova remnant tied to a historical record of its supernova (SN 1181) has never been studied at TeV energies. The reason for this is simple - the associated remnant was only identified as such in 2021. The remnant, Pa 30, is an unusual object whose properties are best explained as resulting from a Type Iax supernova explosion. These are a rare sub-type of Type Ia supernovae in which the merging white dwarfs are not fully destroyed by the supernova explosion, leading to a double-degenerate merger product colorfully described as a 'zombie star'. We will present the results of a search for TeV gamma-ray emission from Pa 30 with VERITAS.</description>

      <title>Density constraint of the warm absorber in NGC 5548</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Ionized outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are thought to influence the evolution of their host galaxies and super-massive black holes (SMBHs). Distance is important to understand the kinetic power of the outflows as a cosmic feedback channel. However, the distance of the outflows with respect to the central engine is poorly constrained. The density of the outflows is an essential parameter for estimating the distance of the outflows. NGC 5548 exhibits a variety of spectroscopic features in its archival spectra, which can be used for density analysis. Aims. We aim to use the variability of the absorption lines from the archival spectra to obtain a density constraint and then estimate the distance of the outflows. Methods. We used the archival observations of NGC 5548 taken with Chandra in January 2002 to search for variations of the absorption lines. Results. We found that the Mg XII Ly${\alpha}$ and the O VIII Ly${\beta}$ absorption lines have significant variation on the 144 ks time scale and the 162 ks time scale during the different observation periods. Based on the variability timescales and the physical properties of the variable components that dominated these two absorption lines, we derive a lower limit on the density of the variable warm absorber components in the range of $7.2-9.0{\times}10^{11} m^{-3}$, and an upper limit on their distance from the central source in the range of 0.2-0.5 pc.</description>

      <title>Morphology of Young Massive Stellar Clusters with Next-Generation IACTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term PeVatron designates astrophysical objects capable of accelerating particles to PeV energies. Their nature and particle acceleration mechanisms are uncertain, but ultra-high-energy gamma rays are produced when particles accelerated by either leptonic or hadronic PeVatrons interact with the surrounding medium or radiation fields. The atmospheric air shower observatory LHAASO detected photons with energies above 100 TeV from 43 sources in the Galactic Plane, proving the existence of PeVatrons within the Milky Way. In particular, one of the detections was a 1.4 PeV photon in spatial correspondence with Cygnus OB2, providing a strong hint that young massive stellar clusters (YMSCs) can act as PeVatrons. The next-generation Cherenkov telescopes will have unprecedented energy and angular resolution. Therefore, they will be able to resolve spatially YMSCs better than LHAASO. We focused on a sample of 5 YMSCs and their environments visible from either hemisphere with the CTAO or ASTRI Mini-Array. We modeled the gamma-ray emission above 1 TeV. We devised methods for classifying YMSCs that could be detected as unidentified extended TeV sources and estimated the observational time needed to distinguish the morphology of different classes of sources. We study the morphology of the sources in our sample in order to identify the main features. We simulated observations of all sources with the instrument response function (IRF) of CTAO or ASTRI Mini-Array. We compare their emission distribution to the one of the TeV halos observed by HAWC. We parametrize their radial profiles in order to develop methodologies to classify them and to distinguish YMSCs from TeV halos based on their morphology. We expect some feature, such as the emission peak, to be key in differentiating between the two classes of objects. We then test them on a sample of sources of the first LHAASO catalog.</description>

      <title>Classification of Unidentified Extended LHAASO Sources based on their Gamma-Ray Morphology: Prospects for Future IACTs</title>

Abstract: While Supernova Remnants (SNRs) are widely considered the primary accelerators of cosmic rays (CRs) up to hundreds of TeV, they struggle to account for the CR flux at PeV energies, suggesting the existence of additional PeVatrons. Observations from LHAASO (Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory) have identified several PeVatron candidates, including some SNRs, pulsar wind nebulae, TeV halos and young massive star clusters (YMSCs). These objects accelerate particles that interact with the surrounding interstellar medium and radiation fields, producing very-high-energy gamma rays (&gt;100 TeV), a key signature of both leptonic and hadronic PeVatrons. We simulate and model the emission of TeV halos and YMSCs, adopting radial emission profiles derived from observational data. Given the current angular resolution of gamma-ray instruments, these profiles often appear similar, making it challenging to distinguish between source classes. We explore how next-generation Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), namely the CTAO (Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory) and the ASTRI Mini-Array (Astrofisica con Specchi a Tecnologia Replicante Italiana), can classify these sources based on their morphology. We test our classification methods, derived from the profile features of known sources, on simulated CTAO and ASTRI Mini-Array observations of unidentified extended sources from the first LHAASO catalog. We present the results of our analysis to highlight the potential of future IACT observations in identifying the nature of extended gamma-ray sources, refining PeVatron candidate classifications, and improving our understanding of cosmic-ray accelerators.</description>

      <title>Formation and Diagnostic Use of Carbon Lines in Stripped-Envelope Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon is one of the main end products of nucleosynthesis in massive stars. In this work, we study the emission signatures of carbon in spectra of stripped envelope supernovae (SESNe). A grid of model nebular spectra is created using the NLTE radiative transfer code SUMO, with stellar evolution- and explosion models as inputs. In the models, [C I] {\lambda}8727 and [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 are identified as the only significant optical carbon lines, with contribution from both the O/C and He/C zones. To obtain estimates of L_[C I] {\lambda}8727, which is blended with the Ca II triplet, we introduce and apply the CaNARY code, a publicly available Monte Carlo scattering code. We study carbon lines in a sample of SESNe, and find that luminosities of [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 relative to the optical spectrum increase with time, just as in our model grid. However, the relative luminosities of both [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 and [C I] {\lambda}8727 are overproduced in our models. Multiple explanations for this discrepancy, such as too high carbon abundances in the stellar evolution models and underestimated cooling through molecule formation, are investigated. For those SNe where both lines are clearly observed, we use an analytical formalism to constrain their ejected carbon masses to the range ~0.2 - 2 Msun. However, several SNe yield upper limits of 0.05 Msun. We also show that [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 is a useful line to diagnose both carbon mass and the extent of the He/C zone. We strongly encourage observers and instrumentalists to target [C I] {\lambda}{\lambda}9824, 9850 in future SN observing campaigns.</description>

      <title>Two-moment cosmic ray transport in RAMSES</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) are an important source of feedback in a variety of astrophysical contexts. Magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations treating CRs as a fluid have shown that how their feedback operates is strongly dependent on their transport properties such as diffusion and streaming. In this paper we introduce the numerical implementation, in the adaptive-mesh-refinement MHD code RAMSES, of the grey two-moment formulation of CR fluid dynamics, which follows the energy density and its associated three-dimensional flux. This method is tested for CR diffusion, streaming, and advection in a series of multi-dimensional tests including shocks to check the robustness and stability of this numerical two-moment CRMHD solver. We finally use the new two-moment CR implementation in a complex simulation of an isolated galactic disc producing galaxy-wide outflows launched by small-scale supernova explosions, and compare it with a previously existing one-moment formulation in the same code.</description>

      <title>Black holes black out: total absorption in time-dependent scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover a new class of phenomena in gravitational physics, whereby resonances in the complex plane can be excited via tailored time-dependent scattering. We show that specific forms of temporal modulation of an incoming signal can lead to complete absorption for the entire duration of the scattering process. This, then, makes stars and black holes truly black. Such ``virtual absorption'' stores energy with high efficiency, releasing it once the process finishes via relaxation into the characteristic virtual absorption modes -- also known as total transmission modes -- of the object. While such modes are challenging to obtain and four-dimensional black holes have a restricted set of solutions, we also show that higher dimensional black holes have a complex and interesting structure of virtual absorption modes.</description>

      <title>Nulling baryonic feedback in weak lensing surveys using cross-correlations with fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryonic feedback is a leading contaminant in studying dark matter and cosmology using cosmic shear. This has meant omitting much of the data during cosmological inference, or forward-modeling the spatial distribution of gas around dark matter halos using analytical or hydrodynamical models for baryonic feedback, which introduces nuisance parameters and model dependence. We propose a novel method of ``baryon nulling'' using cross-correlations between shear maps and fast radio burst (FRB) dispersion measures. By directly subtracting the dark matter--dispersion measure cross-correlation, the sensitivity of our nulled power spectra to feedback effects can be significantly reduced without any explicit feedback modeling. Using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamic simulations, whose power spectra span a wide yet realistic range of feedback variations, we demonstrate that our method reduces sensitivity to feedback modeling at $k \approx 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ by about an order of magnitude. This points toward a strong synergy between the next generation of sensitive FRB surveys such as CHORD and the DSA-2000, and cosmic shear surveys such as Rubin, Euclid, and Roman.</description>

      <title>A Bolometric Luminosity Correction Recipe for AGN at Any Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how active galactic nuclei (AGN) affect their host galaxies requires determining their total radiative power across all wavelengths (i.e., bolometric luminosities). We show how AGN accretion disk spectral energy distribution (SED) templates, parameterized by supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, Eddington ratio, spin, and inclination, can be used to estimate total radiated luminosities. Bolometric luminosities are calculated by integrating the accretion disk SEDs from 1$\mu$m to 10keV over $0^\circ$--$90^\circ$ inclinations, ensuring consistent treatment of wavelength gaps, avoiding double-counting reprocessed emission, and accounting for anisotropy of visible--UV emission at different inclinations. The SED, and resulting bolometric corrections, depend strongly on SMBH mass and Eddington ratio, but only weakly on spin and inclination. Increasing SMBH mass produces cooler disks peaking at lower frequencies, whereas higher Eddington ratios (and spins) yield hotter disks peaking at higher frequencies. Larger inclinations suppress the visible--UV portion of the SED, whereas X-ray emission remains nearly isotropic. Bolometric corrections in the visible--NUV range (5100\AA-3000\AA) show strong dependence on SMBH mass, while X-ray bolometric corrections depend strongly on the Eddington ratio. Near the SED peak (FUV; $\sim$1450\AA), parameter dependencies are weak, making this band particularly robust for estimating bolometric corrections. The X-ray band is reliable, though dependence on the Eddington ratio introduces a wide dynamic range. Because our SEDs are intrinsic and defined in the rest-frame, their application to Type 1 AGN is straightforward. For other AGN, however, corrections for obscuration by the host galaxy and torus are required in many cases.</description>

      <title>Effects of multidimensional treatment of gravity in simulations on supernova gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova explosions are expected as one of the promising candidates for gravitational wave sources. In this study, we examine the supernova gravitational waves, focusing on the multidimensional treatment of gravity in the simulation. For this purpose, we newly performed two-dimensional relativistic simulations with a nonmonopole (two-dimensional) potential and compared the resultant gravitational wave signals in the simulations with the frequencies of the proto-neutron stars with and without the Cowling approximation. Then, we find that the proto-neutron star frequencies with the Cowling approximation overestimate the gravitational wave frequencies. On the other hand, the frequencies of the proto-neutron star oscillations with metric perturbations agree well with the gravitational wave signals in the simulations. Employing the new data, we derive a new fitting formula for the supernova gravitational wave frequencies with the two-dimensional gravitational potential, independently of the progenitor mass. Combining this new formula with the previous one derived from the Cowling approximation, we also derive the formula to predict the gravitational wave frequencies with a two-dimensional potential, using those with a monopole potential.</description>

      <title>Chronology Protection of Rotating Black Holes in a Viable Lorentz-Violating Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study causal properties of the recently found rotating black-hole solution in the low-energy sector of Horava gravity as a viable Lorentz-violating (LV) gravity in four dimensions with the LV Maxwell field and a cosmological constant $\Lambda (&gt;-3/a^2)$ for an arbitrary rotation parameter $a$. The region of non-trivial causality violation containing closed timelike curves is exactly the same as in the Kerr-Newman or the Kerr-Newman-(Anti-)de Sitter solution. Nevertheless, chronology is protected in the new rotating black hole because the causality violating region becomes physically inaccessible by exterior observers due to the new three-curvature singularity at its boundary that is topologically two-torus including the usual ring singularity at $(r,\theta)=(0,\pi/2)$. As a consequence, the physically accessible region outside the torus singularity is causal everywhere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity describes the dynamics of gravitational waves, which can feature nonlinear interactions, such as those underlying turbulent processes. Theoretical and numerical explorations have demonstrated the existence of gravitational wave turbulence, of which a full and general mathematical description is currently not known. Here, we take essential steps towards such a theory. Leveraging a formulation exactly recasting general relativity as a set of nonlinear electrodynamics equations, we demonstrate that general relativity admits an Elsasser formulation -- the same type of equation underpinning magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We further show that nonlinear interactions described by this equation are in part Alfv\'enic, linking gravitational wave turbulence to Alfv\'enic turbulence. Our work paves the way for a new understanding of nonlinear gravitational wave dynamics through insights from magnetohydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Analytical modeling of polarization signals arising from confined circumstellar material in Type II supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of Type II supernovae (SNe) have brought a challenge in our understanding on the final evolutionary stage of massive stars. The early-time spectra and light curves of Type II SNe suggest that a majority of them have dense circumstellar material (CSM) in their vicinity, the so-called confined CSM. However, the mechanism of these extensive mass loss has not yet been understood. For addressing this problem, we aim to study the spatial distribution of the confined CSM, which has important information on the mechanism. We analytically calculate the polarization signals created by electron scatterings within disk-like confined CSM, and apply the results to the case of SN 2023ixf. The calculated polarization angle remains fixed at the angle aligned with the CSM disk axis, and is insensitive to the disk parameters. The calculated polarization degree evolves over a timescale of &lt; 10 days, depending on the disk parameters: it stays constant or increases slightly while the unshocked CSM is optically thick, peaks as it becomes optically thin, and drops to zero when the shock reaches the disk's outer edge. We also find that the time evolution of the polarization in Type II SNe with confined CSM can be used for estimating the CSM parameters. In particular, the maximum degree and the rise time are strongly connected to the values of the viewing angle and the opening angle of the CSM disk, while the duration and the decline time are sensitive to the values of the mass and extension of the CSM disk. We demonstrate that the time evolution of the polarization of SN 2023ixf can be explained with a disk-like CSM. This information of the CSM is a strong constraint on the mechanism to create the confined CSM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of polarimetric parameters of active galactic nuclei motivate the study of polarization in the spacetime of exotic compact objects which can mimic the features of black holes in the strong field regime of gravity. In this work, we study the properties of two models for ultra-compact objects containing light rings - relativistic fluid spheres and gravastars. We have simulated the orbit of a hot spot around the considered objects in the polarization ray-tracing software GYOTO, and extracted observables, namely integrated images of the Stokes parameters I, Q, U; their evolution during the orbit in the QU-plane, and the electric vector position angle (EVPA). Our models resemble the black hole qualitatively, with slight additional imprints which provide a useful tool to constrain the spacetime metric of supermassive compact objects with current and future observations, and probe the fundamental properties of these objects. We have found that one fluid star model with a pressure singularity resembles the black hole entirely, while another gravastar features notable differences in the EVPA curve in the low-inclination case. Since differences between the models become more pronounced for a higher inclination, our results could potentially restrict the adequateness of ECO classes with future high-inclination observations.</description>

Abstract: We use the Monte Carlo For AGN (active galactic nucleus) Channel Testing and Simulation (McFACTS, https://www.github.com/mcfacts/mcfacts) code to study the effect of AGN disk and nuclear star cluster parameters on predicted mass distributions for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) compact binaries forming in AGN disks. The assumptions we vary include the black hole (BH) initial mass function, disk model, disk size, disk lifetime, and the prograde-to-retrograde fraction of newly formed black hole binaries. Broadly we find that dense, moderately short-lived AGN disks are preferred for producing a $(q,\chi_{\rm eff})$ anti-correlation like those identified from existing gravitational wave (GW) observations. Additionally, a BH initial mass function (MF $\propto M^{-2}$) is preferred over a more top-heavy MF ($M^{-1}$). The preferred fraction of prograde-to-retrograde is $&gt;90\%$, to produce results consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Comparison of magnetic diffusion and reconnection in ideal and resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, ideal magnetodynamics, and resistive force-free electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy astrophysical systems and compact objects are frequently modeled using ideal relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) or force-free electrodynamic (FFE) simulations, with the underlying assumption that the discretisation from the numerical scheme introduces an effective (numerical) magnetic resistivity that adequately resembles an explicit resistivity. However, it is crucial to note that numerical resistivity can fail to replicate essential features of explicit resistivity. In this study, we compare the 1D resistive decay and 2D reconnection properties of four commonly used physical models. We demonstrate that the 1D Ohmic decay of current sheets via numerical dissipation in both ideal MHD and magnetodynamics (MD) is subdiffusive (i.e., sub-linear in time), whereas explicit resistive FFE and resistive MHD simulations match the predictions of resistive theory adequately. For low-resolution, reconnecting current sheets in 2D, we show that ideal MHD and MD have an analogue to the Sweet--Parker regime where the scaling of the reconnection rate depends directly on the resolution. At high resolutions, ideal MHD and MD have an asymptotic reconnection rate similar to resistive MHD. Furthermore, we find that guide field-balanced current sheets in ideal MHD and MD have a qualitative structure similar to that of one in resistive MHD. Similarly, a pressure-balanced current sheet in ideal MHD is found to have a qualitative structure similar to that of one in resistive MHD. For a guide field-balanced sheet, resistive FFE is found to have a nearly identical Sweet--Parker regime compared to resistive MHD and a similar asymptotic reconnection rate for large enough Lundquist numbers, but differs in the timescale for reconnection onset in the asymptotic regime. We discuss the implications of our findings for global simulations.</description>

Abstract: The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer is an X-ray observatory measuring the X-ray polarization in the 2-8 keV energy range. Highly sensitive to the system's geometry, X-ray polarization is a unique method to probe the structure of X-ray binaries. The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer observed the High-Mass X-ray Binary Cygnus X-1 and the Low-Mass X-ray Binary Swift J1727.8-1613 in different accretion states: in the hard state and in the soft state. The X-ray polarimetry analysis of both sources shows a linear polarization degree increasing with energy, with higher values in the hard state than in the soft state. However, the linear polarization angle stays similar in both states and is aligned with the radio jet within $5^\circ$. Furthermore, the Low-Mass X-ray Binary Swift J1727.8-1613 has a lower optical intrinsic polarization and a lower X-ray polarization degree for a softer spectrum. The similarities observed in this analysis between the X-ray polarization results of different types of X-ray Binaries show that the innermost accretion processes are independent of the companion star's type.</description>

      <title>The soft X-ray transient EP241021a: A cosmic explosion with a complex off-axis jet and cocoon from a massive progenitor</title>

Abstract: X-ray flashes (XRFs) are fast X-ray transients thought to be softer analogs of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). With its soft X-ray sensitivity, the Einstein Probe (EP) provides a unique opportunity to study these events. We report multiwavelength observations of EP241021a, a soft X-ray transient detected by EP, and interpret its afterglow in the context of leading XRF models. The prompt emission was observed by EP-WXT and Fermi-GBM, followed by a broad campaign across radio (uGMRT, ATCA, e-MERLIN, ALMA), optical (LBT, GTC, CAHA), and X-rays (EP-FXT). Light curves and spectra were analyzed with both empirical and physical models of GRBs and spherical expansions (both nonrelativistic and mildly relativistic cocoons). The afterglow shows multiple components, consistent with a structured jet interacting with a complex environment. The early optical and X-ray decline is explained by wide, low-Lorentz-factor ($\gamma \sim 40$) wings, while a rebrightening at approximately 7 days arises from the off-axis jet core. Radio data require an additional mildly relativistic cocoon ($\gamma \sim 2$), and a late (70 days) spectral component peaking at 50 GHz suggests a second, slower cocoon ($\gamma \sim 1$).</description>

      <title>X-ray emission of the Nuclear Stellar Disk as seen by SRG/ART-XC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nuclear Stellar Disk (NSD), together with the Nuclear Stellar Cluster and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*, forms the central region of the Milky Way. Galactic X-ray background emission is known to be associated with the old stellar population, predominantly produced by accreting white dwarfs. In this work we characterize the X-ray emission of the Galactic Center (GC) region using wide-field observations with the ART-XC telescope on board the SRG observatory in the 4-12 keV energy band. Our analysis demonstrates that the X-ray emission of the GC at a spatial scale of a few hundred parsecs is dominated by the regularly shaped NSD aligned in the Galactic plane, and characterized by latitudinal and longitudinal scale heights of approximately 20 pc and approximately 100 pc, respectively. The measured flux, 6.8 (+0.1, -0.3) x 10^-10 erg/s/cm^2 in the 4-12 keV band, corresponds to a luminosity of 5.9 (+0.1, -0.3) x 10^36 erg/s, assuming the GC distance of 8.178 kpc. The average mass-normalized X-ray emissivity of the NSD, 5.6 (+0.5, -0.7) x 10^27 erg/s/M_sun, exceeds the corresponding value of the Galactic ridge by a factor of 3.3 (+0.4, -0.5), confirming other studies. We also perform a deprojection of the observed NSD surface brightness distribution in order to construct a three-dimensional X-ray luminosity density model, which can be directly compared to the existing 3D stellar mass models. Finally, we conclude that the spatial distribution of the X-ray emission from the NSD is consistent with the most recent stellar mass density distribution model within 30%, which suggests that this emission is dominated by unresolved point X-ray sources rather than by diffuse X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>Imaging the positron annihilation line with 20 years of INTEGRAL/SPI observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The e$^+$ e$^-$ annihilation line at 511 keV provides a unique probe for studying the distribution and origin of positrons in our Galaxy. The SPI spectrometer on INTEGRAL has observed this gamma-ray line for two decades. We analyze 20 years of INTEGRAL/SPI observations to produce the most sensitive all-sky map of the 511 keV line emission to date, aiming to reveal new features and provide refined measurements of known sources. We perform image deconvolution using the RL algorithm and employ bootstrap analysis to evaluate statistical uncertainties of fluxes from regions of interest. Systematic uncertainties in parameter choices are also considered. We utilize GPU acceleration to enable this computationally intensive analysis. The reconstructed image successfully recovers the basic morphological features reported in model-fitting studies: a bright central component, a broad bulge, and an elongated disk component along the Galactic plane. We also report hints of new spatial features in the reconstructed image, including an asymmetric structure in the broad bulge emission and 511 keV emission potentially associated with massive stars from the Sco-Cen and other OB associations. While the significance of these new features is marginal ($\sim 2\sigma$), they are spatially consistent with $^{26}$Al emission from massive stars in that region, suggesting that this 511 keV emission originates from its $\beta^{+}$ decay. Our 20-year dataset provides the most detailed 511 keV emission map to date, reproducing global structures suggested in model-fitting approach while revealing hints of new spatial features. These findings provide insights into the origin of Galactic positrons and propagation of low-energy positrons in the interstellar medium. Future MeV gamma-ray observations, such as COSI, are expected to confirm the reported features and shed further light on the nature of positrons in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Equation of State Extrapolation Systematics: Parametric vs. Nonparametric Inference of Neutron Star Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equation of state (EOS) of cold dense matter is a central open problem in nuclear astrophysics. Its inference is hindered by the lack of \textit{ab initio} control above about twice nuclear saturation density, requiring extrapolation. Parametric schemes such as piecewise polytropes (PP) are efficient but restrictive, while nonparametric approaches like Gaussian processes (GP) allow more flexibility at the cost of larger prior volumes. We extend our hybrid EOS framework by replacing the high-density polytropic extension with a GP representation of the squared sound speed, anchored at low densities by the SLy crust EOS and a nuclear meta-model constrained by $\chi$EFT and laboratory data. Using hierarchical Bayesian analysis, we jointly constrain the EOS and neutron star mass distribution with multi-messenger observations, including NICER radii, GW170817 and GW190425 tidal deformabilities, pulsar masses, and neutron skin experiments. We examine four scenarios defined by high-density extrapolation (PP vs.\ GP) and hotspot geometry in the NICER modeling of PSR~J0030$+$0451 (ST+PDT vs.\ PDT-U). GP extrapolations generally yield softer EOS posteriors with broader uncertainties. Hotspot assumptions also play an important role, shifting inferred mass--radius relations. Bayesian evidence strongly favors the ST+PDT geometry over PDT-U under both extrapolations, while GP is mildly preferred over PP. These results underscore the impact of observational modeling and EOS extrapolation on neutron star inferences, and show that a GP-based extension offers a robust way to quantify systematic uncertainties in high-density matter.</description>

      <title>Ringdown mode amplitudes of precessing binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ringdown phase of a binary black-hole merger encodes key information about the remnant properties and provides a direct probe of the strong-field regime of General Relativity. While quasi-normal mode frequencies and damping times are well understood within black-hole perturbation theory, their excitation amplitudes remain challenging to model, as they depend on the merger phase. The complexity increases for precessing black-hole binaries, where multiple emission modes can contribute comparably to the ringdown. In this paper, we investigate the phenomenology of precessing binary black hole ringdowns using the SXS numerical relativity simulations catalog. Precession significantly impacts the ringdown excitation amplitudes and the related mode hierarchy. Using Gaussian process regression, we construct the first fits for the ringdown amplitudes of the most relevant modes in precessing systems.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Hyperboloidal Extraction of Gravitational Waves in 3+1 Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework to propagate to null infinity gravitational waves computed at timelike worldtubes in the interior of a 3+1 (Cauchy) numerical relativity simulations. In our method, numerical relativity data are used as the inner inflowing boundary of a perturbative time-domain Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli simulation in hyperboloidal coordinates that reaches null infinity. We showcase waveforms from (3+1)D simulations of gravitational collapse of rotating neutron stars, binary black holes mergers and scattering, and binary neutron star mergers and compare them to other extrapolation methods. Our perturbative hyperboloidal extraction provides a simple yet efficient procedure to compute gravitational waves with data quality comparable to the Cauchy characteristic extraction for several practical applications. Nonlinear effects in the wave propagation are not captured by our method, but the present work is a stepping stone towards more sophisticated hyperboloidal schemes for gravitational-wave extraction.</description>
