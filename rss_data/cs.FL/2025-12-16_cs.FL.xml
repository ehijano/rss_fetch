      <title>Probabilistic Programming Meets Automata Theory: Exact Inference using Weighted Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic programs encode stochastic models as ordinary-looking programs with primitives for sampling numbers from predefined distributions and conditioning. Their applications include, among many others, machine learning and modeling of autonomous systems. The analysis of probabilistic programs is often quantitative - it involves reasoning about numerical properties like probabilities and expectations. A particularly important quantitative property of probabilistic programs is their posterior distribution, i.e., the distribution over possible outputs for a given input (or prior) distribution. Computing the posterior distribution exactly is known as exact inference. We present our current research using weighted automata, a generalization of the well-known finite automata, for performing exact inference in a restricted class of discrete probabilistic programs. This is achieved by encoding distributions over program variables - possibly with infinite support - as certain weighted automata. The semantics of our programming language then corresponds to common automata-theoretic constructions, such as product, concatenation, and others.</description>

      <title>Hypergame Rationalisability: Solving Agent Misalignment In Strategic Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differences in perception, information asymmetries, and bounded rationality lead game-theoretic players to derive a private, subjective view of the game that may diverge from the underlying ground-truth scenario and may be misaligned with other players' interpretations. While typical game-theoretic assumptions often overlook such heterogeneity, hypergame theory provides the mathematical framework to reason about mismatched mental models. Although hypergames have recently gained traction in dynamic applications concerning uncertainty, their practical adoption in multi-agent system research has been hindered by the lack of a unifying, formal, and practical representation language, as well as scalable algorithms for managing complex hypergame structures and equilibria. Our work addresses this gap by introducing a declarative, logic-based domain-specific language for encoding hypergame structures and hypergame solution concepts. Leveraging answer-set programming, we develop an automated pipeline for instantiating hypergame structures and running our novel hypergame rationalisation procedure, a mechanism for finding belief structures that justify seemingly irrational outcomes. The proposed language establishes a unifying formalism for hypergames and serves as a foundation for developing nuanced, belief-based heterogeneous reasoners, offering a verifiable context with logical guarantees. Together, these contributions establish the connection between hypergame theory, multi-agent systems, and strategic AI.</description>

      <title>Slightly Non-Linear Higher-Order Tree Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the tree-to-tree functions computed by "affine $\lambda$-transducers": tree automata whose memory consists of an affine $\lambda$-term instead of a finite state. They can be seen as variations on Gallot, Lemay and Salvati's Linear High-Order Deterministic Tree Transducers.
  When the memory is almost purely affine ($\textit{\`a la}$ Kanazawa), we show that these machines can be translated to tree-walking transducers (and with a purely affine memory, we get a reversible tree-walking transducer). This leads to a proof of an inexpressivity conjecture of Nguy\^en and Pradic on "implicit automata" in an affine $\lambda$-calculus. We also prove that a more powerful variant, extended with preprocessing by an MSO relabeling and allowing a limited amount of non-linearity, is equivalent in expressive power to Engelfriet, Hoogeboom and Samwel's invisible pebble tree transducers.
  The key technical tool in our proofs is the Interaction Abstract Machine (IAM), an operational avatar of Girard's geometry of interaction, a semantics of linear logic. We work with ad-hoc specializations to $\lambda$-terms of low exponential depth of a tree-generating version of the IAM.</description>

      <title>Unambiguous and Co-Nondeterministic Computations of Finite Automata and Pushdown Automata Families and the Effects of Multiple Counters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonuniform families of polynomial-size finite automata and pushdown automata respectively have strong connections to nonuniform-NL and nonuniform-LOGCFL. We examine the behaviors of unambiguous and co-nondeterministic computations produced by such families of automata operating multiple counters, where a counter is a stack using only a single non-bottom symbol. As immediate consequences, we obtain various collapses of the complexity classes of families of promise problems solvable by finite and pushdown automata families when all valid instances are limited to either polynomially long strings or unary strings. A key technical ingredient of our proofs is an inductive counting of reachable vertices of each computation graph of finite and pushdown automata that operate multiple counters simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Certifying Robustness of Graph Convolutional Networks for Node Perturbation with Polyhedra Abstract Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) are powerful tools for learning graph-based knowledge representations from training data. However, they are vulnerable to small perturbations in the input graph, which makes them susceptible to input faults or adversarial attacks. This poses a significant problem for GCNs intended to be used in critical applications, which need to provide certifiably robust services even in the presence of adversarial perturbations. We propose an improved GCN robustness certification technique for node classification in the presence of node feature perturbations. We introduce a novel polyhedra-based abstract interpretation approach to tackle specific challenges of graph data and provide tight upper and lower bounds for the robustness of the GCN. Experiments show that our approach simultaneously improves the tightness of robustness bounds as well as the runtime performance of certification. Moreover, our method can be used during training to further improve the robustness of GCNs.</description>
