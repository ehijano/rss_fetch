      <title>Dirac mode localization in QCD near the crossover temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the localization properties of the low-lying Dirac eigenmodes in QCD near the crossover temperature, using staggered fermions on the lattice. We find that localized low modes, absent at low temperature, appear at a temperature $T_{\mathrm{loc}}$ in the range $155\,\mathrm{MeV}\le T_{\mathrm{loc}}\le 158\,\mathrm{MeV}$, in excellent agreement with the pseudocritical crossover temperature as determined from the chiral condensate and from the light-quark susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Structural dissection of hadronic molecules: The $D^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ family under QCD light-cone sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the static electromagnetic properties of three charm--strange molecular tetraquark candidates with quantum numbers $J^{P}=1^{+}$, namely the $D\bar{K}^{\ast}$, $D^{\ast}\bar{K}$, and $D^{\ast}\bar{K}^{\ast}$ systems. The analysis is carried out within the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules, using interpolating currents constructed from colour-singlet meson bilinears to reflect their molecular configurations. Both perturbative and non-perturbative photon contributions are included,and numerical predictions for the magnetic and electric quadrupole moments are obtained. The magnetic moments are found to lie in the range $1$--$3$ nuclear magnetons, with the largest value associated with the $D^{*}\bar{K}$ configuration. The quadrupole moments are an order of magnitude smaller, of order $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{fm}^{2}$, indicating only weak deviations from spherical charge distributions. A flavour decomposition shows that the magnetic response is dominated by the light quarks, while the charm-quark contribution is strongly suppressed, a feature naturally expected for loosely bound hadronic molecules. The present analysis extends QCD light-cone sum-rule studies of exotic hadrons by providing a systematic determination of the electromagnetic moments of the $D^{(\ast)}\bar K^{(\ast)}$ molecular systems. These results provide quantitative benchmarks that may help discriminate between molecular configurations and more compact multiquark interpretations and may offer useful guidance for future experimental studies of electromagnetic signatures of charm--strange exotic states.</description>

      <title>Unified Description of Pseudoscalar Meson Structure from Light to Heavy Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive review of the structure of pseudoscalar mesons within an algebraic model formulated in the light-front framework. The approach provides a unified description of leading-twist parton distribution amplitudes (PDAs), light-front wave functions (LFWFs), generalized parton distributions (GPDs), parton distribution functions (PDFs), elastic electromagnetic form factors (EFFs), charge radii, and impact-parameter GPDs (IPS-GPDs), all derived consistently from the same underlying Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes. Results are discussed for light ($\pi$, $K$), heavy-light ($D$, $D_s$, $B$, $B_s$, $B_c$), and heavy-heavy ($\eta_c$, $\eta_b$) pseudoscalar mesons, allowing for a systematic analysis of the role played by quark-mass asymmetry and heavy-quark dynamics. The study highlights how increasing quark masses drive a transition from broad, asymmetric momentum distributions to increasingly symmetric and spatially compact configurations. Comparisons with lattice QCD, Dyson-Schwinger equation studies, and contact-interaction models are presented where available. Overall, the algebraic model offers a transparent and symmetry-consistent framework to explore the three-dimensional momentum and spatial structure of pseudoscalar mesons across all quark-mass regimes.</description>

      <title>Repulsively Bound Hadrons in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory is a paradigmatic model that exhibits gauge-field-mediated-confinement of pairs of particles into mesons, drawing connections to quantum chromodynamics. In the absence of any additional attractive interactions between particles, mesons are not known to bind in this model. Here, we show that resonant pair-production terms give rise to two separate mechanisms to form stable ``hadron'' bound states of two mesons: either induced by an effective attractive interaction, or a new dynamical binding mechanism induced by an effective repulsion. The repulsively bound hadron is a high-energy state stabilized by being energetically separated from the two-meson continuum through quantum fluctuations of the gauge fields. We study the dynamical formation of this bound state starting from local excitations. We use matrix product state techniques based on the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to perform our numerical simulations and analyze the effect of model parameters on hadron formation. Furthermore, we derive an effective model that explains its formation. Our findings are amenable to experimental observation on modern quantum hardware such as superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Forward-mode automatic differentiation for the tensor renormalization group and its relation to the impurity method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD) framework for tensor renormalization group (TRG) methods. In this approach, evaluating the derivatives of the partition function up to order $k$ increases the matrix-multiplication cost by a factor of $(k+1)(k+2)/2$ compared to computing the free energy alone, and the memory footprint is only $k+1$ times that of the original calculation. In the limit where the derivatives of the SVD are neglected, we establish a theoretical correspondence between our forward-mode AD and conventional impurity methods. Numerically, we find that the proposed AD algorithm can calculate internal energy and specific heat significantly higher accuracy than the impurity method at comparable computational cost. We also provide a practical procedure to extract critical exponents from derivatives of the renormalized tensor in TRG calculations in both two and three dimensions. In addition, we discuss how to efficiently differentiate an arbitrary tensor network.</description>
