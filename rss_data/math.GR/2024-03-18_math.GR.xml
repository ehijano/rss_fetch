      <title>The word problem and growth of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{WP}_G$ denote the word problem in a finitely generated group $G$. We consider the complexity of $\mathrm{WP}_G$ with respect to standard deterministic Turing machines. Let $\mathrm{DTIME}_k(t(n))$ be the complexity class of languages solved in time $O(t(n))$ by a Turing machine with $k$ tapes. We prove that $\mathrm{WP}_G\in\mathrm{DTIME}_1(n\log n)$ if and only if $G$ is virtually nilpotent. We relate the complexity of the word problem and the growth of groups by showing that $\mathrm{WP}_G\not\in \mathrm{DTIME}_1(o(n\log\gamma(n)))$, where $\gamma(n)$ is the growth function of $G$. We prove that $\mathrm{WP}_G\in\mathrm{DTIME}_k(n)$ for strongly contracting automaton groups, $\mathrm{WP}_G\in\mathrm{DTIME}_k(n\log n)$ for groups generated by bounded automata, and $\mathrm{WP}_G\in\mathrm{DTIME}_k(n(\log n)^d)$ for groups generated by polynomial automata. In particular, for the Grigorchuk group, $\mathrm{WP}_G\not\in\mathrm{DTIME}_1(n^{1.7674})$ and $\mathrm{WP}_G\in\mathrm{DTIME}_1(n^2)$.</description>

      <title>Borel Complexity of the Isomorphism Relation of Archimedean Orders in Finitely Generated Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2020, Calderoni, Marker, Motto Ros and Shani asked what the Borel complexity of the isomorphism relation of Archimedean orders on $\mathbb{Q}^n$ is. We answer this question by proving that the isomorphism relation of Archimedean orders on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is not hyperfinite when $n \geq 3$ and not treeable when $n \geq 4$. As a corollary, we get that the isomorphism relation of Archimedean orders on $\mathbb{Q}^n$ is not hyperfinite when $n \geq 3$ and not treeable when $n \geq 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the simple random walks in percolation clusters on hyperbolic groups, we show that the associated harmonic measures are exact dimensional and their Hausdorff dimensions are equal to the entropy over the speed. Our method is inspired by cluster relations introduced by Gaboriau and applies to a large class of random environments on the groups.</description>

Abstract: We show that the automorphism groups of right-angled Artin groups whose defining graphs have at least 3 vertices are not relatively hyperbolic. We then show that the outer automorphism groups are not relatively hyperbolic, if they are not virtually isomorphic to a right-angled Artin group whose defining graph is either a single vertex or disconnected.</description>

      <title>Maximal subgroups of a family of iterated monodromy groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.12503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Basilica group is a well-known 2-generated weakly branch, but not branch, group acting on the binary rooted tree. Recently a more general form of the Basilica group has been investigated by Petschick and Rajeev, which is an $s$-generated weakly branch, but not branch, group that acts on the $m$-adic tree, for $s,m &gt; 1$. A larger family of groups, which contains these generalised Basilica groups, is the family of iterated monodromy groups. With the new developments by Francoeur, the study of the existence of maximal subgroups of infinite index has been extended from branch groups to weakly branch groups. Here we show that a subfamily of iterated monodromy groups, which more closely resemble the generalised Basilica groups, have maximal subgroups only of finite index.</description>

Abstract: Let $ H $ be a subgroup of a finite group $ G $.

In this paper, we study the influence of some second minimal or second maximal subgroups of a Sylow subgroup satisfying the partial $ \Pi $-property on the structure of a finite group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1995 Grillet introduced the concept of a stratified semigroup as a kind of generalisation of finite nilsemigroups. We extend these ideas here by allowing a more general Base and describe them in terms of extensions of semigroups by stratified semigroups. We consider semillatices of certain types of group-bound semigroups and also semillatices of Clifford semigroups and show how to describe them as semilattices of these stratified extensions and provide a number of interesting examples.</description>

      <title>Non-locally discrete actions on the circle with at most $N$ fixed points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subgroup of $\mathrm{Homeo}_+(\mathbb{S}^1)$ is M\"obius-like if every element is conjugate to an element of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. In general, a M\"obius-like subgroup of $\mathrm{Homeo}_+(\mathbb{S}^1)$ is not necessarily (semi-)conjugate to a subgroup of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$, as discovered by N. Kova\v{c}evi\'{c} [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 351 (1999), 4823-4835]. Here we determine simple dynamical criteria for the existence of such a (semi-)conjugacy. We show that M\"obius-like subgroups of $\mathrm{Homeo}_+(\mathbb{S}^1)$ which are elementary (namely, preserving a Borel probability measure), are semi-conjugate to subgroups of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. On the other hand, we provide an example of elementary subgroup of $\mathrm{Diff}^\infty_+(\mathbb{S}^1)$ satisfying that every non-trivial element fixes at most 2 points, which is not isomorphic to any subgroup of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. Finally, we show that non-elementary, non-locally discrete subgroups acting with at most $N$ fixed points are conjugate to a dense subgroup of some finite central extension of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any right-angled Artin group $A_{\Gamma}$, Charney--Stambaugh--Vogtmann showed that the subgroup $U^0(A_{\Gamma}) \leq\text{Out}(A_{\Gamma})$ generated by Whitehead automorphisms and inversions acts properly and cocompactly on a contractible space $K_{\Gamma}$. In the present paper we show that any finite subgroup of $U^0(A_{\Gamma})$ fixes a point of $K_{\Gamma}$. This generalizes the fact that any finite subgroup of $\text{Out}(F_n)$ fixes a point of Outer Space, and implies that there are only finitely many conjugacy classes of finite subgroups in $U^0(A_{\Gamma})$.</description>

      <title>Strong almost finiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A countable, bounded degree graph is almost finite if it has a tiling with isomorphic copies of finitely many F\o lner sets, and we call it strongly almost finite, if the tiling can be randomized so that the probability that a vertex is on the boundary of a tile is uniformly small. We give various equivalents for strong almost finiteness. In particular, we prove that Property A together with a uniform version of amenability is equivalent to strong almost finiteness. Using these characterizations, we show that graphs of subexponential growth and Schreier graphs of amenable groups are always strongly almost finite, generalizing the celebrated result of Downarowicz, Huczek and Zhang about amenable Cayley graphs, based on graph theoretic rather than group theoretic principles. We give various equivalents to Property A for graphs, and show that if a sequence of graphs of Property A (in a uniform sense) converges to a graph $G$ in the neighborhood distance (a purely combinatorial analogue of the classical Benjamini-Schramm distance), then their Laplacian spectra converge to the Laplacian spectrum of $G$ in the Hausdorff distance. We apply the previous theory to construct a new and rich class of classifiable $C^{\star}$-algebras. Namely, we show that for any minimal strong almost finite graph $G$ there are naturally associated simple, nuclear, stably finite $C^{\star}$-algebras that are classifiable by their Elliott invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a complete description of the Poisson boundary of wreath products $A\wr B= \bigoplus_{B} A\rtimes B$ of countable groups $A$ and $B$, for probability measures $\mu$ with finite entropy where lamp configurations stabilize almost surely. If, in addition, the projection of $\mu$ to $B$ is Liouville, we prove that the Poisson boundary of $(A\wr B,\mu)$ is equal to the space of limit lamp configurations, endowed with the corresponding hitting measure. In particular, this answers an open question asked by Kaimanovich, and Lyons-Peres, for $B=\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\ge 3$, and measures $\mu$ with a finite first moment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending earlier work of Guralnick and of Cai and Zhang, we classify the almost simple groups which have transitive permutation representations of prime power degree $p^k$, and those which have $p$-complements (stabilisers of order coprime to $p$ in such representations). We deduce that every primitive permutation group of prime power degree has a regular subgroup, and that any two faithful primitive representations of a group, of the same prime power degree, are equivalent under automorphisms. In general, $p$-complements in a finite group can be inequivalent under automorphisms, or even non-isomorphic. We extend examples of such phenomena due to Buturlakin, Revin and Nesterov by showing that the number of inequivalent classes of complements can be arbitrarily large. Questions concerning the existence of prime power representations and $p$-complements in groups with socle ${\rm PSL}_d(q)$ are related to some difficult open problems in Number Theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give sharp bounds in Breuillard, Green and Tao's finitary version of Gromov's theorem on groups with polynomial growth. Precisely, we show that for every non-negative integer d there exists $c=c(d)&gt;0$ such that if $G$ is a group with finite symmetric generating set $S$ containing the identity and $|S^n|\le cn^{d+1}|S|$ for some positive integer $n$ then there exist normal subgroups $H\le\Gamma\le G$ such that $H\subseteq S^n$, such that $\Gamma/H$ is $d$-nilpotent (i.e. has a central series of length $d$ with cyclic factors), and such that $[G:\Gamma]\le g(d)$, where $g(d)$ denotes the maximum order of a finite subgroup of $GL_d(\mathbb{Z})$. The bounds on both the nilpotence and index are sharp; the previous best bounds were $O(d)$ on the nilpotence, and an ineffective function of $d$ on the index. In fact, we obtain this as a small part of a much more detailed fine-scale description of the structure of $G$. These results have a wide range of applications in various aspects of the theory of vertex-transitive graphs: percolation theory, random walks, structure of finite groups, scaling limits of finite vertex-transitive graphs.... We obtain some of these applications in the present paper, and treat others in companion papers. Some are due to or joint with other authors.</description>

Abstract: For $d \geq 4$ and $p$ a sufficiently large prime, we construct a lattice $\Gamma \leq {\rm PSp}_{2d}(\mathbb Q_p),$ such that its universal central extension cannot be sofic if $\Gamma$ satisfies some weak form of stability in permutations. In the proof, we make use of high-dimensional expansion phenomena and, extending results of Lubotzky, we construct new examples of cosystolic expanders over arbitrary finite abelian groups.</description>

In this paper, we show that its matrix presentation is written using the Fox derivation, and also a relation with twisted Alexander invariants.</description>

The decomposition depends only on an integer parameter whose choice sets the intended degree of locality. The global structure of the graph, as determined by the relative position of these parts, is described by a coarser $\it model$. This is a simpler graph determined entirely by the decomposition, not imposed.
  The model and decomposition are obtained as projections of the tangle-tree structure of a covering of the given graph that reflects its local structure while unfolding its global structure. In this way, the tangle theory from graph minors is brought to bear canonically on arbitrary graphs, which need not be tree-like.
  Our theorem extends to locally finite quasi-transitive graphs, and in particular to locally finite Cayley graphs. It thereby offers a canonical decomposition for finitely generated groups into local parts, whose relative structure is displayed by a graph.</description>

Abstract: If $G$ is a group, we say a subset $S$ of $G$ is product-free if the equation $xy=z$ has no solutions with $x,y,z \in S$. For $D \in \mathbb{N}$, a group $G$ is said to be $D$-quasirandom if the minimal dimension of a nontrivial complex irreducible representation of $G$ is at least $D$. Gowers showed that in a $D$-quasirandom finite group $G$, the maximal size of a product-free set is at most $|G|/D^{1/3}$. This disproved a longstanding conjecture of Babai and S\'os from 1985.
  For the special unitary group, $G=SU(n)$, Gowers observed that his argument yields an upper bound of $n^{-1/3}$ on the measure of a measurable product-free subset. In this paper, we improve Gowers' upper bound to $\exp(-cn^{1/3})$, where $c&gt;0$ is an absolute constant. In fact, we establish something stronger, namely, product-mixing for measurable subsets of $SU(n)$ with measure at least $\exp(-cn^{1/3})$; for this product-mixing result, the $n^{1/3}$ in the exponent is sharp.
  Our approach involves introducing novel hypercontractive inequalities, which imply that the non-Abelian Fourier spectrum of the indicator function of a small set concentrates on high-dimensional irreducible representations.
  Our hypercontractive inequalities are obtained via methods from representation theory, harmonic analysis, random matrix theory and differential geometry. We generalize our hypercontractive inequalities from $SU(n)$ to an arbitrary $D$-quasirandom compact connected Lie group for $D$ at least an absolute constant, thereby extending our results on product-free sets to such groups.
  We also demonstrate various other applications of our inequalities to geometry (viz., non-Abelian Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities), mixing times, and the theory of growth in compact Lie groups.</description>
