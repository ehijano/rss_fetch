      <title>Exciton-Enhanced Superconductivity in Monolayer Films of Aluminum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BCS theory has achieved widespread success in describing conventional superconductivity.
  However, when the length scale reaches the atomic limit, the reduced dimensionality may lead to
  the quantum breakdown resulting in unpredictable superconducting behaviors. It has been exper imentally evidenced that the critical temperature is strongly enhanced in the monolayer films of
  FeSe/STO and epitaxial Aluminum. Here, we propose the exciton mechanism of superconductivity
  as a possible reason for the enhanced superconductivity in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor
  structures. The exciton-induced Cooper pairing may lead to the larger energy gaps and higher
  critical temperatures as compared to those caused by the phonon induced superconductivity. A
  detailed comparison of the theory and experimental results of Ref. 1 reveals the possibility of
  exciton-induced superconductivity in thin films of Aluminum near the monolayer limit.</description>

      <title>Analysis of "Revaluation of the lower critical field in superconducting H_3S and LaH_10 (Nature Comm. 13, 3194, 2022)" by V. S. Minkov et al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Nat Comm. 13,3194 (2022) [1] and an "Author Correction" to it [2], Minkov et al. presented magnetization data versus applied magnetic field for H_3S and LaH_10 under pressure, argued that the data provide evidence that these materials are superconducting at high temperatures, and extracted from the reported data the behavior of lower critical fields versus temperature. In several papers [3,4,5,6] analyzing Refs. [1,2] it was shown that the published magnetization data could not have been obtained from the reported measured data through the processes described in Refs. [1,2]. Recently, Minkov et al performed a revaluation of their experimental results [7] and argued that the results derived from their new analysis are consistent with the results reported earlier [1]. In addition, they made public the underlying data [8] from which the data published in Ref. [1] were derived. In this paper we analyze those underlying data and conclude that (a) the data published in Ref. [1] are incompatible with the underlying measured data, and (b) the revaluation analysis presented in Ref. [7] does not support the conclusions drawn by the authors in Ref. [7] nor Ref. [1].</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric superfluid weight in multiband superconductors: A microscopic interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even in non-interacting limit, electrons on different Bloch bands of a multiband system do not move as if they are oblivious to the presence of one another. Instead, they move in concert by virtue of a non-Abelian interband Berry connection. While the impact of this quantum geometric attribute manifests most famously through the Hall response of topological bands, the geometric effects in superconductors have attracted significant recent attention. In particular, much has been discussed about the quantum-metric-induced superfluid weight (SW) in flatband superconductors. In this study, we revisit the geometric SW in generic multiband superconductors and trace its origin to a series of microscopic processes. We separately derive the SW of models containing only intraband Cooper pairing and those involving interband pairing. Two classes of processes enabled by the so-called interband velocity (or the closely related interband Berry connection) are identified: one is equivalent to the transfer of Cooper pairs between different bands, and the other corresponds to virtual back-and-forth single-electron tunneling between the bands. The former contribution manifests as effective Josephson coupling between the multiband superconducting order parameters, while the latter constitutes the only source of SW for a superconducting flatband well isolated from other bands. We further numerically evaluate the SW of a simple topologically trivial two-band superconductor, showcasing how the geometric contribution is sensitive to the details of the multiband pairing configuration. In particular, we highlight an intriguing scenario of negative SW, which may pave way for the formation of novel pair density wave order. Our study provides deeper and more intuitive insight into the origin and nature of the SW induced by the quantum geometry of paired Bloch electrons.</description>

      <title>Flux-trapping experiments on ultra-high pressure hydrides as evidence of superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flux-trapping magnetization studies on H3S at ultra-high pressure have been reported by Minkov et al. as definitive evidence of superconductivity in this hydride system. This is very helpful in a field that has become somewhat controversial. However, this conclusion has been questioned based on an apparent zero-field cooled (ZFC) linear magnetization at low field. The standard Bean model would require an approximately quadratic dependence. In support, we note that the reported ZFC magnetization is indeed super-linear and consistent both with model calculations for thin discs and with the ZFC magnetization reported for YBa2Cu3Oy films. We conclude that the reported high-pressure magnetization data is fully consistent with superconductivity and that there is no reason, in this particular data set, to reject the original inference of hydride superconductivity.</description>

      <title>A unified theoretical framework for Kondo superconductors: Periodic Anderson impurities with attractive pairing and Rashba spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic superconductors manifest a fascinating interplay between their magnetic and superconducting properties. This becomes evident, for example, in the significant enhancement of the upper critical field observed in uranium-based superconductors, or the destruction of superconductivity well below the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in cobalt-doped NbSe$_2$. In this work, we argue that the Kondo interaction plays a pivotal role in governing these behaviors. By employing a periodic Anderson model, we study the Kondo effect in superconductors with either singlet or triplet pairing. In the regime of small impurity energies and high doping concentrations, we find the emergence of a Kondo resistive region below $T_c$. While a magnetic field suppresses singlet superconductivity, it stabilizes triplet pairing through the screening of magnetic impurities, inducing reentrant superconductivity at high fields. Moreover, introducing an antisymmetric spin-orbital coupling suppresses triplet superconductivity. This framework provides a unified picture to understand the observation of Kondo effect in NbSe$_2$ as well as the phase diagrams in Kondo superconductors such as UTe$_2$, and URhGe.</description>

      <title>Structural analysis and transport properties of [010]-tilt grain boundaries in Fe(Se,Te)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of grain boundaries is a prerequisite for fabricating high-performance superconducting bulks and wires. For iron-based superconductors [e.g. Ba(Fe,Co)$_2$As$_2$, Fe(Se,Te), and NdFeAs(O,F)], the dependence of the critical current density $J_\mathrm{c}$ on misorientation angle ($\theta_\mathrm{GB}$) has been explored on [001]-tilt grain boundaries, but no data for other types of orientations have been reported. Here, we report on the structural and transport properties of Fe(Se,Te) grown on CeO$_2$-buffered symmetric [010]-tilt roof-type SrTiO$_3$ bicrystal substrates by pulsed laser deposition. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy revealed that $\theta_\mathrm{GB}$ of Fe(Se,Te) was smaller whereas $\theta_\mathrm{GB}$ of CeO$_2$ was larger than that of the substrate. The difference in $\theta_\mathrm{GB}$ between the CeO$_2$ buffer layer and the substrate is getting larger with increasing $\theta_\mathrm{GB}$. For $\theta_\mathrm{GB}\geq24^\circ$ of the substrates, $\theta_\mathrm{GB}$ of Fe(Se,Te) was zero, whereas $\theta_\mathrm{GB}$ of CeO$_2$ was continuously increasing. The inclined growth of CeO$_2$ can be explained by the geometrical coherency model. The $c$-axis growth of Fe(Se,Te) for $\theta_\mathrm{GB}\geq24^\circ$ of the substrates is due to the domain matching epitaxy on (221) planes of CeO$_2$. Electrical transport measurements confirmed no reduction of inter-grain $J_\mathrm{c}$ for $\theta_\mathrm{GB}\leq9^\circ$, indicative of strong coupling between the grains.</description>

      <title>Chiral superfluidity of helium-3 in the quasi-two-dimensional limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic pair breaking close to surfaces favors chiral superfluid $^3$He-A over time-reversal invariant $^3$He-B. Confining superfluid $^3$He into a cavity of height $D$ of the order of the Cooper pair size characterized by the coherence length $\xi_0$ -- ranging between 16 nm (34 bar) and 77 nm (0 bar) -- extends the surface effects over the whole sample volume, thus allowing stabilization of the A phase at pressures $P$ and temperatures $T$ where otherwise the B phase would be stable. In this work the surfaces of such a confined sample are covered with a superfluid $^4$He film to create specular quasiparticle scattering boundary conditions, preventing the suppression of the superfluid order parameter. We show that the chiral A phase is the stable superfluid phase under strong confinement over the full $P-T$ phase diagram down to a quasi-two-dimensional limit $D/\xi_0 = 1$. The planar phase, which is degenerate with the chiral A phase in the weak-coupling limit, is not observed. The gap inferred from measurements over the wide pressure range from 0.2 to 21.0 bar leads to an empirical ansatz for temperature-dependent strong-coupling effects. We discuss how these results pave the way for the realization of the fully-gapped two-dimensional $p_x + ip_y$ superfluid under more extreme confinement.</description>

      <title>Vacuum and Vortices in Inhomogeneous Abelian Higgs Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inhomogeneous abelian Higgs model with a magnetic impurity in the BPS limit is studied for both relativistic and nonrelativistic regimes. Though the symmetry of spatial translation is broken by inhomogeneity, extension to an $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric theory is admitted. The quartic scalar potential has minimum value depending on strength of the impurity but possesses broken phase at spatial asymptote. The vacuum configuration of broken phase can be neither a constant nor the minimum of the scalar potential, but is found as a nontrivial solution of the Bogomolny equations. While its energy density and magnetic field are given by the function of spatial coordinates, the energy and magnetic flux remain zero. The sign of the magnetic impurity term allows either a BPS sector or anti-BPS sector but not both. Thus the obtained solution is identified as the new inhomogeneous broken vacuum of minimum zero energy. In the presence of rotationally symmetric Gaussian type inhomogeneity, topological vortex solutions are also obtained and the effects of the impurity to the vortex are numerically analyzed.</description>

      <title>AC Josephson Signatures of the Superconducting Higgs/Amplitude Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Higgs mode in superconductors corresponds to oscillations of the amplitude of the order parameter. While its detection typically entails resonant optical excitation, we present a purely transport-based setup wherein it is excited in a voltage biased Josephson junction. Demonstrating the importance of order parameter dynamics, the interplay of Higgs resonance and Josephson physics enhances the second harmonic Josephson current oscillating at twice the usual Josephson frequency in transparent junctions featuring single-band s-wave superconductors. If the leads have unequal equilibrium superconducting gaps, this second harmonic component may even eclipse its first harmonic counterpart, thus furnishing a unique hallmark of the Higgs oscillations.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity in altermagnets with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate some possible symmetries of the superconducting state that emerges in three-dimensional altermagnets in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate within a weak-coupling approach that altermagnetic fluctuations with form factor $\boldsymbol{g}_{\mathbf{k}}$ promote spin-triplet superconductivity described by gap functions $\boldsymbol{d}(\mathbf{k}) = \boldsymbol{u}(\mathbf{k}) \times \boldsymbol{g}_{\mathbf{k}}$, such that $\boldsymbol{u}(\mathbf{k}) = - \boldsymbol{u}(-\mathbf{k})$. Consequently, this singles out $f$-wave spin-triplet superconductivity as the most favorable pairing state to appear in the vicinity of $d$-wave altermagnetism. Furthermore, we obtain that the combination of spin-singlet superconducting states with altermagnetism gives rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which are protected by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant. Using a Ginzburg-Landau analysis, we show that, for a class of spin-orbit coupled altermagnetic models, a superconducting phase is expected to appear at low temperatures as an intertwined $d + if$ state, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry spontaneously.</description>

      <title>Toolbox for nonreciprocal dispersive models in circuit QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08354v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a systematic method for constructing effective dispersive Lindblad master equations to describe weakly anharmonic superconducting circuits coupled by a generic dissipationless nonreciprocal linear system, with effective coupling parameters and decay rates written in terms of the immittance parameters characterizing the coupler. This article extends the foundational work of Solgun et al. (2019) for linear reciprocal couplers described by an impedance response. Notably, we expand the existing toolbox to incorporate nonreciprocal elements, account for direct stray coupling between immittance ports, circumvent potential singularities, and include collective dissipative effects that arise from interactions with external common environments. We illustrate the use of our results with a circuit of weakly anharmonic Josephson junctions coupled to a multiport nonreciprocal environment and a dissipative port. The results obtained here can be used for the design of complex superconducting quantum processors with nontrivial routing of quantum information, as well as analog quantum simulators of condensed matter systems.</description>
