      <title>Education Paradigm Shift To Maintain Human Competitive Advantage Over AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discussion about the replacement of intellectual human labour by ``thinking machines'' has been present in the public and expert discourse since the creation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an idea and terminology since the middle of the twentieth century. Until recently, it was more of a hypothetical concern. However, in recent years, with the rise of Generative AI, especially Large Language Models (LLM), and particularly with the widespread popularity of the ChatGPT model, that concern became practical. Many domains of human intellectual labour have to adapt to the new AI tools that give humans new functionality and opportunity, but also question the viability and necessity of some human work that used to be considered intellectual yet has now become an easily automatable commodity. Education, unexpectedly, has now become burdened by an especially crucial role of charting long-range strategies for discovering viable human skills that would guarantee their place in the world of the ubiquitous use of AI in the intellectual sphere. We highlight weaknesses of the current AI and, especially, of its LLM-based core, show that root causes of LLMs' weaknesses are unfixable by the current technologies, and propose directions in the constructivist paradigm for the changes in Education that ensure long-term advantages of humans over AI tools.</description>
