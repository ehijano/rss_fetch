      <title>Demonstration of hybrid foreground removal on CHIME data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main challenge of 21 cm cosmology experiments is astrophysical foregrounds which are difficult to separate from the signal due to telescope systematics. An earlier study has shown that foreground residuals induced by antenna gain errors can be estimated and subtracted using the hybrid foreground residual subtraction (HyFoReS) technique which relies on cross-correlating linearly filtered data. In this paper, we apply a similar technique to the CHIME stacking analysis to subtract beam-induced foreground contamination. Using a linear high-pass delay filter for foreground suppression, the CHIME collaboration reported a $11.1\sigma$ detection in the 21 cm signal stacked on eBOSS quasar locations, despite foreground residual contamination mostly due to the instrument chromatic transfer function. We cross-correlate the foreground-dominated data at low delay with the contaminated signal at high delay to estimate residual foregrounds and subtract them from the signal. We find foreground residual subtraction can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the stacked 21 cm signal by $ 10 - 20\%$ after the delay foreground filter, although some of the improvement can also be achieved with an alternative flagging technique. We have shown that it is possible to use HyFoReS to reduce beam-induced foreground contamination, benefiting the analysis of the HI auto power spectrum with CHIME and enabling the recovery of large scale modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between cosmology and strongly coupled dynamics can yield transient spectral features that vanish at late times, but which may leave behind phenomenological signatures in the spectrum of primordial fluctuations. Of particular interest are strongly coupled extensions of the standard model featuring approximate conformal invariance. In flat space, the spectral density for a scalar operator in a conformal field theory is characterized by a continuum with scaling law governed by the dimension of the operator, and is otherwise featureless. AdS/CFT arguments suggest that for large $N$, in an inflationary background with Hubble rate $H$, this continuum is gapped. We demonstrate that there can be additional peak structures that become sharp and particle-like at phenomenologically interesting regions in parameter space, and we estimate their contribution to cosmological observables. We find phenomena that are potentially observable in future experiments that are unique to these models, including displaced oscillatory features in the squeezed limit of the bi-spectrum. These particles can be either fundamental, and localized to a UV brane, or composite at the Hubble scale, $H$, and bound to a horizon in the bulk of the 5D geometry. We comment on how stabilization of conformal symmetry breaking vacua can be correlated with these spectral features and their phenomenology.</description>

      <title>AI-assisted super-resolution cosmological simulations IV: An emulator for deterministic realizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) models in cosmological simulations use deep learning (DL) to rapidly supplement low-resolution (LR) runs with statistically correct, fine details. The SR technique preserves large-scale structures by conditioning on a low-resolution (LR) version of the simulation. On smaller scales, the generative deep learning (DL) process is stochastic, resulting in numerous possible SR realizations, each with unique small-scale structures. Validation of SR then relies on making sure that a specific statistic of interest is accurately reproduced by comparing SR and high resolution (HR) runs. In this study, we develop an emulator designed to reproduce the individual small-scale structures of an HR simulation as closely as possible. We process an SR realization alongside a specific High-Resolution Initial Condition (HRIC), transforming the SR output to emulate the results of a full simulation with that HRIC. By comparing visualizations, individual halo measures and cross-correlating Fourier modes we show that the emulated SR runs closely align with the corresponding HR simulation, even on length scales an order of magnitude smaller than the LR run. Additionally, small halos are trained to match the HR simulation, and the subhalo mass function is more accurately reproduced. These results show the promise of this method for generating numerous fast and accurate simulations and mock observations for large galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Observational evidence for Early Dark Energy as a unified explanation for Cosmic Birefringence and the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the $n$=3 Ultralight Axion-like model of Early Dark Energy (EDE) with the observations of the $EB$ mode of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and local expansion rate measurements. We find that the shape of the CMB $EB$ angular power spectrum is sensitive to the background cosmological parameters. Unlike previous articles which fix the background cosmology and fit % \lu{with fitting} the coupling constant and rotation angles, we run Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations to fit the $\Lambda$CDM + EDE parameters simultaneously. We find that the EDE model with $n$=3 can provide a good fit to the observed CMB $EB$ spectra, consistent with a Hubble constant value that is in good agreement with the locally measured value. Our result is the first to show that axion-like EDE can provide a unified explanation for the observed cosmic birefringence and the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Exploring The Dynamical Nature and Radio Halo Emission of Abell 384: A Combined Radio, X-ray and Optical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiwavelength studies of galaxy clusters are crucial for understanding the complex interconnection of the thermal and non-thermal constituents of these massive structures and uncovering the physical processes involved in their formation and evolution. Here, we report a multiwavelength assessment of the galaxy cluster A384, which was previously reported to host a radio halo with a 660 kpc size at MeerKAT 1.28 GHz. The halo is slightly offset from the cluster centre. Our uGMRT observation reveals that the halo extends up to 690 kpc at 407 MHz with a nonuniform spectral index $\alpha^{1284}_{407}$ distribution varying from flat (-0.5) to steep (-1.3) values. In addition, we use legacy GMRT 608 MHz, \textit{XMM-Newton} X-ray, and the Dark Energy Survey optical observations to obtain an extensive understanding of the dynamical nature of the galaxy cluster. The X-ray surface brightness concentration parameter (c$_{SB}$ = 0.16) and centroid shift (w = 0.057) reveal an ongoing dynamical disturbance in the cluster. This is also supported by the elongated 2-D optical galaxy density distribution map of the cluster. We obtain an asymmetry parameter of 0.35 $\pm$ 0.04 from optical analysis, further supporting the dynamical disturbance in the cluster. The radio and X-ray surface brightness follows a sub-linear correlation. Our observation suggests that the cluster is currently in a merging state where particle re-acceleration in the turbulent ICM resulted in the radio halo emission.</description>

      <title>[O II] as an Effective Indicator of the Dependence Between the Standardised Luminosities of Type Ia Supernovae and the Properties of their Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have obtained IFU spectra of 75 SN Ia host galaxies from the Foundation Supernova survey to search for correlations between the properties of individual galaxies and SN Hubble residuals. After standard corrections for light-curve width and SN colour have been applied, we find correlations between Hubble residuals and the equivalent width of the [O II] $\lambda\lambda$ 3727, 3729 doublet (2.3$\sigma$), an indicator of the specific star formation rate (sSFR). When splitting our sample by SN colour, we find no colour dependence impacting the correlation between EW[O II] and Hubble residual. However, when splitting by colour, we reveal a correlation between the Hubble residuals of blue SNe Ia and the Balmer decrement (2.2$\sigma$), an indicator of dust attenuation. These correlations remain after applying a mass-step correction, suggesting that the mass-step correction does not fully account for the limitations of the colour correction used to standardise SNe Ia. Rather than a mass correction, we apply a correction to SNe from star forming galaxies based on their measurable EW[O II]. We find that this correction also removes the host galaxy mass step, while also greatly reducing the significance of the correlation with the Balmer decrement for blue SNe Ia. We find that correcting for EW[O II], in addition to or in place of the mass-step, may further reduce the scatter in the Hubble diagram.</description>

      <title>Extended $\delta N$ formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\delta N$ formalism is a powerful approach to compute non-linearly the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation $\zeta$. It assumes a set of FLRW patches that evolve independently, but in doing so, all the gradient terms are discarded, which are not negligibly small in models beyond slow-roll. In this paper, we extend the formalism to capture these gradient corrections by encoding them in a homogeneous-spatial-curvature contribution assigned to each FLRW patch. For a concrete example, we apply this formalism to the ultra-slow-roll inflation, and find that it can correctly describe the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation from the horizon exit. We also briefly discuss non-Gaussianities in this context.</description>

      <title>Revised LOFAR upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum at $\mathbf{z\approx9.1}$ using Machine Learning and Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for foregrounds mitigation in data collected by the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) to measure the high-redshift 21-cm signal power spectrum has been shown to have issues of signal loss when the 21-cm signal covariance is misestimated. To address this problem, we have recently introduced covariance kernels obtained by using a Machine Learning based Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) algorithm in combination with simulations of the 21-cm signal. In this work, we apply this framework to 141 hours ($\approx 10$ nights) of LOFAR data at $z \approx 9.1$, and report revised upper limits of the 21-cm signal power spectrum. Overall, we agree with past results reporting a 2-$\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^2_{21} &lt; (80)^2~\rm mK^2$ at $k = 0.075~h~\rm Mpc^{-1}$. Further, the VAE-based kernel has a smaller correlation with the systematic excess noise, and the overall GPR-based approach is shown to be a good model for the data. Assuming an accurate bias correction for the excess noise, we report a 2-$\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^2_{21} &lt; (25)^2~\rm mK^2$ at $k = 0.075~h~\rm Mpc^{-1}$. However, we still caution to take the more conservative approach to jointly report the upper limits of the excess noise and the 21-cm signal components.</description>

      <title>General analysis of Noether symmetries in Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore Noether symmetries of Horndeski gravity, extending the classification of general scalar-tensor theories. Starting from the minimally coupled scalar field and the first-generation scalar-tensor gravity, the discussion is generalised to kinetic gravity braiding and Horndeski gravity. We highlight the main findings by focusing on the non-minimally coupled Gauss-Bonnet term and the extended cuscuton model. Finally, we discuss how the presence of matter can influence Noether symmetries. It turns out that the selected Horndeski functions are unchanged with respect to the vacuum case.</description>

      <title>Investigating the mixing between two black hole populations in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA GWTC-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a population model to analyze the mixing between hypothesised power-law and $\sim 35 M_\odot$ Gaussian bump black hole populations in the latest gravitational wave catalog, GWTC-3, estimating their co-location and separation. We find a relatively low level of mixing, $3.1^{+5.0}_{-3.1}\%$, between the power-law and Gaussian populations, compared to the percentage of mergers containing two Gaussian bump black holes, $5.0^{+3.2}_{-1.7}\%$. Our analysis indicates that black holes within the Gaussian bump are generally separate from the power-law population, with only a minor fraction engaging in mixing and contributing to the $\mathcal{M} \sim 14 M_\odot$ peak in the chirp mass. This leads us to identify a distinct population of Binary Gaussian Black Holes (BGBHs) that arise from mergers within the Gaussian bump. We suggest that current theories for the formation of the massive $35 M_\odot$ Gaussian bump population may need to reevaluate the underlying mechanisms that drive the preference for BGBHs.</description>

      <title>The Fast Radio Burst Population Energy Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the energy distribution of the fast radio burst (FRB) population using a well-defined sample of 63 FRBs from the ASKAP radio telescope, 28 of which are localised to a host galaxy. We apply the luminosity-volume ($V/V_{\mathrm{max}}$) test to examine the distribution of these transient sources, accounting for cosmological and instrumental effects, and determine the energy distribution for the sampled population over the redshift range $0.01 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.02$. We find the distribution between $10^{23}$ and $10^{26}$J Hz$^{-1}$ to be consistent with both a pure power-law with differential slope $\gamma=-1.96 \pm 0.15$, and a Schechter function with $\gamma = -1.82 \pm 0.12$ and downturn energy $E_{\rm max} \sim 6.3 \cdot 10^{25}$J Hz$^{-1}$. We identify systematic effects which currently limit our ability to probe the luminosity function outside this range and give a prescription for their treatment. Finally, we find that with the current dataset, we are unable to distinguish between the evolutionary and spectral models considered in this work.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of WIMP bounds on the velocity distribution in the limit of a massless mediator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the sensitivity of the bounds on the spin-independent (SI) and spin-dependent (SD) WIMP-proton and WIMP-neutron interaction couplings $\alpha_{SI, SD}^{p,n}$ on the WIMP velocity distribution for a massless mediator in the propagator by combining direct detection and the neutrino signal from WIMP annihilation in the Sun (fixing the annihilation channel to $b\bar{b}$). We update the bounds in the Standard Halo Model (SHM) and using the halo-independent single-stream method. In the case of a massless mediator the SHM capture rate in the Sun diverges and is regularized by removing the contribution of WIMPs locked into orbits that extend beyond the Sun-Jupiter distance. We discuss the dependence of the SHM bounds on the Jupiter cut showing that it can be sizeable for $\alpha_{\rm SD}^p$ and a WIMP mass $m_\chi$ exceeding 1 TeV. Our updated SHM bounds show an improvement between about two and three orders of magnitude compared to the previous ones in the literature. Our halo-independent analysis shows that, with the exception of $\alpha_{\rm SD}^p$ at large $m_\chi$, the relaxation of the bounds compared to the SHM is of the same order of that for contact interactions, i.e. relatively moderate in the low and high WIMP mass regimes and as large as a few $\times\sim 10^2$ for $m_\chi\simeq$ 30 GeV. On the other hand, the exact determination of the relaxation of the bound becomes not reliable for $\alpha_{\rm SD}^p$ and $m_\chi\gtrsim$ 1 TeV due to the sensitivity of the SHM capture rate in the Sun to the details of the Maxwellian velocity distribution at low incoming WIMP speeds. The halo-independent bounds do not depend on the Jupiter cut needed to regularize the calculation of the capture rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the electroweak phase transition dynamics with a three-dimensional standard model effective field theory under a gauge-invariant approach. We observe that, at the two-loop level, the phase transition parameters obtained with the gauge invariant approach can at most deviate from that of the dimensional reduction method around the percent level. We further found that the predicted gravitational wave signals at the new physics scale $\Lambda\gtrsim 590$ GeV are unreachable by the space-based interferometers, such as: LISA, TianQin, and Taiji.</description>

Abstract: The NANOGrav 15-year data provides compelling evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background at nanohertz frequencies. The simplest model-independent approach to characterizing the frequency spectrum of this signal consists in a simple power-law fit involving two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index \gamma. In this paper, we consider the next logical step beyond this minimal spectral model, allowing for a running (i.e., logarithmic frequency dependence) of the spectral index, \gamma_run(f) = \gamma + \beta \ln(f/f_ref). We fit this running-power-law (RPL) model to the NANOGrav 15-year data and perform a Bayesian model comparison with the minimal constant-power-law (CPL) model, which results in a 95% credible interval for the parameter \beta consistent with no running, \beta \in [-0.80,2.96], and an inconclusive Bayes factor, B(RPL vs. CPL) = 0.69 +- 0.01. We thus conclude that, at present, the minimal CPL model still suffices to adequately describe the NANOGrav signal; however, future data sets may well lead to a measurement of nonzero \beta. Finally, we interpret the RPL model as a description of primordial GWs generated during cosmic inflation, which allows us to combine our results with upper limits from big-bang nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.</description>

      <title>The anomaly of the CMB power with the latest Planck data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lack of power anomaly is an unexpected feature observed at large angular scales in the CMB maps produced by the COBE, WMAP and Planck satellites. This signature, which consists in a missing of power with respect to that predicted by the LCDM model, might hint at a new cosmological phase before the standard inflationary era. The main point of this paper is taking into account the latest Planck polarisation data to investigate how the CMB polarisation improves the understanding of this feature. With this aim, we apply to the latest Planck data, both PR3 (2018) and PR4 (2020) releases, a new class of estimators capable of evaluating this anomaly by considering temperature and polarisation data both separately and in a jointly way. This is the first time that the PR4 dataset has been used to study this anomaly. To critically evaluate this feature, taking into account the residuals of known systematic effects present in the Planck datasets, we analyse the cleaned CMB maps using different combinations of sky masks, harmonic range and binning on the CMB multipoles. Our analysis shows that the estimator based only on temperature data confirms the presence of a lack of power with a lower-tail-probability (LTP), depending on the component separation method, $\leq 0.33\%$ and $\leq 1.76\%$ for PR3 and PR4, respectively. To our knowledge, the LTP$\leq 0.33\%$ for the PR3 dataset is the lowest one present in the literature obtained from Planck 2018 data, considering the Planck confidence mask. We find significant differences between these two datasets when polarisation is taken into account. Moreover, we also show that for the PR3 dataset the inclusion of the subdominant polarisation information provides estimates that are less likely accepted in a LCDM cosmological model than the only-temperature analysis over the entire harmonic-range considered.</description>

      <title>The size and shape dependence of the bispectrum of the SDSS DR17 main galaxy sample</title>

Abstract: We have measured the spherically averaged bispectrum of the SDSS DR17 main galaxy sample, considering a volume-limited $[273\, \rm Mpc]^3$ data cube with mean galaxy number density $1.76 \times 10^{-3} \, {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ and median redshift $0.093$. Our analysis considers $\sim 1.37 \times 10^{8}$ triangles, for which we have measured the binned bispectrum and analyzed its dependence on the size and shape of the triangle. It spans wavenumbers $k_1=(0.082-0.472)\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for equilateral triangles, and a smaller range of $k_1$ (the largest side) for triangles of other shapes. For all shapes, we find that the measured bispectrum is well modelled by a power law $A\big(k_1/1 Mpc^{-1}\big)^{n}$, where the best-fit values of $A$ and $n$ vary with the shape. The parameter $A$ is the minimum for equilateral triangles and increases as the shape is deformed to linear triangles where the two largest sides are nearly aligned, reaching its maximum value for squeezed triangles. The values of $n$ are all negative, $|n|$ is minimum $(3.31 \pm 0.17)$ for squeezed triangles, and $4.12 \pm 0.16$ for equilateral. We have also analyzed mock galaxy samples constructed from $\Lambda$CDM N-body simulations by applying a simple Eulerian bias prescription where the galaxies reside in regions where the smoothed density field exceeds a threshold. We find that the bispectrum from the mock samples with bias $b_1=1.2$ is in good agreement with the SDSS results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators hold the key to high-energy physics as they probe the earliest moments of our Universe, and conceal hidden mathematical structures. However, even at tree-level, perturbative calculations are limited by technical difficulties absent in flatspace Feynman diagrammatics. In this paper, we introduce CosmoFlow: a new accurate open source Python code that computes tree-level cosmological correlators by tracing their time flow. This code is specifically designed to offer a simple, intuitive and flexible coding environment to theorists, primordial and late-time cosmologists. It can typically serve to complement analytical computations, to provide physical intuition when studying various inflationary theories, and to obtain exact results in regimes that are analytically out of reach. This paper presents the basic structure of CosmoFlow, leads the reader through an in-depth user-guide, and illustrates how it can be used with a series of worked examples. Our hope is that this first building block sets the stage for a bank of theoretical data, which can be nurtured and enhanced collaboratively by the community. CosmoFlow is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Developing a Theoretical Model for the Resummation of Infrared Effects in the Post-Reconstruction Power Spectrum (an explanatory video is available in the comments section)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since galaxy distribution reconstruction effectively reduces non-Gaussian terms in the power spectrum covariance matrix, it has attracted interest not only for Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signals but also for various cosmological signal analyses. To this end, this paper presents a novel theoretical model that addresses infrared (IR) effects in the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum, including 1-loop corrections. In particular, we discuss the importance of incorporating non-perturbative effects arising from IR contributions into the displacement vector $\vec{s}$ used for reconstruction. Consequently, post-reconstruction nonlinear damping of BAO can be described by a single two-dimensional Gaussian function. This is a phenomenon not observed when $\vec{s}$ is considered to at a linear order in the Zel'dovich approximation. Furthermore, we confirm that the cross-power spectrum of the pre- and post-reconstruction density fluctuations lacks IR effect cancellations, and shows an exponential decay in both the cross-power spectrum and the associated shot-noise term.

      <title>Turbocharging constraints on dark matter substructure through a synthesis of strong lensing flux ratios and extended lensed arcs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03253v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing provides a purely gravitational means to infer properties of dark matter halos and thereby constrain the particle nature of dark matter. Strong lenses sometimes appear as four lensed images of a background quasar accompanied by spatially-resolved emission from the quasar host galaxy encircling the main deflector (lensed arcs). We present methodology to simultaneously reconstruct lensed arcs and relative image magnifications (flux ratios) in the presence of full populations of subhalos and line-of-sight halos. To this end, we develop a new approach for multi-plane ray tracing that accelerates lens mass and source light reconstruction by factors of $\sim 100-1000$. Using simulated data, we show that simultaneous reconstruction of lensed arcs and flux ratios isolates small-scale perturbations to flux ratios by dark matter substructure from uncertainties associated with the main deflector mass profile on larger angular scales. Relative to analyses that use only image positions and flux ratios to constrain the lens model, incorporating arcs strengthens likelihood ratios penalizing warm dark matter (WDM) with a suppression scale $m_{\rm{hm}} / M_{\odot}$ in the range $\left[10^7 - 10^{7.5}\right]$, $\left[10^{7.5} - 10^{8}\right]$, $\left[10^8 - 10^{8.5}\right]$, $\left[10^{8.5} - 10^{9}\right]$ by factors of $1.3$, $2.5$, $5.6$, and $13.1$, respectively, for a cold dark matter (CDM) ground truth. The $95\%$ exclusion limit improves by 0.5 dex in $\log_{10} m_{\rm{hm}}$. The enhanced sensitivity to low-mass halos enabled by these methods pushes the observational frontier of substructure lensing to the threshold of galaxy formation, enabling stringent tests of any theory that alters the properties of dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>The 21-cm signal during the end stages of reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the epoch of reionization (EoR), the 21-cm signal allows direct observation of the neutral hydrogen (HI) in the intergalactic medium (IGM). In the post-reionization era, this signal instead probes HI in galaxies, which traces the dark matter density distribution. With new numerical simulations, we investigated the end stages of reionization to elucidate the transition of our Universe into the post-reionization era. Our models are consistent with the latest high-redshift measurements, including ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions \RefereeReport{up to redshift $\simeq$8}. Notably, these models consistently reproduced the evolution of the UV photon background, which is constrained from Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption spectra. We studied the dependence of this background on the nature of photon sinks in the IGM, requiring mean free path of UV photons to be $\sim$10 comoving-megaparsecs (cMpc) during the EoR that increases gradually with time during late stages ($z\lesssim 6$). Our models revealed that the reionization of the IGM transitioned from an \textit{inside-out} to an \textit{outside-in} process when the Universe is less than 0.01 per cent neutral. During this epoch, the 21-cm signal also shifted from probing predominantly the HI in the IGM to that in galaxies. Furthermore, we identified a statistically significant number of large neutral islands (with sizes up to 40 cMpc) persisting until very late stages ($5 \lesssim z \lesssim 6$) that can imprint features in Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption spectra and also produce a knee-like feature in the 21-cm power spectrum.</description>

      <title>No time to derive: unraveling total time derivatives in in-in perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The in-in formalism provides a way to systematically organize the calculation of primordial correlation functions. Although its theoretical foundations are now firmly settled, the treatment of total time derivative interactions, incorrectly trivialized as ``boundary terms'', has been the subject of intense discussions and conceptual mistakes. In this work, we demystify the use of total time derivatives -- as well as terms proportional to the linear equations of motion -- and show that they can lead to artificially large contributions cancelling at different orders of the in-in operator formalism. We discuss the treatment of total time derivative interactions in the Lagrangian path integral formulation of the in-in perturbation theory, and we showcase the importance of interaction terms proportional to linear equations of motion. We then provide a new route to the calculation of primordial correlation functions, which avoids the generation of total time derivatives, by working directly at the level of the full Hamiltonian in terms of phase-space variables. Instead of integrating by parts, we perform canonical transformations to simplify interactions. We explain how to retrieve correlation functions of the initial phase-space variables from the knowledge of the ones after canonical transformations. As an important first application, we find the explicit sizes of Hamiltonian cubic interactions in single-field inflation with canonical kinetic terms and for any background evolution [...]. Our results are important for performing complete calculations of exchange diagrams in inflation, such as the (scalar and tensor) exchange trispectrum and the one-loop power spectrum. Being already written in a form amenable to characterize quantum properties of primordial fluctuations, they also promise to shed light on the non-linear dynamics of quantum states during inflation.</description>

      <title>Spectral distortions from acoustic dissipation with non-Gaussian (or not) perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known route to form primordial black holes in the early universe relies on the existence of unusually large primordial curvature fluctuations, confined to a narrow range of wavelengths that would be too small to be constrained by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. This scenario would however boost the generation of $\mu$-type spectral distortions in the CMB due to an enhanced dissipation of acoustic waves. Previous studies of $\mu$-distortion bounds on the primordial spectrum were based on the assumptions of Gaussian primordial fluctuations. In this work, we push the calculation of $\mu$-distortions to one higher order in photon anisotropies. We discuss how to derive bounds on primordial spectrum peaks obeying non-Gaussian statistics under the assumption of local (perturbative or not) non-Gaussianity. We find that, depending on the value of the peak scale, the bounds may either remain stable or get tighter by several orders of magnitude, but only when the departure from Gaussian statistics is very strong. Our results are translated in terms of bounds on primordial supermassive black hole mass in a companion paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is reporting unexpectedly massive high redshift galaxies that appear challenging from the $\Lambda$CDM perspective. Interpreted as a problem of cosmological origin, this necessitates Planck underestimating either matter density $\Omega_m$ or physical matter density $\Omega_m h^2$ at higher redshifts. Through standard frequentist profile likelihoods, we identify corroborating quasar (QSO) and gamma-ray burst (GRB) data sets where $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}}$, with $\Omega_m$ remaining anomalously large at higher redshifts. While the variation of $\Omega_m$ with $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ is at odds with the $\Lambda$CDM model, demarcating frequentist confidence intervals through differences in $\chi^2$ in profile likelihoods, the prevailing technique in the literature, points to $3.9 \sigma$ and $7.9 \sigma$ tensions between GRBs and QSOs, respectively, and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. We explain the approximations inherent in the existing profile likelihood literature, and highlight fresh methodology that generalises the prescription. We show that alternative methods, including Bayesian approaches, lead to similar tensions. Finally, in the large sample limit, we show that Feldman-Cousins prescription for frequentist confidence intervals in the presence of a boundary (prior) leads to confidence intervals that are bounded above by Wilks' theorem.</description>

Abstract: At the cosmological stage of radiation dominance, dark matter density spikes should form around primordial black holes. In the case when dark matter particles are able to annihilate, the density in the central regions of the spikes decreases due to the elimination of particles, which gives an upper bound on the central density. In this paper, the modification of the central density profile is investigated, taking into account the distribution of the particle orbits. The orbits in spike around a primordial black hole are very elongated, almost radial, and the angular momentum distribution has an exponential form. For such an initial distribution function, it is obtained that a cusp with the exponent $\approx-0.7$ is formed in the central region, instead of an annihilation plateau. The presence of the cusp provides some correction to the rate of dark matter annihilation around primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Obviating PBH overproduction for SIGWs generated by Pulsar Timing Arrays in loop corrected EFT of bounce</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to unravel the present situation of the PBH overproduction problem, our study emphasizes the critical role played by the equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$ within the framework of effective field theory (EFT) of non-singular bounce. Our analysis focuses on a wide range of EoS parameter values that are still optimal for explaining the latest data from the pulsar timing array (PTA). As a result of our study, the most advantageous window, $0.31 \leq w \leq 1/3$, is identified as the location of a substantial PBH abundance, $f_{\rm PBH} \in (10^{-3},1)$ with large mass PBHs, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-7}-10^{-3})M_{\odot}$, in the SIGW interpretation of the PTA signal. When confronted with PTA, we find that the overproduction avoiding circumstances are between $1\sigma-2\sigma$, while the EoS parameter lies inside the narrow window, $0.31&lt;w\leq 1/3$. We propose a regularized-renormalized-resummed (RRR) scalar power spectrum that is large enough to produce EoS dependent scalar generated gravitational waves compatible with PTA evidence, while satisfying the perturbativity, causality, and unitarity criteria, within the range of $0.88 \leq c_{s} \leq 1$.</description>

Abstract: Exploring the mysterious dark matter is a key quest in modern physics. Currently, detecting axions, a hypothetical particle proposed as a primary component of dark matter, remains a significant challenge due to their weakly interacting nature. Here we show at quantum level that in a cavity permeated by a magnetic field, the single axion-photon conversion rate is enhanced by the cavity quality factor and is quantitatively larger than the classical result by $\pi/2$. The axion cavity can be considered a quantum device emitting single photons with temporal separations. This differs from the classical picture and reveals a possibility for the axion cavity experiment to handle the signal sensitivity at the quantum level, e.g., a dual path quantum interferometry with cross-power and second-order correlation measurements. This scheme would greatly reduce the signal scanning time and improve the sensitivity of the axion-photon coupling, potentially leading to the direct observation of axions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical formation of black hole binaries in dense star clusters: Rapid cluster evolution code</title>

Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations have just started probing the properties of black hole binary merger populations. The observation of binaries with very massive black holes and significantly asymmetric masses motivates the study of dense star clusters as astrophysical environments which can produce such events dynamically. In this paper we present Rapster (for "Rapid cluster evolution"), a new code designed to rapidly model binary black hole population synthesis and the evolution of massive star clusters based on simple, yet realistic prescriptions. We also perform a thorough comparison with the Cluster Monte Carlo code and find generally good agreement. The code can be used to generate large populations of dynamically formed binary black holes.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the formation of type II primordial black holes (PBHs) resulting from extremely large amplitudes of initial fluctuations in a radiation-dominated universe. We find that, for a sufficiently large initial amplitude, the configuration of trapping horizons shows characteristic structure due to the existence of bifurcating trapping horizons. We call this type of configuration of the trapping horizons type II-B PBH, while the structure without a bifurcating trapping horizon type II-A PBH. In Ref. [1], in the dust-dominated universe, the type B PBH can be realized by the type II initial fluctuation, which is characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius as a function of the radial coordinate (throat structure) in contrast with the standard case, type A PBH with a monotonic areal radius (type I fluctuation). Our research reveals that a type II fluctuation does not necessarily result in a type B PBH in the radiation-dominated case. We also find that for an initial amplitude well above the threshold value, the resulting PBH mass may either increase or decrease with the initial amplitude, depending on its specific profile rather than its fluctuation type.</description>

Abstract: A first order electroweak phase transition probes physics beyond the Standard Model on multiple frontiers and therefore is of immense interest for theoretical exploration. We conduct a model-independent study of the effects of relevant dimension 6 and dimension 8 operators, of the Standard Model effective field theory, on electroweak phase transition. We use a thermally corrected and renormalization group improved potential and study its impact on nucleation temperature. We then outline bubble dynamics that lead to ultrarelativistic bubble wall velocities which are mainly motivated from the viewpoint of gravitational wave detection. We highlight the ranges of the Wilson coefficients that give rise to such bubble wall velocities and predict gravitational wave spectra generated by such transitions which can be tested in future experiments.</description>

      <title>GLANCE -- Gravitational Lensing Authenticator using Non-Modelled Cross-Correlation Exploration of Gravitational Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is the phenomenon where the presence of matter (called a lens) bends the path of light-like trajectories travelling nearby. Similar to the geometric optics limit of electromagnetic waves, gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) can occur in geometric optics condition when GW wavelength is much smaller than the Schwarzschild radius of the lens i.e. $\lambda_{GW} \ll$ R$^{\rm s}_{\rm lens}$. This is known as the strong-lensing regime for which a multiple-image system with different magnifications and phase-shifts is formed. We developed $\texttt{GLANCE}$, Gravitational Lensing Authenticator using Non-modelled Cross-correlation Exploration, a novel technique to detect strongly lensed GW signals. We demonstrate that cross-correlation between two noisy reconstruction of polarized GW signals shows a non-zero value when the signals are lensed counterparts. The relative strength between the signal cross-correlation and noise cross-correlation can quantify the significance of the event(s) being lensed. Since lensing biases the inference of source parameters, primarily the luminosity distance, a joint parameter estimation of the source and lens-induced parameters is incorporated using a Bayesian framework. We applied $\texttt{GLANCE}$ to synthetic strong lensing data and showed that it can detect lensed GW signals and correctly constrain the injected source and lens parameters, even when one of the signals is below match-filtered threshold signal-to-noise ratio. This demonstrates $\texttt{GLANCE}'$s capability as a robust detection technique for strongly lensed GW signals and can distinguish between lensed and unlensed events.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric self-interacting dark matter with a canonical seesaw model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of generating dark matter (DM) and baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) simultaneously in an asymmetric DM framework, which also alleviates the small-scale structure issues of cold DM. While the thermal relic of such self-interacting DM remains under-abundant due to efficient annihilation into light mediators, a nonzero asymmetry in the dark sector can lead to the survival of the required DM in the Universe. The existence of a light mediator leads to the required self-interactions of DM at small scales while keeping DM properties similar to cold DM at large scales. It also ensures that the symmetric DM component annihilates away, leaving the asymmetric part in the spirit of cogenesis. The particle physics implementation is done in canonical seesaw models of light neutrino mass, connecting it to the origin of DM and BAU. In particular, we consider type-I and type-III seesaw origin of neutrino mass for simplicity and minimality of the field content. We show that the desired self-interactions and relic of DM together with BAU while satisfying relevant constraints lead to strict limits on DM mass $\mathcal{O}({\rm GeV}) \lesssim M_{\rm DM} \lesssim460 $ GeV. In spite of being a high-scale seesaw, the models remain verifiable in different experiments, including direct and indirect DM searches as well as colliders.</description>

      <title>Identifying Halos in Cosmological Simulations with Continuous Wavelet Analysis: The 2D Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous wavelet analysis is gaining popularity in science and engineering for its ability to analyze data across spatial and scale domains simultaneously. In this study, we introduce a wavelet-based method to identify halos and assess its feasibility in two-dimensional (2D) scenarios. We begin with the generation of four pseudo-2D datasets from the SIMBA dark matter simulation by compressing thin slices of three-dimensional (3D) data into 2D. We then calculate the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) directly from the particle distributions, identify local maxima that represent actual halos, and segment the CWT to delineate halo boundaries. A comparison with the traditional friends-of-friends (FOF) method shows that our CWT-identified halos, while contain slightly fewer particles, have smoother boundaries and are more compact in dense regions. In contrast, the CWT method can link particles over greater distances to form halos in sparse regions due to its spatial segmentation scheme. The spatial distribution and halo power spectrum of both CWT and FOF halos demonstrate substantial consistency, validating the 2D applicability of CWT for halo detection. Our identification scheme operates with a linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, suggesting its suitability for analyzing significantly larger datasets in the future.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of thermal state in early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our work, we perform a detailed study of the Krylov complexity of the thermal state across the entire early universe, encompassing the inflation, radiation-dominated period, and matter-dominated period, which is for the single field inflation. We utilize both the closed system's method and open system's method to achieve this goal. To accurately calculate the Krylov complexity, we purified the thermal state, resulting in a pure state with two modes. Our analysis with both methods indicates that the Krylov complexity will increase during inflation, but will saturate at constant values during the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods, where the generation of particles via preheating leads to this evolution. Furthermore, our findings reveal that inflation behaves as a strong dissipative system, while the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods act as weak dissipative systems. The chaotic feature during these periods follows a similar trend to the Krylov complexity. This research has the potential to provide new insights into the exploration of Krylov complexity in cosmology.</description>
