      <title>Hybrid deep learning and physics-based neural network for programmable illumination computational microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relying on either deep models or physical models are two mainstream approaches for solving inverse sample reconstruction problems in programmable illumination computational microscopy. Solutions based on physical models possess strong generalization capabilities while struggling with global optimization of inverse problems due to a lack of insufficient physical constraints. In contrast, deep learning methods have strong problem-solving abilities, but their generalization ability is often questioned because of the unclear physical principles. Besides, conventional deep models are difficult to apply to some specific scenes because of the difficulty in acquiring high-quality training data and their limited capacity to generalize across different scenarios. In this paper, to combine the advantages of deep models and physical models together, we propose a hybrid framework consisting of three sub-neural networks (two deep learning networks and one physics-based network). We first obtain a result with rich semantic information through a light deep learning neural network and then use it as the initial value of the physical network to make its output comply with physical process constraints. These two results are then used as the input of a fusion deep learning neural work which utilizes the paired features between the reconstruction results of two different models to further enhance imaging quality. The final result integrates the advantages of both deep models and physical models and can quickly solve the computational reconstruction inverse problem in programmable illumination computational microscopy and achieve better results. We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed hybrid framework with theoretical analysis and actual experiments on resolution targets and biological samples.</description>

      <title>HyperVQ: MLR-based Vector Quantization in Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of models operating on tokenized data has led to an increased demand for effective tokenization methods, particularly when applied to vision or auditory tasks, which inherently involve non-discrete data. One of the most popular tokenization methods is Vector Quantization (VQ), a key component of several recent state-of-the-art methods across various domains. Typically, a VQ Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) is trained to transform data to and from its tokenized representation. However, since the VQVAE is trained with a reconstruction objective, there is no constraint for the embeddings to be well disentangled, a crucial aspect for using them in discriminative tasks. Recently, several works have demonstrated the benefits of utilizing hyperbolic spaces for representation learning. Hyperbolic spaces induce compact latent representations due to their exponential volume growth and inherent ability to model hierarchical and structured data. In this work, we explore the use of hyperbolic spaces for vector quantization (HyperVQ), formulating the VQ operation as a hyperbolic Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) problem, in contrast to the Euclidean K-Means clustering used in VQVAE. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that hyperVQ performs comparably in reconstruction and generative tasks while outperforming VQ in discriminative tasks and learning a highly disentangled latent space.</description>

      <title>Super-High-Fidelity Image Compression via Hierarchical-ROI and Adaptive Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned Image Compression (LIC) has achieved dramatic progress regarding objective and subjective metrics. MSE-based models aim to improve objective metrics while generative models are leveraged to improve visual quality measured by subjective metrics. However, they all suffer from blurring or deformation at low bit rates, especially at below $0.2bpp$. Besides, deformation on human faces and text is unacceptable for visual quality assessment, and the problem becomes more prominent on small faces and text. To solve this problem, we combine the advantage of MSE-based models and generative models by utilizing region of interest (ROI). We propose Hierarchical-ROI (H-ROI), to split images into several foreground regions and one background region to improve the reconstruction of regions containing faces, text, and complex textures. Further, we propose adaptive quantization by non-linear mapping within the channel dimension to constrain the bit rate while maintaining the visual quality. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve better visual quality on small faces and text with lower bit rates, e.g., $0.7X$ bits of HiFiC and $0.5X$ bits of BPG.</description>

      <title>Physics-Guided Neural Networks for Intraventricular Vector Flow Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intraventricular vector flow mapping (iVFM) seeks to enhance and quantify color Doppler in cardiac imaging. In this study, we propose novel alternatives to the traditional iVFM optimization scheme by utilizing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and a physics-guided nnU-Net-based supervised approach. Through rigorous evaluation on simulated color Doppler images derived from a patient-specific computational fluid dynamics model and in vivo Doppler acquisitions, both approaches demonstrate comparable reconstruction performance to the original iVFM algorithm. The efficiency of PINNs is boosted through dual-stage optimization and pre-optimized weights. On the other hand, the nnU-Net method excels in generalizability and real time capabilities. Notably, nnU-Net shows superior robustness on sparse and truncated Doppler data while maintaining independence from explicit boundary conditions. Overall, our results highlight the effectiveness of these methods in reconstructing intraventricular vector blood flow. The study also suggests potential applications of PINNs in ultrafast color Doppler imaging and the incorporation of fluid dynamics equations to derive biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases based on blood flow.</description>

      <title>Trustworthiness of Pretrained Transformers for Lung Cancer Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assessed the trustworthiness of two self-supervision pretrained transformer models, Swin UNETR and SMIT, for fine-tuned lung (LC) tumor segmentation using 670 CT and MRI scans. We measured segmentation accuracy on two public 3D-CT datasets, robustness on CT scans of patients with COVID-19, CT scans of patients with ovarian cancer and T2-weighted MRI of men with prostate cancer, and zero-shot generalization of LC for T2-weighted MRIs. Both models demonstrated high accuracy on in-distribution data (Dice 0.80 for SMIT and 0.78 for Swin UNETR). SMIT showed similar near-out-of-distribution performance on CT scans (AUROC 89.85% vs. 89.19%) but significantly better far-out-of-distribution accuracy on CT (AUROC 97.2% vs. 87.1%) and MRI (92.15% vs. 73.8%). SMIT outperformed Swin UNETR in zero-shot segmentation on MRI (Dice 0.78 vs. 0.69). We expect these findings to guide the safe development and deployment of current and future pretrained models in routine clinical use.</description>

      <title>SIFT-DBT: Self-supervised Initialization and Fine-Tuning for Imbalanced Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is a widely used medical imaging modality for breast cancer screening and diagnosis, offering higher spatial resolution and greater detail through its 3D-like breast volume imaging capability. However, the increased data volume also introduces pronounced data imbalance challenges, where only a small fraction of the volume contains suspicious tissue. This further exacerbates the data imbalance due to the case-level distribution in real-world data and leads to learning a trivial classification model that only predicts the majority class. To address this, we propose a novel method using view-level contrastive Self-supervised Initialization and Fine-Tuning for identifying abnormal DBT images, namely SIFT-DBT. We further introduce a patch-level multi-instance learning method to preserve spatial resolution. The proposed method achieves 92.69% volume-wise AUC on an evaluation of 970 unique studies.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Label Distributions for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) aims to train segmentation models by weak labels, which is receiving significant attention due to its low annotation cost. Existing approaches focus on generating pseudo labels for supervision while largely ignoring to leverage the inherent semantic correlation among different pseudo labels. We observe that pseudo-labeled pixels that are close to each other in the feature space are more likely to share the same class, and those closer to the distribution centers tend to have higher confidence. Motivated by this, we propose to model the underlying label distributions and employ cross-label constraints to generate more accurate pseudo labels. In this paper, we develop a unified WSSS framework named Adaptive Gaussian Mixtures Model, which leverages a GMM to model the label distributions. Specifically, we calculate the feature distribution centers of pseudo-labeled pixels and build the GMM by measuring the distance between the centers and each pseudo-labeled pixel. Then, we introduce an Online Expectation-Maximization (OEM) algorithm and a novel maximization loss to optimize the GMM adaptively, aiming to learn more discriminative decision boundaries between different class-wise Gaussian mixtures. Based on the label distributions, we leverage the GMM to generate high-quality pseudo labels for more reliable supervision. Our framework is capable of solving different forms of weak labels: image-level labels, points, scribbles, blocks, and bounding-boxes. Extensive experiments on PASCAL, COCO, Cityscapes, and ADE20K datasets demonstrate that our framework can effectively provide more reliable supervision and outperform the state-of-the-art methods under all settings.

      <title>High-confidence pseudo-labels for domain adaptation in COVID-19 detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper outlines our submission for the 4th COV19D competition as part of the `Domain adaptation, Explainability, Fairness in AI for Medical Image Analysis' (DEF-AI-MIA) workshop at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference (CVPR). The competition consists of two challenges. The first is to train a classifier to detect the presence of COVID-19 from over one thousand CT scans from the COV19-CT-DB database. The second challenge is to perform domain adaptation by taking the dataset from Challenge 1 and adding a small number of scans (some annotated and other not) for a different distribution. We preprocessed the CT scans to segment the lungs, and output volumes with the lungs individually and together. We then trained 3D ResNet and Swin Transformer models on these inputs. We annotated the unlabeled CT scans using an ensemble of these models and chose the high-confidence predictions as pseudo-labels for fine-tuning. This resulted in a best cross-validation mean F1 score of 93.39\% for Challenge 1 and a mean F1 score of 92.15 for Challenge 2.</description>

      <title>Step-Calibrated Diffusion for Biomedical Optical Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality, high-resolution medical imaging is essential for clinical care. Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection, brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately, optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment. Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired image restoration method that views the image restoration problem as completing the finishing steps of a diffusion-based image generation task. RSCD uses a step calibrator model to dynamically determine the severity of image degradation and the number of steps required to complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging. Our code is available at https://github.com/MLNeurosurg/restorative_step-calibrated_diffusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a transformer decoder based model, SportsNGEN, that is trained on sports player and ball tracking sequences that is capable of generating realistic and sustained gameplay. We train and evaluate SportsNGEN on a large database of professional tennis tracking data and demonstrate that by combining the generated simulations with a shot classifier and logic to start and end rallies, the system is capable of simulating an entire tennis match. In addition, a generic version of SportsNGEN can be customized to a specific player by fine-tuning on match data that includes that player. We show that our model is well calibrated and can be used to derive insights for coaches and broadcasters by evaluating counterfactual or what if options. Finally, we show qualitative results indicating the same approach works for football.</description>

      <title>Train Ego-Path Detection on Railway Tracks Using End-to-End Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the task of "train ego-path detection", a refined approach to railway track detection designed for intelligent onboard vision systems. Whereas existing research lacks precision and often considers all tracks within the visual field uniformly, our proposed task specifically aims to identify the train's immediate path, or "ego-path", within potentially complex and dynamic railway environments. Building on this, we extend the RailSem19 dataset with ego-path annotations, facilitating further research in this direction. At the heart of our study lies TEP-Net, an end-to-end deep learning framework tailored for ego-path detection, featuring a configurable model architecture, a dynamic data augmentation strategy, and a domain-specific loss function. Leveraging a regression-based approach, TEP-Net outperforms SOTA: while addressing the track detection problem in a more nuanced way than previously, our model achieves 97.5% IoU on the test set and is faster than all existing methods. Further comparative analysis highlights the relevance of the conceptual choices behind TEP-Net, demonstrating its inherent propensity for robustness across diverse environmental conditions and operational dynamics. This work opens promising avenues for the development of intelligent driver assistance systems and autonomous train operations, paving the way toward safer and more efficient railway transportation.</description>

      <title>Reflectivity Is All You Need!: Advancing LiDAR Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation frameworks predominantly leverage geometry-based features to differentiate objects within a scan. While these methods excel in scenarios with clear boundaries and distinct shapes, their performance declines in environments where boundaries are blurred, particularly in off-road contexts. To address this, recent strides in 3D segmentation algorithms have focused on harnessing raw LiDAR intensity measurements to improve prediction accuracy. Despite these efforts, current learning-based models struggle to correlate the intricate connections between raw intensity and factors such as distance, incidence angle, material reflectivity, and atmospheric conditions. Building upon our prior work, this paper delves into the advantages of employing calibrated intensity (also referred to as reflectivity) within learning-based LiDAR semantic segmentation frameworks. We initially establish that incorporating reflectivity as an input enhances the existing LiDAR semantic segmentation model. Furthermore, we present findings that enable the model to learn to calibrate intensity can boost its performance. Through extensive experimentation on the off-road dataset Rellis-3D, we demonstrate notable improvements. Specifically, converting intensity to reflectivity results in a 4% increase in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) when compared to using raw intensity in Off-road scenarios. Additionally, we also investigate the possible benefits of using calibrated intensity in semantic segmentation in urban environments (SemanticKITTI) and cross-sensor domain adaptation.</description>

      <title>Hermite coordinate interpolation kernels: application to image zooming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number of basic image processing tasks, such as any geometric transformation require interpolation at subpixel image values. In this work we utilize the multidimensional coordinate Hermite spline interpolation defined on non-equal spaced, rectilinear grids and apply it to a very common image processing task, image zooming. Since Hermite interpolation utilizes function values, as well as partial derivative values, it is natural to apply it to image processing tasks as a special case of equi-spaced grid, using numerical approximations of the image partial derivatives at each pixel. Furthermore, the task of image interpolation requires the calculation of image values at positions with nono-zero fractional part. Thus, any spline interpolation can be written as convolution with an appropriate kernel. In this context we generate the Hermite kernels according to the derived $n-$dimensional interpolant of Theorem 2 in [1]. We show that despite the increased complexity of the interpolant, once the kernels are constructed, the Hermite spline interpolation can be applied to images as efficiently as any other less complicated method. Finally, we perform illustrative numerical examples to showcase the applicability and high accuracy of the proposed Hermite kernels for image zooming, compared to other interpolation methods, both traditional convolution-based, as well as employing deep learning, in terms of PSNR, as well as SSIM error metrics. The proposed Hermite spline kernels outperform all other methods in the majority of the test images, in experiments using many cascaded repetitions of the zoom operation. Interesting conclusions can be drawn considering all methods under comparison.</description>

      <title>HyperFusion: A Hypernetwork Approach to Multimodal Integration of Tabular and Medical Imaging Data for Predictive Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of diverse clinical modalities such as medical imaging and the tabular data obtained by the patients' Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is a crucial aspect of modern healthcare. The integrative analysis of multiple sources can provide a comprehensive understanding of a patient's condition and can enhance diagnoses and treatment decisions. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) consistently showcase outstanding performance in a wide range of multimodal tasks in the medical domain. However, the complex endeavor of effectively merging medical imaging with clinical, demographic and genetic information represented as numerical tabular data remains a highly active and ongoing research pursuit.
  We present a novel framework based on hypernetworks to fuse clinical imaging and tabular data by conditioning the image processing on the EHR's values and measurements. This approach aims to leverage the complementary information present in these modalities to enhance the accuracy of various medical applications. We demonstrate the strength and the generality of our method on two different brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analysis tasks, namely, brain age prediction conditioned by subject's sex, and multiclass Alzheimer's Disease (AD) classification conditioned by tabular data. We show that our framework outperforms both single-modality models and state-of-the-art MRI-tabular data fusion methods. The code, enclosed to this manuscript will be made publicly available.</description>

Abstract: This work aims to promote Chinese opera research in both musical and speech domains, with a primary focus on overcoming the data limitations. We introduce KunquDB, a relatively large-scale, well-annotated audio-visual dataset comprising 339 speakers and 128 hours of content. Originating from the Kunqu Opera Art Canon (Kunqu yishu dadian), KunquDB is meticulously structured by dialogue lines, providing explicit annotations including character names, speaker names, gender information, vocal manner classifications, and accompanied by preliminary text transcriptions. KunquDB provides a versatile foundation for role-centric acoustic studies and advancements in speech-related research, including Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV). Beyond enriching opera research, this dataset bridges the gap between artistic expression and technological innovation. Pioneering the exploration of ASV in Chinese opera, we construct four test trials considering two distinct vocal manners in opera voices: stage speech (ST) and singing (S). Implementing domain adaptation methods effectively mitigates domain mismatches induced by these vocal manner variations while there is still room for further improvement as a benchmark.</description>

Abstract: Ship detection from satellite imagery using Deep Learning (DL) is an indispensable solution for maritime surveillance. However, applying DL models trained on one dataset to others having differences in spatial resolution and radiometric features requires many adjustments. To overcome this issue, this paper focused on the DL models trained on datasets that consist of different optical images and a combination of radar and optical data. When dealing with a limited number of training images, the performance of DL models via this approach was satisfactory. They could improve 5-20% of average precision, depending on the optical images tested. Likewise, DL models trained on the combined optical and radar dataset could be applied to both optical and radar images. Our experiments showed that the models trained on an optical dataset could be used for radar images, while those trained on a radar dataset offered very poor scores when applied to optical images.</description>

      <title>Malaria Parasitic Detection using a New Deep Boosted and Ensemble Learning Framework</title>

Abstract: Malaria is a potentially fatal plasmodium parasite injected by female anopheles mosquitoes that infect red blood cells and millions worldwide yearly. However, specialists' manual screening in clinical practice is laborious and prone to error. Therefore, a novel Deep Boosted and Ensemble Learning (DBEL) framework, comprising the stacking of new Boosted-BR-STM convolutional neural networks (CNN) and the ensemble ML classifiers, is developed to screen malaria parasite images. The proposed Boosted-BR-STM is based on a new dilated-convolutional block-based split transform merge (STM) and feature-map Squeezing-Boosting (SB) ideas. Moreover, the new STM block uses regional and boundary operations to learn the malaria parasite's homogeneity, heterogeneity, and boundary with patterns. Furthermore, the diverse boosted channels are attained by employing Transfer Learning-based new feature-map SB in STM blocks at the abstract, medium, and conclusion levels to learn minute intensity and texture variation of the parasitic pattern. The proposed DBEL framework implicates the stacking of prominent and diverse boosted channels and provides the generated discriminative features of the developed Boosted-BR-STM to the ensemble of ML classifiers. The proposed framework improves the discrimination ability and generalization of ensemble learning. Moreover, the deep feature spaces of the developed Boosted-BR-STM and customized CNNs are fed into ML classifiers for comparative analysis. The proposed DBEL framework outperforms the existing techniques on the NIH malaria dataset that are enhanced using discrete wavelet transform to enrich feature space. The proposed DBEL framework achieved Accuracy (98.50%), Sensitivity (0.9920), F-score (0.9850), and AUC (0.997), which suggest it to be utilized for malaria parasite screening.</description>

      <title>Lossless Point Cloud Geometry and Attribute Compression Using a Learned Conditional Probability Model</title>

Abstract: In recent years, we have witnessed the presence of point cloud data in many aspects of our life, from immersive media, autonomous driving to healthcare, although at the cost of a tremendous amount of data. In this paper, we present an efficient lossless point cloud compression method that uses sparse tensor-based deep neural networks to learn point cloud geometry and color probability distributions. Our method represents a point cloud with both occupancy feature and three attribute features at different bit depths in a unified sparse representation. This allows us to efficiently exploit feature-wise and point-wise dependencies within point clouds using a sparse tensor-based neural network and thus build an accurate auto-regressive context model for an arithmetic coder. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning-based lossless point cloud geometry and attribute compression approach. Compared with the-state-of-the-art lossless point cloud compression method from Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), our method achieves 22.6% reduction in total bitrate on a diverse set of test point clouds while having 49.0% and 18.3% rate reduction on geometry and color attribute component, respectively.</description>

      <title>DermSynth3D: Synthesis of in-the-wild Annotated Dermatology Images</title>

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning (DL) has shown great potential in the field of dermatological image analysis. However, existing datasets in this domain have significant limitations, including a small number of image samples, limited disease conditions, insufficient annotations, and non-standardized image acquisitions. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel framework called DermSynth3D. DermSynth3D blends skin disease patterns onto 3D textured meshes of human subjects using a differentiable renderer and generates 2D images from various camera viewpoints under chosen lighting conditions in diverse background scenes. Our method adheres to top-down rules that constrain the blending and rendering process to create 2D images with skin conditions that mimic in-the-wild acquisitions, ensuring more meaningful results. The framework generates photo-realistic 2D dermoscopy images and the corresponding dense annotations for semantic segmentation of the skin, skin conditions, body parts, bounding boxes around lesions, depth maps, and other 3D scene parameters, such as camera position and lighting conditions. DermSynth3D allows for the creation of custom datasets for various dermatology tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of data generated using DermSynth3D by training DL models on synthetic data and evaluating them on various dermatology tasks using real 2D dermatological images. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/sfu-mial/DermSynth3D.</description>

      <title>Weakly supervised segmentation of intracranial aneurysms using a novel 3D focal modulation UNet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate identification and quantification of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) is crucial for the risk assessment and treatment of this cerebrovascular disorder. Current 2D manual assessment on 3D magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is suboptimal and time-consuming. In addition, one major issue in medical image segmentation is the need for large well-annotated data, which can be expensive to obtain. Techniques that mitigate this requirement, such as weakly supervised learning with coarse labels are highly desirable. In the paper, we propose FocalSegNet, a novel 3D focal modulation UNet, to detect an aneurysm and offer an initial, coarse segmentation of it from time-of-flight MRA image patches, which is further refined with a dense conditional random field (CRF) post-processing layer to produce a final segmentation map. We trained and evaluated our model on a public dataset, and in terms of UIA detection, our model showed a low false-positive rate of 0.21 and a high sensitivity of 0.80. For voxel-wise aneurysm segmentation, we achieved a Dice score of 0.68 and a 95% Hausdorff distance of ~0.95 mm, demonstrating its strong performance. We evaluated our algorithms against the state-of-the-art 3D Residual-UNet and Swin-UNETR, and illustrated the superior performance of our proposed FocalSegNet, highlighting the advantages of employing focal modulation for this task.</description>

      <title>CoNeS: Conditional neural fields with shift modulation for multi-sequence MRI translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has found wide applications in both modern clinical studies and deep learning research. However, in clinical practice, it frequently occurs that one or more of the MRI sequences are missing due to different image acquisition protocols or contrast agent contraindications of patients, limiting the utilization of deep learning models trained on multi-sequence data. One promising approach is to leverage generative models to synthesize the missing sequences, which can serve as a surrogate acquisition. State-of-the-art methods tackling this problem are based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) which usually suffer from spectral biases, resulting in poor reconstruction of high-frequency fine details. In this paper, we propose Conditional Neural fields with Shift modulation (CoNeS), a model that takes voxel coordinates as input and learns a representation of the target images for multi-sequence MRI translation. The proposed model uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) instead of a CNN as the decoder for pixel-to-pixel mapping. Hence, each target image is represented as a neural field that is conditioned on the source image via shift modulation with a learned latent code. Experiments on BraTS 2018 and an in-house clinical dataset of vestibular schwannoma patients showed that the proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art methods for multi-sequence MRI translation both visually and quantitatively. Moreover, we conducted spectral analysis, showing that CoNeS was able to overcome the spectral bias issue common in conventional CNN models. To further evaluate the usage of synthesized images in clinical downstream tasks, we tested a segmentation network using the synthesized images at inference.</description>

      <title>Immunohistochemistry guided segmentation of benign epithelial cells, in situ lesions, and invasive epithelial cells in breast cancer slides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital pathology enables automatic analysis of histopathological sections using artificial intelligence (AI). Automatic evaluation could improve diagnostic efficiency and help find associations between morphological features and clinical outcome. For development of such prediction models, identifying invasive epithelial cells, and separating these from benign epithelial cells and in situ lesions would be the first step. In this study, we aimed to develop an AI model for segmentation of epithelial cells in sections from breast cancer. We generated epithelial ground truth masks by restaining hematoxylin and eosin (HE) sections with cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, and by pathologists' annotations. HE/CK image pairs were used to train a convolutional neural network, and data augmentation was used to make the model more robust. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 839 patients, and whole slide images from two patients were used for training and evaluation of the models. The sections were derived from four cohorts of breast cancer patients. TMAs from 21 patients from a fifth cohort was used as a second test set. In quantitative evaluation, a mean Dice score of 0.70, 0.79, and 0.75 for invasive epithelial cells, benign epithelial cells, and in situ lesions, respectively, were achieved. In qualitative scoring (0-5) by pathologists, results were best for all epithelium and invasive epithelium, with scores of 4.7 and 4.4. Scores for benign epithelium and in situ lesions were 3.7 and 2.0. The proposed model segmented epithelial cells in HE stained breast cancer slides well, but further work is needed for accurate division between the classes. Immunohistochemistry, together with pathologists' annotations, enabled the creation of accurate ground truths. The model is made freely available in FastPathology and the code is available at https://github.com/AICAN-Research/breast-epithelium-segmentation</description>

      <title>Towards Architecture-Agnostic Untrained Network Priors for Image Reconstruction with Frequency Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Untrained networks inspired by deep image prior have shown promising capabilities in recovering a high-quality image from noisy or partial measurements, without requiring training data. Their success has been widely attributed to the spectral bias acting as an implicit regularization induced by suitable network architectures. However, applications of such network-based priors often entail superfluous architectural decisions, overfitting risks, and slow optimization, all of which hinder their practicality. In this work, we propose efficient, architecture-agnostic methods for a more direct frequency control over the network priors: 1) constraining the bandwidth of the white-noise input, 2) controlling the bandwidth of the interpolation-based upsamplers, and 3) regularizing the Lipschitz constants of the layers. We show that even with just one extra line of code, the overfitting issues in underperforming architectures can be alleviated such that their performance gaps with the high-performing counterparts can be largely closed despite their distinct configurations, mitigating the need for architecture tuning. This then makes it possible to employ a more compact model to achieve similar or superior performance to larger models with greater efficiency. Our regularized network priors compare favorably with current supervised and self-supervised methods on MRI reconstruction and image inpainting tasks, serving as a stronger zero-shot baseline reconstructor. Our code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Content-aware Masked Image Modeling Transformer for Stereo Image Compression</title>

Abstract: Existing learning-based stereo image codec adopt sophisticated transformation with simple entropy models derived from single image codecs to encode latent representations. However, those entropy models struggle to effectively capture the spatial-disparity characteristics inherent in stereo images, which leads to suboptimal rate-distortion results. In this paper, we propose a stereo image compression framework, named CAMSIC. CAMSIC independently transforms each image to latent representation and employs a powerful decoder-free Transformer entropy model to capture both spatial and disparity dependencies, by introducing a novel content-aware masked image modeling (MIM) technique. Our content-aware MIM facilitates efficient bidirectional interaction between prior information and estimated tokens, which naturally obviates the need for an extra Transformer decoder. Experiments show that our stereo image codec achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on two stereo image datasets Cityscapes and InStereo2K with fast encoding and decoding speed.</description>

      <title>Lightweight, error-tolerant edge detection using memristor-enabled stochastic logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand for efficient edge vision has spurred the interest in developing stochastic computing approaches for performing image processing tasks. Memristors with inherent stochasticity readily introduce probability into the computations and thus enable stochastic image processing computations. Here, we present a stochastic computing approach for edge detection, a fundamental image processing technique, facilitated with memristor-enabled stochastic logics. Specifically, we integrate the memristors with logic circuits and harness the stochasticity from the memristors to realize compact stochastic logics for stochastic number encoding and processing. The stochastic numbers, exhibiting well-regulated probabilities and correlations, can be processed to perform logic operations with statistical probabilities. This can facilitate lightweight stochastic edge detection for edge visual scenarios characterized with high-level noise errors. As a practical demonstration, we implement a hardware stochastic Roberts cross operator using the stochastic logics, and prove its exceptional edge detection performance, remarkably, with 95% less computational cost while withstanding 50% bit-flip errors. The results underscore the great potential of our stochastic edge detection approach in developing lightweight, error-tolerant edge vision hardware and systems for autonomous driving, virtual/augmented reality, medical imaging diagnosis, industrial automation, and beyond.</description>

      <title>D-YOLO a robust framework for object detection in adverse weather conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adverse weather conditions including haze, snow and rain lead to decline in image qualities, which often causes a decline in performance for deep-learning based detection networks. Most existing approaches attempts to rectify hazy images before performing object detection, which increases the complexity of the network and may result in the loss in latent information. To better integrate image restoration and object detection tasks, we designed a double-route network with an attention feature fusion module, taking both hazy and dehazed features into consideration. We also proposed a subnetwork to provide haze-free features to the detection network. Specifically, our D-YOLO improves the performance of the detection network by minimizing the distance between the clear feature extraction subnetwork and detection network. Experiments on RTTS and FoggyCityscapes datasets show that D-YOLO demonstrates better performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. It is a robust detection framework for bridging the gap between low-level dehazing and high-level detection.</description>
