      <description>arXiv:2405.02701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a Chevalley group over a field $\Bbbk$. Fix a maximal torus $\mathbb{T}$ in $ G $, along with opposite Borel subgroups $ B $ and $ B^-$ satisfying $ \mathbb{T} = B \cap B^-$, and denote by $ \mathbb{U} := R_u(B) $ and $ \mathbb{L} := R_u(B^-)$ their respective unipotent radicals. We prove that the multiplication map $ \mu \colon \mathbb{L} \times \mathbb{U}\times \mathbb{L} \times \mathbb{U} \longrightarrow G $ is syntomic and faithfully flat over any base field $ \Bbbk$.</description>

      <title>Weighted Ehrhart theory via equivariant toric geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a $K$-theoretic and geometric interpretation for a generalized weighted Ehrhart theory of a full-dimensional lattice polytope $P$, depending on a given homogeneous polynomial function $\varphi$ on $P$, and with Laurent polynomial weights $f_Q(y)\in \mathbb{Z}[y^{\pm 1}]$ associated to the faces $Q \preceq P$ of the polytope. For this purpose, we calculate equivariant $K$-theoretic Hodge-Chern classes of an equivariant mixed Hodge module $\mathcal{M}$ on the toric variety $X_P$ associated to $P$ (defined via an equivariant embedding of $X_P$ into an ambient smooth variety). For any integer $\ell$, we introduce a corresponding equivariant Hodge $\chi_y$-polynomial $\chi_y(X_P, \ell D_P; [\mathcal{M}])$, with $D_P$ the corresponding ample Cartier divisor on $X_P$ (defined by the facet presentation of $P$). Motivic properties of the Hodge-Chern classes are used to express this equivariant Hodge polynomial in terms of weighted character sums fitting with a generalized weighted Ehrhart theory. The equivariant Hodge polynomials are shown to satisfy a reciprocity and purity formula fitting with the duality for equivariant mixed Hodge modules, and implying the corresponding properties for the generalized weighted Ehrhart polynomials. In the special case of the equivariant intersection cohomology mixed Hodge module, with the weight function corresponding to Stanley's $g$-function of the polar polytope of $P$, we recover in geometric terms a recent combinatorial formula of Beck--Gunnells--Materov.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the generating function $\Phi^{(N)}$ for the reciprocals $N$-th power of factorials. We show a connection of product formulas for such series with the periods for certain families of algebraic hypersurfaces. For these families we describe their singular loci. We show that these singular loci are given by zeros of the Buchstaber-Rees polynomials, which define $N$-valued group laws. We describe a generalized Frobenius method and use it to obtain special expansions for multiplication kernels in the sense of Kontsevich. Using these expansions we provide some experimental results that connect $N$-Bessel kernels and the hierarchies of the palindromic unimodal polynomials. We study the properties of such polynomials and conjecture positivity of their roots. We also discuss the connection with Kloosterman motives as a version of the mirror duality.</description>

      <title>The period-index conjecture for abelian threefolds and Donaldson-Thomas theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the period-index conjecture for unramified Brauer classes on abelian threefolds. To do so, we develop a theory of reduced Donaldson-Thomas invariants for 3-dimensional Calabi-Yau categories, with the feature that the noncommutative variational integral Hodge conjecture holds for classes with nonvanishing invariant. The period-index result is then proved by interpreting it as the algebraicity of a Hodge class on the twisted derived category, and specializing within the Hodge locus to an untwisted abelian threefold with nonvanishing invariant. As a consequence, we also deduce the integral Hodge conjecture for generically twisted abelian threefolds.</description>

      <title>The spectral genus of an isolated hypersurface singularity and a conjecture relating to the Milnor number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of spectral genus $\widetilde{p}_{g}$ of a deformation of a germ of an isolated hypersurface singularity $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1}, 0) \to (\mathbb{C}, 0)$, defined as a sum of small exponents of monodromy eigenvalues. The number of these is equal to the geometric genus $p_{g}$, and hence $\widetilde{p}_g$ can be considered as a secondary invariant to it. We then explore a secondary version of the Durfee conjecture on $p_{g}$, regarding the relationship between $\widetilde{p}_{g}$ the Milnor number $\mu$, to the effect that $$\frac{\mu}{(n+2)!} &gt; \widetilde{p}_g.$$ We provide evidence by confirming the conjecture in several cases, including homogeneous singularities and singularities with large Newton polyhedra, and quasi-homogeneous or irreducible curve singularities.
  Our conjecture is shown to relate closely to the asymptotic behavior of the holomorphic analytic torsion of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on a degeneration of projective varieties, potentially indicating deeper geometric and analytic connections.</description>

      <title>On isolated hypersurface singularities: algebra-geometric and symplectic aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes are based on a seminar which took place in the autumn of 2022 at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Leiden.
  Its goal was to understand the recent work of J. Evans and Y. Lekili on the symplectic cohomology of the Milnor fiber for specific classes of isolated singularities. This work uses inputs from several fields, notably from algebraic geometry, in particular singularity theory, and from symplectic geometry. The main aim of the notes is to make the work of J. Evans and Y. Lekili more accessible by explaining the main ideas from these fields and indicate how these play a role in this work.</description>

      <title>Tropical Vector Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to introduce a construction of a vector bundle on a tropical variety. When the base is a tropical toric variety these tropicalize toric vector bundles, and are described by the data of a valuated matroid and some flats in the lattice of flats of the underlying matroid. The fibers are tropical linear spaces. We define global sections for tropical toric vector bundles, stability, and Jordan-H\"older and Harder-Narasimhan filtrations. Many of these require additional modularity assumptions on the defining matroid.</description>

      <title>Toric matroid bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments have produced new ways to encode the data of a torus equivariant vector bundle over a toric variety using certain representable matroid(s) labeled by polyhedral data. In this paper we show that this data makes sense for non-representable matroids as well. We call the resulting combinatorial objects toric matorid bundles. We define equivariant $K$-theory and characteristic classes of these bundles. As a particular case, we show that any matroid comes with tautological toric matroid bundles over the permutahedral toric variety and the corresponding equivariant K-classes and Chern classes agree with those in the recent work of Berger-Eur-Spink-Tseng on matroid invariants. Moreover, in analogy with toric vector bundles, we define sheaf of sections and Euler characteristic as well as positivity notions such as global generation, ampleness and nefness for toric matroid bundles. Finally, we study the splitting of toric matroid bundles and, in particular, an analogue of Grothendieck's theorem on splitting of vector bundles on the projective line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the geometric Langlands functor in one direction (from the automorphic to the spectral side) in characteristic zero settings (i.e., de Rham and Betti). We prove that various forms of the conjecture (de Rham vs Betti, restricted vs. non-restricted, tempered vs. non-tempered) are equivalent. We also discuss structural properties of Hecke eigensheaves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series of five that together prove the geometric Langlands conjecture. Our goals are two-fold:
  (1) Formulate and prove the Fundamental Local Equivalence (FLE) at the critical level;
  (2) Study the interaction between Kac-Moody localization and the global geometric Langlands functor of ref. [GLC1].
  This paper contains an extensive Appendix, whose primary goals are:
  (a) Development the theory of ind-coherent sheaves in infinite type;
  (b)Development of the formalism of factorization categories.</description>

Abstract: We prove a lower bound for the size of the isogeny class of a simple abelian variety over a finite field with commutative endomorphism ring in the extended Lubin-Tate case. Moreover, based on the expected size of the isogeny classes in the Newton stratum, we conjecture that this lower bound is sharp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the existence of a $Z$-positive and $Z$-critical Hermitian metric on a rank 2 holomorphic vector bundle over a compact K\"ahler surface implies that the bundle is $Z$-stable. As particular cases, we obtain stability results for the deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills equation and the almost Hermite-Einstein equation for rank 2 bundles over surfaces. We show examples of $Z$-unstable bundles and $Z$-critical metrics away from the large volume limit.</description>

      <title>Non-Perturbative Corrections to 3d BPS Indices and Topological Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a 3d gauged linear sigma model parametrized by a Kahler manifold X, the 3d BPS index defines a q-series that can be analytically continued in the Kahler modulus by standard methods. It is argued that an SL(2,Z)-transform of the Birkhoff connection matrix captures non-perturbative corrections to the 3d GLSM. As an application, a 3d lift of the standard 2d GLSM for the resolved conifold is shown to provide a world-volume dual for the non-perturbative topological string on the resolved conifold. The perturbative 3d BPS index computes the Gopakumar-Vafa partition function, while the analytic continuation matches existing proposals for a non-perturbative completion of the topological string.</description>

      <title>Equivariant algebraic $\mathrm{K}$-theory and Artin $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the Quillen-Lichtenbaum Conjecture relating special values of Dedekind zeta functions to algebraic $\mathrm{K}$-groups. The former has been settled by Rost-Voevodsky up to the Iwasawa Main Conjecture. Our generalization extends the scope of this conjecture to Artin $L$-functions of Galois representations of finite, function, and totally real number fields. The statement of this conjecture relates norms of the special values of these $L$-functions to sizes of equivariant algebraic $\mathrm{K}$-groups with coefficients in an equivariant Moore spectrum attached to a Galois representation.
  We prove this conjecture in many cases, integrally, except up to a possible factor of powers of $2$ in the non-abelian and totally real number field case. In the finite field case, we further determine the group structures of their equivariant algebraic $\mathrm{K}$-groups with coefficients in Galois representations. At heart, our method lifts the M\"obius inversion formula for factorizations of zeta functions as a product of $L$-functions, to the $E_1$-page of an equivariant spectral sequence converging to equivariant algebraic $\mathrm{K}$-groups. Additionally, the spectral Mackey functor structure on equivariant $\mathrm{K}$-theory allows us to incorporate certain ramified extensions that appear in these $L$-functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a positive answer to a question of J. Doyle and J. Silverman about fields of definition of dynamical systems on $\mathbb{P}^{n}$. We prove that, for fixed $n$, there exists a constant $C_{n}$ such that every dynamical system $\mathbb{P}^{n}\to\mathbb{P}^{n}$ is defined over an extension of degree $\le C_{n}$ of the field of moduli. More generally, the same bound works for any kind of "algebraic structure" defined over $\mathbb{P}^{n}$, such as embedded curves, hypersurfaces, algebraic cycles. As a consequence we prove that, if $x\in X(k)$ is a rational point of an $n$-dimensional variety with quotient singularities, there exists a field extension $k'/k$ of degree $\le C_{n-1}$ such that $x$ lifts to a $k'$-rational point of any resolution of singularities.</description>

Abstract: We prove general type results for orthogonal modular varieties associated with the moduli of compact hyperk\"ahler manifolds of deformation generalised Kummer type ('deformation generalised Kummer varieties'). In particular, we consider moduli spaces of deformation generalised Kummer fourfolds with split-polarisation of degree $2d$. Our main result is that when $d$ is prime or $2d$ is square-free then the associated modular varieties are of general type when $d$ exceeds bounds we determine, subject to the existence of certain low-weight cusp forms for $\operatorname{O}(2,n)$. As a corollary, we conclude that the corresponding moduli spaces are also of general type.</description>

Abstract: We prove a sort of reconstruction theorem for generic elliptic Calabi-Yau $3$-folds in the sense of C\u{a}ld\u{a}raru. From our argument it follows that two generic elliptic Calabi-Yau $3$-folds are derived-equivalent linear over the base if and only if their generic fibers are derived-equivalent. As an application, we give affirmative answers to the conjectures raised by Knapp-Scheidegger-Schimannek. Namely, for each pair of elliptic Calabi-Yau $3$-folds in their list we prove that they share the relative Jacobian and are $P^2$-linear derived-equivalent.</description>

      <title>On regular but non-smooth integral curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a regular geometrically integral curve over an imperfect field $K$ and assume that it admits a non-smooth point $\mathfrak{p}$ which -- seen as a prime of the separable function field $K(C)|K$ -- is non-decomposed in the base field extension $\overline{K} \otimes_K K(C)|\overline{K}$. In this paper we establish a bound for the number of iterated Frobenius pullbacks needed in order to transform $\mathfrak{p}$ into a rational point. This provides an algorithm to compute geometric $\delta$-invariants of non-smooth points and a procedure to construct fibrations with moving singularities of prescribed $\delta$-invariants. We show that the bound is sharp in characteristic 2. We further study the geometry of a pencil of plane projective rational quartics in characteristic 2 whose generic fibre attains our bound. On our way, we prove several results on separable and non-decomposed points that might be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We classify combinations of isolated singularities that can occur on complex cubic threefolds generalizing analogous results for cubic surfaces due to Schl\"{a}fli and Bruce--Wall.

      <title>Syzygies of secant varieties of curves of genus 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ein, Niu and Park showed in [ENP20] that if the degree of the line bundle $L$ on a curve of genus $g$ is at least $2g+2k+1$, the $k$-th secant variety of the curve via the embedding defined by the complete linear system of $L$ is normal, projectively normal and arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay, and they also proved some vanishing of the Betti diagrams. However, the length of the linear strand of weight $k+1$ of the resolution of the secant variety $\Sigma_k$ of a curve of $g\geq2$ is still mysterious. In this paper we calculate the complete Betti diagrams of the secant varieties of curves of genus $2$ using Boij-S\"{o}derberg theory. The main idea is to find the pure diagrams that contribute to the Betti diagram of the secant variety via calculating some special positions of the Betti diagram.</description>

      <title>Fibrations by plane quartic curves with a canonical moving singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify fibrations by integral plane projective rational quartic curves whose generic fibre is regular but admits a non-smooth point that is a canonical divisor. These fibrations can only exist in characteristic two. The geometric generic fibre, which determines the generic behaviour of the special fibres, is an integral plane projective rational quartic curve over the algebraic closure of the function field of the base. It has the remarkable property that the tangent lines at the non-singular points are either all bitangents or all non-ordinary inflection tangents; moreover it is strange, that is, all the tangent lines meet in a common point. We construct two fibrations that are universal in the sense that any other fibration with the aforementioned properties can be obtained from one of them by a base extension. Furthermore, among these fibrations we choose a pencil of plane quartic curves and study in detail its geometry. We determine the corresponding minimal regular model and we describe it as a purely inseparable double covering of a quasi-elliptic fibration.</description>

      <title>Periodic and quasi-motivic pencils of flat connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of a periodic pencil of flat connections on a smooth algebraic variety $X$. This is a family $\nabla(s_1,...,s_n)$ of flat connections on a trivial vector bundle on $X$ depending linearly on parameters $s_1,...,s_n$ and generically invariant, up to isomorphism, under the shifts $s_i\mapsto s_i+1$ for all $i$. If in addition $\nabla$ has regular singularities, we call it a quasi-motivic pencil. We use tools from complex analysis to establish various remarkable properties of such pencils over $\mathbb C$. For example, we show that the monodromy of a quasi-motivic pencil is defined over the field of algebraic functions in $e^{2\pi is_j}$, and that its singularities are constrained to an arrangement of hyperplanes with integer normal vectors. Then we show that many important examples of families of flat connections, such as Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov, Dunkl, and Casimir connections, are quasi-motivic and thus periodic pencils.
  Besides being interesting in its own right, the periodic property of a pencil of flat connections turns out to be very useful in computing the eigenvalues of the $p$-curvature of its reduction to positive characteristic. This will be done in our forthcoming paper.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if $X$ is a compact complex analytic variety, which has quotient singularities in codimension 2, then there is a projective bimeromorphic morphism $f\colon Y\to X$, such that $Y$ has quotient singularities, and that the indeterminacy locus of $f^{-1}$ has codimension at least 3 in $X$. As an application, we deduce the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality on orbifold Chern classes for stable reflexive coherent sheaves on compact K\"ahler varieties which have quotient singularities in codimension 2.</description>

Abstract: We show that the smooth theta divisors of general principally polarised abelian varieties can be chosen as irreducible algebraic representatives of the coefficients of the Chern-Dold character in complex cobordisms and describe the action of the Landweber-Novikov operations on them. We introduce a quantisation of the complex cobordism theory with the dual Landweber-Novikov algebra as the deformation parameter space and show that the Chern-Dold character can be interpreted as the composition of quantisation and dequantisation maps. Some smooth real-analytic representatives of the cobordism classes of theta divisors are described in terms of the classical Weierstrass elliptic functions. The link with the Milnor-Hirzebruch problem about possible characteristic numbers of irreducible algebraic varieties is discussed.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Grothendieck polynomials appearing in the K-theory of Grassmannians, which are analogs of Schur polynomials. This paper aims to establish a version of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for Grothendieck polynomials of the Grassmannian type. This rule allows us to express the product of a Grothendieck polynomial with a power sum symmetric polynomial into a linear combination of other Grothendieck polynomials.</description>

  3) the Galois group \Gal(f) of f(x) acts doubly transitively on the set of roots of f(x);
  4) the index of every maximal subgroup of Gal(f) does not divide deg(f)-1.
  Then the endomorphism ring of the Jacobian of the superelliptic curve y^p=f(x) is isomorphic to the pth cyclotomic ring for all primes p&gt;deg(f).</description>

Abstract: Calabi-Yau manifolds can be obtained as hypersurfaces in toric varieties built from reflexive polytopes. We generate reflexive polytopes in various dimensions using a genetic algorithm. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that our algorithm reproduces the full set of reflexive polytopes in two and three dimensions, and in four dimensions with a small number of vertices and points. Motivated by this result, we construct five-dimensional reflexive polytopes with the lowest number of vertices and points. By calculating the normal form of the polytopes, we establish that many of these are not in existing datasets and therefore give rise to new Calabi-Yau four-folds. In some instances, the Hodge numbers we compute are new as well.</description>

Abstract: We give an algebraic characterization of the affine $3$-space over an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic. We use this characterization to reformulate the following question. Let $$A=k[X, Y, Z, T]/(XY+Z^{p^e}+T+T^{sp})$$ where $p^e\nmid sp$, $sp\nmid p^e$, $e, s\geq 1$ and $k$ is an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic $p$. Is $A= k^{[3]}$? We prove some results on ML and ML$^*$ invariants and use them to prove a special case of the strong cancellation of $k^{[2]}$.</description>

      <title>Reverse H\"older inequalities on the space of K\"ahler metrics of a Fano variety and effective openness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A reverse H\"older inequality is established on the space of K\"ahler metrics in the first Chern class of a Fano manifold X endowed with Darvas L^{p}-Finsler metrics. The inequality holds under a uniform bound on a twisted Ricci potential and extends to Fano varieties with log terminal singularities. Its proof leverages a "hidden" log-concavity. An application to destabilizing geodesic rays is provided, which yields a reverse H\"older inequality for the speed of the geodesic. In the case of Aubin's continuity path on a K-unstable Fano variety, the constant in the corresponding H\"older bound is shown to only depend on p and the dimension of X. This leads to some intruiging relations to Harnack bounds and the partial C^{0}-estimate. In another direction, universal effective openness results are established for the complex singularity exponents (log canonical thresholds) of \omega-plurisubharmonic functions on any Fano variety. Finally, another application to K-unstable Fano varieties is given, involving Archimedean Igusa zeta functions.</description>

      <title>Density functions for epsilon multiplicity and families of ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A density function for an algebraic invariant is a measurable function on $\mathbb{R}$ which measures the invariant on an $\mathbb{R}$-scale. This function carries a lot more information related to the invariant without seeking extra data. It has turned out to be a useful tool, which was introduced by the third author, to study the characteristic $p$ invariant, namely Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of a graded ${\bf m}$-primary ideal.
  Here we construct density functions $f_{A,\{I_n\}}$ for a Noetherian filtration $\{I_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ of graded ideals and $f_{A,\{\widetilde{I^n}\}}$ for a filtration given by the saturation of powers of a graded ideal $I$ in a standard graded domain $A$. As a consequence, we get a density function $f_{\varepsilon(I)}$ for the epsilon multiplicity $\varepsilon(I)$ of a graded ideal $I$ in $A$. We further show that the function $f_{A,\{I_n\}}$ is continuous everywhere except possibly at one point, and $f_{A,\{\widetilde{I^n}\}}$ is a continuous function everywhere and is continuously differentiable except possibly at one point. As a corollary the epsilon density function $f_{\varepsilon(I)}$ is a compactly supported continuous function on $\mathbb{R}$ except at one point, such that $\int_{\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}} f_{\varepsilon(I)} = \varepsilon(I)$.
  All the three functions $f_{A,\{I^n\}}$, $f_{A,\{\widetilde{I^n}\}}$ and $f_{\varepsilon(I)}$ remain invariant under passage to the integral closure of $I$.
  As a corollary of this theory, we express the mixed multiplicities $e_i(A[It])$ of the Rees algebra of a graded ideal $I$ in terms of the intersection numbers of two Cartier divisors on $X=\mathbf{Proj} \left(\oplus_{n\geq 0}\mathcal{I}^n\right)$, where $\mathcal{I}$ is the ideal sheaf associated to $I$ on $\mathrm{Proj}~A$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study some codes of algebraic geometry related to certain maximal curves. Quantum stabilizer codes obtained through the self orthogonality of Hermitian codes of this error correcting do not always have good parameters. However, appropriate parameters found that the Hermitian self-orthogonal code quantum stabilizer code has good parameters. Therefore, we investigated the quantum stabilizer code at a certain maximum curve and modified its parameters. Algebraic geometry codes show promise for enabling high data rate transmission over noisy power line communication channels.</description>

      <title>Module schemes in invariant theory</title>

Abstract: Let G be a finite group acting linearly on the polynomial ring with invariant ring R. If the action is small, then a classical result of Auslander gives in dimension two a correspondence between linear representations of G and maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-modules. We establish a correspondence for all linear actions between representations and objects over the invariant ring by looking at quotient module schemes (up to modification) instead of the modules of covariants.</description>
