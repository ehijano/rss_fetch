      <title>Imaging the Northern Los Angeles Basins with Autocorrelations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show reflectivity cross-sections for the San Gabriel, Chino, and San Bernardino basins north of Los Angeles, California determined from autocorrelations of ambient noise and teleseismic earthquake waves. These basins are thought to channel the seismic energy from earthquakes on the San Andreas Fault to Los Angeles and a more accurate model of their depth is important for hazard mitigation. We use the causal side of the autocorrelation function to determine the zero-offset reflection response. To minimize the smoothing effect of the source time function, we remove the common mode from the autocorrelation in order to reveal the zero-offset reflection response. We apply this to 10 temporary nodal lines consisting of a total of 758 geophones with an intraline spacing of 250-300 m. We also show that the autocorrelation function from teleseismic events can provide illumination of subsurface that is consistent with ambient noise. Both autocorrelation results compare favorably to receiver functions.</description>

      <title>On the viscoelastic-electromagnetic-gravitational analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analogy between electromagnetism and gravitation was achieved by linearizing the tensorial gravitational equations of general relativity and converting them into a vector form corresponding to Maxwell's electromagnetic equations. On this basis, we use the equivalence with viscoelasticity (SH waves) and propose a theory of gravitational waves. We add a damping term to the differential equations, which is equivalent to Ohm's law in electromagnetism and Maxwell's viscosity in viscoelasticity, to describe the attenuation of the waves.
  A plane-wave analysis gives the phase velocity, the energy velocity, the quality factor and the attenuation factor of the field as well as the energy balance. To obtain these properties, we use the analogy with viscoelasticity; the properties of electromagnetic and gravitational waves are similar to those of shear waves. The presence of attenuation means that the transient field is generally a composition of inhomogeneous (non-uniform) plane waves, where the propagation and attenuation vectors do not point in the same direction and the phase velocity vector and the energy flux (energy velocity) are not collinear. The polarization of cross-plane field is linear and perpendicular to the propagation-attenuation plane, while the polarization of the field within the plane is elliptical.
  Transient wave fields in the space-time domain are analyzed with the Green function (in homogeneous media) and with a grid method (in heterogeneous media) based on the Fourier method for calculating the spatial derivatives and a Runge-Kutta scheme of order 4 for the time stepping. In the examples, wave propagation at the Sun-Earth and Earth-Moon distances using quadrupole sources is considered in comparison to viscoelastic waves. Finally, an example of propagation in heterogeneous media is presented.</description>

      <title>WaveCastNet: An AI-enabled Wavefield Forecasting Framework for Earthquake Early Warning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large earthquakes can be destructive and quickly wreak havoc on a landscape. To mitigate immediate threats, early warning systems have been developed to alert residents, emergency responders, and critical infrastructure operators seconds to a minute before seismic waves arrive. These warnings provide time to take precautions and prevent damage. The success of these systems relies on fast, accurate predictions of ground motion intensities, which is challenging due to the complex physics of earthquakes, wave propagation, and their intricate spatial and temporal interactions. To improve early warning, we propose a novel AI-enabled framework, WaveCastNet, for forecasting ground motions from large earthquakes. WaveCastNet integrates a novel convolutional Long Expressive Memory (ConvLEM) model into a sequence to sequence (seq2seq) forecasting framework to model long-term dependencies and multi-scale patterns in both space and time. WaveCastNet, which shares weights across spatial and temporal dimensions, requires fewer parameters compared to more resource-intensive models like transformers and thus, in turn, reduces inference times. Importantly, WaveCastNet also generalizes better than transformer-based models to different seismic scenarios, including to more rare and critical situations with higher magnitude earthquakes. Our results using simulated data from the San Francisco Bay Area demonstrate the capability to rapidly predict the intensity and timing of destructive ground motions. Importantly, our proposed approach does not require estimating earthquake magnitudes and epicenters, which are prone to errors using conventional approaches; nor does it require empirical ground motion models, which fail to capture strongly heterogeneous wave propagation effects.</description>

      <title>Isotopic variation of non-carbonaceous meteorites caused by dust leakage across the Jovian gap in the solar nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision isotopic measurements of meteorites revealed that they are classified into non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) meteorites. One plausible scenario for achieving this grouping is the early formation of Jupiter because massive planets can create gaps that suppress the mixing of dust across the gap in protoplanetary disks. However, the efficiency of this suppression by the gaps depends on dust size and the strength of turbulent diffusion, allowing some fraction of the dust particles to leak across the Jovian gap. In this study, we investigate how isotopic ratios of NC and CC meteorites are varied by the dust leaking across the Jovian gap in the solar nebula. To do this, we constructed a model to simulate the evolution of the dust size distribution and the $^{54}$Cr-isotopic anomaly $\varepsilon^{54}$Cr in isotopically heterogeneous disks with Jupiter. Assuming that the parent bodies of NC and CC meteorites are formed in two dust-concentrated locations inside and outside Jupiter's orbit, referred to as the NC reservoir and CC reservoir, we derive the temporal variation of $\varepsilon^{54}$Cr at the NC and CC reservoir. Our results indicate that substantial contamination of CC materials occurs at the NC reservoir in the fiducial run. Nevertheless, the values of $\varepsilon^{54}$Cr at the NC reservoir and the CC reservoir in the run are still consistent with those of NC and CC meteorites formed around 2 Myrs after the formation of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions. Moreover, this dust leakage causes a positive correlation between the $\varepsilon^{54}$Cr value of NC meteorites and the accretion ages of their parent bodies.</description>
