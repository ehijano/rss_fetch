      <title>Graph neural networks for residential location choice: connection to classical logit models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers have adopted deep learning for classical discrete choice analysis as it can capture complex feature relationships and achieve higher predictive performance. However, the existing deep learning approaches cannot explicitly capture the relationship among choice alternatives, which has been a long-lasting focus in classical discrete choice models. To address the gap, this paper introduces Graph Neural Network (GNN) as a novel framework to analyze residential location choice. The GNN-based discrete choice models (GNN-DCMs) offer a structured approach for neural networks to capture dependence among spatial alternatives, while maintaining clear connections to classical random utility theory. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the GNN-DCMs incorporate the nested logit (NL) model and the spatially correlated logit (SCL) model as two specific cases, yielding novel algorithmic interpretation through message passing among alternatives' utilities. Empirically, the GNN-DCMs outperform benchmark MNL, SCL, and feedforward neural networks in predicting residential location choices among Chicago's 77 community areas. Regarding model interpretation, the GNN-DCMs can capture individual heterogeneity and exhibit spatially-aware substitution patterns. Overall, these results highlight the potential of GNN-DCMs as a unified and expressive framework for synergizing discrete choice modeling and deep learning in the complex spatial choice contexts.</description>

      <title>From Sublinear to Linear: Fast Convergence in Deep Networks via Locally Polyak-Lojasiewicz Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of gradient descent (GD) on the non-convex loss landscapes of deep neural networks (DNNs) presents a fundamental theoretical challenge. While recent work has established that GD converges to a stationary point at a sublinear rate within locally quasi-convex regions (LQCRs), this fails to explain the exponential convergence rates consistently observed in practice. In this paper, we resolve this discrepancy by proving that under a mild assumption on Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) stability, these same regions satisfy a local Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. We introduce the concept of a Locally Polyak-Lojasiewicz Region (LPLR), where the squared gradient norm lower-bounds the suboptimality gap, prove that properly initialized finite-width networks admit such regions around initialization, and establish that GD achieves linear convergence within an LPLR, providing the first finite-width guarantee that matches empirically observed rates. We validate our theory across diverse settings, from controlled experiments on fully-connected networks to modern ResNet architectures trained with stochastic methods, demonstrating that LPLR structure emerges robustly in practical deep learning scenarios. By rigorously connecting local landscape geometry to fast optimization through the NTK framework, our work provides a definitive theoretical explanation for the remarkable efficiency of gradient-based optimization in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Measuring Sample Quality with Copula Discrepancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that underpin modern Bayesian machine learning, such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), sacrifice asymptotic exactness for computational speed, creating a critical diagnostic gap: traditional sample quality measures fail catastrophically when applied to biased samplers. While powerful Stein-based diagnostics can detect distributional mismatches, they provide no direct assessment of dependence structure, often the primary inferential target in multivariate problems. We introduce the Copula Discrepancy (CD), a principled and computationally efficient diagnostic that leverages Sklar's theorem to isolate and quantify the fidelity of a sample's dependence structure independent of its marginals. Our theoretical framework provides the first structure-aware diagnostic specifically designed for the era of approximate inference. Empirically, we demonstrate that a moment-based CD dramatically outperforms standard diagnostics like effective sample size for hyperparameter selection in biased MCMC, correctly identifying optimal configurations where traditional methods fail. Furthermore, our robust MLE-based variant can detect subtle but critical mismatches in tail dependence that remain invisible to rank correlation-based approaches, distinguishing between samples with identical Kendall's tau but fundamentally different extreme-event behavior. With computational overhead orders of magnitude lower than existing Stein discrepancies, the CD provides both immediate practical value for MCMC practitioners and a theoretical foundation for the next generation of structure-aware sample quality assessment.</description>

      <title>From Global to Local: A Scalable Benchmark for Local Posterior Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Degeneracy is an inherent feature of the loss landscape of neural networks, but it is not well understood how stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC) algorithms interact with this degeneracy. In particular, current global convergence guarantees for common SGMCMC algorithms rely on assumptions which are likely incompatible with degenerate loss landscapes. In this paper, we argue that this gap requires a shift in focus from global to local posterior sampling, and, as a first step, we introduce a novel scalable benchmark for evaluating the local sampling performance of SGMCMC algorithms. We evaluate a number of common algorithms, and find that RMSProp-preconditioned SGLD is most effective at faithfully representing the local geometry of the posterior distribution. Although we lack theoretical guarantees about global sampler convergence, our empirical results show that we are able to extract non-trivial local information in models with up to O(100M) parameters.</description>

      <title>Stochastic forest transition model dynamics and parameter estimation via deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forest transitions, characterized by dynamic shifts between forest, agricultural, and abandoned lands, are complex phenomena. This study developed a stochastic differential equation model to capture the intricate dynamics of these transitions. We established the existence of global positive solutions for the model and conducted numerical analyses to assess the impact of model parameters on deforestation incentives. To address the challenge of parameter estimation, we proposed a novel deep learning approach that estimates all model parameters from a single sample containing time-series observations of forest and agricultural land proportions. This innovative approach enables us to understand forest transition dynamics and deforestation trends at any future time.</description>

      <title>An Equal-Probability Partition of the Sample Space: A Non-parametric Inference from Finite Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates what can be inferred about an arbitrary continuous probability distribution from a finite sample of $N$ observations drawn from it. The central finding is that the $N$ sorted sample points partition the real line into $N+1$ segments, each carrying an expected probability mass of exactly $1/(N+1)$. This non-parametric result, which follows from fundamental properties of order statistics, holds regardless of the underlying distribution's shape. This equal-probability partition yields a discrete entropy of $\log_2(N+1)$ bits, which quantifies the information gained from the sample and contrasts with Shannon's results for continuous variables. I compare this partition-based framework to the conventional ECDF and discuss its implications for robust non-parametric inference, particularly in density and tail estimation.</description>

      <title>MIBoost: A Gradient Boosting Algorithm for Variable Selection After Multiple Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical learning methods for automated variable selection, such as LASSO, elastic nets, or gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular tools for building powerful prediction models. Yet, in practice, analyses are often complicated by missing data. The most widely used approach to address missingness is multiple imputation, which creates several completed datasets. However, there is an ongoing debate on how to perform model selection in the presence of multiple imputed datasets. Simple strategies, such as pooling models across datasets, have been shown to have suboptimal properties. Although more sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to implement and therefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches modify the regularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single loss function, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations. Our key contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of component-wise gradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that employs a uniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets. Simulation studies suggest that our approach yields prediction performance comparable to that of these recently proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid rise of InsurTech, traditional insurance companies are increasingly exploring alternative data sources and advanced technologies to sustain their competitive edge. This paper provides both a conceptual overview and practical case studies of natural language processing (NLP) and its emerging applications within insurance operations with a focus on transforming raw, unstructured text into structured data suitable for actuarial analysis and decision-making. Leveraging real-world alternative data provided by an InsurTech industry partner that enriches traditional insurance data sources, we apply various NLP techniques to demonstrate practical use cases in the commercial insurance context. These enriched, text-derived insights not only add to and refine traditional rating factors for commercial insurance pricing but also offer novel perspectives for assessing underlying risk by introducing novel industry classifications. Through these demonstrations, we show that NLP is not merely a supplementary tool but a foundational element for modern, data-driven insurance analytics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry of Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML) encodes data as quantum geometry. In QCML, features of the data are represented by learned Hermitian matrices, and data points are mapped to states in Hilbert space. The quantum geometry description endows the dataset with rich geometric and topological structure - including intrinsic dimension, quantum metric, and Berry curvature - derived directly from the data. QCML captures global properties of data, while avoiding the curse of dimensionality inherent in local methods. We illustrate this on a number of synthetic and real-world examples. Quantum geometric representation of QCML could advance our understanding of cognitive phenomena within the framework of quantum cognition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised and supervised learning methods conventionally use kernels to capture nonlinearities inherent in data structure. However experts have to ensure their proposed nonlinearity maximizes variability and capture inherent diversity of data. We reviewed all independence criteria to design unsupervised learners. Then we proposed 3 independence criteria and used them to design unsupervised and supervised dimensionality reduction methods. We evaluated contrast, accuracy and interpretability of these methods in both linear and neural nonlinear settings. The results show that the methods have outperformed the baseline (tSNE, PCA, regularized LDA, VAE with (un)supervised learner and layer sharing) and opened a new line of interpretable machine learning (ML) for the researchers.</description>

      <title>SPADE-S: A Sparsity-Robust Foundational Forecaster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in time series forecasting, accurate modeling of time series with strong heterogeneity in magnitude and/or sparsity patterns remains challenging for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods.
  SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to 15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and 4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%, respectively, for each of three distinct datasets, ranging from 3 million to 700 million series, from a large online retailer.</description>

      <title>OCSVM-Guided Representation Learning for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to detect anomalies without labeled data, a necessity in many machine learning applications where anomalous samples are rare or not available. Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two categories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies too well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which can suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to couple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate objectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit their expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically solvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly aligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated on two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI subtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large, hyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small, non-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a more clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of robustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and scanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness of our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world medical imaging applications.

      <title>AdaptHetero: Machine Learning Interpretation-Driven Subgroup Adaptation for EHR-Based Clinical Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interpretation has primarily been leveraged to build clinician trust and uncover actionable insights in EHRs. However, the intrinsic complexity and heterogeneity of EHR data limit its effectiveness in guiding subgroup-specific modeling. We propose AdaptHetero, a novel MLI-driven framework that transforms interpretability insights into actionable guidance for tailoring model training and evaluation across subpopulations within individual hospital systems. Evaluated on three large-scale EHR datasets - GOSSIS-1-eICU, WiDS, and MIMIC-IV - AdaptHetero consistently identifies heterogeneous model behaviors in predicting ICU mortality, in-hospital death, and hidden hypoxemia. By integrating SHAP-based interpretation and unsupervised clustering, the framework enhances the identification of clinically meaningful subgroup-specific characteristics, leading to improved predictive performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any agents we can possibly build are subject to capacity constraints, as memory and compute resources are inherently finite. However, comparatively little attention has been dedicated to understanding how agents with limited capacity should allocate their resources for optimal performance. The goal of this paper is to shed some light on this question by studying a simple yet relevant continual learning problem: the capacity-constrained linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) sequential prediction problem. We derive a solution to this problem under appropriate technical conditions. Moreover, for problems that can be decomposed into a set of sub-problems, we also demonstrate how to optimally allocate capacity across these sub-problems in the steady state. We view the results of this paper as a first step in the systematic theoretical study of learning under capacity constraints.</description>

      <title>Domain Generalization and Adaptation in Intensive Care with Anchor Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of predictive models in clinical settings often degrades when deployed in new hospitals due to distribution shifts. This paper presents a large-scale study of causality-inspired domain generalization on heterogeneous multi-center intensive care unit (ICU) data. We apply anchor regression and introduce anchor boosting, a novel, tree-based nonlinear extension, to a large dataset comprising 400,000 patients from nine distinct ICU databases. The anchor regularization consistently improves out-of-distribution performance, particularly for the most dissimilar target domains. The methods appear robust to violations of theoretical assumptions, such as anchor exogeneity. Furthermore, we propose a novel conceptual framework to quantify the utility of large external data datasets. By evaluating performance as a function of available target-domain data, we identify three regimes: (i) a domain generalization regime, where only the external model should be used, (ii) a domain adaptation regime, where refitting the external model is optimal, and (iii) a data-rich regime, where external data provides no additional value.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Discrete-HAMS: A Second-order Irreversible Discrete Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods have recently received much attention for sampling discrete distributions, with notable examples such as Norm Constrained Gradient (NCG), Auxiliary Variable Gradient (AVG), and Discrete Hamiltonian Assisted Metropolis Sampling (DHAMS). In this work, we propose the Preconditioned Discrete-HAMS (PDHAMS) algorithm, which extends DHAMS by incorporating a second-order, quadratic approximation of the potential function, and uses Gaussian integral trick to avoid directly sampling a pairwise Markov random field. The PDHAMS sampler not only satisfies generalized detailed balance, hence enabling irreversible sampling, but also is a rejection-free property for a target distribution with a quadratic potential function. In various numerical experiments, PDHAMS algorithms consistently yield superior performance compared with other methods.</description>

      <title>Horseshoe Forests for High-Dimensional Causal Survival Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22004v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Bayesian tree ensemble model to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in censored survival data with high-dimensional covariates. Instead of imposing sparsity through the tree structure, we place a horseshoe prior directly on the step heights to achieve adaptive global-local shrinkage. This strategy allows flexible regularisation and reduces noise. We develop a reversible jump Gibbs sampler to accommodate the non-conjugate horseshoe prior within the tree ensemble framework. We show through extensive simulations that the method accurately estimates treatment effects in high-dimensional covariate spaces, at various sparsity levels, and under non-linear treatment effect functions. We further illustrate the practical utility of the proposed approach by a re-analysis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) survival data from The Cancer Genome Atlas.</description>

      <title>Active learning for level set estimation under input uncertainty and its extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:1909.06064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Testing under what conditions the product satisfies the desired properties is a fundamental problem in manufacturing industry. If the condition and the property are respectively regarded as the input and the output of a black-box function, this task can be interpreted as the problem called Level Set Estimation (LSE) -- the problem of identifying input regions such that the function value is above (or below) a threshold. Although various methods for LSE problems have been developed so far, there are still many issues to be solved for their practical usage. As one of such issues, we consider the case where the input conditions cannot be controlled precisely, i.e., LSE problems under input uncertainty. We introduce a basic framework for handling input uncertainty in LSE problem, and then propose efficient methods with proper theoretical guarantees. The proposed methods and theories can be generally applied to a variety of challenges related to LSE under input uncertainty such as cost-dependent input uncertainties and unknown input uncertainties. We apply the proposed methods to artificial and real data to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Sparse Online Learning of the Koopman Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for representing the dynamics of general nonlinear dynamical systems. However, existing data-driven approaches to learning the Koopman operator rely on batch data. In this work, we present a sparse online learning algorithm that learns the Koopman operator iteratively via stochastic approximation, with explicit control over model complexity and provable convergence guarantees. Specifically, we study the Koopman operator via its action on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and address the mis-specified scenario where the dynamics may escape the chosen RKHS. In this mis-specified setting, we relate the Koopman operator to the conditional mean embeddings (CME) operator. We further establish both asymptotic and finite-time convergence guarantees for our learning algorithm in mis-specified setting, with trajectory-based sampling where the data arrive sequentially over time. Numerical experiments demonstrate the algorithm's capability to learn unknown nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>BEACON: A Bayesian Optimization Strategy for Novelty Search in Expensive Black-Box Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03616v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novelty search (NS) refers to a class of exploration algorithms that seek to uncover diverse system behaviors through simulations or experiments. Such diversity is central to many AI-driven discovery and design tasks, including material and drug development, neural architecture search, and reinforcement learning. However, existing NS methods typically rely on evolutionary strategies and other meta-heuristics that require dense sampling of the input space, making them impractical for expensive black-box systems. In this work, we introduce BEACON, a sample-efficient, Bayesian optimization-inspired approach to NS that is tailored for settings where the input-to-behavior relationship is opaque and costly to evaluate. BEACON models this mapping using multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) and selects new inputs by maximizing a novelty metric computed from posterior samples of the MOGP, effectively balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. By leveraging recent advances in posterior sampling and high-dimensional GP modeling, our method remains scalable to large input spaces and datasets. We evaluate BEACON across ten synthetic benchmarks and eight real-world tasks, including the design of diverse materials for clean energy applications. Our results show that BEACON significantly outperforms existing NS baselines, consistently discovering a broader set of behaviors under tight evaluation budgets.</description>

      <title>Robust Matrix Completion for Discrete Rating-Scale Data: Coping with Fake Profiles in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems are essential tools in the digital landscape for connecting users with content that more closely aligns with their preferences. Matrix completion is a widely used statistical framework for such systems, aiming to predict a user's preferences for items they have not yet rated by leveraging the observed ratings in a partially filled user-item rating matrix. Realistic applications of matrix completion in recommender systems must address several challenges that are too often neglected: (i) the discrete nature of rating-scale data, (ii) the presence of malicious users who manipulate the system to their advantage through the creation of fake profiles, and (iii) missing-not-at-random patterns, where users are more likely to rate items they expect to enjoy. Our goal in this paper is twofold. First, we propose a novel matrix completion method, robust discrete matrix completion (RDMC), designed specifically to handle the discrete nature of sparse rating-scale data and to remain reliable in the presence of adversarial manipulation. We evaluate RDMC through carefully designed experiments and realistic case studies. Our work therefore, secondly, offers a statistically-sound blueprint for future studies on how to evaluate matrix completion methods for recommender systems under realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Review on Self-Supervised Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection: Recent Advances and Open Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection presents various challenges due to the sequential and dynamic nature of time-dependent data. Traditional unsupervised methods frequently encounter difficulties in generalization, often overfitting to known normal patterns observed during training and struggling to adapt to unseen normality. In response to this limitation, self-supervised techniques for time series have garnered attention as a potential solution to undertake this obstacle and enhance the performance of anomaly detectors. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the recent methods that make use of self-supervised learning for time series anomaly detection. A taxonomy is proposed to categorize these methods based on their primary characteristics, facilitating a clear understanding of their diversity within this field. The information contained in this survey, along with additional details that will be periodically updated, is available on the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/Aitorzan3/Awesome-Self-Supervised-Time-Series-Anomaly-Detection.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Treatment Effect in Time-to-Event Outcomes: Harnessing Censored Data with Recursively Imputed Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tailoring treatments to individual needs is a central goal in fields such as medicine. A key step toward this goal is estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) - the way treatments impact different subgroups. While crucial, HTE estimation is challenging with survival data, where time until an event (e.g., death) is key. Existing methods often assume complete observation, an assumption violated in survival data due to right-censoring, leading to bias and inefficiency. Cui et al. (2023) proposed a doubly-robust method for HTE estimation in survival data under no hidden confounders, combining a causal survival forest with an augmented inverse-censoring weighting estimator. However, we find it struggles under heavy censoring, which is common in rare-outcome problems such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, most current methods cannot handle instrumental variables, which are a crucial tool in the causal inference arsenal. We introduce Multiple Imputation for Survival Treatment Response (MISTR), a novel, general, and non-parametric method for estimating HTE in survival data. MISTR uses recursively imputed survival trees to handle censoring without directly modeling the censoring mechanism. Through extensive simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets-the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 175 and the Illinois unemployment dataset we show that MISTR outperforms prior methods under heavy censoring in the no-hidden-confounders setting, and extends to the instrumental variable setting. To our knowledge, MISTR is the first non-parametric approach for HTE estimation with unobserved confounders via instrumental variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the problem of sampling from distributions whose densities are not necessarily smooth nor logconcave. We propose a simple Langevin-based algorithm that does not rely on popular but computationally challenging techniques, such as the Moreau-Yosida envelope or Gaussian smoothing, and show consequently that the performance of samplers like ULA does not necessarily degenerate arbitrarily with low regularity. In particular, we show that the Lipschitz or H\"older continuity assumption can be replaced by a geometric one-sided Lipschitz condition that allows even for discontinuous log-gradients. We derive non-asymptotic guarantees for the convergence of the algorithm to the target distribution in Wasserstein distances. Non-asymptotic bounds are also provided for the performance of the algorithm as an optimizer, specifically for the solution of associated excess risk optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Extracting Interpretable Models from Tree Ensembles: Computational and Statistical Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree ensembles are non-parametric methods widely recognized for their accuracy and ability to capture complex interactions. While these models excel at prediction, they are difficult to interpret and may fail to uncover useful relationships in the data. We propose an estimator to extract compact sets of decision rules from tree ensembles. The extracted models are accurate and can be manually examined to reveal relationships between the predictors and the response. A key novelty of our estimator is the flexibility to jointly control the number of rules extracted and the interaction depth of each rule, which improves accuracy. We develop a tailored exact algorithm to efficiently solve optimization problems underlying our estimator and an approximate algorithm for computing regularization paths, sequences of solutions that correspond to varying model sizes. We also establish novel non-asymptotic prediction error bounds for our proposed approach, comparing it to an oracle that chooses the best data-dependent linear combination of the rules in the ensemble subject to the same complexity constraint as our estimator. The bounds illustrate that the large-sample predictive performance of our estimator is on par with that of the oracle. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our estimator outperforms existing algorithms for rule extraction.</description>

      <title>Sampling from high-dimensional, multimodal distributions using automatically tuned, tempered Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is widely used for sampling from high dimensional target distributions with densities known up to proportionality. While HMC exhibits favorable scaling properties in high dimensions, it struggles with strongly multimodal distributions. Tempering methods are commonly used to address multimodality, but they can be difficult to tune, especially in high dimensional settings. In this study, we propose a method that combines tempering with HMC to enable efficient sampling from high dimensional, strongly multimodal distributions. Our approach simulates the dynamics of a time-varying Hamiltonian in which the temperature increases and then decreases over time. In the first phase, the simulated trajectory gradually explores low-density regions farther from the mode; the second phase guides it back toward a local mode. We develop efficient tuning strategies based on a time-scale transformation under which the Hamiltonian becomes approximately stationary. This leads to a tempered Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (THMC) algorithm with automatic tuning. We demonstrate numerically that our method scales more effectively with dimension than adaptive parallel tempering and tempered sequential Monte Carlo. Finally, we apply our THMC to sample from strongly multimodal posterior distributions arising in Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical mixtures of Gaussians for combined dimensionality reduction and clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce hierarchical mixtures of Gaussians (HMoGs), which unify dimensionality reduction and clustering into a single probabilistic model. HMoGs provide closed-form expressions for the model likelihood, exact inference over latent states and cluster membership, and exact algorithms for maximum-likelihood optimization. The novel exponential family parameterization of HMoGs greatly reduces their computational complexity relative to similar model-based methods, allowing them to efficiently model hundreds of latent dimensions, and thereby capture additional structure in high-dimensional data. We demonstrate HMoGs on synthetic experiments and MNIST, and show how joint optimization of dimensionality reduction and clustering facilitates increased model performance. We also explore how sparsity-constrained dimensionality reduction can further improve clustering performance while encouraging interpretability. By bridging classical statistical modelling with the scale of modern data and compute, HMoGs offer a practical approach to high-dimensional clustering that preserves statistical rigour, interpretability, and uncertainty quantification that is often missing from embedding-based, variational, and self-supervised methods.</description>

      <title>Quantize Once, Train Fast: Allreduce-Compatible Compression with Provable Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed training enables large-scale deep learning, but suffers from high communication overhead, especially as models and datasets grow. Gradient compression, particularly quantization, is a promising approach to mitigate this bottleneck. However, existing quantization schemes are often incompatible with Allreduce, the dominant communication primitive in distributed deep learning, and many prior solutions rely on heuristics without theoretical guarantees. We introduce Global-QSGD, an Allreduce-compatible gradient quantization method that leverages global norm scaling to reduce communication overhead while preserving accuracy. Global-QSGD is backed by rigorous theoretical analysis, extending standard unbiased compressor frameworks to establish formal convergence guarantees. Additionally, we develop a performance model to evaluate its impact across different hardware configurations. Extensive experiments on NVLink, PCIe, and large-scale cloud environments show that Global-QSGD accelerates distributed training by up to 3.51% over baseline quantization methods, making it a practical and efficient solution for large-scale deep learning workloads.</description>

      <title>Randomized Kaczmarz Methods with Beyond-Krylov Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized Kaczmarz methods form a family of linear system solvers which converge by repeatedly projecting their iterates onto randomly sampled equations. While effective in some contexts, such as highly over-determined least squares, Kaczmarz methods are traditionally deemed secondary to Krylov subspace methods, since this latter family of solvers can exploit outliers in the input's singular value distribution to attain fast convergence on ill-conditioned systems.
  In this paper, we introduce Kaczmarz++, an accelerated randomized block Kaczmarz algorithm that exploits outlying singular values in the input to attain a fast Krylov-style convergence. Moreover, we show that Kaczmarz++ captures large outlying singular values provably faster than popular Krylov methods, for both over- and under-determined systems. We also develop an optimized variant for positive semidefinite systems, called CD++, demonstrating empirically that it is competitive in arithmetic operations with both CG and GMRES on a collection of benchmark problems. To attain these results, we introduce several novel algorithmic improvements to the Kaczmarz framework, including adaptive momentum acceleration, Tikhonov-regularized projections, and a memoization scheme for reusing information from previously sampled equation blocks.</description>

      <title>A calibration test for evaluating set-based epistemic uncertainty representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate representation of epistemic uncertainty is a challenging yet essential task in machine learning. A widely used representation corresponds to convex sets of probabilistic predictors, also known as credal sets. One popular way of constructing these credal sets is via ensembling or specialized supervised learning methods, where the epistemic uncertainty can be quantified through measures such as the set size or the disagreement among members. In principle, these sets should contain the true data-generating distribution. As a necessary condition for this validity, we adopt the strongest notion of calibration as a proxy. Concretely, we propose a novel statistical test to determine whether there is a convex combination of the set's predictions that is calibrated in distribution. In contrast to previous methods, our framework allows the convex combination to be instance dependent, recognizing that different ensemble members may be better calibrated in different regions of the input space. Moreover, we learn this combination via proper scoring rules, which inherently optimize for calibration. Building on differentiable, kernel-based estimators of calibration errors, we introduce a nonparametric testing procedure and demonstrate the benefits of capturing instance-level variability on of synthetic and real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Mining Intrinsic Rewards from LLM Hidden States for Efficient Best-of-N Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancing Large Language Model (LLM)'s performance with best-of-N sampling is effective and has attracted significant attention. However, it is computationally prohibitive due to massive, data-hungry text-based reward models. By changing the data source from text to hidden states, we introduce SWIFT (Simple Weighted Intrinsic Feedback Technique), a novel, lightweight technique that leverages the rich information embedded in LLM hidden states to address these issues, which operates on token-level and consists of only linear layers. Extensive experiments show that SWIFT outperforms baselines with less than 0.005% of the parameters of baselines, requiring only a few samples for training, demonstrating significant efficiency improvement. SWIFT's robust scalability, applicability to some closed-source models via logits, and ability to be combined with traditional reward models to yield further performance gains underscore its practical value.</description>

      <title>Opening the Black Box of Local Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local projections (LPs) are widely used in empirical macroeconomics to estimate impulse responses to policy interventions. Yet, in many ways, they are black boxes. It is often unclear what mechanism or historical episodes drive a particular estimate. We introduce a new decomposition of LP estimates into the sum of contributions of historical events, which is the product, for each time stamp, of a weight and the realization of the response variable. In the least squares case, we show that these weights admit two interpretations. First, they represent purified and standardized shocks. Second, they serve as proximity scores between the projected policy intervention and past interventions in the sample. Notably, this second interpretation extends naturally to machine learning methods, many of which yield impulse responses that, while nonlinear in predictors, still aggregate past outcomes linearly via proximity-based weights. Applying this framework to shocks in monetary and fiscal policy, global temperature, and the excess bond premium, we find that easily identifiable events-such as Nixon's interference with the Fed, stagflation, World War II, and the Mount Agung volcanic eruption-emerge as dominant drivers of often heavily concentrated impulse response estimates.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Large Portfolio Optimization for Variance Minimization with Neural Networks through Covariance Cleaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a rotation-invariant neural network that provides the global minimum-variance portfolio by jointly learning how to lag-transform historical returns and how to regularise both the eigenvalues and the marginal volatilities of large equity covariance matrices. This explicit mathematical mapping offers clear interpretability of each module's role, so the model cannot be regarded as a pure black-box. The architecture mirrors the analytical form of the global minimum-variance solution yet remains agnostic to dimension, so a single model can be calibrated on panels of a few hundred stocks and applied, without retraining, to one thousand US equities-a cross-sectional jump that demonstrates robust out-of-sample generalisation. The loss function is the future realized minimum portfolio variance and is optimized end-to-end on real daily returns. In out-of-sample tests from January 2000 to December 2024 the estimator delivers systematically lower realised volatility, smaller maximum drawdowns, and higher Sharpe ratios than the best analytical competitors, including state-of-the-art non-linear shrinkage. Furthermore, although the model is trained end-to-end to produce an unconstrained (long-short) minimum-variance portfolio, we show that its learned covariance representation can be used in general optimizers under long-only constraints with virtually no loss in its performance advantage over competing estimators. These gains persist when the strategy is executed under a highly realistic implementation framework that models market orders at the auctions, empirical slippage, exchange fees, and financing charges for leverage, and they remain stable during episodes of acute market stress.</description>

      <title>A DPI-PAC-Bayesian Framework for Generalization Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified Data Processing Inequality PAC-Bayesian framework -- abbreviated DPI-PAC-Bayesian -- for deriving generalization error bounds in the supervised learning setting. By embedding the Data Processing Inequality (DPI) into the change-of-measure technique, we obtain explicit bounds on the binary Kullback-Leibler generalization gap for both R\'enyi divergence and any $f$-divergence measured between a data-independent prior distribution and an algorithm-dependent posterior distribution. We present three bounds derived under our framework using R\'enyi, Hellinger \(p\) and Chi-Squared divergences. Additionally, our framework also demonstrates a close connection with other well-known bounds. When the prior distribution is chosen to be uniform, our bounds recover the classical Occam's Razor bound and, crucially, eliminate the extraneous \(\log(2\sqrt{n})/n\) slack present in the PAC-Bayes bound, thereby achieving tighter results. The framework thus bridges data-processing and PAC-Bayesian perspectives, providing a flexible, information-theoretic tool to construct generalization guarantees.</description>
