      <title>The Verifications of No Bright and Dark Fringes In a Standing-wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After Wiener's experiment, it had been widely accepted that only electric-field was the fundamental-factor for optical interference and believed that there were alternating bright and dark fringes in a light standing-wave field which was formed by a pair of parallel light-beams traveling in mutually opposite directions. While being supplied to the bright fringes, the light-energy from the beams must pass across the dark fringes or across the electric-field nodes, so that the electric-field would not keep zero at the nodes. However, it was inconsistent with the characteristic of electric-field nodes at which the electric-field was zero anytime. Therefore, this naturally led to a presumption that there were no bright and dark interference-fringes in a standing-wave field, which was consistent with zero of the electromagnetic energy-flux-density in a standing-wave field. In this paper, it was fully verified from several aspects, including an ideal experiment, comparing a standing-wave with an LC circuit, a group of experiments and theoretical deductions of formulas. An inclination factor was introduced into the previous common formula of two-beams-interference to rectify it back to the original meaning of its initial definition by energy-flux-density rather than electric-field energy-density. Given the angle between the two-beams to be 180 degrees as a validation, it was verified by the corrected formula that the light-intensities of the bright interference-fringes in a standing-wave were equal to zero. i.e., no interference-fringes existed in a standing-wave field.Thus, instead of electric-field energy-density alone from Wiener's conclusions, interference-energy-flux density was the fundamental-factor to form interference-fringes. The magnetic-field vector acts the same role as the electric-field vector on light interacting with substance.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian thermodynamics on symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a symplectic approach to thermodynamics in which thermodynamic transformations are described by Hamiltonian dynamics on thermodynamic spaces. By identifying the spaces of equilibrium states with Lagrangian submanifolds of a symplectic manifold, we construct a Hamiltonian description of thermodynamic processes where the space of equilibrium states of a system in a certain ensemble is the level set on which the Hamiltonian takes a constant value. In particular, we work out two explicit examples involving the ideal gas. Finally, we describe a Hamiltonian approach towards constructing maps between related thermodynamic systems, e.g., the ideal (non-interacting) gas and interacting gases.</description>

      <title>Radiation reaction on an accelerating point charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A point charge accelerating under the influence of an external force emits electromagnetic radiation that reduces the increase in its mechanical energy. This causes a reduction in the particle's acceleration. We derive the decrease in acceleration due to radiation reaction for a particle accelerating parallel to its velocity, and show that it has a negligible effect.</description>

      <title>Polarization-dependent resonant phenomena in all-dielectric scatterers: inversion of magnetic inductance and electric displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theoretical description and experimental verification of resonant phenomena in electromagnetic fields generated in the near zone of all-dielectric rectangular thin sub wavelength frames, subjected to an incident microwave, is considered. The geometry of considered problems is presented by means of arrangements of these frames in three orthogonal planes, normal respectively to electric component, magnetic component and wave vector of the incident wave. Such trio paves the way to design of 3D all-dielectric multiresonant microwave unit cell. Displacement currents, generated by linearly polarized electromagnetic waves in the system, lead to the formation of magnetic and electric dipoles, each of which possess own resonant frequency. Resonant inversion of magnetic inductance and electric displacement is observed. The sliding incidence of plane wave on the frame is shown to provide the sharp and deep resonance in the components of generated field. The phase shift equal to $\pi$ between the magnetic components of incident and generated wave indicates the formation of negative magnetic response. There observes the angular anisotropy of arising dipoles, manifested in values of resonance frequencies and in the dependence of depths of resonant spectral dips upon the orientation of dipoles, with respect to the direction of propagation of incident wave.</description>
