      <title>Quantifying Influencer Effects on Affective Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era where digital platforms increasingly mediate public discourse, grasping the complexities and nuances in affective polarization--especially as influenced by key figures on social media--has never been more vital. This study delves into the intricate web of interactions on Twitter, now rebranded as 'X', to unravel how influencer-led conversations catalyze shifts in public sentiment, laying bare the complex dynamics that underpin online polarization. Employing a novel methodological framework that includes counterfactual analysis, we analyze scenarios with and without specific influencer-led conversations. Our findings illuminate the significant role influencers play in shaping public discourse, offering insights into the mechanisms of online polarization and suggesting pathways for future research to mitigate divisiveness and explore new methods for quantifying affective polarization. This research contributes to the broader understanding of digital communication's impact on societal polarization, underscoring the importance of detailed analysis in developing strategies to foster a more cohesive digital public sphere.</description>

      <title>ArguSense: Argument-Centric Analysis of Online Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we model arguments and their dynamics in online forum discussions? The meteoric rise of online forums presents researchers across different disciplines with an unprecedented opportunity: we have access to texts containing discourse between groups of users generated in a voluntary and organic fashion. Most prior work so far has focused on classifying individual monological comments as either argumentative or not argumentative. However, few efforts quantify and describe the dialogical processes between users found in online forum discourse: the structure and content of interpersonal argumentation. Modeling dialogical discourse requires the ability to identify the presence of arguments, group them into clusters, and summarize the content and nature of clusters of arguments within a discussion thread in the forum. In this work, we develop ArguSense, a comprehensive and systematic framework for understanding arguments and debate in online forums. Our framework consists of methods for, among other things: (a) detecting argument topics in an unsupervised manner; (b) describing the structure of arguments within threads with powerful visualizations; and (c) quantifying the content and diversity of threads using argument similarity and clustering algorithms. We showcase our approach by analyzing the discussions of four communities on the Reddit platform over a span of 21 months. Specifically, we analyze the structure and content of threads related to GMOs in forums related to agriculture or farming to demonstrate the value of our framework.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Transformer Hawkes Processes: Unveiling Complex Interactions in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social networks represent complex ecosystems where the interactions between users or groups play a pivotal role in information dissemination, opinion formation, and social interactions. Effectively harnessing event sequence data within social networks to unearth interactions among users or groups has persistently posed a challenging frontier within the realm of point processes. Current deep point process models face inherent limitations within the context of social networks, constraining both their interpretability and expressive power. These models encounter challenges in capturing interactions among users or groups and often rely on parameterized extrapolation methods when modelling intensity over non-event intervals, limiting their capacity to capture intricate intensity patterns, particularly beyond observed events. To address these challenges, this study proposes modifications to Transformer Hawkes processes (THP), leading to the development of interpretable Transformer Hawkes processes (ITHP). ITHP inherits the strengths of THP while aligning with statistical nonlinear Hawkes processes, thereby enhancing its interpretability and providing valuable insights into interactions between users or groups. Additionally, ITHP enhances the flexibility of the intensity function over non-event intervals, making it better suited to capture complex event propagation patterns in social networks. Experimental results, both on synthetic and real data, demonstrate the effectiveness of ITHP in overcoming the identified limitations. Moreover, they highlight ITHP's applicability in the context of exploring the complex impact of users or groups within social networks.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Multipolar Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying and understanding social networks is crucial for accurately defining ideological polarization, since they enable precise modeling of social structures. One of the limitations of many methods for quantifying polarization on networks is the assumption of a two-dimensional opinion space. This prevents accurate study of multipolar systems like multi-party political systems, where modeling more than two opinion poles is beneficial. Here, I experimentally compare methods for quantifying multipolar polarization on a network, and find that the average pairwise distance extension of generalized Euclidean distance conforms to several desired properties, showing its advantages over other methods. This allows study of multipolar polarized systems based on an empirically and intuitively good metric.</description>

      <title>Link Prediction on Textual Edge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Textual-edge Graphs (TEGs), characterized by rich text annotations on edges, are increasingly significant in network science due to their ability to capture rich contextual information among entities. Existing works have proposed various edge-aware graph neural networks (GNNs) or let language models directly make predictions. However, they often fall short of fully capturing the contextualized semantics on edges and graph topology, respectively. This inadequacy is particularly evident in link prediction tasks that require a comprehensive understanding of graph topology and semantics between nodes. In this paper, we present a novel framework - Link2Doc, designed especially for link prediction on textual-edge graphs. Specifically, we propose to summarize neighborhood information between node pairs as a human-written document to preserve both semantic and topology information. A self-supervised learning model is then utilized to enhance GNN's text-understanding ability from language models. Empirical evaluations, including link prediction, edge classification, parameter analysis, runtime comparison, and ablation studies, on four real-world datasets demonstrate that Link2Doc achieves generally better performance against existing edge-aware GNNs and pre-trained language models in predicting links on TEGs.</description>

      <title>Balancing User Preferences by Social Networks: A Condition-Guided Social Recommendation Model for Mitigating Popularity Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social recommendation models weave social interactions into their design to provide uniquely personalized recommendation results for users. However, social networks not only amplify the popularity bias in recommendation models, resulting in more frequent recommendation of hot items and fewer long-tail items, but also include a substantial amount of redundant information that is essentially meaningless for the model's performance. Existing social recommendation models fail to address the issues of popularity bias and the redundancy of social information, as they directly characterize social influence across the entire social network without making targeted adjustments. In this paper, we propose a Condition-Guided Social Recommendation Model (named CGSoRec) to mitigate the model's popularity bias by denoising the social network and adjusting the weights of user's social preferences. More specifically, CGSoRec first includes a Condition-Guided Social Denoising Model (CSD) to remove redundant social relations in the social network for capturing users' social preferences with items more precisely. Then, CGSoRec calculates users' social preferences based on denoised social network and adjusts the weights in users' social preferences to make them can counteract the popularity bias present in the recommendation model. At last, CGSoRec includes a Condition-Guided Diffusion Recommendation Model (CGD) to introduce the adjusted social preferences as conditions to control the recommendation results for a debiased direction. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is in: https://github.com/hexin5515/CGSoRec.</description>

      <title>TopoLa: a novel embedding framework for understanding complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex networks, which are the abstractions of many real-world systems, present a persistent challenge across disciplines for people to decipher their underlying information. Recently, hyperbolic geometry of latent spaces has gained traction in network analysis, due to its ability to preserve certain local intrinsic properties of the nodes. In this study, we explore the problem from a much broader perspective: understanding the impact of nodes' global topological structures on latent space placements. Our investigations reveal a direct correlation between the topological structure of nodes and their positioning within the latent space. Building on this deep and strong connection between node distance and network topology, we propose a novel embedding framework called Topology-encoded Latent Hyperbolic Geometry (TopoLa) for analyzing complex networks. With the encoded topological information in the latent space, TopoLa is capable of enhancing both conventional and low-rank networks, using the singular value gap to clarify the mathematical principles behind this enhancement. Meanwhile, we show that the equipped TopoLa distance can also help augment pivotal deep learning models encompassing knowledge distillation and contrastive learning.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Performance of Continuous-Time Dynamic Link Prediction Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Link Prediction (DLP) addresses the prediction of future links in evolving networks. However, accurately portraying the performance of DLP algorithms poses challenges that might impede progress in the field. Importantly, common evaluation pipelines usually calculate ranking or binary classification metrics, where the scores of observed interactions (positives) are compared with those of randomly generated ones (negatives). However, a single metric is not sufficient to fully capture the differences between DLP algorithms, and is prone to overly optimistic performance evaluation. Instead, an in-depth evaluation should reflect performance variations across different nodes, edges, and time segments. In this work, we contribute tools to perform such a comprehensive evaluation. (1) We propose Birth-Death diagrams, a simple but powerful visualization technique that illustrates the effect of time-based train-test splitting on the difficulty of DLP on a given dataset. (2) We describe an exhaustive taxonomy of negative sampling methods that can be used at evaluation time. (3) We carry out an empirical study of the effect of the different negative sampling strategies. Our comparison between heuristics and state-of-the-art memory-based methods on various real-world datasets confirms a strong effect of using different negative sampling strategies on the test Area Under the Curve (AUC). Moreover, we conduct a visual exploration of the prediction, with additional insights on which different types of errors are prominent over time.</description>

      <title>R-ODE: Ricci Curvature Tells When You Will be Informed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information diffusion prediction is fundamental to understand the structure and organization of the online social networks, and plays a crucial role to blocking rumor spread, influence maximization, political propaganda, etc. So far, most existing solutions primarily predict the next user who will be informed with historical cascades, but ignore an important factor in the diffusion process - the time. Such limitation motivates us to pose the problem of the time-aware personalized information diffusion prediction for the first time, telling the time when the target user will be informed. In this paper, we address this problem from a fresh geometric perspective of Ricci curvature, and propose a novel Ricci-curvature regulated Ordinary Differential Equation (R-ODE). In the diffusion process, R-ODE considers that the inter-correlated users are organized in a dynamic system in the representation space, and the cascades give the observations sampled from the continuous realm. At each infection time, the message diffuses along the largest Ricci curvature, signifying less transportation effort. In the continuous realm, the message triggers users' movement, whose trajectory in the space is parameterized by an ODE with graph neural network. Consequently, R-ODE predicts the infection time of a target user by the movement trajectory learnt from the observations. Extensive experiments evaluate the personalized time prediction ability of R-ODE, and show R-ODE outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>The Peripatetic Hater: Predicting Movement Among Hate Subreddits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many online hate groups exist to disparage others based on race, gender identity, sex, or other characteristics. The accessibility of these communities allows users to join multiple types of hate groups (e.g., a racist community and misogynistic community), which calls into question whether these peripatetic users could be further radicalized compared to users that stay in one type of hate group. However, little is known about the dynamics of joining multiple types of hate groups, nor the effect of these groups on peripatetic users. In this paper, we develop a new method to classify hate subreddits, and the identities they disparage, which we use to better understand how users become peripatetic (join different types of hate subreddits). The hate classification technique utilizes human-validated LLMs to extract the protected identities attacked, if any, across 168 subreddits. We then cluster identity-attacking subreddits to discover three broad categories of hate: racist, anti-LGBTQ, and misogynistic. We show that becoming active in a user's first hate subreddit can cause them to become active in additional hate subreddits of a different category. We also find that users who join additional hate subreddits, especially of a different category, become more active in hate subreddits as a whole and develop a wider hate group lexicon. We are therefore motivated to train an AI model that we find usefully predicts the hate categories users will become active in based on post text read and written. The accuracy of this model may be partly driven by peripatetic users often using the language of hate subreddits they eventually join. Overall, these results highlight the unique risks associated with hate communities on a social media platform, as discussion of alternative targets of hate may lead users to target more protected identities.</description>

      <title>A modular and scalable web platform for computational phylogenetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic analysis, which allow to understand the evolution of bacterial and viral epidemics, requires large quantities of data to be analysed and processed for knowledge extraction. One of the major challenges consists on the integration of the results from typing and phylogenetic inference methods with epidemiological data, namely in what concerns their integrated and simultaneous analysis and visualization. Numerous approaches to support phylogenetic analysis have been proposed, varying from standalone tools to integrative web applications that include tools and/or algorithms for executing the common analysis tasks for this kind of data. However, most of them lack the capacity to integrate epidemiological data. Others provide the ability for visualizing and analyzing such data, allowing the integration of epidemiological data but they do not scale for large data analysis and visualization. Namely, most of them run inference and/or visualization optimization tasks on the client side, which becomes often unfeasible for large amounts of data, usually implying transferring data from existing databases in order to be analysed. Moreover, the results and optimizations are not stored for reuse. We propose the PHYLOViZ Web Platform, a cloud based tool for phylogenetic analysis, that not only unifies the features of both existing versions of PHYLOViZ, but also supports structured and customized workflows for executing data processing and analyses tasks, and promotes the reproducibility of previous phylogenetic analyses. This platform supports large scale analyses by relying on a workflow system that enables the distribution of parallel computations on cloud and HPC environments. Moreover, it has a modular architecture, allowing easy integration of new methods and tools, as well as customized workflows, making it flexible and extensible.</description>

      <title>DPHGNN: A Dual Perspective Hypergraph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Message passing on hypergraphs has been a standard framework for learning higher-order correlations between hypernodes. Recently-proposed hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) can be categorized into spatial and spectral methods based on their design choices. In this work, we analyze the impact of change in hypergraph topology on the suboptimal performance of HGNNs and propose DPHGNN, a novel dual-perspective HGNN that introduces equivariant operator learning to capture lower-order semantics by inducing topology-aware spatial and spectral inductive biases. DPHGNN employs a unified framework to dynamically fuse lower-order explicit feature representations from the underlying graph into the super-imposed hypergraph structure. We benchmark DPHGNN over eight benchmark hypergraph datasets for the semi-supervised hypernode classification task and obtain superior performance compared to seven state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide a theoretical framework and a synthetic hypergraph isomorphism test to express the power of spatial HGNNs and quantify the expressivity of DPHGNN beyond the Generalized Weisfeiler Leman (1-GWL) test. Finally, DPHGNN was deployed by our partner e-commerce company for the Return-to-Origin (RTO) prediction task, which shows ~7% higher macro F1-Score than the best baseline.</description>

      <title>Let Silence Speak: Enhancing Fake News Detection with Generated Comments from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fake news detection plays a crucial role in protecting social media users and maintaining a healthy news ecosystem. Among existing works, comment-based fake news detection methods are empirically shown as promising because comments could reflect users' opinions, stances, and emotions and deepen models' understanding of fake news. Unfortunately, due to exposure bias and users' different willingness to comment, it is not easy to obtain diverse comments in reality, especially for early detection scenarios. Without obtaining the comments from the ``silent'' users, the perceived opinions may be incomplete, subsequently affecting news veracity judgment. In this paper, we explore the possibility of finding an alternative source of comments to guarantee the availability of diverse comments, especially those from silent users. Specifically, we propose to adopt large language models (LLMs) as a user simulator and comment generator, and design GenFEND, a generated feedback-enhanced detection framework, which generates comments by prompting LLMs with diverse user profiles and aggregating generated comments from multiple subpopulation groups. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GenFEND and further analysis shows that the generated comments cover more diverse users and could even be more effective than actual comments.</description>

      <title>Waiting for Q: An Exploration of QAnon Users' Online Migration to Poal in the Wake of Voat's Demise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01397v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online communities are groups of people who interact primarily via the Internet, often sharing common interests. Some of these groups, particularly supporters of Q who created the far-right conspiracy theory known as QAnon, are highly toxic and controversial. These communities are often banned from various mainstream online social networks due to their controversy. This study examines the deplatforming and subsequent migrations of QAnon adherents, following a two-step process. We analyze Reddit data, finding that users opt for Voat as an alternative following the Reddit bans, particularly influenced by Q's postings on 4chan. Subsequently, upon Voat's shutdown announcement, we observe users recommending Poal. Among several insights, we compare the effects of abrupt permanent bans and announced shutdowns on the migration patterns of these conspiracists. Specifically, we find that almost half of Poal's active users are Voat migrants who registered after the shutdown was announced. This contradicts the patterns observed after the Reddit bans, suggesting that advance warning can facilitate more coordinated migrations. Lastly, our research uncovers evidence of discussions and planning related to the January 6th, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, which emerged shortly after Voat's shutdown, predominantly on Poal. This underscores the continued activity of the conspiracy, albeit at a diminished scale due to various bans and a shutdown, while also exposing Poal as a platform that hosts dangerous individuals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel model-selection method for dynamic networks. Our approach involves training a classifier on a large body of synthetic network data. The data is generated by simulating nine state-of-the-art random graph models for dynamic networks, with parameter range chosen to ensure exponential growth of the network size in time. We design a conceptually novel type of dynamic features that count new links received by a group of vertices in a particular time interval. The proposed features are easy to compute, analytically tractable, and interpretable. Our approach achieves a near-perfect classification of synthetic networks, exceeding the state-of-the-art by a large margin. Applying our classification method to real-world citation networks gives credibility to the claims in the literature that models with preferential attachment, fitness and aging fit real-world citation networks best, although sometimes, the predicted model does not involve vertex fitness.</description>

Abstract: Graph transformers need strong inductive biases to derive meaningful attention scores. Yet, current methods often fall short in capturing longer ranges, hierarchical structures, or community structures, which are common in various graphs such as molecules, social networks, and citation networks. This paper presents a Hierarchical Distance Structural Encoding (HDSE) method to model node distances in a graph, focusing on its multi-level, hierarchical nature. We introduce a novel framework to seamlessly integrate HDSE into the attention mechanism of existing graph transformers, allowing for simultaneous application with other positional encodings. To apply graph transformers with HDSE to large-scale graphs, we further propose a high-level HDSE that effectively biases the linear transformers towards graph hierarchies. We theoretically prove the superiority of HDSE over shortest path distances in terms of expressivity and generalization. Empirically, we demonstrate that graph transformers with HDSE excel in graph classification, regression on 7 graph-level datasets, and node classification on 11 large-scale graphs, including those with up to a billion nodes.</description>
