      <title>Deep-Learning-Empowered Programmable Topolectrical Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topolectrical circuits provide a versatile platform for exploring and simulating modern physical models. However, existing approaches suffer from incomplete programmability and ineffective feature prediction and control mechanisms, hindering the investigation of physical phenomena on an integrated platform and limiting their translation into practical applications. Here, we present a deep learning empowered programmable topolectrical circuits (DLPTCs) platform for physical modeling and analysis. By integrating fully independent, continuous tuning of both on site and off site terms of the lattice Hamiltonian, physics graph informed inverse state design, and immediate hardware verification, our system bridges the gap between theoretical modeling and practical realization. Through flexible control and adiabatic path engineering, we experimentally observe the boundary states without global symmetry in higher order topological systems, their adiabatic phase transitions, and the flat band like characteristic corresponding to Landau levels in the circuit. Incorporating a physics graph informed mechanism with a generative AI model for physics exploration, we realize arbitrary, position controllable on board Anderson localization, surpassing conventional random localization. Utilizing this unique capability with high fidelity hardware implementation, we further demonstrate a compelling cryptographic application: hash based probabilistic information encryption by leveraging Anderson localization with extensive disorder configurations, enabling secure delivery of full ASCII messages.</description>

      <title>Long-range resonances in quasiperiodic many-body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate long-range resonances in quasiperiodic many-body localized (MBL) systems. Focusing on the Heisenberg chain in a deterministic Aubry-Andr\'{e} potential, we complement standard diagnostics by analyzing the structure of long-distance pairwise correlations at high energy. Contrary to the expectation that the ergodic-MBL transition in quasiperiodic systems should be sharper due to the absence of Griffiths regions, we uncover a broad unconventional regime at strong quasiperiodic potential, characterized by fat-tailed distributions of longitudinal correlations at long distance. This reveals the presence of atypical eigenstates with strong long-range correlations in a regime where standard diagnostics indicate stable MBL. We further identify these anomalous eigenstates as quasi-degenerate pairs of resonant cat states, which exhibit entanglement at long distance. These findings advance the understanding of quasiperiodic MBL and identify density-correlation measurements in ultracold atomic systems as a probe of long-range resonances.</description>

      <title>Free-Fermion Measurement-Induced Volume- to Area-Law Entanglement Transition in the Presence of Fermion Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At a generic volume- to area-law entanglement transition in a many-body system, quantum chaos is arrested. We argue that this tends to imply the vanishing of a certain "mass" term in the field theory of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) for monitored, interacting fermions. To explore this idea, we consider the MIPT with no conserved quantities that describes 1D monitored, interacting Majorana fermions in class DIII. We conjecture that the MIPT is the noninteracting DIII one in this case; the volume-law phase arises through the dangerously irrelevant mass. We propose numerical tests of our conjecture and analytically identify a candidate noninteracting critical point.</description>

      <title>Identifying geometric third-order nonlinear transport in disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In third-order nonlinear transport, a voltage can be measured in response to the cube of a driving current as a result of the quantum geometric effects, which has attracted tremendous attention. However, in realistic materials where disorder scattering also contributes to nonlinear transport, identifying the geometric mechanisms remains a challenge. We find a total of 20 mechanisms of third-order nonlinear transport by developing a comprehensive theory that treats the geometric effects and disorder scattering on an equal footing. More importantly, we find that 12 of these mechanisms can be unambiguously identified, by deriving a scaling law that expresses the third-order nonlinear Hall conductivity as a polynomial in the linear longitudinal conductivity. We apply this theory to identify the geometric mechanisms of third-order nonlinear transport in materials both with and without time-reversal symmetry, such as 2D materials, topological materials, and altermagnets. This theory further promotes nonlinear transport as a probe of geometric effects and phase transitions in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Dirac spectrum in the chirally symmetric phase of a gauge theory. II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I discuss the consequences of the constraints imposed on the Dirac spectrum by the restoration of chiral symmetry in the chiral limit of gauge theories with two light fermion flavors, with particular attention to the fate of the anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry. Under general, physically motivated assumptions on the spectral density and on the two-point eigenvalue correlation function, I show that effective $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ breaking in the symmetric phase requires specific spectral features, including a spectral density effectively behaving as $m^2\delta(\lambda)$ in the chiral limit, a two-point function singular at zero, and delocalized near-zero modes, besides an instanton gas-like behavior of the topological charge distribution. I then discuss a $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$-breaking scenario characterized by a power-law divergent spectral peak tending to $O(m^4)/|\lambda|$ in the chiral limit and by a near-zero mobility edge, and argue that the mixing of the approximate zero modes associated with a dilute gas of topological objects provides a concrete physical mechanism producing the required spectral features, and so a viable mechanism for effective $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ breaking in the symmetric phase of a gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Learning to generalize in evolution through annealed population heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary systems must learn to generalize, often extrapolating from a limited set of selective conditions to anticipate future environmental changes. The mechanisms enabling such generalization remain poorly understood, despite their importance to predict ecological robustness, drug resistance, or design future-proof vaccination strategies. Here, we demonstrate that annealed population heterogeneity, wherein distinct individuals in the population experience different instances of a complex environment over time, can act as a form of implicit regularization and facilitate evolutionary generalization. Mathematically, annealed heterogeneity introduces a variance-weighted demographic noise term that penalizes across-environment fitness variance and effectively rescales the population size, thereby biasing evolution toward generalist solutions. This process is indeed analogous to a variant of the mini-batching strategy employed in stochastic gradient descent, where an effective multiplicative noise produces an inductive bias by triggering noise-induced transitions.
  Through numerical simulations and theoretical analysis we discuss the conditions under which variation in how individuals experience environmental selection can naturally promote evolutionary strategies that generalize across environments and anticipate novel challenges.</description>

      <title>Statistical physics of deep learning: Optimal learning of a multi-layer perceptron near interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24616v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For three decades statistical physics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. A long-standing question remained on its capacity to tackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going beyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively answer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer perceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it more prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the challenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and data are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider the matched teacher-student setting. It provides the fundamental limits of learning random deep neural network targets and helps in identifying the sufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network as the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various learning transitions. With enough data optimal performance is attained through model's "specialisation" towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for training algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by the theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating from shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer. Furthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the Bayesian-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and finite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning regime that are potentially relevant way beyond it.</description>

      <title>Memory-induced long-range order drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that memory, in the form of slow degrees of freedom, can induce a phase of long-range order (LRO) in locally-coupled fast degrees of freedom, producing power-law distributions of avalanches. In fact, such memory-induced LRO (MILRO) arises in a wide range of physical systems. Here, we show that MILRO can be transferred to coupled systems that have no memory of their own. As an example, we consider a stack of layers of spins with local feedforward couplings: only the first layer contains memory, while downstream layers are memory-free and locally interacting. Analytical arguments and simulations reveal that MILRO can indeed drag across the layers, enabling downstream layers to sustain intra-layer LRO despite having neither memory nor long-range interactions. This establishes a simple, yet generic mechanism for propagating collective activity through media without fine tuning to criticality, with testable implications for neuromorphic systems and laminar information flow in the brain cortex.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Properties of Dense Associative Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense associative memory, a fundamental instance of modern Hopfield networks, can store a large number of memory patterns as equilibrium states of recurrent networks. While the stationary-state storage capacity has been investigated, its dynamical properties have not yet been discussed. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics using an exact approach based on generating functional analysis. We show results on convergence properties of memory retrieval, such as the convergence time and the size of the attraction basins. Our analysis enables a quantitative evaluation of the convergence time and the storage capacity of dense associative memory, which is useful for model design. Unlike the traditional Hopfield model, the retrieval of a pattern does not act as additional noise to itself, suggesting that the structure of modern networks makes recall more robust. Furthermore, the methodology addressed here can be applied to other energy-based models, and thus has the potential to contribute to the design of future architectures.</description>

      <title>Non-linear sigma models for non-Hermitian random matrices in symmetry classes AI$^{\dagger}$ and AII$^{\dagger}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry of non-Hermitian matrices underpins many physical phenomena. In particular, chaotic open quantum systems exhibit universal bulk spectral correlations classified on the basis of time-reversal symmetry$^{\dagger}$ (TRS$^{\dagger}$), coinciding with those of non-Hermitian random matrices in the same symmetry class. Here, we analytically study the spectral correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices in the presence of TRS$^{\dagger}$ with signs $+1$ and $-1$, corresponding to symmetry classes AI$^{\dagger}$ and AII$^{\dagger}$, respectively. Using the fermionic replica non-linear sigma model approach, we derive $n$-fold integral expressions for the $n$th moment of the one-point and two-point characteristic polynomials. Performing the replica limit $n\to 0$, we qualitatively reproduce the density of states and level-level correlations of non-Hermitian random matrices with TRS$^{\dagger}$.</description>

      <title>Why Diffusion Models Don't Memorize: The Role of Implicit Dynamical Regularization in Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of generative tasks. A key challenge is understanding the mechanisms that prevent their memorization of training data and allow generalization. In this work, we investigate the role of the training dynamics in the transition from generalization to memorization. Through extensive experiments and theoretical analysis, we identify two distinct timescales: an early time $\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ at which models begin to generate high-quality samples, and a later time $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ beyond which memorization emerges. Crucially, we find that $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ increases linearly with the training set size $n$, while $\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ remains constant. This creates a growing window of training times with $n$ where models generalize effectively, despite showing strong memorization if training continues beyond it. It is only when $n$ becomes larger than a model-dependent threshold that overfitting disappears at infinite training times. These findings reveal a form of implicit dynamical regularization in the training dynamics, which allow to avoid memorization even in highly overparameterized settings. Our results are supported by numerical experiments with standard U-Net architectures on realistic and synthetic datasets, and by a theoretical analysis using a tractable random features model studied in the high-dimensional limit.</description>
