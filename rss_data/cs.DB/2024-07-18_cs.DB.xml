      <title>Modeling Relational Patterns for Logical Query Answering over Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Answering first-order logical (FOL) queries over knowledge graphs (KG) remains a challenging task mainly due to KG incompleteness. Query embedding approaches this problem by computing the low-dimensional vector representations of entities, relations, and logical queries. KGs exhibit relational patterns such as symmetry and composition and modeling the patterns can further enhance the performance of query embedding models. However, the role of such patterns in answering FOL queries by query embedding models has not been yet studied in the literature. In this paper, we fill in this research gap and empower FOL queries reasoning with pattern inference by introducing an inductive bias that allows for learning relation patterns. To this end, we develop a novel query embedding method, RoConE, that defines query regions as geometric cones and algebraic query operators by rotations in complex space. RoConE combines the advantages of Cone as a well-specified geometric representation for query embedding, and also the rotation operator as a powerful algebraic operation for pattern inference. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets confirm the advantage of relational patterns for enhancing logical query answering task.</description>

      <title>GastCoCo: Graph Storage and Coroutine-Based Prefetch Co-Design for Dynamic Graph Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An efficient data structure is fundamental to meeting the growing demands in dynamic graph processing. However, the dual requirements for graph computation efficiency (with contiguous structures) and graph update efficiency (with linked list-like structures) present a conflict in the design principles of graph structures. After experimental studies of existing state-of-the-art dynamic graph structures, we observe that the overhead of cache misses accounts for a major portion of the graph computation time. This paper presents GastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design. By employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and introducing a prefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the performance degradation caused by cache misses. Our results show that GastCoCo outperforms state-of-the-art graph storage systems by 1.3x - 180x in graph updates and 1.4x - 41.1x in graph computation.</description>

      <title>MMVR: Millimeter-wave Multi-View Radar Dataset and Benchmark for Indoor Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compared with an extensive list of automotive radar datasets that support autonomous driving, indoor radar datasets are scarce at a smaller scale in the format of low-resolution radar point clouds and usually under an open-space single-room setting. In this paper, we scale up indoor radar data collection using multi-view high-resolution radar heatmap in a multi-day, multi-room, and multi-subject setting, with an emphasis on the diversity of environment and subjects. Referred to as the millimeter-wave multi-view radar (MMVR) dataset, it consists of $345$K multi-view radar frames collected from $25$ human subjects over $6$ different rooms, $446$K annotated bounding boxes/segmentation instances, and $7.59$ million annotated keypoints to support three major perception tasks of object detection, pose estimation, and instance segmentation, respectively. For each task, we report performance benchmarks under two protocols: a single subject in an open space and multiple subjects in several cluttered rooms with two data splits: random split and cross-environment split over $395$ 1-min data segments. We anticipate that MMVR facilitates indoor radar perception development for indoor vehicle (robot/humanoid) navigation, building energy management, and elderly care for better efficiency, user experience, and safety. The MMVR dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12611978.</description>

      <title>Generating SROI^{-} Ontologies via Knowledge Graph Query Embedding Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Query embedding approaches answer complex logical queries over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs) by computing and operating on low-dimensional vector representations of entities, relations, and queries. However, current query embedding models heavily rely on excessively parameterized neural networks and cannot explain the knowledge learned from the graph. We propose a novel query embedding method, AConE, which explains the knowledge learned from the graph in the form of SROI^{-} description logic axioms while being more parameter-efficient than most existing approaches. AConE associates queries to a SROI^{-} description logic concept. Every SROI^{-} concept is embedded as a cone in complex vector space, and each SROI^{-} relation is embedded as a transformation that rotates and scales cones. We show theoretically that AConE can learn SROI^{-} axioms, and defines an algebra whose operations correspond one to one to SROI^{-} description logic concept constructs. Our empirical study on multiple query datasets shows that AConE achieves superior results over previous baselines with fewer parameters. Notably on the WN18RR dataset, AConE achieves significant improvement over baseline models. We provide comprehensive analyses showing that the capability to represent axioms positively impacts the results of query answering.</description>
