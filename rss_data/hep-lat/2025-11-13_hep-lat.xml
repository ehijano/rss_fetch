      <title>QCD Equation of State at very high temperature: computational strategy, simulations and data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed account of the theoretical progress and the computational strategy that led to the non-perturbative determination of the QCD Equation of State (EoS) at temperatures up to the electroweak scale reported in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 201904 (2025)]. The two key ingredients that make such a calculation feasible with controlled uncertainties are: (i) the definition of lines of constant physics through the running of a non-perturbatively defined finite-volume coupling across a wide range of energy scales, and (ii) the use of shifted boundary conditions which allow a direct determination of the entropy density thus without the need for a zero-temperature subtraction. Considering the case of QCD with $N_f =3$ massless flavours in the temperature interval between 3 GeV and 165 GeV, we describe the numerical strategy based on integrating in the bare coupling and quark mass, the perturbative improvement of lattice observables, the optimization of numerical simulations, and the continuum extrapolation. Extensive consistency checks, including finite-volume and topological-freezing effects, confirm the robustness of the method. The final results have a relative accuracy of about $1\%$ or better, and the errors are dominated by the statistical fluctuations of the Monte Carlo ensembles. We also compare our non-perturbative results with predictions from standard and hard thermal loop perturbation theory showing that at the level of $\%$-precision contributions beyond those known, including non-perturbative ones due to ultrasoft modes, are relevant up to the highest temperatures explored. The methodological framework is general and readily applicable to QCD with four and five massive quark flavours and to other thermal observables, paving the way for systematic non-perturbative studies of thermal QCD at very high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Isospin-breaking in the $\pi \pi$ scattering amplitude I: Effects due to the pion mass difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first of a series of papers devoted to a detailed analysis of isospin-breaking effects in the $\pi \pi$ scattering amplitude and the vector form factor of the pion. Isospin breaking originates from the mass difference between up and down quarks and from electromagnetic effects. The latter can be further split into effects due to the pion-mass difference and the remaining virtual and real photonic effects. In this paper, we derive the modifications to the Roy equations for $\pi\pi$ scattering due to the mass difference between the charged and the neutral pion. We solve the equations numerically after matching them to the chiral representation of the $\pi \pi$ scattering amplitude evaluated in the same approximation, which is also provided. Numerical results are presented and discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>The color force acting on a quark in the pion and nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) of hard scattering amplitudes, the twist-3 operators describe local colored Lorentz forces acting on a quark, thereby providing a measure of the strength of the gluon fields. Its value is directly accessible from the nucleon twist-3 polarized $g_2$-parton distribution function. In the semiclassical (instanton-based) QCD vacuum models, the leading non-perturbative contribution stems from correlated instanton-anti-instanton pairs, or molecules. We analyze the magnitude of the color force on a 'struck' quark in light hadrons (pion and nucleon), in the context of the instanton liquid model (ILM). We derive explicitly the pertinent form factors associated to the color Lorenz force, and show that they are intimately related to the pertinent hadronic gravitational and transversity form factors. Using the ILM enhanced by molecules, we detail the ensuing colored force distribution in the transverse plane for luminal pions and nucleons. The results for the nucleons are in good agreement with those reported recently from a lattice collaboration.</description>

      <title>Confined-deconfined interface tension and latent heat in SU(N) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high-precision lattice results for the confined-deconfined interface tension and the latent heat of pure SU($N$) gauge theories up to $N=10$ and investigate their asymptotic $N$-dependency. For both quantities we observe the leading $N^2$ behaviour and subleading corrections, with the result for the interface tension $\sigma/T_c^3 = 0.0182(7) N^2 - 0.194(15)$ and for the latent heat $L/T_c^4 = 0.360(6) N^2 - 1.88(17)$. We use the \emph{mixed phase ensemble} method - where the system is constrained so that half of the volume is in the confined phase and the other half in the deconfined phase - and the interface tension is obtained by measuring the capillary wave fluctuation spectra of the interfaces between the two phases. The method bypasses supercritical slowing down from which other methods for determining the interface tension suffer, and as a by-product produces accurate estimates of the critical inverse gauge coupling as a function of the inverse temperature. We use the latter to determine the lattice beta function values, required to compute the latent heat from the discontinuity in the average plaquette action across the confined-deconfined transition.</description>

      <title>Approaches to the Inverse Fourier Transformation with Limited and Discrete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate several approaches to address the inverse problem that arises in the limited inverse Fourier transform (L-IDFT) of quasi-distributions. The methods explored include Tikhonov regularization, the Backus-Gilbert method, the Bayesian approach with Gaussian Random Walk (GRW) prior, and the feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs). We evaluate the performance of these methods using both mock data generated from toy models and real lattice data from quasi distribution, and further compare them with the physics-driven $\lambda$-extrapolation approach. Our results demonstrate that the L-IDFT constitutes a moderately tractable inverse problem Except for the Backus-Gilbert method, all the other approaches are capable of correctly reconstructing the quasi-distributions in momentum space. In particular, the Bayesian approach with GRW and the feedforward ANNs yield more stable and accurate reconstructions. Based on these investigations, we conclude that, for a given L-IDFT problem, selecting an appropriate reconstruction method according to the input data and carefully assessing the potential systematic uncertainties are essential for obtaining reliable results.</description>

      <title>QCD analysis of $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors and the $\vert V_{ub} \vert$ extraction from $B_{l4}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $B_{l4}$ decays offer an independent method for determining the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $\vert V_{ub} \vert$, with a QCD analysis of the underlying $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors serving as a crucial component. We present a comprehensive QCD analysis of the $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors within the framework of light-cone sum rules, employing two-pion light-cone distribution amplitudes. For the first time, we derive the twist-three $2\pi$DAs explicitly by exploiting the conformal symmetry of massless QCD. This breakthrough enables the first systematic calculation of higher-power corrections to the $B \to \pi\pi$-type transitions. Leveraging the recently measured partial decay fractions of $B^+ \to \pi^+\pi^- l^+ \nu_l$ by the Belle detector, we obtain $\vert V_{ub} \vert = \left( 4.27 \pm 0.49\vert_{\rm data} \pm 0.55\vert_{\rm LCSRs} \right) \times 10^{-3}$ within the dominant region of the $\rho$ resonance. We clarify that the relatively small value of $\vert V_{ub} \vert$ extracted from $B \to \rho l \nu$, when compared to the golden channel $B \to \pi l\nu$, arises due to the finite width and nonresonant effects. We anticipate future measurements of purely isovector and isoscalar $B_{l4}$ decays, which will aid in reducing uncertainties by enhancing our understanding of the $\pi\pi$ phase shifts in the two-pion distribution amplitudes through heavy flavor decays.</description>

      <title>Impact on $L$-observables of a new combined analysis of $B_{d,s}\to K^{(*)}$ form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of a combined analysis of $B_{d,s}\to K^{(*)}$ form factors on a set of $L$-observables. The $L$-observables are constructed from ratios of branching fractions in $B_{s}\to VV,PP,PV$ versus $B_d \to VV,PP,PV$ decays with $P=K^0,\bar{K}^0$ and $V=K^{*0},\bar{K}^{*0}$, thereby partially reducing their hadronic uncertainties. We show the change of the Standard Model predictions of the $L$-observables under different determinations of the ratio of the relevant form factors (with correlations) including lattice QCD data and a novel light-cone sum rule analysis. In addition, we provide precise results for all $B_{d,s} \to K^{(*)}$ form factors in machine-readable files. We find that the inclusion of our up-to-date results, as well as the use or omission of lattice QCD data for the form factors, has a significant impact on the $L$-observables. We also discuss how the New Physics interpretation is affected by the updated form factors and present revised predictions for the mechanism identified in our analysis of $B \to VP$ decays, now employing more suitable new experimental observables defined in this paper.</description>

      <title>SMEFT ATLAS: The Landscape Beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) based on the unbroken gauge group $\text{SU(3)}_C\otimes\text{SU(2)}_L\otimes\text{U(1)}_Y$ and containing only particles of the Standard Model (SM) has developed in the last decade to a mature field. It is the framework to be used in the energy gap from scales sufficiently higher than the electroweak scale up to the lowest energy scale at which new particles show up. We summarize the present status of this theory with a particular emphasize on its role in the indirect search for new physics (NP). While flavour physics of both quarks and leptons is the main topic of our review, we also discuss electric dipole moments, anomalous magnetic moments $(g-2)_{\mu,e}$, $Z$-pole observables, Higgs observables and high-$p_T$ scattering processes within the SMEFT. We group the observables into ten classes and list for each class the most relevant operators and the corresponding renormalization group equations (RGEs). We exhibit the correlations between different classes implied both by the operator mixing and the $\text{SU(2)}_L$ gauge symmetry. Our main goal is to provide an insight into the complicated operator structure of this framework which hopefully will facilitate the identification of valid ultraviolet completions behind possible anomalies observed in future data. Numerous colourful charts, and 85 tables, while representing rather complicated RG evolution from the NP scale down to the electroweak scale, beautify the involved SMEFT landscape. Over 950 references to the literature underline the importance and the popularity of this field. We discuss both top-down and bottom-up approaches as well as their interplay. This allows us eventually to present an atlas of different landscapes beyond the SM that includes heavy gauge bosons and scalars, vector-like quarks and leptons and leptoquarks.</description>
