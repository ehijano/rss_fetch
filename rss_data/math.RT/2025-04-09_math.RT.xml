      <title>Cohomology and deformations of restricted Lie algebras and their morphisms in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to study cohomology and develop a deformation theory of restricted Lie algebras in positive characteristic $p&gt;0$. In the case $p\geq3$, it is shown that the deformations of restricted Lie algebras are controlled by the restricted cohomology introduced by Evans and Fuchs. Moreover, we introduce a new cohomology that controls the deformations of restricted morphisms of restricted Lie algebras. In the case $p=2$, we provide a full restricted cohomology complex with values in a restricted module and investigate its connections with formal deformations. Furthermore, we introduce a full deformation cohomology that controls deformations of restricted morphisms of restricted Lie algebras in characteristic $2$. As example, we discuss restricted cohomology with adjoint coefficients of restricted Heisenberg Lie algebras in characteristic $p\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>A stability phenomenon in Kazhdan-Lusztig combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, when $n$ goes to infinity, the expression, with respect to the dual Kazhdan-Lusztig basis, of the product $\hat{\underline{H}}_x\underline{H}_y$ of elements of the dual and the usual Kazhdan-Lusztig bases in the Hecke algebra of the symmetric group $S_n$ stabilizes. As an application, we define the action of projective functors on the principal block of category $\mathcal{O}$ for $\mathfrak{sl}_\infty$ and show that the subcategory of finite length objects is stable under this action. As a bonus, we also prove that this latter block is Koszul, answering, for this block, a question from \cite{CP}.</description>

      <title>A Hom formula for Soergel modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Soergel modules for arbitrary Coxeter groups. For infinite Coxeter groups, we show that the homomorphisms between Soergel modules are in general more than those coming from morphisms of Soergel bimodules. This result provides a negative answer to a question posed by Soergel.
  We further show that the dimensions of the morphism spaces agree with the pairing in the Hecke algebra when Soergel modules are instead regarded as modules over the structure algebra. Moreover, we use this module structure to define a distinguished submodule of indecomposable Soergel bimodules that mimics the cohomology submodule of the intersection cohomology. Combined with the Hodge theory of Soergel bimodules, this can be used to extend results regarding the shape of Bruhat intervals, such as top-heaviness, to arbitrary Coxeter groups.</description>

      <title>On the Hopf envelope of finite-dimensional bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hopf envelope of a bialgebra is the free Hopf algebra generated by the given bialgebra. Its existence, as well as that of the cofree Hopf algebra, is a well-known fact in Hopf algebra theory, but their construction is not particularly handy or friendly. In this note, we offer a novel realisation of the Hopf envelope and of the cofree Hopf algebra of a finite-dimensional bialgebra as a particular quotient and sub-bialgebra, respectively, of the bialgebra itself. Our construction can also be extended to the infinite-dimensional case, provided that the bialgebra satisfies additional conditions, such as being left Artinian as an algebra or admitting a $n$-antipode, the latter being a notion hereby introduced.</description>

      <title>Braid group actions on branched coverings and full exceptional sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We relate full exceptional sequences in Fukaya categories of surfaces or equivalently in derived categories of graded gentle algebras to branched coverings over the disk, building on a previous classification result of the first and third author. This allows us to apply tools from the theory of branched coverings such as Birman--Hilden theory and Hurwitz systems to study the natural braid group action on exceptional sequences. As an application, counterexamples are given to a conjecture of Bondal--Polishchuk on the transitivity of the braid group action on full exceptional sequences in a triangulated category.</description>

      <title>An Equivalence Relation Classification of the Isomorphism Types of Absolutely Indecomposable (resp. Absolutely Simple) Modules in Finite Group Modular Representation Theory with a Green Theory Invariants "Compatibility"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, let $F$ be a field of prime $p$ order and let $\bar{F}$ be an algebraic closure of $F$. In this context, we develop an equivalence relation on the set of isomorphic types of indecomposable (resp. simple) $\bar{F}G$-modules. Note that here all indecomposable (resp. simple) modules are absolutely indecomposable (resp. simple). Also we show that members of the same equivalence have related Green Theory invariants. This work completes and extends previous results of the author.</description>

      <title>Sporadic Isogenies to the Quaternionic Orthogonal Groups $\operatorname{SO}^*(2n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For small dimensional Lie algebra's there are many so-called accidental isomorphisms which give rise to double covers of special orthogonal groups - Spin groups - which happen to coincide with groups already belonging to another classification. The well known catalog of these sporadic isogenies given by Dr. Paul Garrett keeps track of these facts for the complex orthogonal groups $\operatorname{SO}(n, \mathbb{C})$, and those real forms which are manifestly real: $\operatorname{SO}(p,q)$, while avoiding the quaternionic real forms, $\operatorname{SO}^*(2n)$. This article serves to complement and complete the existing catalog by presenting the sporadic isogenies to the first four quaternionic orthogonal groups in one place, with contemporary proofs of those group and algebra homomorphisms. A review of the definition of $\operatorname{SO}^*(2n)$ is presented in a modern notation, emphasizing the concept of `quaternion reversion' as a useful, albeit redundant, second conjugation upon quaternions, helping to explicate the self-conjugacy of quaternionic representations. Lastly, the triality of $\operatorname{SO}^*(8)$ is explored in a similar manner to work done by the author previously.</description>

      <title>Semi-infinite flags and Zastava spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13067v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an interpretation of the semi-infinite intersection cohomology sheaf associated to a semisimple simply-connected algebraic group in terms of finite-dimensional geometry. Specifically, we describe a procedure for building factorization spaces over moduli spaces of finite subsets of a curve from factorization spaces over moduli spaces of divisors, and show that under this procedure the compactified Zastava space is sent to the support of the semi-infinite IC sheaf in the factorizable Grassmannian. We define "semi-infinite t-structures" for a large class of schemes with an action of the multiplicative group, and show that, for the Zastava, the limit of these t-structure recovers the infinite-dimensional version. As an application, we also construct factorizable parabolic semi-infinite IC sheaves and a generalization (of the principal case) to Kac-Moody algebras.</description>

      <title>Towards the quantum exceptional series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a single two-parameter skein relation on trivalent graphs, the quantum exceptional relation, that specializes to a skein relation associated to each exceptional Lie algebra (in the adjoint representation). If a slight strengthening of Deligne's conjecture on the existence of a (classical) exceptional series is true, then this relation holds for a new two-variable quantum exceptional polynomial, at least as a power series near $q=1$. The single quantum exceptional relation can be viewed as a deformation of the Jacobi relation, and implies a deformation of the Vogel relation that motivated the conjecture on the classical exceptional series.
  We find a conjectural basis for the space of diagrams with $n$ loose ends modulo the quantum exceptional relation for $n \le 6$, with dimensions agreeing with the classical computations, and compute the matrix of inner products, and the quantum dimensions of idempotents. We use the skein relation to compute the conjectural quantum exceptional polynomial for many knots. In particular we determine (unconditionally) the values of the quantum polynomials for the exceptional Lie algebras on these knots. We can perform these computations for all links of Conway width less than $6$, which includes all prime knots with 12 or fewer crossings. Finally, we prove several specialization results relating our conjectural family to certain quantum group categories, and conjecture a number of exceptional analogues of level-rank duality.</description>
