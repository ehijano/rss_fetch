      <title>Derangements in non-Frobenius groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if $G$ is a transitive permutation group of sufficiently large degree $n$, then either $G$ is primitive and Frobenius, or the proportion of derangements in $G$ is larger than $1/(2n^{1/2})$. This is sharp, generalizes substantially bounds of Cameron--Cohen and Guralnick--Wan, and settles a conjecture of Guralnick--Tiep in large degree. We also give an application to coverings of varieties over finite fields.</description>

      <title>On Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that an abelian group $A$ and a $2$-cocycle $c:A \times A \to C$ yield a group ${\mathscr{H}}(A,C,c)$ which we call a Heisenberg group. This group, a central extension of $A$, is the archetype of a class~$2$ nilpotent group. In this note, we prove that under mild conditions, any class~$2$ nilpotent group $G$ is equivalent as an extension of $G/[G,G]$ to a Heisenberg group ${\mathscr{H}}(G/[G,G], [G,G], c')$ whose $2$-cocycle $c'$ is bimultiplicative.</description>

      <title>On groups with at most five irrational conjugacy classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G. Navarro and P. H. Tiep, among others, have studied groups with few rational conjugacy classes or few rational irreducible characters. In this paper we look at the opposite extreme. Let $G$ be a finite group. Given a conjugacy class $K$ of $G$, we say it is irrational if there is some $\chi \in \operatorname{Irr}(G)$ such that $\chi(K) \not \in \mathbb{Q}$. One of our main results shows that, when $G$ contains at most $5$ irrational conjugacy classes, then $|\operatorname{Irr}_{\mathbb{Q}} (G)| = | \operatorname{cl}_{\mathbb{Q}} (G)|$. This suggests some duality with the known results and open questions on groups with few rational irreducible characters.</description>

      <title>A combination theorem for hierarchically quasiconvex subgroups, and application to geometric subgroups of mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for two subgroups of a hierarchically hyperbolic group to generate an amalgamated free product over their intersection. The result applies in particular to certain geometric subgroups of mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces, that is, those subgroups coming from the embeddings of closed subsurfaces.
  In the second half of the paper, we study under which hypotheses our amalgamation procedure preserves several notions of convexity in HHS, such as hierarchical quasiconvexity (as introduced by Behrstock, Hagen, and Sisto) and strong quasiconvexity (every quasigeodesic with endpoints on the subset lies in a uniform neighbourhood). This answers a question of Russell, Spriano, and Tran.</description>

      <title>A classification of $C_{p^n}$-Tambara fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tambara functors arise in equivariant homotopy theory as the structure adherent to the homotopy groups of a coherently commutative equivariant ring spectrum. We show that if $k$ is a field-like $C_{p^n}$-Tambara functor, then $k$ is the coinduction of a field-like $C_{p^s}$-Tambara functor $\ell$ such that $\ell(C_{p^s}/e)$ is a field. If this field has characteristic other than $p$, we observe that $\ell$ must be a fixed-point Tambara functor, and if the characteristic is $p$, we determine all possible forms of $\ell$ through an analysis of the behavior of the Frobenius endomorphism and an application of Artin-Schreier theory.</description>

      <title>Representation Rings of Fusion Systems and Brauer Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a saturated fusion system on a $p$-group $S$. We study the ring $R(\mathcal{F})$ of $\mathcal{F}$-stable characters by exploiting a new connection to the modular characters of a finite group $G$ with $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F}_S(G)$. We utilise this connection to find the rank of the $\mathcal{F}$-stable character ring over fields with positive characteristic. We use this theory to derive a decomposition of the regular representation for a fixed basis $B$ of the ring of complex $\mathcal{F}$-stable characters and give a formula for the absolute value of the determinant of the $\mathcal{F}$-character table with respect to $B$ (the matrix of the values taken by elements of $B$ on each $\mathcal{F}$-conjugacy class) for a wide class of saturated fusion systems, including all non-exotic fusion systems, and prove this value squared is a power of $p$ for all saturated fusion systems.</description>

      <title>From local isometries to global symmetries: bridging Killing vectors and Lie algebras through induced vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of symmetries in the realm of manifolds can be approached in two different ways. On one hand, Killing vector fields on a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold correspond to the directions of local isometries within it. On the other hand, from an algebraic perspective, global symmetries of such manifolds are associated with group elements. Although the connection between these two concepts is well established in the literature, this work aims to build an unexplored bridge between the Killing vector fields of n-dimensional maximally symmetric spaces and their corresponding isometry Lie groups, anchoring primarily on the definition of induced vector fields. As an application of our main result, we explore two specific examples: the three-dimensional Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Strong asymptotic freeness of Haar unitaries in quasi-exponential dimensional representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove almost sure strong asymptotic freeness of i.i.d. random unitaries with the following law: sample a Haar unitary matrix of dimension $n$ and then send this unitary into an irreducible representation of $U(n)$. The strong convergence holds as long as the irreducible representation arises from a pair of partitions of total size at most $n^{\frac{1}{24}-\varepsilon}$ and is uniform in this regime.
  Previously this was known for partitions of total size up to $\asymp\log n/\log\log n$ by a result of Bordenave and Collins.</description>

      <title>Local permutation stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of "local stability in permutations" for finitely generated groups. If a group is sofic and locally stable in our sense, then it is also locally embeddable into finite groups (LEF). Our notion is weaker than the "permutation stability" introduced by Glebsky-Rivera and Arzhantseva-Paunescu, which allows one to upgrade soficity to residual finiteness. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for an amenable group to be locally permutation stable, in terms of invariant random subgroups (IRSs), inspired by a similar criterion for permutation stability due to Becker, Lubotzky and Thom. We apply our criterion to prove that derived subgroups of topological full groups of Cantor minimal subshifts are locally stable, using Zheng's classification of IRSs for these groups. This last result provides continuum-many groups which are locally stable, but not stable.</description>

      <title>On closure operations in the space of subgroups and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish some interactions between uniformly recurrent subgroups (URSs) of a group $G$ and cosets topologies $\tau_\mathcal{N}$ on $G$ associated to a family $\mathcal{N}$ of normal subgroups of $G$. We show that when $\mathcal{N}$ consists of finite index subgroups of $G$, there is a natural closure operation $\mathcal{H} \mapsto \mathrm{cl}_\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{H})$ that associates to a URS $\mathcal{H}$ another URS $\mathrm{cl}_\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{H})$, called the $\tau_\mathcal{N}$-closure of $\mathcal{H}$. We give a characterization of the URSs $\mathcal{H}$ that are $\tau_\mathcal{N}$-closed in terms of stabilizer URSs. This has consequences on arbitrary URSs when $G$ belongs to the class of groups for which every faithful minimal profinite action is topologically free. We also consider the largest amenable URS $\mathcal{A}_G$, and prove that for certain coset topologies on $G$, almost all subgroups $H \in \mathcal{A}_G$ have the same closure. For groups in which amenability is detected by a set of laws (a property that is variant of the Tits alternative), we deduce a criterion for $\mathcal{A}_G$ to be a singleton based on residual properties of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the mapping class group of the one-holed Cantor tree surface is acyclic. This in turn determines the homology of the mapping class group of the once-punctured Cantor tree surface (i.e. the plane minus a Cantor set), in particular answering a recent question of Calegari and Chen. We in fact prove these results for a general class of infinite-type surfaces called binary tree surfaces. To prove our results we use two main ingredients: one is a modification of an argument of Mather related to the notion of dissipated groups; the other is a general homological stability result for mapping class groups of infinite-type surfaces.</description>

      <title>Transitive path decompositions of Cartesian products of complete graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An $H$-decomposition of a graph $\Gamma$ is a partition of its edge set into subgraphs isomorphic to $H$. A transitive decomposition is a special kind of $H$-decomposition that is highly symmetrical in the sense that the subgraphs (copies of $H$) are preserved and transitively permuted by a group of automorphisms of $\Gamma$. This paper concerns transitive $H$-decompositions of the graph $K_n \Box K_n$ where $H$ is a path. When $n$ is an odd prime, we present a construction for a transitive path decomposition where the paths in the decomposition are considerably large compared to the number of vertices. Our main result supports well-known Gallai's conjecture and an extended version of Ringel's conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inquiry into identifying sets of monomials that can be eliminated from a generic homogeneous polynomial via a linear change of coordinates was initiated by E. K. Wakeford. This linear algebra problem prompted C. K. Fan and J. Losonczy to introduce the notion of acyclic matchings in the additive group $\mathbb{Z}^n$, subsequently extended to abelian groups by the latter author. Alon, Fan, Kleitman, and Losonczy established the acyclic matching property for $\mathbb{Z}^n$. This note aims to classify all abelian groups with respect to the acyclic matching property.</description>

Abstract: A multiplicatively idempotent rig (which we abbreviate to mirig) is a rig satisfying the equation $r^2 = r$. We show that a free mirig on finitely many generators is finite and compute its size. This work was originally motivated by a collaborative effort on the decentralized social network Mastodon to compute the size of the free mirig on two generators.</description>
