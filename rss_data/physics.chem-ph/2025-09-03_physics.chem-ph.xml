      <title>MolErr2Fix:Benchmarking LLM Trustworthiness in Chemistry via Modular Error Detection, Localization, Explanation, and Revision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown growing potential in molecular sciences, but they often produce chemically inaccurate descriptions and struggle to recognize or justify potential errors. This raises important concerns about their robustness and reliability in scientific applications. To support more rigorous evaluation of LLMs in chemical reasoning, we present the MolErr2Fix benchmark, designed to assess LLMs on error detection and correction in molecular descriptions. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on molecule-to-text generation or property prediction, MolErr2Fix emphasizes fine-grained chemical understanding. It tasks LLMs with identifying, localizing, explaining, and revising potential structural and semantic errors in molecular descriptions. Specifically, MolErr2Fix consists of 1,193 fine-grained annotated error instances. Each instance contains quadruple annotations, i.e,. (error type, span location, the explanation, and the correction). These tasks are intended to reflect the types of reasoning and verification required in real-world chemical communication. Evaluations of current state-of-the-art LLMs reveal notable performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust chemical reasoning capabilities. MolErr2Fix provides a focused benchmark for evaluating such capabilities and aims to support progress toward more reliable and chemically informed language models. All annotations and an accompanying evaluation API will be publicly released to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Dissociative electron attachment to the HNC$_3$ molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissociative electron attachment (DEA) to the HNC$_3$ is modeled theoretically using a first-principles approach. In HNC$_3$+$e^-$ collisions, there is a low-energy resonance, which has a repulsive character along the H+NC$_3$ coordinate and becomes a bound electronic state of the HNC$_3^-$ anion near the equilibrium of HNC$_3$. The anion state dissociates without a potential barrier towards C$_3$N$^-$+H. The cross section and the rate coefficient of the process were computed. The obtained rate coefficient at low temperatures is $5\times 10^{-9}$cm$^3$/s at 300~K. Such a value of the DEA rate coefficient makes the DEA process by three orders of magnitude more efficient in producing negative molecular ions in the interstellar space than the radiative electron attachment (REA). It is suggested that negative molecular carbon-chain ions, observed in the interstellar medium, are produced by DEA rather than REA.</description>

      <title>Migration as a Probe: A Generalizable Benchmark Framework for Specialist vs. Generalist Machine-Learned Force Fields in Doped Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), particularly pre-trained foundation models, promise to bring ab initio-level accuracy to the length and time scales of molecular dynamics. Yet this shift raises a central question: is it better to build a specialist model from scratch or adapt a generalist foundation model for a specific system? The trade-offs in data efficiency, predictive accuracy, and risks of out-of-distribution (OOD) failure remain unclear. Here, we present a benchmarking framework that contrasts bespoke (from scratch) and fine-tuned foundation models in a test case of a technologically relevant 2D material, Cr-intercalated Sb2Te3, using the MACE architecture. Our framework employs migration pathways, evaluated through nudged elastic band (NEB) trajectories, as a diagnostic probe that tests both interpolation and extrapolation. We assess accuracy for equilibrium, kinetic (atomic migration), and mechanical (interlayer sliding) tasks. While all models capture equilibrium structures, predictions for non-equilibrium processes diverge. Task-specific fine-tuning substantially improves kinetic accuracy compared with both from-scratch and zero-shot models, but can degrade learned representations of long-range physics. Analysis of internal representations shows that training paradigms yield distinct, non-overlapping latent encodings of system physics. This work offers a practical guide for MLFF development, highlights migration-based probes as efficient diagnostics, and suggests pathways toward uncertainty-aware active learning strategies.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Aqueous Medium on Nucleobase Shape Resonances: Insights from Microsolvation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the effect of microhydration on the shape resonances of uracil nucleobase. The resonance parameters were determined using the resonance via Pad\'e approach along with the efficient wave function-based EA-EOM-DLPNO-CCSD method. Our results showed that the uracil resonances become stabilized with an increase in the extent of microsolvation. The energy of the resonances decreased, and the width increased as the number of water molecules surrounding uracil was increased. It showed that ten water molecules are sufficient to make the lowest shape resonance of uracil a bound radical anionic state. Our results also indicate that the lowest energy resonance state may become a bound state under bulk solvation.</description>

      <title>Insights into the Structure and Dynamics of Water at Co$_3$O$_4$(001) Using a High-Dimensional Neural Network Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co$_3$O$_4$ is an important catalyst for the oxidation of organic molecules in the liquid phase. Still, understanding the atomistic details of Co$_3$O$_4$-water interfaces under operando conditions remains extremely challenging. While ab initio molecular dynamics have become an essential tool for investigating these dynamic interfaces in silico, they are limited to only a few picoseconds and a few hundred atoms. In this work, we overcome these limitations by training a high-dimensional neural network potential (HDNNP) on density functional theory data, which allows us to significantly extend the accessible time and length scales. Employing this HDNNP, we perform simulations to unravel the structure, dynamics, and reactivity of Co$_3$O$_4$(001)-water interfaces in detail. Our simulations reveal distinct characteristics of the two possible A and B terminations. The B-terminated surface stabilizes a compact, quasi-epitaxial hydration layer with strong templating effects, enhanced hydroxylation, and a well-organized hydrogen-bond network. In contrast, the A-termination forms a more diffuse contact layer with weaker templating, lower hydroxylation, and less ordered interfacial water. Extended simulations further uncover proton transfer pathways, including intermittent protonation of surface hydroxyls, migration of water molecules into the epitaxial layer, and rare hydronium-like configurations.</description>

      <title>Rectification of Vibrational Energy Transfer in Driven Chiral Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the combination of molecular chirality and phase controlled driving can lead to rectification of vibrational energy transfer. We demonstrate this effect using classical models of (1) a single helical chain and (2) a more realistic model of polyethylene double helix. We examine the effect of the driving frequency, polarization, and temperature on this phenomenon. Notably, we find that the direction and magnitude of the observed directionality preference depends on the driving frequency and phase, and that the effect persists at room temperature.</description>

      <title>A Further Comparison of TD-DMRG and ML-MCTDH for Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Exciton Dissociation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network methods, such as time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) and multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), are powerful tools for simulating quantum dynamics. While both methods are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, a recent study reported up to 60% discrepancy in their calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we first reduce the difference to less than 10%. Further refinement using an extrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the difference to approximately 2%. Our results confirm both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase-induced nuclear quantum interference is robust against quantum dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the intriguing effects due to conical intersections is the geometric phase, manifested as destructive quantum interference in the nuclear probability distribution. However, whether such geometric phaseinduced interference can survive in dissipative environments remains an open question. We demonstrate by numerically exact dissipative conical intersection dynamics simulations that the destructive interference is highly robust against non-Markovian quantum dissipation. To do so, we integrate the recently proposed local diabatic representation to describe vibronic couplings and the hierarchical equations of motion for system-bath interactions. Both vibrational and electronic environments are considered. An intuitive path integral-like picture isprovided to explain the robustness of geometric phase-induced interference.</description>

      <title>NMR-Solver: Automated Structure Elucidation via Large-Scale Spectral Matching and Physics-Guided Fragment Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful and widely used tools for molecular structure elucidation in organic chemistry. However, the interpretation of NMR spectra to determine unknown molecular structures remains a labor-intensive and expertise-dependent process, particularly for complex or novel compounds. Although recent methods have been proposed for molecular structure elucidation, they often underperform in real-world applications due to inherent algorithmic limitations and limited high-quality data. Here, we present NMR-Solver, a practical and interpretable framework for the automated determination of small organic molecule structures from $^1$H and $^{13}$C NMR spectra. Our method introduces an automated framework for molecular structure elucidation, integrating large-scale spectral matching with physics-guided fragment-based optimization that exploits atomic-level structure-spectrum relationships in NMR. We evaluate NMR-Solver on simulated benchmarks, curated experimental data from the literature, and real-world experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization, robustness, and practical utility in challenging, real-life scenarios. NMR-Solver unifies computational NMR analysis, deep learning, and interpretable chemical reasoning into a coherent system. By incorporating the physical principles of NMR into molecular optimization, it enables scalable, automated, and chemically meaningful molecular identification, establishing a generalizable paradigm for solving inverse problems in molecular science.</description>

      <title>Effective approximations for Hartree-Fock exchange potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hartree-Fock exchange potential is fundamental for capturing quantum mechanical exchange effects but faces critical challenges in large-scale applications due to its nonlocal and computationally intensive nature. This study introduces a generalized framework for constructing approximate Fock exchange operators in Hartree-Fock theory, addressing the computational bottlenecks caused by the nonlocal nature. By employing low-rank decomposition and incorporating adjustable variables, the proposed method ensures high accuracy for occupied orbitals while maintaining Hermiticity and structural consistency with the exact Fock exchange operator. Meanwhile, a two-level nested self-consistent field iteration strategy is developed to decouple the exchange operator stabilization (outer loop) and electron density refinement (inner loop), significantly reducing computational costs. Numerical experiments on several molecules demonstrate that the approximate exchange operators achieve near-identical energies compared to that of the exact exchange operator and the NWChem references, with substantial improvements in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Multi-Orbital Charge Transfer into Nonplanar Cycloarenes Revealed with CO-Functionalized Tips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-surface synthesis has allowed for the tuneable preparation of numerous molecular systems with variable properties. Recently, we demonstrated the highly selective synthesis of kekulene (&gt;99%) on Cu(111) and isokekulene (92%) on Cu(110) from the same molecular precursor (Ruan et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2025, e202509932). Scanning tunneling microscopy with CO-functionalized tips can identify the single molecules on the basis of their geometric structure at a low coverage on Cu(110), but it also detects complex features due to electronic contributions close to the Fermi energy. Here, we investigate the origin of these features by simulating STM images based on a weighted sum of multiple molecular orbitals, for which we employ weights based on the calculated molecular-orbital projected density of states. This allows for an experimental confirmation of charge transfer from the surface into multiple formerly unoccupied molecular orbitals for single molecules of kekulene as well as isokekulene in its two nonplanar adsorption configurations. In comparison, the area-integrating photoemission orbital tomography technique confirms the charge transfer as well as the high selectivity for the formation of a full monolayer of mainly isokekulene on Cu(110). Our STM-based approach is applicable to a wide range of adsorbed molecular systems and specifically also suited for strongly interacting surfaces, nonplanar molecules, and such molecules which can only be prepared at extremely low yields.</description>

      <title>Suitability of ReaxFF potential for MD modelling of lithium across low and high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling lithium's atomic-scale behavior is critical for its roles in plasma-facing fusion components and lithium-ion batteries, yet it remains challenging across phase regimes. This study benchmarks ReaxFF, 2NN-MEAM, and SNAP potentials from 100 to 1000 K using molecular dynamics, with ensemble and cooling protocols carefully controlled. Compared to reliable experimental data, ReaxFF diverges above 800 K, underestimating density by ~10% at 1000 K and overestimating diffusivity, yielding anomalously low-density liquid behavior. Radial distribution functions and coordination profiles further reveal possible excessive disorder above 800 K. While ReaxFF offers qualitative insight into disordered lithium, its quantitative reliability diminishes at high temperatures, requiring validation against ab initio or experimental benchmarks. These findings inform potential selections for fusion- and battery-relevant simulations, underscoring the sensitivity of glassy phase modeling to potential choices and thermal histories.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency of Hydrocarbon Isomer Separation via Levi-Blow Mechanism: Benchmarking Against Conventional Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Separation of hydrocarbon isomers with closely matched physicochemical properties remains an energetically demanding challenge in the petrochemical refineries. This study presents a comparative analysis of three methods: the fractional distillation, the Molex process, and the Levi-Blow (LB) technique. Using experimentally validated thermodynamic data and heat-transfer estimates, we quantify the energy expenditure and number of cycles required to achieve ultrahigh-purity separation. The LB method achieves eight-9s purity in a single cycle with just 39.4~kJ/mol, while fractional distillation and Molex require multiple iterations and up to five orders of magnitude more energy. Each method is also benchmarked against the thermodynamic minimum work of separation of the mixture of interest. It is found that the LB technique operates within a factor of 23 of this lower bound, compared to $\sim 10^2$ for Molex (Molex is a trademark and/or service mark of UOP Inc.) and $\sim 10^5$ for fractional distillation, demonstrating its thermodynamic and operational superiority.</description>

      <title>Perturbatively corrected ring-polymer instanton rate theory rigorously captures anharmonicity and deep tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a perturbatively-corrected instanton rate theory in the ring-polymer framework (RPI+PC), which significantly enhances the accuracy of instanton theory by using third and fourth derivatives of the potential to capture anharmonic effects. Instanton theory is a rigorous semiclassical method that extends transition-state theory by including quantum tunneling along a well-defined optimal tunneling pathway. However, the standard leading-order instanton theory (RPI) neglects anharmonicity perpendicular to this tunneling path. The RPI+PC method described here corrects this using only local information along the same instanton trajectory as the leading-order theory. Hence, RPI+PC does not require a global potential energy surface and is readily applicable in combination with ab initio electronic-structure methods. The derivation of the RPI+PC result is performed within the flux-correlation formalism using standard techniques from asymptotic analysis, and the final rate expression is shown to be independent of the choice of dividing surface. We demonstrate that RPI+PC represents a systematic improvement over RPI by analyzing its asymptotic properties in the semiclassical limit ($\hbar\to0$ with total thermal time $\tau^{\mathrm{tot}}=\beta\hbar$ kept constant) and illustrate its improved performance on a series of model systems for which exact results are available for comparison, including the collinear H+H$_2$ reaction and its isotopic variants.</description>

      <title>Membrane-Electrode Assemblies for Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Ethylene: Design for Minimal Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA) cells with copper (Cu) cathodes show strong potential for electrochemical CO2 reduction to ethylene (C2H4), but achieving high C2H4 selectivity remains a challenge due to competing hydrogen evolution. This selectivity is highly sensitive to the local microenvironment near the Cu catalyst surface. In this study, a 1-D, multiphysics continuum model is utilized to investigate how MEA cell performance and faradaic efficiency (FE) to C2H4 are affected by both component properties and operating conditions, with particular focus on coupled transport and reaction phenomena. Key parameters include cathode electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and catalyst layer thickness. Halving catalyst layer thickness increases FE to C2H4 by 2% and lowers the cell voltage by 40 mV. In contrast, a tenfold decrease in ECSA results increases the FE to C2H4 by 7% but leads increase cell voltage at a given current density by 150 mV. This tradeoff occurs because the potential distribution within the cathode catalyst layer is the primary driving force for C2H4 formation. Increased cell voltage also raises the energy cost of C2H4 production. This model framework enables techno-economic assessments and identifies key factors that must be optimized to enable economically viable production of C2H4 via electrochemical reduction of CO2.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the unique kinetic interactions between N2O and unsaturated hydrocarbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between unsaturated hydrocarbons and N2O has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their important roles as potential propellants for advanced propulsion systems e.g. NOFBX, key combustion intermediates in EGR systems, and as major pollutants and precursors in atmospheric chemistry. Although experimental studies and kinetic models have been developed to investigate its fuel chemistry, discrepancies remain between modeled and measured ignition delay times at low temperatures. In this work, we characterize previously unreported direct interaction pathways between N2O and unsaturated hydrocarbons C2H4, C3H6, C2H2, and C3H4 through quantum chemistry calculations, comprehensive kinetic modeling, and experimental validation. These reactions proceed via O-atom addition from N2O to unsaturated hydrocarbons, forming five membered ring intermediates that decompose into N2 and hydrocarbon specific products. Distinct mechanistic differences are identified between alkenes and alkynes, arising from the disparity in N C bond lengths within the intermediates 1.480 A vs. 1.381 A, which governs their decomposition pathways. The corresponding rate coefficients are determined and implemented into multiple kinetic models, with autoignition simulations showing a pronounced promoting effect on model reactivity and improved agreement with experiments, especially at low temperatures. Flux analysis further reveals that the new pathways suppress conventional inhibiting channels while enabling aldehyde and ketone forming pathways that enhance overall reactivity. This work provides a more complete description of N2O hydrocarbon interactions, advancing predictive capability for combustion and atmospheric chemistry.</description>

      <title>Electrode Potential Dependent Differential Capacitance in Electrocatalysis: a Novel, Ab Initio Computational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As interest in nanomaterials grows, ab initio simulations play a crucial role in designing electrochemical catalysts. Electrochemical reactions depend on electrode potential, highlighting the importance of the grand canonical representation, especially when integrated with Density Functional Theory. The Grand Canonical Potential - Kinetics (GCP-K) method is a valuable approach for determining electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms and kinetics rooted in quantum mechanics, relying on assumptions of quadratic free energy dependence on charge and a constant differential capacitance-potential relationship. However, it is known that differential capacitance is potential-dependent in several practical electrocatalysts. Here we present $\mu$-GCP-K, a practical approach which makes no assumptions about the relationships between thermodynamic and electrochemical properties. We demonstrate the method's efficiency by computing the surface charge density and differential capacitance of graphene, further emphasizing the importance of accurately calculating the thermodynamic stability of reaction intermediates in carbon dioxide electroreduction, while also showing the role of potential-dependent differential capacitance.</description>

      <title>Pre-trained knowledge elevates large language models beyond traditional chemical reaction optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern optimization in experimental chemistry employs algorithmic search through black-box parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that pre-trained knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm. Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768 - 5,684 experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become scarce (&lt;5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain systematically higher exploration entropy than BO across all datasets while achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails - suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories. Our findings establish that LLM-GO excels precisely where traditional methods struggle: complex categorical spaces requiring domain understanding rather than mathematical optimization.</description>

      <title>Generative Latent Space Dynamics of Electron Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the time-dependent evolution of electron density is essential for understanding quantum mechanical behaviors of condensed matter and enabling predictive simulations in spectroscopy, photochemistry, and ultrafast science. Yet, while machine learning methods have advanced static density prediction, modeling its spatiotemporal dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a generative framework that combines a 3D convolutional autoencoder with a latent diffusion model (LDM) to learn electron density trajectories from ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Our method encodes electron densities into a compact latent space and predicts their future states by sampling from the learned conditional distribution, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without drift or collapse. To preserve statistical fidelity, we incorporate a scaled Jensen-Shannon divergence regularization that aligns generated and reference density distributions. On AIMD trajectories of liquid lithium at 800 K, our model accurately captures both the spatial correlations and the log-normal-like statistical structure of the density. The proposed framework has the potential to accelerate the simulation of quantum dynamics and overcome key challenges faced by current spatiotemporal machine learning methods as surrogates of quantum mechanical simulators.</description>

Abstract: Emerging ferroic materials may pave a new way to next-generation nanoelectronic and spintronic devices due to their interesting physical properties. Here, we systematically review unconventional ferroelectric systems, from Hf-based and elementary ferroelectrics to stacking ferroelectricity, polar metallicity, fractional quantum ferroelectricity, wurtzite-type ferroelectricity, and freestanding membranes ferroelectricity. Moreover, multiferroic materials are reviewed, particularly the interplay between novel magnetic states and ferroelectricity, as well as ferrovalley-ferroelectric coupling. Finally, we conclude by discussing current challenges and future opportunities in this field.</description>

      <title>rhodent: A Python package for analyzing real-time TDDFT response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) is a well-established method for studying the dynamic response of matter in the femtosecond or optical range. In this method, the Kohn-Sham (KS) wave functions are propagated forward in time, and in principle, one can extract any observable at any given time. Alternatively, by taking a Fourier transform, spectroscopic quantities can be extracted. There are many publicly available codes implementing rt-TDDFT, which differ in their numeric solution of the KS equations, their available exchange-correlation functionals, and in their analysis capabilities. For users of rt-TDDFT, this is an inconvenient situation because they may need to use a numerical method that is available in one code, but an analysis method available in another. Here, we introduce rhodent, a modular Python package for processing the output of rt-TDDFT calculations. Our package can be used to calculate hot-carrier distributions, energies, induced densities, and dipole moments, and various decompositions thereof. In its current version, rhodent handles calculation results from the gpaw code, but can readily be extended to support other rt-TDDFT codes. Additionally, under the assumption of linear response, rhodent can be used to calculate the response to a narrow-band laser, from the response to a broad-band perturbation, greatly speeding up the analysis of frequency-dependent excitations. We demonstrate the capabilities of rhodent via a set of examples, for systems consisting of Al and Ag clusters and organic molecules.</description>

      <title>RoFt-Mol: Benchmarking Robust Fine-Tuning with Molecular Graph Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based, representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Solution of Non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion and Operator Construction of Quantum Stochastic Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Markovian quantum state diffusion provides a wavefunction-based framework for modeling open quantum systems. In this work, we introduce a novel machine learning approach based on an operator construction algorithm. This algorithm employs a neural network as a universal generator to reconstruct the stochastic time evolution operator from an ensemble of quantum trajectories. Unlike conventional machine learning methods that merely approximate time-dependent wavefunctions or expectation values, our operator-based approach yields broader applications and enhanced interpretability of the stochastic process. We benchmark the algorithm on the spin-boson model across diverse spectral densities, demonstrating its accuracy. Furthermore, we showcase the operator's utility in calculating absorption spectra and reconstructing reduced density matrices at extended timescales. These results establish a new paradigm for the application of machine learning in quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Seniority-based Subspace Expansion: Linear Combinations of Short-Circuit Unitary Transformations for Efficient Quantum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum SENiority-based Subspace Expansion (Q-SENSE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that interpolates between the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Configuration Interaction (CI) methods. It constructs Hamiltonian matrix elements on a quantum device and solves the resulting eigenvalue problem classically. This seniority-symmetry-based approach reduces one of the primary limitations of VQE on near-term quantum hardware - circuit depth - by exchanging lower circuit complexity for the need to compute additional matrix elements. Unlike other expansion-based methods - such as Quantum Subspace Expansion (QSE), Quantum Krylov Subspace Expansion, and the Non-orthogonal Quantum Eigensolver - Q-SENSE leverages symmetry-induced orthogonality to construct basis states in distinct symmetry sectors. This not only guarantees orthogonality but also reduces the number of Hamiltonian terms that must be measured, as many terms are zero between different symmetry subspaces. By systematically combining symmetry principles with matrix-based techniques, Q-SENSE offers a scalable and resource-efficient potential route to quantum advantage on near-term quantum devices and in the early fault-tolerant regime.</description>

Abstract: The M{\O}D computational framework implements rule-based generative chemistries as explicit transformations of graphs representing chemical structural formulae. Here, we expand M{\O}D by a stochastic simulation module that simulates the time evolution of species concentrations using Gillespie's well-known stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). This module distinguishes itself among competing implementations of rule-based stochastic simulation engines by its flexible network expansion mechanism and its functionality for defining custom reaction rate functions. It enables direct sampling from actual reactions instead of rules. We present methodology and implementation details followed by examples which demonstrate the capabilities of the stochastic simulation engine.</description>

      <title>Phase field simulation of dendrite growth in solid-state lithium batteries based on mechanical-thermo-electrochemical coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state lithium batteries possess numerous advantages, such as high energy density, excellent cycle stability, superior mechanical strength, non-flammability, enhanced safety, and extended service life. These characteristics make them highly suitable for applications in aerospace, new energy vehicles, and portable electronic devices. However, the growth of lithium dendrite at the electrode/electrolyte interface remains a critical challenge, limiting both performance and safety. The growth of lithium dendrites in the electrolyte not only reduces the Coulombic efficiency of the battery but also poses a risk of puncturing the electrolyte, leading to internal short circuits between the anode and cathode. This study is to solve the problem of lithium dendrite growth in solid-state lithium batteries by employing phase-field theory for numerical simulations. A phase-field model is developed by coupling the mechanical stress field, thermal field, and electrochemical field, to investigate the morphology and evolution of lithium dendrites under the condition of different ambient temperatures, external pressures, and their combined effects. The results indicate that higher temperature and greater external pressure significantly suppress lithium dendrite growth, leading to fewer side branches, smoother surfaces, and more uniform electrochemical deposition. Increased external pressure inhibits longitudinal dendrite growth, resulting in a compressed morphology with higher compactness, but at the cost of increased mechanical instability. The combined effect of temperature and pressure exhibits a pronounced inhibitory influence on dendrite growth, with stress concentrating at the dendrite roots. This stress distribution promotes lateral growth, facilitating the formation of flatter and denser lithium deposits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe in detail a mathematical framework in which statistical ensembles of hybrid classical- quantum systems can be properly described. We show how a maximum entropy principle can be applied to derive the microcanonical ensemble of hybrid systems. We investigate its properties, and in particular how the microcanonical ensemble and its marginal classical and quantum ensembles can be defined for arbitrarily small range of energies for the whole system. We show how, in this situations, the ensembles are well defined for a continuum of energy values, unlike the purely quantum microcanonical ensemble, thus proving that hybrid systems translate properties of classical systems to the quantum realm. We also analyze the relation with the hybrid canonical ensemble by considering the microcanonical ensemble of a compound system composed of a hybrid subsystem weakly coupled to a reservoir and computing the marginal ensemble of the hybrid subsystem. Lastly, we apply the theory to the statistics of a toy model, which gives some insight on the different properties presented along the article.</description>

      <title>Medium-range structural order in amorphous arsenic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medium-range order (MRO) is a key structural feature of amorphous materials, but its origin and nature remain elusive. Here, we reveal the MRO in amorphous arsenic (a-As) using advanced atomistic simulations, based on machine-learned potentials derived using automated workflows. Our simulations accurately reproduce the experimental structure factor of a-As, especially the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP), which is a signature of MRO. We compare and contrast the structure of a-As with that of its lighter homologue, red amorphous phosphorus (a-P), identifying the dihedral-angle distribution as a key factor differentiating the MRO in both. The pressure-dependent structural behaviors of a-As and a-P differ as well, which we link to the interplay of ring topology and structural entropy. We finally show that the origin of the FSDP is closely correlated with the size and spatial distribution of voids in the amorphous networks. Our work provides fundamental insights into MRO in an amorphous elemental system, and more widely it illustrates the usefulness of automation for machine-learning-driven atomistic simulations.</description>

Abstract: This work collects the spin-dependent leading-order relativistic and quantum-electrodynamical corrections for the electronic structure of atoms and molecules within the non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics framework. We report the computation of perturbative corrections using an explicitly correlated Gaussian basis set, which allows high-precision computations for few-electron systems. In addition to numerical tests for triplet Be, triplet H$_2$, and triplet H$_3^+$ states and comparison with no-pair Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian energies, numerical results are reported for electronically excited states of the helium dimer, He$_2$, for which the present implementation delivers high-precision magnetic coupling curves necessary for a quantitative understanding of the fine structure of its high-resolution rovibronic spectrum.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Quantum Dynamics of He$_2$ over the b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ Electronic Subspace by including Non-adiabatic, Relativistic and QED Corrections and Couplings</title>

Abstract: Relativistic, quantum electrodynamics, as well as non-adiabatic corrections and couplings, are computed for the b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$ and c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ electronic states of the helium dimer. The underlying Born-Oppenheimer potential energy curves are converged to 1 ppm ($1:10^6$) relative precision using a variational explicitly correlated Gaussian approach. The quantum nuclear motion is computed over the b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ (and B $^1\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-C $^1\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$) 9-(12-)dimensional electronic-spin subspace coupled by non-adiabatic and relativistic (magnetic) interactions. The electron's anomalous magnetic moment is also included; its effect is expected to be visible in high-resolution experiments. The computed rovibronic energy intervals are in excellent agreement with available high-resolution spectroscopy data, including the rovibronic b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-state fine structure. Fine-structure splittings are also predicted for the c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ levels, which have not been fully resolved experimentally, yet.</description>

      <title>Post-collision interaction in the liquid phase: the role of electron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a detailed study of post-collision interaction (PCI) in a liquid medium. We investigate PCI for the Auger KLL electrons of solvated Cl$^-$, K$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$. All three isoelectronic ions exhibit a very similar PCI behavior, which is little affected by changing the solvent from water to methanol or ethanol. The two main factors modifying the PCI interaction in condensed media is the screening of Coulombic interactions, and scattering of the electrons. The experimental results are compared with the predictions of a previously reported semi-classical PCI theory modified to account for screening and scattering. We show that a better agreement with experiment can be obtained by instead modeling scattering using electron transport Monte-Carlo simulations. We suggest that, in turn, PCI experimental data could be used as another experimental constraint to refine the currently insufficiently well-known scattering parameters of low-energy electrons in water, which are crucial in many fields.</description>

      <title>AEGISS -- Atomic orbital and Entropy-based Guided Inference for Space Selection -- A novel semi-automated active space selection workflow for quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a wide range of molecular systems.
  In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum computational frameworks.
  Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research community.</description>

      <title>Double excitations in molecules</title>

Abstract: Double excitations in organic molecules have garnered significant interest as a result of their importance in singlet fission and photophysics. These excitations play a crucial role in understanding the photoexcitation processes in polyenes. To describe photoexcited states with both single and double excitation character, we use a first-principles many-body theory that combines the GW / Bethe-Salpeter equation and the configuration interaction (CI) methods. Specifically, we develop and employ two CI-based methods: screened configuration interaction singles and doubles (scrCISD) and screened configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles (scrCIS(D)), applied to an effective many-body Hamiltonian that incorporates screening. We apply these methods to Thiel's set of molecules, which exhibit excited states predominantly characterized by single excitations with a partial double excitation character. Our results indicate that the scrCISD method systematically underestimates the excitation energies compared to the best theoretical estimates, while the scrCIS(D) method shows good agreement with these estimates. Furthermore, we used the scrCISD method to calculate the binding energies of the dominantly doubly excited correlated triplet pair states, $\mathrm{TT^1}$, in pentacene dimers, finding that the $\mathrm{TT^1}$ binding energies agree well with empirical calculations.</description>

      <title>Intramolecular Singlet Fission Through a Coherently Coupled Excimer-like Intermediate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singlet Fission (SF) into two triplets offers exciting avenues for high-efficiency photovoltaics and optically initializable qubits. While the chemical space of SF chromophores is ever-expanding, the mechanistic details of electronic-nuclear motions that dictate the photophysics are unclear. Rigid SF dimers with well-defined orientations are necessary to decipher such details. Here, using polarization-controlled white-light two-dimensional and pump-probe spectroscopies, we investigate a new class of contorted naphthalenediimide dimers, recently reported to have a favorable intramolecular SF (iSF) pathway. 2D cross-peaks directly identify the two Davydov components of the dimer along with strongly wavelength-dependent TT1 formation kinetics depending on which Davydov component is excited, implicating a coherently coupled intermediate that mediates iSF. Enhanced quantum beats in the TT1 photoproduct suggest that inter-chromophore twisting and ruffling motions drive the ~200 fs evolution towards an excimer-like intermediate and its subsequent ~2 ps relaxation to the TT1 photoproduct. Polarization anisotropy directly tracks electronic motion during these steps and reveals surprisingly minimal electronic reorientation with significant singlet-triplet mixing throughout the nuclear evolution away from the Franck-Condon geometry towards relaxed TT1. The combination of white-light 2DES and polarization anisotropy experiments presented here lends powerful insights for refinement of the existing theoretical models for iSF, and lays the foundation for a broader mechanistic investigation of iSF across various molecular platforms.</description>

      <title>Variations of saturation vapor pressure and evaporation rate of liquids with their vaporization enthalpy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase transition enthalpy of condensed materials can be altered by factors such as electric fields, and such variations in turn affect physical and chemical behaviors including phase equilibrium. However, due to the neglect of non-expansion work, the Clapeyron equation does not account for the effect of changes in phase transition enthalpy on equilibrium. In this paper, by analyzing the electric-field-induced changes in phase transition enthalpy and incorporating the non-expansion work performed on the system, we extended both the Clapeyron and Clausius-Clapeyron equations to explicitly include variations in phase transition enthalpy. Building upon these extensions, analytical expressions for the vapor pressure of liquids and for the total evaporation rate of sessile liquid droplets as functions of the change in vaporization enthalpy have been derived, showing that an approximately 1% decrease in vaporization enthalpy of a liquid can cause an increase of about 20% in its vapor pressure and an almost twofold increase in its evaporation rate. The theoretical predictions by the present equations were compared and found to be in good agreement with the experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo across diverse community codes: The case of water-methane dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to assess the reproducibility of the method, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. These findings demonstrate that, with appropriate choices of algorithmic details, fixed-node DMC is reproducible across diverse community codes-highlighting the maturity and robustness of the method as a tool for open and reliable computational science.</description>

      <title>Oxyfluoride glasses obtained through incorporation of CaF$_2$ into photovoltaic cover glass melts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The glass industry has limited options to mitigate its environmental footprint, and the demand for cover glass to produce photovoltaic panels is increasing. Currently, the majority of this special type of glass is not being recycled, and in this work, we propose to reuse it as raw material to obtain oxyfluoride glasses. The incorporation of CaF$_2$ and the increasing Na$_2$CO$_3$ content resulted in a melting temperature of about 1200$^o$C, significantly lower than in soda-lime glasses, which adds up to the environmental benefits of reusing end-of-life cover glass. The obtained samples show high transparency and thermal stability, allowing the cover glass to make up to 80\% of its weight. XRF analysis was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while XRD and Raman indicated that by adding CaF$_2$, the glass network was depolymerized. In situ XRD as a function of temperature showed the formation of a few crystalline phases in these oxyfluoride samples, evidencing that it can be explored as a matrix to obtain different glass-ceramics. The combination of the glass properties indicates that this method and the resulting material can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the glass industry, by creating new glass or glass-ceramic materials that can be obtained at a reduced temperature compared to the soda-lime glass, while cover glass being the primary raw material could reduce the need to extract minerals from nature.</description>

Abstract: The general, multidimensional barrier crossing problem for diffusive processes under the action of conservative forces is studied with the goal of developing tractable approximations. Particular attention is given to the effect of different statistical interpretations of the stochastic differential equation and to the relation between the approximations and the known, exact solutions to the one-dimensional problem. Beginning with a reasonable, but heuristic, simplifying assumption, a one-dimensional solution to the problem is developed. This is then simplified by introducing further approximations resulting in a sequence of increasingly simple expressions culminating in the classic result of Langer(Ann. Phys. 54, 258 (1969)) and others. The various approximations are tested on two dimensional problems by comparison to simulation results and it is found that the one-dimensional approximations capture most of the non-Arrhenius dependence on the energy barrier which is lost in the Langer approximation while still converging to the latter in the large-barrier limit.</description>
