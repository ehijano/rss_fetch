      <title>Integrated Software/Hardware Execution Models for High-Accuracy Methods in Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective deployment and application of advanced methodologies for quantum chemistry is inherently linked to the optimal usage of emerging and highly diversified computational resources. This paper examines the synergistic utilization of Micron memory technologies and Azure Quantum Element cloud computing in Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) simulations leveraging coupled-cluster (CC) downfolded/effective Hamiltonians based on the double unitary coupled cluster (DUCC) Ansatz. We analyze the performance of the DMRG-DUCC workflow, emphasizing the proper choice of hardware that reflects the numerical overheads associated with specific components of the workflow. We report a hybrid approach that takes advantage of Micron CXL hardware for the memory capacity intensive CC downfolding phase while employing AQE cloud computing for the less resource-intensive DMRG simulations. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the scalable ExaChem suite of electronic simulations conducted on Micron prototype systems.</description>

      <title>SPUS: A Lightweight and Parameter-Efficient Foundation Model for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6 challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems. Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving diverse PDE systems.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Surrogates for Free Energy Computation of Complex Chemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover, Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of biochemistry and materials simulations.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis of large twist ferroelectricity and swirling dislocations in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With its atomically thin structure and intrinsic ferroelectric properties, heterodeformed bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has gained prominence in next-generation non-volatile memory applications. However, studies to date have focused almost exclusively on small heterodeformations, leaving the question of whether ferroelectricity can persist under large heterodeformation entirely unexplored. In this work, we establish the crystallographic origin of ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN configurations heterodeformed relative to high-symmetry configurations such as the AA-stacking and the 21.786789 $\circ$ twisted configuration, using Smith normal form bicrystallography. We then demonstrate out-of-plane ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN across configurations vicinal to both the AA and $\Sigma 7$ stacking. Atomistic simulations reveal that AA-vicinal systems support ferroelectricity under both small twist and small strain, with polarization switching in the latter governed by the deformation of swirling dislocations rather than the straight interface dislocations seen in the former. For $\Sigma 7$-vicinal systems, where reliable interatomic potentials are lacking, we develop a density-functional-theory-informed continuum framework--the bicrystallography-informed frame-invariant multiscale (BFIM) model, which captures out-of-plane ferroelectricity in heterodeformed configurations vicinal to the $\Sigma 7$ stacking. Interface dislocations in these large heterodeformed bilayer configurations exhibit markedly smaller Burgers vectors compared to the interface dislocations in small-twist and small-strain bilayer hBN. The BFIM model reproduces atomistic simulation results and provides a powerful, computationally efficient framework for predicting ferroelectricity in large-unit-cell heterostructures where atomistic simulations are prohibitively expensive.</description>

      <title>Variational approach to open quantum systems with long-range competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competition between short- and long-range interactions underpins many emergent phenomena in nature. Despite rapid progress in their experimental control, computational methods capable of accurately simulating open quantum many-body systems with complex long-ranged interactions at scale remain scarce. Here, we address this limitation by introducing an efficient and scalable approach to dissipative quantum lattices in one and two dimensions, combining matrix product operators and time-dependent variational Monte Carlo. We showcase the versatility, effectiveness, and unique methodological advantages of our algorithm by simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady states of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ lattices with competing algebraically-decaying interactions for as many as $N=200$ sites, revealing the emergence of spatially-modulated magnetic order far from equilibrium. This approach offers promising prospects for advancing our understanding of the complex non-equilibrium properties of a diverse variety of experimentally-realizable quantum systems with long-ranged interactions, including Rydberg atoms, ultracold dipolar molecules, and trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Efficiency of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculations of Dynamic Response Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra, as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based noise attenuation technique to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by up to an order of magnitude, thus potentially saving millions of CPU hours for modeling a single XRTS measurement of matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Walks for Graph Representation Learning in Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Representation Learning (GRL) has emerged as a cornerstone technique for analysing complex, networked data across diverse domains, including biological systems, social networks, and data analysis. Traditional GRL methods often struggle to capture intricate relationships within complex graphs, particularly those exhibiting non-trivial structural properties such as power-law distributions or hierarchical structures. This paper introduces a novel quantum-inspired algorithm for GRL, utilizing hybrid Quantum-Classical Walks to overcome these limitations. Our approach combines the benefits of both quantum and classical dynamics, allowing the walker to simultaneously explore both highly local and far-reaching connections within the graph. Preliminary results for a case study in network community detection shows that this hybrid dynamic enables the algorithm to adapt effectively to complex graph topologies, offering a robust and versatile solution for GRL tasks.</description>

      <title>Accelerating kinetic plasma simulations with machine learning generated initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer aided engineering of multi-time-scale plasma systems which exhibit a quasi-steady state solution are challenging due to the large number of time steps required to reach convergence. Machine learning techniques combined with traditional first-principles simulations and high-performance computing offer many interesting pathways towards resolving this challenge. We consider acceleration of kinetic plasma simulations via machine learning generated initial conditions. The approach is demonstrated through modeling of capacitively coupled plasma discharges relevant to the microelectronics industry. Three models are trained on simulations across a parameter space of device driving frequency and operating pressure. The models incorporate elements of a multi-layer perceptron, principal component analysis, and convolutional neural networks to predict the final time-averaged profiles of ion-density and velocity distribution functions. These data-driven initial condition generators (ICGs) provide a mean speedup of 17.1x in convergence time, when measured using an offline procedure, or a 4.4x speedup with an online procedure, with convolutional neural networks leading to the best performance. The paper also outlines a workflow for continuous data-driven model improvement and simulation speedup, with the aim of generating sufficient data for full device digital twins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states have emerged as a widely used approach to the numerical study of the ground states of non-stoquastic Hamiltonians. However, existing approaches often rely on a priori knowledge of the sign structure or require a separately pre-trained phase network. We introduce a modified stochastic reconfiguration method that effectively uses differing imaginary time steps to evolve the amplitude and phase. Using a larger time step for phase optimization, this method enables a simultaneous and efficient training of phase and amplitude neural networks. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated on the Heisenberg J_1-J_2 model.</description>

Abstract: The availability of open-source molecular simulation software packages allows scientists and engineers to focus on running and analyzing simulations without having to write, parallelize, and validate their own simulation software. While molecular simulations thus become accessible to a larger audience, the `black box' nature of such software packages and wide array of options and features can make it challenging to use them correctly, particularly for beginners in the topic of MD simulations. LAMMPS is one such versatile molecular simulation code, designed for modeling particle-based systems across a broad range of materials science and computational chemistry applications, including atomistic, coarse-grained, mesoscale, grid-free continuum, and discrete element models. LAMMPS is capable of efficiently running simulations of varying sizes from small desktop computers to large-scale supercomputing environments. Its flexibility and extensibility make it ideal for complex and extensive simulations of atomic and molecular systems, and beyond. This article introduces a suite of tutorials designed to make learning LAMMPS more accessible to new users. The first four tutorials cover the basics of running molecular simulations in LAMMPS with systems of varying complexities. The second four tutorials address more advanced molecular simulation techniques, specifically the use of a reactive force field, grand canonical Monte Carlo, enhanced sampling, and the REACTER protocol. In addition, we introduce LAMMPS-GUI, an enhanced cross-platform graphical text editor specifically designed for use with LAMMPS and able to run LAMMPS directly on the edited input. LAMMPS-GUI is used as the primary tool in the tutorials to edit inputs, run LAMMPS, extract data, and visualize the simulated systems.</description>

      <title>PCG-Informed Neural Solvers for High-Resolution Homogenization of Periodic Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of periodic microstructures are pivotal in various engineering applications. Homogenization theory is a powerful tool for predicting these properties by averaging the behavior of complex microstructures over a representative volume element. However, traditional numerical solvers for homogenization problems can be computationally expensive, especially for high-resolution and complicated topology and geometry. Existing learning-based methods, while promising, often struggle with accuracy and generalization in such scenarios. To address these challenges, we present CGINS, a preconditioned-conjugate-gradient-solver-informed neural network for solving homogenization problems. CGINS leverages sparse and periodic 3D convolution to enable high-resolution learning while ensuring structural periodicity. It features a multi-level network architecture that facilitates effective learning across different scales and employs minimum potential energy as label-free loss functions for self-supervised learning. The integrated preconditioned conjugate gradient iterations ensure that the network provides PCG-friendly initial solutions for fast convergence and high accuracy. Additionally, CGINS imposes a global displacement constraint to ensure physical consistency, addressing a key limitation in prior methods that rely on Dirichlet anchors. Evaluated on large-scale datasets with diverse topologies and material configurations, CGINS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (relative error below 1%) and outperforms both learning-based baselines and GPU-accelerated numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers 2 times to 10 times speedups over traditional methods while maintaining physically reliable predictions at resolutions up to $512^3$.</description>

      <title>Accurate ab initio modeling of solid solution strengthening in high entropy alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High entropy alloys (HEA) represent a class of materials with promising properties, such as high strength and ductility, radiation damage tolerance, etc. At the same time, a combinatorially large variety of compositions and a complex structure render them quite hard to study using conventional methods. In this work, we present a computationally efficient methodology based on ab initio calculations within the coherent potential approximation. To make the methodology predictive, we apply an exchange-correlation correction to the equation of state and take into account thermal effects on the magnetic state and the equilibrium volume. The approach shows good agreement with available experimental data on bulk properties of solid solutions. As a particular case, the workflow is applied to a series of iron-group HEA to investigate their solid solution strengthening within a parameter-free model based on the effective medium representation of an alloy. The results reveal intricate interactions between alloy components, which we analyze by means of a simple model of local bonding. Thanks to its computational efficiency, the methodology can be used as a basis for an adaptive learning workflow for optimal design of HEA.</description>

      <title>The emergent dynamics of double-folded randomly branching ring polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The statistics of randomly branching double-folded ring polymers are relevant to the secondary structure of RNA, the large-scale branching of plectonemic DNA (and thus bacterial chromosomes), the conformations of single-ring polymers migrating through an array of obstacles, as well as to the conformational statistics of eukaryotic chromosomes and melts of crumpled, non-concatenated ring polymers. Double-folded rings fall into different dynamical universality classes depending on whether the random tree-like graphs underlying the double-folding are quenched or annealed, and whether the trees can undergo unhindered Brownian motion in their spatial embedding. Locally, one can distinguish (i) repton-like mass transport around a fixed tree, (ii) the spontaneous creation and deletion of side branches, and (iii) displacements of tree node, where complementary ring segments diffuse together in space. Here we employ dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of a suitable elastic lattice polymer model of double-folded, randomly branching ring polymers to explore the mesoscopic dynamics that emerge from different combinations of the above local modes in three different systems: ideal non-interacting rings, self-avoiding rings, and rings in the melt state. We observe the expected scaling regimes for ring reptation, the dynamics of double-folded rings in an array of obstacles, and Rouse-like tree dynamics as limiting cases. Of particular interest, the monomer mean-square displacements of $g_1\sim t^{0.4}$ observed for crumpled rings with $\nu=1/3$ are similar to the subdiffusive regime observed in bacterial chromosomes. In our analysis, we focus on the question to which extent contributions of different local dynamical modes to the emergent dynamics are simply additive. Notably, we reveal a non-trivial acceleration of the dynamics of interacting rings, when all three types of local motion are present.</description>

Abstract: We propose a straightforward and highly accurate method for extracting material parameters such as screening length, bandgap energy, exciton reduced mass, and the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium from experimental magnetoexciton energies available for monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Our approach relies on analytical formulations that allow us to calculate the screening length $r_0$ and bandgap energy $E_g$ directly from the experimental $s$-state exciton energies $E_{1s}$, $E_{2s}$, and $E_{3s}$. We also establish a relationship between the surrounding dielectric constant $\kappa$ and the exciton reduced mass $\mu$. This relationship simplifies the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for a magnetoexciton in a TMDC monolayer, transforming it into a one-parameter equation that depends solely on the single material parameter $\mu$. Furthermore, we develop an analytical formula with high accuracy for magnetoexciton energies as a function of the exciton reduced mass: $E(B,\mu)$. Then, the inverse of this formula allows us to calculate the exciton reduced mass from experimental data on magnetoexciton energies. By applying this method, we extract key material parameters, $E_g$, $r_0$, $\mu$, and $\kappa$, from the magnetoexciton energies of monolayer TMDCs, including WSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoS$_2$, encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slabs in various current experiments. The material properties we retrieve complement and correct existing experimental and theoretical data. Additionally, we develop an analytical method for calculating diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii with high accuracy compared to numerical calculations. Based on this method, we provide diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii computed using the extracted material parameters.</description>

      <title>Learning Beyond Experience: Generalizing to Unseen State Space with Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors -- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing -- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system behavior in entirely unobserved basins.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing phase transitions through time scale entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial entanglement of wave functions has matured into an enthralling and very active research area. Here, we unearth a completely different kind of entanglement, the entanglement between different time scales. This is feasible through quantics tensor train diagnostics (QTTD), wherein the bond dimension for an $n$-particle correlation function allows diagnosing the temporal entanglement. As examples, we study time-scale entanglement of the Hubbard dimer, the four-site Hubbard ring with and without next-nearest neighbor hopping and the single-impurity Anderson model. Besides introducing the QTTD method, our major finding is that the time-scale entanglement is generically maximal at phase transitions and crossovers. This is independent of the correlation function studied. Thus, QTTD is a universal tool for detecting quantum phase transitions, ground state crossings in finite systems, and thermal crossovers.</description>

      <title>Chase Orbits, not Time: A Scalable Paradigm for Long-Duration Eccentric Gravitational-Wave Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00116</link>

Abstract: Surrogate modeling of eccentric binary black hole waveforms has remained challenging. The complicated morphology of these waveforms due to the eccentric orbital timescale variations makes it difficult to construct accurate and efficient surrogate models, especially for waveforms long enough to cover the sensitivity band of the current ground-based gravitational wave detectors. We present a novel and scalable surrogate building technique which makes surrogate modeling of long-duration eccentric binary black hole waveforms both feasible and highly efficient. The technique aims to simplify the harmonic content of the intermediate eccentric surrogate data pieces by modeling them in terms of an angular orbital element called the mean anomaly, instead of time. We show that this novel parameterization yields an order of magnitude fewer surrogate basis functions than using the contemporary parameterization in terms of time. We show that variations in surrogate data-pieces across parameter space become much more regular when expressed in terms of the instantaneous waveform eccentricity and mean anomaly, greatly easing their parameter-space fitting. The methods presented in this work make it feasible to build long-duration eccentric surrogates for the current as well as future third-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>
