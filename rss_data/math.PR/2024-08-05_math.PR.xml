      <title>Sandwiching Random Geometric Graphs and Erdos-Renyi with Applications: Sharp Thresholds, Robust Testing, and Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution $\mathsf{RGG}(n,\mathbb{S}^{d-1},p)$ is formed by sampling independent vectors $\{V_i\}_{i = 1}^n$ uniformly on $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ and placing an edge between pairs of vertices $i$ and $j$ for which $\langle V_i,V_j\rangle \ge \tau^p_d,$ where $\tau^p_d$ is such that the expected density is $p.$ Our main result is a poly-time implementable coupling between Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and $\mathsf{RGG}$ such that $\mathsf{G}(n,p(1 - \tilde{O}(\sqrt{np/d})))\subseteq \mathsf{RGG}(n,\mathbb{S}^{d-1},p)\subseteq \mathsf{G}(n,p(1 + \tilde{O}(\sqrt{np/d})))$ edgewise with high probability when $d\gg np.$ We apply the result to: 1) Sharp Thresholds: We show that for any monotone property having a sharp threshold with respect to the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi distribution and critical probability $p^c_n,$ random geometric graphs also exhibit a sharp threshold when $d\gg np^c_n,$ thus partially answering a question of Perkins. 2) Robust Testing: The coupling shows that testing between $\mathsf{G}(n,p)$ and $\mathsf{RGG}(n,\mathbb{S}^{d-1},p)$ with $\epsilon n^2p$ adversarially corrupted edges for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ is information-theoretically impossible when $d\gg np.$ We match this lower bound with an efficient (constant degree SoS) spectral refutation algorithm when $d\ll np.$ 3) Enumeration: We show that the number of geometric graphs in dimension $d$ is at least $\exp(dn\log^{-7}n)$, recovering (up to the log factors) the sharp result of Sauermann.</description>

      <title>Joint tail of randomly weighted sums under generalized quasi asymptotic independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we revisited the classical problem of max-sum equivalence of randomly (weighted) sums in two dimensions. In opposite to the most papers in leterature, we consider that there exist some inderdependence between the primary random variables, which is achieved by a combination of a new dependence structure with some two-dimensional heavy-tailed classes of distributions. Further we introduce a new approach in two-dimensional regular varying distributions, and we study some closure properties of this, and of other two-dimensional classes. Our results contain the finite-time ruin probability in a two-dimensional discrete time risk model.</description>

      <title>Renewal and Regenerative Processes: short review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document presents a compilation of results related to the theory of stochastic processes, with a specific focus on Markov processes, regenerative processes, renewal processes, and stationary processes. The relevance of these topics lies in the ability to identify regeneration points and the necessary conditions to ensure the stationarity of the process. The study begins with a review of Markov chains and continues with the analysis of processes that satisfy the strong Markov property. Subsequently, it delves into renewal processes, regenerative processes, and finally, stationary regenerative processes, highlighting the results presented by Thorisson [22]. This work is not intended to be exhaustive but aims to provide a solid foundation for further deepening the knowledge of these processes, given their broad range of applications in cryptography [16], queueing theory [15], and Monte Carlo methods [23]. Additionally, the importance of Poisson-type processes is emphasized due to their numerous applications (see [8]).</description>

      <title>Covariance Identities and Variance Bounds for Infinitely Divisible Random Variables and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish a general covariance identity for infinitely divisible distributions (IDD). Using this result, we derive Cacoullos type variance bounds for the IDD. Applications to some important distributions are discussed, in addition to the computation of variance bounds for certain posterior distributions. As another application, we derive the Stein-type identity for the IDD, which involves the L'evy measure. This result in turn is used to derive the Stein-type identity for the CGMY distributions and the variance-gamma distributions (VGD). This approach, especially for the VGD is new and simpler, compared to the ones available in the literature. Finally, as another nontrivial application, we apply the covariance identity in deriving known and some new formulas for the weighted premium calculation principles (WPCP) and Gini coefficient for the IDD.</description>

      <title>A quantitative central limit theorem for the simple symmetric exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantitative central limit theorem for the simple symmetric exclusion process (SSEP) on a $d$-dimensional discrete torus is proven. The argument is based on a comparison of the generators of the density fluctuation field of the SSEP and the generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, as well as on an infinite-dimensional Berry-Essen bound for the initial particle fluctuations. The obtained rate of convergence is optimal.</description>

      <title>Rumour Spreading Depends on the Latent Geometry and Degree Distribution in Social Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study push-pull rumour spreading in small-world models for social networks where the degrees follow a power-law. In a non-geometric setting Fountoulakis, Panagiotou and Sauerwald have shown that rumours always spread fast (SODA 2012). On the other hand, Janssen and Mehrabian have found that rumours spread slowly in a spatial preferential attachment model (SIDMA 2017). We study the question systematically for the model of geometric inhomogeneous random graphs (GIRGs), which has been found to be a good theoretical and empirical fit for social networks. Our result is two-fold: with classical Euclidean geometry both slow and fast rumour spreading may occur, depending on the exponent of the power law and the prevalence of weak ties in the networks, and we fully characterise the phase boundaries between those two regimes. Depending on the parameters, fast spreading may either mean polylogarithmic time or even doubly logarithmic time. Secondly, we show that rumour spreading is always fast in a non-metric geometry. The considered non-metric geometry allows to model social connections where resemblance of vertices in a single attribute, such as familial kinship, already strongly indicates the presence of an edge. Classical Euclidean Geometry fails to capture such ties.
  For some regimes in the Euclidean setting, the efficient pathways for spreading rumours differ from previously identified paths. A vertex of degree $d$ can transmit the rumour efficiently to a vertex of larger degree by a chain of length $3$, where one of the two intermediaries has constant degree, and the other has degree $d^{c}$ for some constant $c&lt;1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider stochastic two-phase Stefan problem driven by general jump L\'evy noise. We first obtain the existence and uniqueness of the strong solution and then establish the ergodicity of the stochastic Stefan problem. Moreover, we give a precise characterization of the support of the invariant measures which provides the regularities of the stationary solutions of the stochastic free boundary problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The binary perceptron problem asks us to find a sign vector in the intersection of independently chosen random halfspaces with intercept $-\kappa$. We analyze the performance of the canonical discrepancy minimization algorithms of Lovett-Meka and Rothvoss/Eldan-Singh for the asymmetric binary perceptron problem. We obtain new algorithmic results in the $\kappa = 0$ case and in the large-$|\kappa|$ case. In the $\kappa\to-\infty$ case, we additionally characterize the storage capacity and complement our algorithmic results with an almost-matching overlap-gap lower bound.</description>

      <title>Generalisation of Total Uncertainty in AI: A Theoretical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI has been dealing with uncertainty to have highly accurate results. This becomes even worse with reasonably small data sets or a variation in the data sets. This has far-reaching effects on decision-making, forecasting and learning mechanisms. This study seeks to unpack the nature of uncertainty that exists within AI by drawing ideas from established works, the latest developments and practical applications and provide a novel total uncertainty definition in AI.
  From inception theories up to current methodologies, this paper provides an integrated view of dealing with better total uncertainty as well as complexities of uncertainty in AI that help us understand its meaning and value across different domains.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of a fully discrete scheme for stochastic Burgers equation with fractional-type noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate numerical approximations for the stochastic Burgers equation driven by an additive cylindrical fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H \in (\frac{1}{2}, 1)$. To discretize the continuous problem in space, a spectral Galerkin method is employed, followed by the presentation of a nonlinear-tamed accelerated exponential Euler method to yield a fully discrete scheme. By showing the exponential integrability of the stochastic convolution of the fractional Brownian motion, we present the boundedness of moments of semi-discrete and full-discrete approximations. Building upon these results and the convergence of the fully discrete scheme in probability proved by a stopping time technique, we derive the strong convergence of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Universality of kernel random matrices and kernel regression in the quadratic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a popular class of machine learning models that has become an important tool for understanding deep learning. Much of the focus has been on studying the proportional asymptotic regime, $n \asymp d$, where $n$ is the number of training samples and $d$ is the dimension of the dataset. In this regime, under certain conditions on the data distribution, the kernel random matrix involved in KRR exhibits behavior akin to that of a linear kernel. In this work, we extend the study of kernel regression to the quadratic asymptotic regime, where $n \asymp d^2$. In this regime, we demonstrate that a broad class of inner-product kernels exhibit behavior similar to a quadratic kernel. Specifically, we establish an operator norm approximation bound for the difference between the original kernel random matrix and a quadratic kernel random matrix with additional correction terms compared to the Taylor expansion of the kernel functions. The approximation works for general data distributions under a Gaussian-moment-matching assumption with a covariance structure. This new approximation is utilized to obtain a limiting spectral distribution of the original kernel matrix and characterize the precise asymptotic training and generalization errors for KRR in the quadratic regime when $n/d^2$ converges to a non-zero constant. The generalization errors are obtained for both deterministic and random teacher models. Our proof techniques combine moment methods, Wick's formula, orthogonal polynomials, and resolvent analysis of random matrices with correlated entries.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximations of McKean Anticipative Backward Stochastic Differential Equations arising in Initial Margin requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of anticipative backward stochastic differential equations with a dependence of McKean type on the law of the solution, that we name MKABSDE. We provide existence and uniqueness results in a general framework with relatively general regularity assumptions on the coefficients. We show how such stochastic equations arise within the modern paradigm of derivative pricing where a central counterparty (CCP) requires the members to deposit variation and initial margins to cover their exposure. In the case when the initial margin is proportional to the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of the contract price, we apply our general result to define the price as a solution of a MKABSDE. We provide several linear and non-linear simpler approximations, which we solve using different numerical (deterministic and Monte-Carlo) methods.</description>

      <title>The random timestep Euler method and its continuous dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ODE solvers with randomly sampled timestep sizes appear in the context of chaotic dynamical systems, differential equations with low regularity, and, implicitly, in stochastic optimisation. In this work, we propose and study the stochastic Euler dynamics - a continuous-time Markov process that is equivalent to a linear spline interpolation of a random timestep (forward) Euler method. We understand the stochastic Euler dynamics as a path-valued ansatz for the ODE solution that shall be approximated. We first obtain qualitative insights by studying deterministic Euler dynamics which we derive through a first order approximation to the infinitesimal generator of the stochastic Euler dynamics. Then we show convergence of the stochastic Euler dynamics to the ODE solution by studying the associated infinitesimal generators and by a novel local truncation error analysis. Next we prove stability by an immediate analysis of the random timestep Euler method and by deriving Foster-Lyapunov criteria for the stochastic Euler dynamics; the latter also yield bounds on the speed of convergence to stationarity. The paper ends with a discussion of second-order stochastic Euler dynamics and a series of numerical experiments that appear to verify our analytical results.</description>

Abstract: We consider a branching random walk in time-inhomogeneous random environment, in which all particles at generation $k$ branch into the same random number of particles $\mathcal{L}_{k+1}\ge 2$, where the $\mathcal{L}_k$, $k\in\mathbb{N}$, are i.i.d., and the increments are standard normal. Let $\mathbb{P}$ denote the law of $(\mathcal{L}_k)_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$, and let $M_n$ denote the position of the maximal particle in generation $n$. We prove that there are $m_n$, which are functions of only $(\mathcal{L}_k)_{k\in\{0,\dots, n\}}$, such that (with regard to $\mathbb{P}$) the sequence $(M_n-m_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is tight with high probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For finite interacting particle systems with strong repulsing-attracting or general interactions, we prove global weak well-posedness almost up to the critical threshold of the strengths of attracting interactions (independent of the number of particles), and establish other regularity results, such as a heat kernel bound in the regions where strongly attracting particles are close to each other. Our main analytic instruments are a variant of De Giorgi's method in $L^p$ with appropriately chosen large $p$, and an abstract desingularization theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the asymptotic fluctuations of linear eigenvalue statistics of random centrosymmetric matrices with i.i.d. entries. We prove that for a complex analytic test function, the centered and normalized linear eigenvalue statistics of random centrosymmetric matrices converge to a normal distribution. We find the exact expression of the variance of the limiting normal distribution via combinatorial arguments. Moreover, we also argue that the limiting spectral distribution of properly scaled centrosymmetric matrices follows the circular law.</description>

      <title>On Exponential Convergence of Random Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the discrete-time sequence of nonnegative random variables, general dependencies between the exponential convergence of the expectations, exponential convergence of the trajectories and the logarithmic growth of the corresponding expected hitting times are analysed. The applications are presented: the general results are applied to the areas of optimization, stochastic control and estimation.</description>

      <title>On quantitative convergence for stochastic processes: Crossings, fluctuations and martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for extracting highly uniform bounds on local stability for stochastic processes in terms of information on fluctuations or crossings. This includes a large class of martingales: As a corollary of our main abstract result, we obtain a quantitative version of Doob's convergence theorem for $L_1$-sub- and supermartingales, but more importantly, demonstrate that our framework readily extends to more complex stochastic processes such as almost-supermartingales, thus paving the way for future applications in stochastic optimization. Fundamental to our approach is the use of ideas from logic, particularly a careful analysis of the quantifier structure of probabilistic statements and the introduction of a number of abstract notions that represent stochastic convergence in a quantitative manner. In this sense, our work falls under the 'proof mining' program, and indeed, our quantitative results provide new examples of the phenomenon, recently made precise by the first author and Pischke, that many proofs in probability theory are proof-theoretically tame, and amenable to the extraction of quantitative data that is both of low complexity and independent of the underlying probability space.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits for supercritical nearly unstable Hawkes processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of nearly unstable Hawkes processes whose regression kernel has $L^1$ norm strictly greater than one and close to one as time goes to infinity. We find that,the scaling size determines the scaling behavior of the processes like in \cite{MR3313750}. Specifically,after suitable rescaling, the limit of the sequence of Hawkes processes is deterministic.And also with another appropriate rescaling, the sequence converges in law to an integrated Cox Ingersoll Ross like process. This theoretical result may apply to model the recent COVID19 in epidemiology and in social network.</description>
