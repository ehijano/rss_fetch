      <title>SynthAorta: A 3D Mesh Dataset of Parametrized Physiological Healthy Aortas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of the aortic geometry on its mechanics and blood flow, and subsequently on aortic pathologies, remain largely unexplored. The main obstacle lies in obtaining patient-specific aorta models, an extremely difficult procedure in terms of ethics and availability, segmentation, mesh generation, and all of the accompanying processes. Contrastingly, idealized models are easy to build but do not faithfully represent patient-specific variability. Additionally, a unified aortic parametrization in clinic and engineering has not yet been achieved. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new set of statistical parameters to generate synthetic models of the aorta. The parameters possess geometric significance and fall within physiological ranges, effectively bridging the disciplines of clinical medicine and engineering. Smoothly blended realistic representations are recovered with convolution surfaces. These enable high-quality visualization and biological appearance, whereas the structured mesh generation paves the way for numerical simulations. The only requirement of the approach is one patient-specific aorta model and the statistical data for parameter values obtained from the literature. The output of this work is SynthAorta, a dataset of ready-to-use synthetic, physiological aorta models, each containing a centerline, surface representation, and a structured hexahedral finite element mesh. The meshes are structured and fully consistent between different cases, making them imminently suitable for reduced order modeling and machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>A Low-Field Magnetic Resonance Signal Transmission and Reception Processing Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the spectrometer is a fundamental component of MRI systems, responsible for the transmission of radiofrequency (RF) pulses that excite hydrogen nuclei and the subsequent acquisition of MR signals for processing. However, detailed knowledge about this component remains largely inaccessible due to the proprietary nature of commercial systems. To address this gap, we present an FPGA-based platform specifically designed for MRI signal transmission and reception in low-field MRI applications. Additionally, with appropriate chip replacements, this platform can be adapted for use in mid- and high-field MRI systems. This platform leverages Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) technology to generate RF pulses, offering the flexibility to quickly and precisely adjust soft pulse parameters to meet the specific requirements of the MRI system. Additionally, the platform processes MRI signals through digital downconversion techniques and utilizes CIC and FIR filters to obtain baseband signals. Experimental testing of this platform has yielded promising results. We hope that this work will inspire further research and development in the field of MRI spectrometer design. Furthermore, it is worth noting that with the replacement of relevant chips, this system can also be adapted for use in mid- and high-field MRI systems.</description>

      <title>Optically-Validated Microvascular Phantom for Super-Resolution Ultrasound Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution ultrasound (SRUS) visualises microvasculature beyond the ultrasound diffraction limit (wavelength($\lambda$)/2) by localising and tracking spatially isolated microbubble contrast agents. SRUS phantoms typically consist of simple tube structures, where diameter channels below 100 $\mu$m are not available. Furthermore, these phantoms are generally fragile and unstable, have limited ground truth validation, and their simple structure limits the evaluation of SRUS algorithms. To aid SRUS development, robust and durable phantoms with known and physiologically relevant microvasculature are needed for repeatable SRUS testing. This work proposes a method to fabricate durable microvascular phantoms that allow optical gauging for SRUS validation. The methodology used a microvasculature negative print embedded in a Polydimethylsiloxane to fabricate a microvascular phantom. Branching microvascular phantoms with variable microvascular density were demonstrated with optically validated vessel diameters down to $\sim$ 60 $\mu$m ($\lambda$/5.8; $\lambda$ =$\sim$ 350 $\mu$m). SRUS imaging was performed and validated with optical measurements. The average SRUS error was 15.61 $\mu$m ($\lambda$/22) with a standard deviation error of 11.44 $\mu$m. The average error decreased to 7.93 $\mu$m ($\lambda$/44) once the number of localised microbubbles surpassed 1000 per estimated diameter. In addition, the less than 10$\%$ variance of acoustic and optical properties and the mechanical toughness of the phantoms measured a year after fabrication demonstrated their long-term durability. This work presents a method to fabricate durable and optically validated complex microvascular phantoms which can be used to quantify SRUS performance and facilitate its further development.</description>

      <title>Identifying Human Indoor Daily Life Behavior employing Thermal Sensor Arrays (TSAs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Daily activity monitoring systems used in households provide vital information for health status, particularly with aging residents. Multiple approaches have been introduced to achieve such goals, typically obtrusive and non-obtrusive. Amongst the obtrusive approaches are the wearable devices, and among the non-obtrusive approaches are the movement detection systems, including motion sensors and thermal sensor arrays (TSAs). TSA systems are advantageous when preserving a person's privacy and picking his precise spatial location. In this study, human daily living activities were monitored day and night, constructing the corresponding activity time series and spatial probability distribution and employing a TSA system. The monitored activities are classified into two categories: sleeping and daily activity. Results showed the possibility of distinguishing between classes regardless of day and night. The obtained sleep activity duration was compared with previous research using the same raw data. Results showed that the duration of sleep activity, on average, was 9 hours/day, and daily life activity was 7 hours/day. The person's spatial probability distribution was determined using the bivariate distribution for the monitored location. In conclusion, the results showed that sleeping activity was dominant. Our study showed that TSAs were the optimum choice when monitoring human activity. Our proposed approach tackled limitations encountered by previous human activity monitoring systems, such as preserving human privacy while knowing his precise spatial location.</description>

      <title>Joint image reconstruction and segmentation of real-time cardiac MRI in free-breathing using a model based on disentangled representation learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A joint image reconstruction and segmentation approach based on disentangled representation learning was trained to enable cardiac cine MR imaging in real-time and under free-breathing. An exploratory feasibility study tested the proposed method in undersampled real-time acquisitions based on an in-house developed spiral bSSFP pulse sequence in eight healthy participants and five patients with intermittent atrial fibrillation. Images and predicted LV segmentations were compared to the reference standard of ECG-gated segmented Cartesian cine in repeated breath-holds and corresponding manual segmentation. On a 5-point Likert scale, image quality of the real-time breath-hold approach and Cartesian cine was comparable in healthy participants (RT-BH: 1.99 $\pm$ .98, Cartesian: 1.94 $\pm$ .86, p=.052), but slightly inferior in free-breathing (RT-FB: 2.40 $\pm$ .98, p&lt;.001). In patients with arrhythmia, image quality from both real-time approaches was favourable (RT-BH: 2.10 $\pm$ 1.28, p&lt;.001, RT-FB: 2.40 $\pm$ 1.13, p&lt;.001, Cartesian: 2.68 $\pm$ 1.13). Intra-observer reliability was good (ICC=.77, 95%-confidence interval [.75, .79], p&lt;.001). In functional analysis, a positive bias was observed for ejection fractions derived from the proposed model compared to the clinical reference standard (RT-BH mean EF: 58.5 $\pm$ 5.6%, bias: +3.47%, 95%-confidence interval [-.86, 7.79%], RT-FB mean: 57.9 $\pm$ 10.6%, bias: +1.45%, [-3.02, 5.91%], Cartesian mean: 54.9 $\pm$ 6.7%). The introduced real-time MR imaging technique is capable of acquiring high-quality cardiac cine data in 1-2 minutes without the need for ECG gating and breath-holds. It thus offers a promising alternative to the current clinical practice of segmented acquisition, with shorter scan times, higher patient comfort and increased robustness to arrhythmia and patient incompliance.</description>
