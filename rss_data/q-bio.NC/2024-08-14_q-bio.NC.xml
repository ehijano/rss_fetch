      <title>A CRH Theory of Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a complete theory of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), explaining its etiology, symptoms, and pathology. The core cause of ASD is excessive stress-induced postnatal release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). CRH competes with urocortins for binding to the CRH2 receptor, impairing their essential function in the utilization of glucose for growth. This results in impaired development of all brain areas depending on CRH2, including areas that are central in social development and eye gaze learning, and low-level sensory areas. Excessive CRH also induces excessive release of adrenal androgens (mainly DHEA), which impairs the long-term plasticity function of gonadal steroids. I show that these two effects can explain all of the known symptoms and properties of ASD. The theory is supported by strong diverse evidence, and points to very early detection biomarkers and preventive pharmaceutical treatments, one of which seems to be very promising.</description>

      <title>A Dynorphin Theory of Depression and Bipolar Disorder</title>

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating health condition affecting a substantial part of the world's population. At present, there is no biological theory of MDD, and treatment is partial at best. Here I present a theory of MDD that explains its etiology, symptoms, pathophysiology, and treatment. MDD involves stressful life events that the person does not manage to resolve. In this situation animals normally execute a 'disengage' survival response. In MDD, this response is chronically executed, leading to depressed mood and the somatic MDD symptoms. To explain the biological mechanisms involved, I present a novel theory of opioids, where each opioid mediates one of the basic survival responses. The opioid mediating 'disengage' is dynorphin. The paper presents strong evidence for chronic dynorphin signaling in MDD and for its causal role in the disorder. The theory also explains bipolar disorder, and the mechanisms behind the treatment of both disorders.</description>

      <title>A Sympathetic Nervous System Theory of Migraine</title>

Abstract: Migraine (MGR) ranks first among diseases in terms of years of lost healthy life in young adult and adult women. Currently, there is no theory of MGR. This paper presents a complete theory of migraine that explains its etiology, symptoms, pathology, and treatment. Migraine involves partially saturated (usually chronically high) sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, mainly due to higher sensitivity of the metabolic sensors that recruit it. MGR headache occurs when SNS activity is desensitized or excessive, resulting in hyperexcitability of baroreceptors, oxidative stress, and activation of pain pathways via TRPV1 channels and CGRP. The theory is supported by overwhelming evidence, and explains the properties of current MGR treatments.</description>

      <title>A Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA) Theory of Schizophrenia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a theory of schizophrenia (SZ) that mechanistically explains its etiology, symptoms, pathophysiology, and treatment. SZ involves the chronic release of membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their utilization for the synthesis of stress-induced plasticity agents such as endocannabinoids (ECBs). The causal event in SZ is prolonged stress during a sensitive period, which can induce prolonged and heritable changes. The physiological effect of the released PUFAs and their products is to disconnect neurons from their inputs and promote intrinsic excitability. I show that these effects can explain the positive, negative, cognitive, and mood symptoms of SZ, as well as the mechanisms of many known triggers of psychosis. The theory is supported by overwhelming evidence addressing lipids, immunity, ECBs, neuromodulators, hormones, neurotransmitters, and cortical parameters in SZ. It explains why antipsychotic drugs are effective against positive symptoms, and why they do not affect the other symptoms. Finally, I present promising treatment directions implied by the theory, including some that are immediately available.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Wasserstein unsupervised alignment reveals structural correspondences between the color similarity structures of humans and large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04381</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the General Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), have shown remarkable performance in various cognitive tasks. However, it remains unclear whether these models have the ability to accurately infer human perceptual representations. Previous research has addressed this question by quantifying correlations between similarity response patterns of humans and LLMs. Correlation provides a measure of similarity, but it relies pre-defined item labels and does not distinguish category- and item- level similarity, falling short of characterizing detailed structural correspondence between humans and LLMs. To assess their structural equivalence in more detail, we propose the use of an unsupervised alignment method based on Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport (GWOT). GWOT allows for the comparison of similarity structures without relying on pre-defined label correspondences and can reveal fine-grained structural similarities and differences that may not be detected by simple correlation analysis. Using a large dataset of similarity judgments of 93 colors, we compared the color similarity structures of humans (color-neurotypical and color-atypical participants) and two GPT models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4). Our results show that the similarity structure of color-neurotypical participants can be remarkably well aligned with that of GPT-4 and, to a lesser extent, to that of GPT-3.5. These results contribute to the methodological advancements of comparing LLMs with human perception, and highlight the potential of unsupervised alignment methods to reveal detailed structural correspondences.

      <title>BrainFounder: Towards Brain Foundation Models for Neuroimage Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning field of brain health research increasingly leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret and analyze neurological data. This study introduces a novel approach towards the creation of medical foundation models by integrating a large-scale multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset derived from 41,400 participants in its own. Our method involves a novel two-stage pretraining approach using vision transformers. The first stage is dedicated to encoding anatomical structures in generally healthy brains, identifying key features such as shapes and sizes of different brain regions. The second stage concentrates on spatial information, encompassing aspects like location and the relative positioning of brain structures. We rigorously evaluate our model, BrainFounder, using the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge and Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke v2.0 (ATLAS v2.0) datasets. BrainFounder demonstrates a significant performance gain, surpassing the achievements of the previous winning solutions using fully supervised learning. Our findings underscore the impact of scaling up both the complexity of the model and the volume of unlabeled training data derived from generally healthy brains, which enhances the accuracy and predictive capabilities of the model in complex neuroimaging tasks with MRI. The implications of this research provide transformative insights and practical applications in healthcare and make substantial steps towards the creation of foundation models for Medical AI.
