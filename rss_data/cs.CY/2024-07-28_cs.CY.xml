      <title>The Structure of Financial Equity Research Reports -- Identification of the Most Frequently Asked Questions in Financial Analyst Reports to Automate Equity Research Using Llama 3 and GPT-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research dissects financial equity research reports (ERRs) by mapping their content into categories.
  There is insufficient empirical analysis of the questions answered in ERRs. In particular, it is not understood how frequently certain information appears, what information is considered essential, and what information requires human judgment to distill into an ERR.
  The study analyzes 72 ERRs sentence-by-sentence, classifying their 4940 sentences into 169 unique question archetypes. We did not predefine the questions but derived them solely from the statements in the ERRs. This approach provides an unbiased view of the content of the observed ERRs. Subsequently, we used public corporate reports to classify the questions' potential for automation. Answers were labeled "text-extractable" if the answers to the question were accessible in corporate reports.
  78.7% of the questions in ERRs can be automated. Those automatable question consist of 48.2% text-extractable (suited to processing by large language models, LLMs) and 30.5% database-extractable questions. Only 21.3% of questions require human judgment to answer.
  We empirically validate using Llama-3-70B and GPT-4-turbo-2024-04-09 that recent advances in language generation and information extraction enable the automation of approximately 80% of the statements in ERRs. Surprisingly, the models complement each other's strengths and weaknesses well.
  The research confirms that the current writing process of ERRs can likely benefit from additional automation, improving quality and efficiency. The research thus allows us to quantify the potential impacts of introducing large language models in the ERR writing process.
  The full question list, including the archetypes and their frequency, will be made available online after peer review.</description>

      <title>KI-Bilder und die Widerst\"andigkeit der Medienkonvergenz: Von prim\"arer zu sekund\"arer Intermedialit\"at?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article presents some current observations (as of April 10, 2024) on the integration of AI-generated images within processes of media convergence. It draws on two different concepts of intermediality. Primary intermediality concepts are motivated by the object when a new type of technology develops the potential to become socially relevant as a media form and thus a socially, politically, or culturally important communicative factor. Due to their uncertain 'measurements' within the wider media ecology, however, the new, still potential media form appears hybrid. The "inter-" or "between-" of this initial intermediality moment thus refers to the questionable "site" and the questionable description of the potential media form between already existing technologies and cultural forms and their conceptual measurements. For secondary concepts of intermediality, in contrast, it can be assumed that the boundaries of media forms and their application have already been drawn and are reasonably undisputed. This then raises the question of intentional and staged references to AI imagery within other media forms and pictures. The article discusses indicators of both intermediality moments using current examples and controversies surrounding AI images. The thesis is that there can be no talk of a seamless 'integration' of AI images into the wider media landscape at the moment (within films, comic books, or video games, for example) - as one of countless other image production techniques - and that the medial 'site' of AI image circulation - at least where it is not a matter of deception, but rather their conscious use as AI images - especially in social media communication and in fan cultures, but with repercussions for the more general media ecology and image interpretation, insofar as the suspicion that an image could be AI-generated is now increasingly present as a "hermeneutics of suspicion".</description>

      <title>AI Safety in Generative AI Large Language Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLMs) such as ChatGPT that exhibit generative AI capabilities are facing accelerated adoption and innovation. The increased presence of Generative AI (GAI) inevitably raises concerns about the risks and safety associated with these models. This article provides an up-to-date survey of recent trends in AI safety research of GAI-LLMs from a computer scientist's perspective: specific and technical. In this survey, we explore the background and motivation for the identified harms and risks in the context of LLMs being generative language models; our survey differentiates by emphasising the need for unified theories of the distinct safety challenges in the research development and applications of LLMs. We start our discussion with a concise introduction to the workings of LLMs, supported by relevant literature. Then we discuss earlier research that has pointed out the fundamental constraints of generative models, or lack of understanding thereof (e.g., performance and safety trade-offs as LLMs scale in number of parameters). We provide a sufficient coverage of LLM alignment -- delving into various approaches, contending methods and present challenges associated with aligning LLMs with human preferences. By highlighting the gaps in the literature and possible implementation oversights, our aim is to create a comprehensive analysis that provides insights for addressing AI safety in LLMs and encourages the development of aligned and secure models. We conclude our survey by discussing future directions of LLMs for AI safety, offering insights into ongoing research in this critical area.</description>

      <title>She Works, He Works: A Curious Exploration of Gender Bias in AI-Generated Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines gender bias in AI-generated imagery of construction workers, highlighting discrepancies in the portrayal of male and female figures. Grounded in Griselda Pollock's theories on visual culture and gender, the analysis reveals that AI models tend to sexualize female figures while portraying male figures as more authoritative and competent. These findings underscore AI's potential to mirror and perpetuate societal biases, emphasizing the need for critical engagement with AI-generated content. The project contributes to discussions on the ethical implications of AI in creative practices and its broader impact on cultural perceptions of gender.</description>

      <title>TAGIFY: LLM-powered Tagging Interface for Improved Data Findability on OGD portals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efforts directed towards promoting Open Government Data (OGD) have gained significant traction across various governmental tiers since the mid-2000s. As more datasets are published on OGD portals, finding specific data becomes harder, leading to information overload. Complete and accurate documentation of datasets, including association of proper tags with datasets is key to improving dataset findability and accessibility. Analysis conducted on the Estonian Open Data Portal, revealed that 11% datasets have no associated tags, while 26% had only one tag assigned to them, which underscores challenges in data findability and accessibility within the portal, which, according to the recent Open Data Maturity Report, is considered trend-setter. The aim of this study is to propose an automated solution to tagging datasets to improve data findability on OGD portals. This paper presents Tagify - a prototype of tagging interface that employs large language models (LLM) such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 to automate dataset tagging, generating tags for datasets in English and Estonian, thereby augmenting metadata preparation by data publishers and improving data findability on OGD portals by data users. The developed solution was evaluated by users and their feedback was collected to define an agenda for future prototype improvements.</description>

      <title>Automatic Detection of Moral Values in Music Lyrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moral values play a fundamental role in how we evaluate information, make decisions, and form judgements around important social issues. The possibility to extract morality rapidly from lyrics enables a deeper understanding of our music-listening behaviours. Building on the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), we tasked a set of transformer-based language models (BERT) fine-tuned on 2,721 synthetic lyrics generated by a large language model (GPT-4) to detect moral values in 200 real music lyrics annotated by two experts.We evaluate their predictive capabilities against a series of baselines including out-of-domain (BERT fine-tuned on MFT-annotated social media texts) and zero-shot (GPT-4) classification. The proposed models yielded the best accuracy across experiments, with an average F1 weighted score of 0.8. This performance is, on average, 5% higher than out-of-domain and zero-shot models. When examining precision in binary classification, the proposed models perform on average 12% higher than the baselines.Our approach contributes to annotation-free and effective lyrics morality learning, and provides useful insights into the knowledge distillation of LLMs regarding moral expression in music, and the potential impact of these technologies on the creative industries and musical culture.</description>

      <title>The Need for Guardrails with Large Language Models in Medical Safety-Critical Settings: An Artificial Intelligence Application in the Pharmacovigilance Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are useful tools with the capacity for performing specific types of knowledge work at an effective scale. However, LLM deployments in high-risk and safety-critical domains pose unique challenges, notably the issue of ``hallucination,'' where LLMs can generate fabricated information. This is particularly concerning in settings such as drug safety, where inaccuracies could lead to patient harm. To mitigate these risks, we have developed and demonstrated a proof of concept suite of guardrails specifically designed to mitigate certain types of hallucinations and errors for drug safety, and potentially applicable to other medical safety-critical contexts. These guardrails include mechanisms to detect anomalous documents to prevent the ingestion of inappropriate data, identify incorrect drug names or adverse event terms, and convey uncertainty in generated content. We integrated these guardrails with an LLM fine-tuned for a text-to-text task, which involves converting both structured and unstructured data within adverse event reports into natural language. This method was applied to translate individual case safety reports, demonstrating effective application in a pharmacovigilance processing task. Our guardrail framework offers a set of tools with broad applicability across various domains, ensuring LLMs can be safely used in high-risk situations by eliminating the occurrence of key errors, including the generation of incorrect pharmacovigilance-related terms, thus adhering to stringent regulatory and quality standards in medical safety-critical environments.</description>

      <title>FemQuest -- An Interactive Multiplayer Game to Engage Girls in Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, computer science (CS) has undergone remarkable growth and diversification. Creating attractive, social, or hands-on games has already been identified as a possible approach to get teenagers and young adults interested in CS. However, overcoming the global gap between the interest and participation of men and women in CS is still a worldwide problem. To address this challenge, we present a multiplayer game that is used in a workshop setting to motivate girls to program through a 3D game environment. The paper aims to expand the educational landscape within computer science education by offering a motivating and engaging platform for young women to explore programming quests in a collaborative environment. The study involved 235 girls and 50 coaches for the workshop evaluation and a subset of 20 participants for an in-game analysis. In this paper, we explore the engagement in programming and assess the cognitive workload while playing and solving programming quests within the game, as well as the learning experience and the outcome. The results show that the positive outcomes of the workshop underscore the effectiveness of a game-based collaborative learning approach to get girls interested in computer science activities. The variety of solutions found for the different tasks demonstrates the creativity and problem-solving skills of the participants and underlines the effectiveness of the workshop in promoting critical thinking and computational skills.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Scoring Processes: Dissecting the Differences between LLMs and Human Graders in Automatic Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in performing automatic scoring for constructed response assessments. While constructed responses graded by humans are usually based on given grading rubrics, the methods by which LLMs assign scores remain largely unclear. It is also uncertain how closely AI's scoring process mirrors that of humans, or if it adheres to the same grading criteria. To address this gap, this paper uncovers the grading rubrics that LLMs used to score students' written responses to science tasks and their alignment with human scores. We also examine whether enhancing the alignments can improve scoring accuracy. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to generate analytic rubrics that they use to assign scores and study the alignment gap with human grading rubrics. Based on a series of experiments with various configurations of LLM settings, we reveal a notable alignment gap between human and LLM graders. While LLMs can adapt quickly to scoring tasks, they often resort to shortcuts, bypassing deeper logical reasoning expected in human grading. We found that incorporating high-quality analytical rubrics designed to reflect human grading logic can mitigate this gap and enhance LLMs' scoring accuracy. These results caution against the simplistic application of LLMs in science education and highlight the importance of aligning LLM outputs with human expectations to ensure efficient and accurate automatic scoring.</description>

      <title>Using Bibliometrics to Detect Unconventional Authorship Practices and Examine Their Impact on Global Research Metrics, 2019-2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Between 2019 and 2023, sixteen universities increased their research output by over fifteen times the global average, alongside significant changes in authorship dynamics (e.g., decreased first authorship, rise in hyperprolific authors, increased multi-affiliations, and increased authors per publication rate). Using bibliometric methods, this study detected patterns suggesting a reliance on unconventional authorship practices, such as gift, honorary, and sold authorship, to inflate publication metrics. The study underscores the need for reforms by universities, policymakers, funding agencies, ranking agencies, accreditation bodies, scholarly publishers, and researchers to maintain academic integrity and ensure the reliability of global ranking systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring Bengali Religious Dialect Biases in Large Language Models with Evaluation Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLM) have created a massive technological impact in the past decade, allowing for human-enabled applications, they can produce output that contains stereotypes and biases, especially when using low-resource languages. This can be of great ethical concern when dealing with sensitive topics such as religion. As a means toward making LLMS more fair, we explore bias from a religious perspective in Bengali, focusing specifically on two main religious dialects: Hindu and Muslim-majority dialects. Here, we perform different experiments and audit showing the comparative analysis of different sentences using three commonly used LLMs: ChatGPT, Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot, pertaining to the Hindu and Muslim dialects of specific words and showcasing which ones catch the social biases and which do not. Furthermore, we analyze our findings and relate them to potential reasons and evaluation perspectives, considering their global impact with over 300 million speakers worldwide. With this work, we hope to establish the rigor for creating more fairness in LLMs, as these are widely used as creative writing agents.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Sustainable Energy: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition to sustainable energy is a key challenge of our time, requiring modifications in the entire pipeline of energy production, storage, transmission, and consumption. At every stage, new sequential decision-making challenges emerge, ranging from the operation of wind farms to the management of electrical grids or the scheduling of electric vehicle charging stations. All such problems are well suited for reinforcement learning, the branch of machine learning that learns behavior from data. Therefore, numerous studies have explored the use of reinforcement learning for sustainable energy. This paper surveys this literature with the intention of bridging both the underlying research communities: energy and machine learning. After a brief introduction of both fields, we systematically list relevant sustainability challenges, how they can be modeled as a reinforcement learning problem, and what solution approaches currently exist in the literature. Afterwards, we zoom out and identify overarching reinforcement learning themes that appear throughout sustainability, such as multi-agent, offline, and safe reinforcement learning. Lastly, we also cover standardization of environments, which will be crucial for connecting both research fields, and highlight potential directions for future work. In summary, this survey provides an extensive overview of reinforcement learning methods for sustainable energy, which may play a vital role in the energy transition.</description>

      <title>Learning production functions for supply chains with graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global economy relies on the flow of goods over supply chain networks, with nodes as firms and edges as transactions between firms. While we may observe these external transactions, they are governed by unseen production functions, which determine how firms internally transform the input products they receive into output products that they sell. In this setting, it can be extremely valuable to infer these production functions, to better understand and improve supply chains, and to forecast future transactions more accurately. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) cannot capture these hidden relationships between nodes' inputs and outputs. Here, we introduce a new class of models for this setting, by combining temporal GNNs with a novel inventory module, which learns production functions via attention weights and a special loss function. We evaluate our models extensively on real supply chains data, along with data generated from our new open-source simulator, SupplySim. Our models successfully infer production functions, with a 6-50% improvement over baselines, and forecast future transactions on real and synthetic data, outperforming baselines by 11-62%.</description>

      <title>MNTD: An Efficient Dynamic Community Detector Based on Nonnegative Tensor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic community detection is crucial for elucidating the temporal evolution of social structures, information dissemination, and interactive behaviors within complex networks. Nonnegative matrix factorization provides an efficient framework for identifying communities in static networks but fall short in depicting temporal variations in community affiliations. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Modularity maximization-incorporated Nonnegative Tensor RESCAL Decomposition (MNTD) model for dynamic community detection. This method serves two primary functions: a) Nonnegative tensor RESCAL decomposition extracts latent community structures in different time slots, highlighting the persistence and transformation of communities; and b) Incorporating an initial community structure into the modularity maximization algorithm, facilitating more precise community segmentations. Comparative analysis of real-world datasets shows that the MNTD is superior to state-of-the-art dynamic community detection methods in the accuracy of community detection.</description>

Abstract: Computational preference elicitation methods are tools used to learn people's preferences quantitatively in a given context. Recent works on preference elicitation advocate for active learning as an efficient method to iteratively construct queries (framed as comparisons between context-specific cases) that are likely to be most informative about an agent's underlying preferences. In this work, we argue that the use of active learning for moral preference elicitation relies on certain assumptions about the underlying moral preferences, which can be violated in practice. Specifically, we highlight the following common assumptions (a) preferences are stable over time and not sensitive to the sequence of presented queries, (b) the appropriate hypothesis class is chosen to model moral preferences, and (c) noise in the agent's responses is limited. While these assumptions can be appropriate for preference elicitation in certain domains, prior research on moral psychology suggests they may not be valid for moral judgments. Through a synthetic simulation of preferences that violate the above assumptions, we observe that active learning can have similar or worse performance than a basic random query selection method in certain settings. Yet, simulation results also demonstrate that active learning can still be viable if the degree of instability or noise is relatively small and when the agent's preferences can be approximately represented with the hypothesis class used for learning. Our study highlights the nuances associated with effective moral preference elicitation in practice and advocates for the cautious use of active learning as a methodology to learn moral preferences.</description>

      <title>The Potential Impact of AI Innovations on U.S. Occupations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04714v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An occupation is comprised of interconnected tasks, and it is these tasks, not occupations themselves, that are affected by AI. To evaluate how tasks may be impacted, previous approaches utilized manual annotations or coarse-grained matching. Leveraging recent advancements in machine learning, we replace coarse-grained matching with more precise deep learning approaches. Introducing the AI Impact (AII) measure, we employ Deep Learning Natural Language Processing to automatically identify AI patents that may impact various occupational tasks at scale. Our methodology relies on a comprehensive dataset of 17,879 task descriptions and quantifies AI's potential impact through analysis of 24,758 AI patents filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between 2015 and 2022. Our results reveal that some occupations will potentially be impacted, and that impact is intricately linked to specific skills. These include not only routine tasks (codified as a series of steps), as previously thought, but also non-routine ones (e.g., diagnosing health conditions, programming computers, and tracking flight routes). However, AI's impact on labour is limited by the fact that some of the occupations affected are augmented rather than replaced (e.g., neurologists, software engineers, air traffic controllers), and the sectors affected are experiencing labour shortages (e.g., IT, Healthcare, Transport).</description>

      <title>Unsocial Intelligence: an Investigation of the Assumptions of AGI Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13142v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dreams of machines rivaling human intelligence have shaped the field of AI since its inception. Yet, the very meaning of human-level AI or artificial general intelligence (AGI) remains elusive and contested. Definitions of AGI embrace a diverse range of incompatible values and assumptions. Contending with the fractured worldviews of AGI discourse is vital for critiques that pursue different values and futures. To that end, we provide a taxonomy of AGI definitions, laying the ground for examining the key social, political, and ethical assumptions they make. We highlight instances in which these definitions frame AGI or human-level AI as a technical topic and expose the value-laden choices being implicitly made. Drawing on feminist, STS, and social science scholarship on the political and social character of intelligence in both humans and machines, we propose contextual, democratic, and participatory paths to imagining future forms of machine intelligence. The development of future forms of AI must involve explicit attention to the values it encodes, the people it includes or excludes, and a commitment to epistemic justice.</description>

      <title>Particip-AI: A Democratic Surveying Framework for Anticipating Future AI Use Cases, Harms and Benefits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General purpose AI, such as ChatGPT, seems to have lowered the barriers for the public to use AI and harness its power. However, the governance and development of AI still remain in the hands of a few, and the pace of development is accelerating without a comprehensive assessment of risks. As a first step towards democratic risk assessment and design of general purpose AI, we introduce PARTICIP-AI, a carefully designed framework for laypeople to speculate and assess AI use cases and their impacts. Our framework allows us to study more nuanced and detailed public opinions on AI through collecting use cases, surfacing diverse harms through risk assessment under alternate scenarios (i.e., developing and not developing a use case), and illuminating tensions over AI development through making a concluding choice on its development. To showcase the promise of our framework towards informing democratic AI development, we run a medium-scale study with inputs from 295 demographically diverse participants. Our analyses show that participants' responses emphasize applications for personal life and society, contrasting with most current AI development's business focus. We also surface diverse set of envisioned harms such as distrust in AI and institutions, complementary to those defined by experts. Furthermore, we found that perceived impact of not developing use cases significantly predicted participants' judgements of whether AI use cases should be developed, and highlighted lay users' concerns of techno-solutionism. We conclude with a discussion on how frameworks like PARTICIP-AI can further guide democratic AI development and governance.</description>

      <title>How Do Students Interact with an LLM-powered Virtual Teaching Assistant in Different Educational Settings?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jill Watson, a virtual teaching assistant powered by LLMs, answers student questions and engages them in extended conversations on courseware provided by the instructors. In this paper, we analyze student interactions with Jill across multiple courses and colleges, focusing on the types and complexity of student questions based on Bloom's Revised Taxonomy and tool usage patterns. We find that, by supporting a wide range of cognitive demands, Jill encourages students to engage in sophisticated, higher-order cognitive questions. However, the frequency of usage varies significantly across deployments, and the types of questions asked depend on course-specific contexts. These findings pave the way for future work on AI-driven educational tools tailored to individual learning styles and course structure, potentially enhancing both the teaching and learning experience in classrooms.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Flaw Disclosure for AI: Beyond Security Vulnerabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harm reporting in Artificial Intelligence (AI) currently lacks a structured process for disclosing and addressing algorithmic flaws, relying largely on an ad-hoc approach. This contrasts sharply with the well-established Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) ecosystem in software security. While global efforts to establish frameworks for AI transparency and collaboration are underway, the unique challenges presented by machine learning (ML) models demand a specialized approach. To address this gap, we propose implementing a Coordinated Flaw Disclosure (CFD) framework tailored to the complexities of ML and AI issues. This paper reviews the evolution of ML disclosure practices, from ad hoc reporting to emerging participatory auditing methods, and compares them with cybersecurity norms. Our framework introduces innovations such as extended model cards, dynamic scope expansion, an independent adjudication panel, and an automated verification process. We also outline a forthcoming real-world pilot of CFD. We argue that CFD could significantly enhance public trust in AI systems. By balancing organizational and community interests, CFD aims to improve AI accountability in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Moral Behavior in Heterogeneous Populations of Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04202v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Growing concerns about safety and alignment of AI systems highlight the importance of embedding moral capabilities in artificial agents: a promising solution is the use of learning from experience, i.e., Reinforcement Learning. In multi-agent (social) environments, complex population-level phenomena may emerge from interactions between individual learning agents. Many of the existing studies rely on simulated social dilemma environments to study the interactions of independent learning agents; however, they tend to ignore the moral heterogeneity that is likely to be present in societies of agents in practice. For example, at different points in time a single learning agent may face opponents who are consequentialist (i.e., focused on maximizing outcomes over time), norm-based (i.e., conforming to specific norms), or virtue-based (i.e., considering a combination of different virtues). The extent to which agents' co-development may be impacted by such moral heterogeneity in populations is not well understood. In this paper, we present a study of the learning dynamics of morally heterogeneous populations interacting in a social dilemma setting. Using an Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma environment with a partner selection mechanism, we investigate the extent to which the prevalence of diverse moral agents in populations affects individual agents' learning behaviors and emergent population-level outcomes. We observe several types of non-trivial interactions between pro-social and anti-social agents, and find that certain types of moral agents are able to steer selfish agents towards more cooperative behavior.</description>

      <title>Analyzing LLM Usage in an Advanced Computing Class in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the use of large language models (LLMs) by undergraduate and graduate students for programming assignments in advanced computing classes. Unlike existing research, which primarily focuses on introductory classes and lacks in-depth analysis of actual student-LLM interactions, our work fills this gap. We conducted a comprehensive analysis involving 411 students from a Distributed Systems class at an Indian university, where they completed three programming assignments and shared their experiences through Google Form surveys.
  Our findings reveal that students leveraged LLMs for a variety of tasks, including code generation, debugging, conceptual inquiries, and test case creation. They employed a spectrum of prompting strategies, ranging from basic contextual prompts to advanced techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and iterative refinement. While students generally viewed LLMs as beneficial for enhancing productivity and learning, we noted a concerning trend of over-reliance, with many students submitting entire assignment descriptions to obtain complete solutions. Given the increasing use of LLMs in the software industry, our study highlights the need to update undergraduate curricula to include training on effective prompting strategies and to raise awareness about the benefits and potential drawbacks of LLM usage in academic settings.</description>

      <title>PersLLM: A Personified Training Approach for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models exhibit aspects of human-level intelligence that catalyze their application as human-like agents in domains such as social simulations, human-machine interactions, and collaborative multi-agent systems. However, the absence of distinct personalities, such as displaying ingratiating behaviors, inconsistent opinions, and uniform response patterns, diminish LLMs utility in practical applications. Addressing this, the development of personality traits in LLMs emerges as a crucial area of research to unlock their latent potential. Existing methods to personify LLMs generally involve strategies like employing stylized training data for instruction tuning or using prompt engineering to simulate different personalities. These methods only capture superficial linguistic styles instead of the core of personalities and are therefore not stable. In this study, we propose PersLLM, integrating psychology-grounded principles of personality: social practice, consistency, and dynamic development, into a comprehensive training methodology. We incorporate personality traits directly into the model parameters, enhancing the model's resistance to induction, promoting consistency, and supporting the dynamic evolution of personality. Single-agent evaluation validates our method's superiority, as it produces responses more aligned with reference personalities compared to other approaches. Case studies for multi-agent communication highlight its benefits in enhancing opinion consistency within individual agents and fostering collaborative creativity among multiple agents in dialogue contexts, potentially benefiting human simulation and multi-agent cooperation. Additionally, human-agent interaction evaluations indicate that our personified models significantly enhance interactive experiences, underscoring the practical implications of our research.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Global North Stereotype: A Global South-centric Benchmark Dataset for Auditing and Mitigating Biases in Facial Recognition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Facial Recognition Systems (FRSs) are being developed and deployed globally at unprecedented rates. Most platforms are designed in a limited set of countries but deployed in worldwide, without adequate checkpoints. This is especially problematic for Global South countries which lack strong legislation to safeguard persons facing disparate performance of these systems. A combination of unavailability of datasets, lack of understanding of FRS functionality and low-resource bias mitigation measures accentuate the problem. In this work, we propose a new face dataset composed of 6,579 unique male and female sportspersons from eight countries around the world. More than 50% of the dataset comprises individuals from the Global South countries and is demographically diverse. To aid adversarial audits and robust model training, each image has four adversarial variants, totaling over 40,000 images. We also benchmark five popular FRSs, both commercial and open-source, for the task of gender prediction (and country prediction for one of the open-source models as an example of red-teaming). Experiments on industrial FRSs reveal accuracies ranging from 98.2%--38.1%, with a large disparity between males and females in the Global South (max difference of 38.5%). Biases are also observed in all FRSs between females of the Global North and South (max difference of ~50%). Grad-CAM analysis identifies the nose, forehead and mouth as the regions of interest on one of the open-source FRSs. Utilizing this insight, we design simple, low-resource bias mitigation solutions using few-shot and novel contrastive learning techniques significantly improving the accuracy with disparity between males and females reducing from 50% to 1.5% in one of the settings. In the red-teaming experiment with the open-source Deepface model, contrastive learning proves more effective than simple fine-tuning.</description>
