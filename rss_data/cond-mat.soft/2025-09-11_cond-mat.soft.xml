      <title>A two-axes shear cell for rheo-optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and test a rheo-optical platform based on a two-axes, parallel plates shear cell coupled to an optical microscope and a photon correlation imaging setup, for simultaneous investigation of the rheological response and the microscopic structure and dynamics of soft materials under shear. Each plate of the shear cell is driven by an air bearing linear stage, actuated by a voice coil motor. A servo control loop reading the plate displacement through a contactless linear encoder enables both strain-controlled and stress-controlled rheology. Simultaneous actuation of both linear stages enables both parallel and orthogonal superposition rheology. We validate the performance of our device in both oscillatory and transient rheological tests on a microgel soft glass, and we demonstrate its potential through orthogonal superposition rheology experiments. During steady-state flow, we reconstruct the strain field across the gap by tracking the motion of tracer particles, to check for slip or shear banding instabilities. At the same time, we measure the microscopic dynamics, both affine and non-affine, resolving them in space and time using photon correlation imaging.</description>

      <title>Poly-liquid behaviors of self-associating fluids and mesoscopic aggregation in liquid solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conflict with standard notions of thermodynamics, mesoscopically-sized inclusions (``clusters'') of a solute-rich liquid have been observed in equilibrated solutions of proteins and other molecules. According to a complexation scenario proposed earlier, a steady-state ensemble of finite-sized droplets of a metastable solute-rich liquid can emerge in a solution, if the solute molecules can form transient complexes with each other and/or solute. Here we solve for the thermodynamics of an explicit model of a self-associating fluid in which particles can form transient dimers. We determine ranges of parameters where two distinct dense liquid phases, dimer-rich and monomer-rich respectively, can co-exist with each other and the solute-poor phase. We find that within a certain range of the dimer's binding strength, thermodynamic conditions for mesoscopic clusters to emerge are indeed satisfied. The location and size, respectively, of the corresponding region on the phase diagram are consistent with observation. We predict that the clusters are comprised of a metastable monomer-rich dense liquid, while the bulk solution itself contains substantial amounts of the dimer and exhibits large, pre-critical density fluctuations. Surprisingly, we find that the dense phase commonly observed during the macroscopic liquid-liquid separation should be dimer-rich, another testable prediction. The present findings provide further evidence for the complexation scenario and suggest new experimental ways to test it.</description>

      <title>Insertion space in repulsive active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For equilibrium hard spheres the stochastic geometry of the insertion space, the room to accommodate another sphere, relates exactly to the equation of state. We begin to extend this idea to active matter, analyzing insertion space for repulsive active particles in one and two dimensions using both on- and off-lattice models. In 1D we derive closed-form expressions for the mean insertion cavity size, cavity number, and total insertion volume, all in excellent agreement with simulations. Strikingly, activity increases the total insertion volume and tends to keep the insertion space more connected. These results provide the first quantitative foundation for the stochastic geometry of active matter, and opens up a new route to building a thermodynamics of active systems.</description>

      <title>Controlling the collective transport of large passive particles with suspensions of microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A promising approach to transport cargo at the microscale lies within the use of self-propelled microorganisms, whose motion entrains that of passive particles. However, most applications remain limited to just a few passive particles of similar size as the microorganisms, since the transport mechanism relies on the interaction between individual swimmers and single particles. Here, we demonstrate how to control the collective transport of hundreds of large passive particles with phototactic microalga. Using directional light stimuli in suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we trigger bioconvection rolls capable of macroscale transport. Passive particles an order of magnitude larger than the microalgae are either attracted or repelled by the rolls depending on their density. Using experiments and simulation, we rationalize these bioconvective flows and describe how to harness them for cargo transport, with future applications in targeted drug delivery and decontamination.</description>

      <title>Membrane Heterogeneity Driven Dynamics of Multicomponent Vesicles in Shear Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their significance in biology and materials science, the dynamics of multicomponent vesicles under shear flow remain poorly understood because of their nonlinear and strongly coupled nature, especially regarding the role of membrane heterogeneity in driving nonequilibrium behavior. Here we present a thermodynamically consistent phase-field model, which is validated against experiments, for the quantitative investigation of these dynamics. While prior research has primarily focused on viscosity or bending rigidity contrasts, we demonstrate that surface tension heterogeneity can also trigger swinging and tumbling in vesicles under shear. Additionally, our systematic phase diagram reveals three previously unreported dynamical regimes arising from the interplay between bending rigidity heterogeneity and shear flow. Overall, our model provides a robust framework for understanding multicomponent vesicle dynamics, with findings offering new physical insights and design principles for tunable vesicle-based carriers.</description>

      <title>Capillary rise on hydrogel surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capillary rise occurs when a thin tube contacts a liquid, which rises against gravity due to the capillary force. This phenomenon is present in a wide range of everyday and industrial settings and provides the means to measure the physical properties of liquids. Here, we report on the unusual ultra-slow capillary rise on a solid-like material of agarose hydrogels. The observed meniscus motion cannot be described with classical capillary rise models, and we develop a new model based on the fluid transport through the porous hydrogel network. Our model is in good agreement with the experimental data for agarose gels made with five different concentrations and with two different viscosities of the liquid flowing inside the gel. Our results provide a non-invasive technique to directly estimate the permeability of hydrogel interfaces, which is crucial for the implementation of hydrogels in different bioadhesion applications.</description>

      <title>Adsorption Barrier Limits the Ice Inhibition Activity of Glycan-Rich Antifreeze Glycoproteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are among the most potent ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) agents, yet the molecular basis for their counterintuitive decline in activity with increasing glycosylated threonine (T*) content remains unresolved. Through molecular dynamics simulations of model glycoproteins with increasing T* content, we show that potent IRI activity arises not only from the thermodynamic stability of strong ice-binding states, but also from their kinetic accessibility. Specifically, the free energy barrier for forming strong ice-binding states from the unbound state constitutes a critical kinetic bottleneck. Increasing T* content enhances the overall hydration capacity due to the additional glycan moieties, thereby imposing a greater desolvation penalty and elevating the adsorption barrier. This kinetic limitation, rather than the absence of strong ice-binding states, accounts for the experimentally observed decline in IRI activity. To quantify the structural basis of this behavior, we introduce a facial amphiphilicity index that integrates both spatial segregation and compositional ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, and show that it correlates well with IRI activity. These findings highlight that facial amphiphilicity mediates a critical balance between binding stability and kinetic accessibility, providing a rational design principle for advanced IRI materials.</description>

      <title>Shape-specific fluctuations of an active colloidal interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a recently synthesized class of active interfaces formed by linked self-propelled colloids, we investigate the dynamics and fluctuations of a phoretically (chemically) interacting active interface with roto-translational coupling. We enumerate all steady-state shapes of the interface across parameter space and identify a regime where the interface acquires a finite curvature, leading to a characteristic C-shaped topology, along with persistent self-propulsion. In this phase, the interface height fluctuations obey Family-Vicsek scaling but with novel exponents: a dynamic exponent $z_h \approx 0.6$, a roughness exponent $\alpha_h \approx 0.9$ and a super-ballistic growth exponent $\beta_h \approx 1.5$. In contrast, the orientational fluctuations of the colloidal monomers exhibit a negative roughness exponent, reflecting a surprising smoothness law, where steady-state fluctuations diminish with increasing system size. Together, these findings reveal a unique non-equilibrium universality class associated with self-propelled interfaces of non-standard shape.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the liquid-liquid transition in cold water/glycerol mixtures by ih-RIDME</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water/glycerol mixtures are common for experiments with biomacromolecules at cryogenic temperatures due to their vitrification properties. Above the glass transition temperature, they undergo liquid-liquid phase separation. Using the novel EPR technique called intermolecular hyperfine Relaxation-Induced Dipolar Modulation Enhancement (ih-RIDME), we quantified the molar composition in frozen water/glycerol mixtures with one or the other component deuterated after the phase transition. Our experiments reveal nearly equal phase composition regardless of the proton/deuterium isotope balance. With the new ih-RIDME data, we can also revisit the already reported body of glass transition data for such mixtures and build a consistent picture for water/glycerol freezing and phase transitions. Our results also indicate that ih-RIDME has the potential for investigating the solvation shells of spin-labelled macromolecules.</description>

      <title>Actin driven morphogenesis in hydra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydra, a centimeter long cylindrical-shaped freshwater organism, has emerged as an interesting model system for studying morphogenesis in animals. Recently, fluorescent imaging of cytoskeletal actin filaments on the outer surface of hydra has revealed nematic-type arrangement of actin filaments. {Several topological defects in the nematic field have also been detected. In particular, aster-like +1 defects appear at the curved head of hydra and at the tip of its tentacles, while -1/2 defects are seen at the base of the tentacles. However, functional role of these defects in tissue development is not clear. Motivated by these observations, we here model hydra's epthelial tissue as a visco-elastic membrane and the tentacles as growing membrane tubes driven by a nematic interaction among actin. We consider the epithelial layer of hydra as a fluid membrane and carry out a non-equilibrium simulation which also includes membrane growth and polymerization of actin. We show that specific kind of defect at the head does not play any positive role in emergence of the tentacles. The reorganization of actin at the base and the tip of growing tentacles are consistent with other possible defect structures at the head as well. While it is known that regions of tentacle growth are hot spots of chemical signaling, involving Wnt3/$\beta$-catenin pathway, we propose that active polymerization of actin bundles could also be an important player in the growth of tubular tentacles. In addition to polymerization, fluidity of our model membrane, capturing effective fluidity of the epithelial tissue, turns out to be essential for enabling such growth.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pattern formation often occurs in confined systems, yet how boundaries shape patterning dynamics is unclear. We develop techniques to analyze confinement effects in nonlocal advection-diffusion equations, which generically capture the collective dynamics of active self-attracting particles. We identify a sequence of size-controlled transitions that generate characteristic slow modes, leading to exponential increase of patterning timescales. Experimental measurements of multicellular dynamics confirm our predictions.</description>

      <title>Far-field axisymmetric solution of the Brinkman equation for a point force near a no-slip wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the far-field solution for the Green's function of a point force acting perpendicular to a no-slip wall in a Brinkman fluid, focusing on the regime where the distance between the force and the wall is much smaller than the screening length. The general solution is obtained in closed form up to a single integral and can be systematically expanded in a Taylor series in both the far-field and near-field limits. The flow can then be expressed as a series of source-multipole singularities with an additional, analytically known, correction in the proximity of the wall. Comparisons with numerical integration demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the asymptotic expansions. The results are also applicable to the unsteady Stokes flow driven by a localized assembly of forces, such as a beating cilium protruding from a flat surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active particles with a (magnetic) dipole moment are of interest for steering self-propelled motion, but also result in novel collective effects due to their dipole-dipole interaction. Here systems of active dipolar particles are studied with Brownian dynamics simulations to systematically characterize the different patterns they form, specifically in the presence of an external (magnetic) field. The combination of three types of order - clustering, orientational alignment and chain formation - is used to classify the patterns observed in these systems. In the presence of an external field, oriented chains and bands are found to be dominant. These structures show some similarities with columnar cluster seen in (passive) ferrofluids and display columnar spacing and number of lanes per cluster that both decrease with increasing field strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by motile cells in tissue formation, we find that active systems of self-aligning adhesive particles undergo ballistic aggregation through a flocking transition. This kinetic regime emerges when the cluster persistence length grows faster with cluster mass than the intercluster distance does. We also identify and explain distinct non-collective kinetic regimes, including biologically relevant long-lived transients. Our analytical and numerical results offer a unified framework explaining the broad range of experimentally observed aggregation exponents in cellular systems and reveal physical principles potentially critical for timely tissue organization.</description>

Abstract: We develop and implement numerically a phase field model for the growth and detachment of a gas bubble resting on an electrode and being filled with hydrogen produced by water electrolysis. The bubble is surrounded by a viscous liquid, has a prescribed static contact angle and is also subject to gravitational forces. We compute, as a function of the static contact angle, the time at which the bubble detaches from the substrate and what volume it has at that time. We also investigate de dependence of the detachment time on other parameters such as the applied voltage and the hydrogen ion concentration at the fluid bulk.</description>

When the components of a binary blend are immiscible, they are typically driven towards a macrophase-separated state, but with the introduction of electrostatic interactions, they can be either homogenized or shifted to microphase separation. However, both experimental and simulation approaches face significant challenges in efficiently exploring the vast design space of charge-compatibilized polymer blends, encompassing chemical interactions, architectural properties, and composition. In this work, we introduce a white-box machine learning approach integrated with polymer field theory to predict the phase behavior of these systems, which is significantly more accurate than conventional black-box machine learning approaches. The random phase approximation (RPA) calculation is used as a testbed to determine polymer phases. Instead of directly predicting the polymer phase output of RPA calculations from a large input space by a machine learning model, we build a parallel partial Gaussian process model to predict the most computationally intensive component of the RPA calculation that only involves polymer architecture parameters as inputs. This approach substantially reduces the computational cost of the RPA calculation across a vast input space with nearly 100% accuracy for out-of-sample prediction, enabling rapid screening of polymer blend charge-compatibilization designs. More broadly, the white-box machine learning strategy offers a promising approach for dramatic acceleration of polymer field-theoretic methods for mapping out polymer phase behavior.</description>

Abstract: We develop and implement numerically a phase field model for the evolution and detachment of a gas bubble resting on a solid substrate and surrounded by a viscous liquid. The bubble has a static contact angle $\theta $ and will be subject to gravitational forces. We compute, as a function of the static contact angle, the cricital Bond number over which bubbles detach from the substrate. Then, we perform similar studies for bubble resting on inclined substrates and bubbles under the action of an external flow. We provide approximate formulas for the critical Bond number under all these circumstances. Our method is also able to resolve the pinchoff of the bubble and the possible appearence of satellites.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>

Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>
