      <title>Inference for the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo model from real action potential data via approximate Bayesian computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model considered here is a two-dimensional nonlinear stochastic differential equation with additive degenerate noise, whose first component, the only one observed, describes the membrane voltage evolution of a single neuron. Due to its low dimensionality, its analytical and numerical tractability, and its neuronal interpretation, it has been used as a case study to test the performance of different statistical methods in estimating the underlying model parameters. Existing methods, however, often require complete observations, non-degeneracy of the noise or a complex architecture (e.g., to estimate the transition density of the process, "recovering" the unobserved second component), and they may not (satisfactorily) estimate all model parameters simultaneously. Moreover, these studies lack real data applications for the stochastic FHN model. Here, we tackle all challenges (non-globally Lipschitz drift, non-explicit solution, lack of available transition density, degeneracy of the noise, and partial observations) via an intuitive and easy-to-implement sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation algorithm. The proposed method relies on a recent computationally efficient and structure-preserving numerical splitting scheme for synthetic data generation, and on summary statistics exploiting the structural properties of the process. We succeed in estimating all model parameters from simulated data and, more remarkably, real action potential data of rats. The presented novel real-data fit may broaden the scope and credibility of this classic and widely used neuronal model.</description>

      <title>Prediction of energy consumption in hotels using ANN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increase in travelers and stays in tourist destinations is leading hotels to be aware of their ecological management and the need for efficient energy consumption. To achieve this, hotels are increasingly using digitalized systems and more frequent measurements are made of the variables that affect their management. Electricity can play a significant role, predicting electricity usage in hotels, which in turn can enhance their circularity - an approach aimed at sustainable and efficient resource use. In this study, neural networks are trained to predict electricity usage patterns in two hotels based on historical data. The results indicate that the predictions have a good accuracy level of around 2.5% in MAPE, showing the potential of using these techniques for electricity forecasting in hotels. Additionally, neural network models can use climatological data to improve predictions. By accurately forecasting energy demand, hotels can optimize their energy procurement and usage, moving energy-intensive activities to off-peak hours to reduce costs and strain on the grid, assisting in the better integration of renewable energy sources, or identifying patterns and anomalies in energy consumption, suggesting areas for efficiency improvements, among other. Hence, by optimizing the allocation of resources, reducing waste and improving efficiency these models can improve hotel's circularity.</description>

      <title>Efficient Prior Calibration From Indirect Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inversion is central to the quantification of uncertainty within problems arising from numerous applications in science and engineering. To formulate the approach, four ingredients are required: a forward model mapping the unknown parameter to an element of a solution space, often the solution space for a differential equation; an observation operator mapping an element of the solution space to the data space; a noise model describing how noise pollutes the observations; and a prior model describing knowledge about the unknown parameter before the data is acquired. This paper is concerned with learning the prior model from data; in particular, learning the prior from multiple realizations of indirect data obtained through the noisy observation process. The prior is represented, using a generative model, as the pushforward of a Gaussian in a latent space; the pushforward map is learned by minimizing an appropriate loss function. A metric that is well-defined under empirical approximation is used to define the loss function for the pushforward map to make an implementable methodology. Furthermore, an efficient residual-based neural operator approximation of the forward model is proposed and it is shown that this may be learned concurrently with the pushforward map, using a bilevel optimization formulation of the problem; this use of neural operator approximation has the potential to make prior learning from indirect data more computationally efficient, especially when the observation process is expensive, non-smooth or not known. The ideas are illustrated with the Darcy flow inverse problem of finding permeability from piezometric head measurements.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates of particle approximation of forward-backward splitting algorithm for granular medium equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spatially homogeneous granular medium equation \[\partial_t\mu=\rm{div}(\mu\nabla V)+\rm{div}(\mu(\nabla W \ast \mu))+\Delta\mu\,,\] within a large and natural class of the confinement potentials $V$ and interaction potentials $W$. The considered problem do not need to assume that $\nabla V$ or $\nabla W$ are globally Lipschitz. With the aim of providing particle approximation of solutions, we design efficient forward-backward splitting algorithms. Sharp convergence rates in terms of the Wasserstein distance are provided.</description>

      <title>Estimating Conditional Distributions with Neural Networks using R package deeptrafo</title>

Abstract: Contemporary empirical applications frequently require flexible regression models for complex response types and large tabular or non-tabular, including image or text, data. Classical regression models either break down under the computational load of processing such data or require additional manual feature extraction to make these problems tractable. Here, we present deeptrafo, a package for fitting flexible regression models for conditional distributions using a tensorflow backend with numerous additional processors, such as neural networks, penalties, and smoothing splines. Package deeptrafo implements deep conditional transformation models (DCTMs) for binary, ordinal, count, survival, continuous, and time series responses, potentially with uninformative censoring. Unlike other available methods, DCTMs do not assume a parametric family of distributions for the response. Further, the data analyst may trade off interpretability and flexibility by supplying custom neural network architectures and smoothers for each term in an intuitive formula interface. We demonstrate how to set up, fit, and work with DCTMs for several response types. We further showcase how to construct ensembles of these models, evaluate models using inbuilt cross-validation, and use other convenience functions for DCTMs in several applications. Lastly, we discuss DCTMs in light of other approaches to regression with non-tabular data.</description>

      <title>Parameter Inference for Degenerate Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study parametric inference for ergodic diffusion processes with a degenerate diffusion matrix. Existing research focuses on a particular class of hypo-elliptic SDEs, with components split into `rough'/`smooth' and noise from rough components propagating directly onto smooth ones, but some critical model classes arising in applications have yet to be explored. We aim to cover this gap, thus analyse the highly degenerate class of SDEs, where components split into further sub-groups. Such models include e.g. the notable case of generalised Langevin equations. We propose a tailored time-discretisation scheme and provide asymptotic results supporting our scheme in the context of high-frequency, full observations. The proposed discretisation scheme is applicable in much more general data regimes and is shown to overcome biases via simulation studies also in the practical case when only a smooth component is observed. Joint consideration of our study for highly degenerate SDEs and existing research provides a general `recipe' for the development of time-discretisation schemes to be used within statistical methods for general classes of hypo-elliptic SDEs.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Dots: Is Mode-Connectedness the Key to Feasible Sample-Based Inference in Bayesian Neural Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in sample-based inference (SBI) for Bayesian neural networks is the size and structure of the networks' parameter space. Our work shows that successful SBI is possible by embracing the characteristic relationship between weight and function space, uncovering a systematic link between overparameterization and the difficulty of the sampling problem. Through extensive experiments, we establish practical guidelines for sampling and convergence diagnosis. As a result, we present a deep ensemble initialized approach as an effective solution with competitive performance and uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Localization via Iterative Posterior Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon score-based learning, new interest in stochastic localization techniques has recently emerged. In these models, one seeks to noise a sample from the data distribution through a stochastic process, called observation process, and progressively learns a denoiser associated to this dynamics. Apart from specific applications, the use of stochastic localization for the problem of sampling from an unnormalized target density has not been explored extensively. This work contributes to fill this gap. We consider a general stochastic localization framework and introduce an explicit class of observation processes, associated with flexible denoising schedules. We provide a complete methodology, $\textit{Stochastic Localization via Iterative Posterior Sampling}$ (SLIPS), to obtain approximate samples of this dynamics, and as a by-product, samples from the target distribution. Our scheme is based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation of the denoiser and comes with detailed practical guidelines. We illustrate the benefits and applicability of SLIPS on several benchmarks of multi-modal distributions, including Gaussian mixtures in increasing dimensions, Bayesian logistic regression and a high-dimensional field system from statistical-mechanics.</description>
