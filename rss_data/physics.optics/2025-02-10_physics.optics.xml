      <title>Ludwig-Soret microscopy with vibrational photothermal effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational microscopy provides label-free, bond-selective chemical contrast by detecting molecular vibrations, making it invaluable for biomedical research. While conventional methods rely on the direct detection of Raman scattering or infrared absorption, recently developed vibrational photothermal (ViP) microscopy achieves chemical contrast indirectly through refractive index (RI) changes. This indirect approach enables unique imaging capabilities beyond traditional chemical imaging. Here, we introduce a novel application of ViP microscopy: label-free intracellular thermophoretic (Soret) imaging, which visualizes biomolecular transport driven by temperature gradients. ViP-induced Soret (ViPS) imaging leverages a steady-state temperature distribution generated by optical heating through vibrational photothermal effect, combined with time-resolved RI imaging via optical diffraction tomography (ODT). Using ViPS imaging, we measured thermophoretic behavior in living COS7 cells, determining intracellular diffusion and Soret coefficients. Notably, we observed a reversed direction of molecular transport (negative Soret effect) in the cytoplasm compared to the nucleus, possibly driven by thermophoresis-induced diffusiophoresis. Furthermore, time-lapse imaging under CO2-depleted conditions revealed a remarkable reduction in thermophoretic activity, suggesting glass formation during the dying process, likely due to polymer aggregation. ViPS imaging represents a new frontier in intracellular thermophoretic studies, expanding the capabilities of vibrational microscopy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microcavities have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional ultrasound probes, offering high sensitivity and wide bandwidth. In our research, we propose a novel silica WGM microprobe device, with impressive Q factors up to 10^7.The side-coupled approach and special encapsulation design make the device small, robust, and capable of utilizing in both gaseous and liquid environments.We have successfully conducted photoacoustic (PA) imaging on various samples using this device which demonstrates a high sensitivity of 5.4 mPa/sqrt(Hz) and a board bandwidth of 41 MHz at -6 dB for ultrasound. What's more, it's capable of capturing the vibration spectrum of microparticles up to a few hundred megahertz. Our compact and lightweight device exhibits significant application potential in PA endoscopic detection, near-field ultrasound sensing and other aspects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled laser arrays exhibit rich and complex physical properties, making them powerful tools for exploring a wide range of phenomena. They enable efficient ground-state optimization of complex landscapes, solve computational problems, reveal topological defects, study coupled oscillators and their universality classes, investigate classical spin systems and complex networks, enhance imaging through scattering media, suppress speckle noise, generate ultra-high-power laser beams, and produce high-resolution shaped beams. Here, I summarize my PhD research on phase-locking large networks of coupled lasers and controlling spatiotemporal lasing modes for rapid speckle reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative phase retrieval algorithms are widely used in digital optics for their efficiency and simplicity. Conventionally, these algorithms do not consider aberrations as they assume an ideal, aberration-free optical system. Here, we propose modified iterative phase retrieval algorithms that take into account the space-invariant and space-variant point spread function of the optical system.</description>

      <title>Accessing different higher-order modes with beam self-cleaning under simple realistic tuning of initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial conditions in multimode fibers pumped by ultrashort laser pulses strongly determine the following nonlinear optical interactions. In this work we firstly compare the detailed spatial mode content of simple initial conditions, transverse offset and tilt. We then show how those initial conditions can both be used to achieve beam self-cleaning into higher-order spatial modes of a model graded-index fiber, with their own slight differences and advantages. Going beyond purely spatial initial conditions, we introduce self-cleaning results using spatial chirp at the input facet, whereby the different temporal envelopes of the spatial modes allows for tuning the self-cleaning process. Our results open up investigations into higher-dimensional tuning of nonlinear processes in multimode fibers using initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Retina electronic paper with video-rate-tunable 45000 pixels per inch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As demand for immersive experiences grows, displays are moving closer to the eye with smaller sizes and higher resolutions. However, shrinking pixel emitters reduce intensity, making them harder to perceive. Electronic Papers utilize ambient light for visibility, maintaining optical contrast regardless of pixel size, but cannot achieve high resolution. We show electrically tunable meta-pixels down to ~560 nm in size (&gt;45,000 PPI) consisting of WO3 nanodiscs, allowing one-to-one pixel-photodetector mapping on the retina when the display size matches the pupil diameter, which we call Retina Electronic Paper. Our technology also supports video display (25 Hz), high reflectance (~80%), and optical contrast (~50%), which will help create the ultimate virtual reality display.</description>

      <title>Paper-based colorimetric sensor for detection of chloride anions in water using an epoxy-silver nanocomposite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An epoxy-silver nanocomposite printed on paper was prepared for colorimetric detection of chloride anions (Cl$^-$) in aqueous solution. This paper-based sensor provides a promising platform with attractive advantages such as simple fabrication, intense colors, fast naked-eye response, and high specificity toward Cl$^-$ detection. The sensor undergoes a color change from yellow-orange to chestnut-brown in the presence of water and turns to green-brown in the presence of Cl$^-$. A good linear relationship ($R^2$=0.9754) between logarithmic Cl$^-$ concentration and the extinction intensity difference at 515 nm was observed at concentrations in the 20-400 mM range with a limit of detection (LOD) of 14 mM, far beyond the usual concentrations at which most of the Cl$^-$ colorimetric sensors are limited. It was also proposed a sensing mechanism based on the oxidative etching of anisotropic silver nanoparticles (from 20 to 250 nm) by Cl$^-$ and subsequent formation of chain-like aggregates, resulting in strong interparticle plasmonic coupling. This paper-based sensor can distinguish Cl$^-$ from other ions such as F$^{-}$, OH$^{-}$, NO$_{3}^{-}$, SO$_{4}^{2-}$, HPO$_{4}^{2-}$, H$_{2}$PO$_{4}^{-}$, H$^{+}$, K$^{+}$, Na$^{+}$, NH$_{4}^{+}$, Zn$^{2+}$, and Co$^{2+}$ and from mixtures of these ions. The nanosensor was also tested to recognize Cl$^{-}$ in seawater and a commercial electrolyte solution, even using volumes as small as 4 $\mu$L, suggesting its easy inclusion in portable devices. This novel colorimetric platform is undoubtedly useful for recognizing Cl$^-$ in environmental and physiological systems.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary state preparation in quantum harmonic oscillators using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing quantum states is a fundamental task in various quantum algorithms. In particular, state preparation in quantum harmonic oscillators (HOs) is crucial for the creation of qudits and the implementation of high-dimensional algorithms. In this work, we develop a methodology for preparing quantum states in HOs. The HO is coupled to an auxiliary qubit to ensure that any state can be prepared in the oscillator [J. Math. Phys. 59, 072101]. By applying a sequence of square pulses to both the qubit and the HO, we drive the system from an initial state to a target state. To determine the required pulses, we use a neural network that predicts the pulse parameters needed for state preparation. Specifically, we present results for preparing qubit and qutrit states in the HO, achieving average fidelities of 99.9% and 97.0%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Blinking optical tweezers for atom rearrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate an energy-efficient approach for holding and rearranging an N x M atom array using only N optical tweezers. This is achieved through the sequential release and recapture of M single atoms by a single optical tweezer. By employing a stroboscopic harmonic potential, the phase-space quadrature of the atom's probability distribution can be maintained under this "blinking" potential, provided the trap frequency meets the appropriate conditions. Proof-of-principle experiments confirm that a blinking tweezer can trap M atoms while requiring only 1 / M of the power per atom, and it can even facilitate rearrangement, demonstrated with arrays of up to M = 9 atoms. This method offers a scalable and reconfigurable platform for optical tweezer arrays, crucial for the preparation and manipulation of large-scale qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Exceptional-Point-Induced Nonequilibrium Entanglement Dynamics in Bosonic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), arising in non-Hermitian systems, have garnered significant attention in recent years, enabling advancements in sensing, wave manipulation, and mode selectivity. However, their role in quantum systems, particularly in influencing quantum correlations, remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate how EPs control multimode entanglement in bosonic chains. Using a Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) framework to describe the Heisenberg equations, we identify EPs of varying orders and uncover spectral transitions between purely real, purely imaginary, and mixed eigenvalue spectra. These spectral regions, divided by EPs, correspond to three distinct entanglement dynamics: oscillatory, exponential, and hybrid. Remarkably, we demonstrate that higher-order EPs, realized by non-integer-pi hopping phases or nonuniform interaction strengths, significantly enhance the degree of multimode entanglement compared to second-order EPs. Our findings provide a pathway to leveraging EPs for entanglement control and exhibit the potential of non-Hermitian physics in advancing quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of a SU(3) color-orbit coupling in an ultracold gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit interaction couples the spin of a particle to its motion and leads to spin-induced transport phenomena such as spin-Hall effects and Chern insulators. In this work, we extend the concept of internal-external state coupling to higher internal symmetry, exploring features beyond the established spin-orbit regime. We couple suitable resonant laser beams to a gas of ultracold atoms, thereby inducing artificial SU(3) non-Abelian gauge fields that act on a degenerate ground state manifold comprised of three dark states. We demonstrate the inherent all-state connectivity of SU(3) systems by performing targeted geometric transformations. Then, we investigate color-orbit coupling, an extension of SU(2) spin-orbit coupling to SU(3) systems. We reveal a rich dynamical interplay between three distinct oscillation frequencies, which possesses interesting analogies with neutrino oscillations and quark mixing mechanisms. In the future, the system should provide a testbed for exploring topological properties of SU(3) systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric origin of self-intersection points in non-Hermitian energy spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian energy spectra under periodic boundary conditions can form closed loops in the complex energy plane, a phenomenon known as point gap topology. In this paper, we investigate the self-intersection points of such non-Hermitian energy spectra and reveal their geometric origins. We rigorously demonstrate that these self-intersection points result from the intersection of the auxiliary generalized Brillouin zone and the Brillouin zone in one-band systems, as confirmed by an extended Hatano-Nelson model. This finding is further generalized to multi-band systems, illustrated through a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Moreover, we address multiple self-intersection points and derive the geometric conditions for general n-fold self-intersection points. Our results enhance the fundamental understanding of generic non-Hermitian quantum systems and provide theoretical support for further experimental investigations of energy self-intersection points.</description>

      <title>Real-Field Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference of Indistinguishable Coherent Photons via Long Optical Injection-Locking over 50 km Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) has garnered significant attention for its potential to enable security-loophole-free quantum communication. Successful MDI-QKD protocols rely on performing a two-photon Bell-state measurement at an intermediate node, with a high-visibility Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference pattern between two independent coherent photons being crucial. In this study, we present a novel approach for developing indistinguishable coherent photon sources over 50 km of optical fiber in a real-world setting. We introduce the long optical injection-locking (long-OIL) technique, which enables frequency locking between two long-distance coherent photons beyond the coherence length of the master laser. Using the long-OIL technique, we achieved time-resolved HOM interference with a visibility of 48(2)%, approaching the theoretical 50% limit for two independent continuous-wave coherent photons. Our results demonstrate that the long-OIL platform is a promising solution for MDI-QKD with repeaterless secret key capacity.</description>

      <title>Tracking electron capture processes in classical molecular dynamics simulations for spectral line broadening in plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma spectroscopy is a fundamental tool for diagnosing laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. Accurate interpretation of spectra depends upon precise modeling and comprehension of Stark-broadening and other mechanisms affecting spectral lines. In this context, computer simulations have emerged as invaluable tools, offering \textit{idealized experiments} with well-defined conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations, in particular, excel at replicating the particle interactions within the plasma and their impact on the state of a radiating atom or ion. However, these simulations present challenges in tracking electron capture processes, since setting an unambiguous criterion to distinguish between bound and free electrons is not trivial. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm that, within a classical framework, precisely identifies the scenario in which an electron is captured by an ion and then follows a stable orbit around it. The algorithm's applicability extends to emitters with charges Z &gt;= 1. Importantly, the procedure enables the correct identification of valid time-histories of the electric microfield perturbing the emitting ion, which will be used for subsequent line shape calculations. As a result, our simulations naturally and accurately incorporate the effects of both strong collisions and electron capture phenomena on spectral line broadening.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum nonlinear Maxwell-Bloch equations for the two-level active medium single-mode laser are solved without adiabatic elimination of the medium polarization in the LED regime, when the population fluctuation spectrum is much narrower than the radiation field and polarization spectra. It is shown that population fluctuations can significantly increase the output power and the collective Rabi splitting of a superradiant LED.</description>

      <title>Experimental validation of boson sampling using detector binning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a testing strategy for boson samplers that is based on efficiently computable expressions for the output photon counting distributions binned over multiple optical modes. We apply this method to validate boson sampling experiments with three photons on a reconfigurable photonic chip, which implements a four-mode interferometer, analyzing 50 Haar-random unitary transformations while tuning photon distinguishability via controlled delays. We show that for high values of indistinguishability, the experiment accurately reproduces the ideal boson sampling binned-mode distributions, which exhibit variations that depend both on the specific interferometer implemented as well as the choice of bin, confirming the usefulness of the method to diagnose imperfections such as partial distinguishability or imperfect chip control. Finally, we analyze the behavior of Haar-averaged binned-mode distributions with partial distinguishability and demonstrate analytically that its variance is proportional to the average of the square of the photons' indistinguishability parameter. These findings highlight the central role of binning in boson sampling validation, offering a scalable and efficient framework for assessing multiphoton interference and experimental performance.</description>

      <title>Learning Electromagnetic Metamaterial Physics With ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Gemini, LlaMa, and Claude are trained on massive quantities of text parsed from the internet and have shown a remarkable ability to respond to complex prompts in a manner often indistinguishable from humans. For all-dielectric metamaterials consisting of unit cells with four elliptical resonators, we present a LLM fine-tuned on up to 40,000 data that can predict the absorptivity spectrum given a text prompt that only specifies the metasurface geometry. Results are compared to conventional machine learning approaches including feed-forward neural networks, random forest, linear regression, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). Remarkably, the fine-tuned LLM (FT-LLM) achieves a comparable performance across large dataset sizes with a deep neural network. We also explore inverse problems by asking the LLM to predict the geometry necessary to achieve a desired spectrum. LLMs possess several advantages over humans that may give them benefits for research, including the ability to process enormous amounts of data, find hidden patterns in data, and operate in higher-dimensional spaces. This suggests they may be able to leverage their general knowledge of the world to learn faster from training data than traditional models, making them valuable tools for research and analysis.</description>

      <title>10$^{-15}$-level laser stabilization down to fiber thermal noise limit using self-homodyne detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a self-homodyne detection method to stabilize a continuous-wave 1550-nm laser to a 1-km optical fiber delay line, achieving a frequency instability of 6.3x10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt; at a 16-ms averaging time. This result, limited by fiber thermal noise, is achieved without the need for a vacuum system, highlighting the potential of our approach for ultra-stable laser systems in non-laboratory environments. The system utilizes only a few passive fiber optic components and a single balanced photodetector, significantly simplifying the laser stabilization process while maintaining high performance. The entire optical setup is compactly packaged in a portable metal air-tight case.</description>

      <title>Novel and Simple Method for Broadband Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtosecond, broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy is a popular approach to measuring molecular dynamics with excellent signal-to-noise and spectral resolution. We present a new method for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy that employs Kerr-instability amplification to amplify the supercontinuum spectrum from sapphire and create a highly tunable Raman probe spectrum spanning from -6000 to 0 cm^(-1). Our method, called Kerr-instability amplification for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy (KAB-SRS) avoids the pitfalls of optical parametric amplifiers by producing a broader and more tunable spectrum at a fraction of the cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by measuring the stimulated Raman loss spectrum of 1-decanol.</description>

      <title>Photonic classification on a single diffractive layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic computation started to shape the future of fast, efficient and accessible computation. The advantages brought by light based Diffractive Deep Neural Networks (D2NN), are shown to be overwhelmingly advantageous especially in targeting classification problems. However, cost and complexity of multi-layer systems are the main challenges that reduce the deployment of this technology. In this study, we develop a simple yet extremely efficient way to achieve optical classification using a single diffractive optical layer. A spatial light modulator is used not only to emulate the classifying system but also the input medium. We show that using a simple interpretable linear classifier, images can be classified at the speed of light. We perform classification of road signs under the effect of noise and demonstrate that we can successfully classify input images with more than 90% accuracy even with 13% noise/imperfection.</description>

      <title>Topological Switching via Exceptional Point Pairs in an Optical Microcavity Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional mode switching mechanisms, which rely on dynamically encircling exceptional points (EPs) through non-adiabatic transitions (NATs), suffer from intrinsic nonlinear dynamics that hinder precise control and reproducibility in experimental settings. Additionally, these methods exhibit low transmission efficiencies due to path-dependent attenuation, limiting their effectiveness in optical switching and logic gate applications. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel mode switching approach that leverages a pair of EPs configuration in an optical microcavity, characterized by superradiance and subradiance. This mechanism exploits the topological structure of the Riemann surface to enable robust mode switching control and tunable Q-factor through purely adiabatic encircling. Furthermore, topological protection validated via braid isotopy ensures robustness against noise and parametric perturbations, facilitating a compact, robust, and adaptive non-Hermitian system.</description>

      <title>Bright Heralded Single-Photon Source Saturating Theoretical Single-photon Purity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-photon source is the cornerstone for modern quantum information processing. The present work derives the theoretical limit of single-photon purity for general parametric heralded single-photon sources, and subsequently demonstrates a bright, gigahertz-pulsed heralded source with the purity saturating the limit. By stimulating spontaneous four-wave mixing effect in the silicon spiral waveguide, this on-chip source is measured to have a coincidence rate exceeding 1.5~MHz at a coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR) of 16.77 in the photon pair correlation experiment. The single-photon purity of this source, quantified by the heralded auto-correlation function $g^{(2)}_\text{h}(0)$, is measured by a heralded Hanbury Brown--Twiss setup to reach the theoretical limit with the lowest value of $0.00094 \pm 0.00002$ obtained at a coincidence rate of 0.8~kHz and a CAR of 2220. The performance improvements are attributed to effective spectral filtering suppressing the noise as well as the coherent pump condition helped by optical injection locking. The reported results provide a reliable standard for benchmarking heralded single-photon sources and present a state-of-the-art heralded source for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Transverse orbital angular momentum and polarization entangled spatiotemporal structured light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intra-system entanglement occurs between non-separable modes within the same system. For optical systems, the various degrees of freedom of light represent different modes, and the potential use of light to create higher dimensional classical entangle states offers a promising potential to drive new technological developments. In this work, we present experimental results demonstrating the orthogonality between transverse orbital angular momentum (t-OAM) of different spatiotemporal topological charges, a previously unverified property of t-OAM. Based on those results, we developed methods to create and characterize a novel family of t-OAM and polarization entangled spatiotemporal structured light. We further provide theoretical analysis to support our study of the entanglement between those modes. By demonstrating the feasibility of leveraging t-OAM as a new family of modes for classical entanglement, our work represents a new advancement towards higher dimensional classical entanglement strategies.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent radiative lifetime measurement of the $6^1\Sigma_g^+(v=9,J=31)$ state of sodium molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the measurement of radiative lifetimes of the $6^1\Sigma_g^+(v=9,J=31)$ state of gas-phase molecular sodium using a high-resolution double-resonance spectroscopy. Measurements were done using a time-correlated photon counting technique at various pressures and temperatures. Lifetimes were extracted from extrapolations to the zero buffer gas pressure, called Stern-Volmer plot, and the temperature-dependence of the radiative lifetimes were measured over a temperature range from 593 K to 653 K. Our result agrees well within the error limits with the theoretical calculations.</description>
