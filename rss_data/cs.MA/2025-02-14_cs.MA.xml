      <title>Centrally Coordinated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Power Grid Topology Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power grid operation is becoming more complex due to the increase in generation of renewable energy. The recent series of Learning To Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions have encouraged the use of artificial agents to assist human dispatchers in operating power grids. However, the combinatorial nature of the action space poses a challenge to both conventional optimizers and learned controllers. Action space factorization, which breaks down decision-making into smaller sub-tasks, is one approach to tackle the curse of dimensionality. In this study, we propose a centrally coordinated multi-agent (CCMA) architecture for action space factorization. In this approach, regional agents propose actions and subsequently a coordinating agent selects the final action. We investigate several implementations of the CCMA architecture, and benchmark in different experimental settings against various L2RPN baseline approaches. The CCMA architecture exhibits higher sample efficiency and superior final performance than the baseline approaches. The results suggest high potential of the CCMA approach for further application in higher-dimensional L2RPN as well as real-world power grid settings.</description>

      <title>Single-Agent Planning in a Multi-Agent System: A Unified Framework for Type-Based Planners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general problem where an agent is in a multi-agent environment and must plan for herself without any prior information about her opponents. At each moment, this pivotal agent is faced with a trade-off between exploiting her currently accumulated information about the other agents and exploring further to improve future (re-)planning. We propose a theoretic framework that unifies a spectrum of planners for the pivotal agent to address this trade-off. The planner at one end of this spectrum aims to find exact solutions, while those towards the other end yield approximate solutions as the problem scales up. Beyond theoretical analysis, we also implement \textbf{13} planners and conduct experiments in a specific domain called \textit{multi-agent route planning} with the number of agents \textbf{up to~50}, to compare their performaces in various scenarios. One interesting observation comes from a class of planners that we call \textit{safe-agents} and their enhanced variants by incorporating domain-specific knowledge, which is a simple special case under the proposed general framework, but performs sufficiently well in most cases. Our unified framework, as well as those induced planners, provides new insights on multi-agent decision-making, with potential applications to related areas such as mechanism design.</description>

      <title>Learning in Strategic Queuing Systems with Small Buffers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Routers in networking use simple learning algorithms to find the best way to deliver packets to their desired destination. This simple, myopic and distributed decision system makes large queuing systems simple to operate, but at the same time, the system needs more capacity than would be required if all traffic were centrally coordinated. In a recent paper, Gaitonde and Tardos (EC 2020 and JACM 2023) initiate the study of such systems, modeling them as an infinitely repeated game in which routers compete for servers and the system maintains a state (number of packets held by each queue) resulting from outcomes of previous rounds. Queues get to send a packet at each step to one of the servers, and servers attempt to process only one of the arriving packets, modeling routers. However, their model assumes that servers have no buffers at all, so queues have to resend all packets that were not served successfully. They show that, even with hugely increased server capacity relative to what is needed in the centrally-coordinated case, ensuring that the system is stable requires using timestamps and priority for older packets. We consider a system with two important changes, which make the model more realistic: first we add a very small buffer to each server, allowing it to hold on to a single packet to be served later (even if it fails to serve it); and second, we do not require timestamps or priority for older packets. Our main result is to show that when queues are learning, a small constant factor increase in server capacity, compared to what would be needed if centrally coordinating, suffices to keep the system stable, even if servers select randomly among packets arriving simultaneously. This work contributes to the growing literature on the impact of selfish learning in systems with carryover effects between rounds: when outcomes in the present round affect the game in the future.</description>

      <title>PathFinder: A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent System for Medical Diagnostic Decision-Making Applied to Histopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diagnosing diseases through histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) is fundamental in modern pathology but is challenged by the gigapixel scale and complexity of WSIs. Trained histopathologists overcome this challenge by navigating the WSI, looking for relevant patches, taking notes, and compiling them to produce a final holistic diagnostic. Traditional AI approaches, such as multiple instance learning and transformer-based models, fail short of such a holistic, iterative, multi-scale diagnostic procedure, limiting their adoption in the real-world. We introduce PathFinder, a multi-modal, multi-agent framework that emulates the decision-making process of expert pathologists. PathFinder integrates four AI agents, the Triage Agent, Navigation Agent, Description Agent, and Diagnosis Agent, that collaboratively navigate WSIs, gather evidence, and provide comprehensive diagnoses with natural language explanations. The Triage Agent classifies the WSI as benign or risky; if risky, the Navigation and Description Agents iteratively focus on significant regions, generating importance maps and descriptive insights of sampled patches. Finally, the Diagnosis Agent synthesizes the findings to determine the patient's diagnostic classification. Our Experiments show that PathFinder outperforms state-of-the-art methods in skin melanoma diagnosis by 8% while offering inherent explainability through natural language descriptions of diagnostically relevant patches. Qualitative analysis by pathologists shows that the Description Agent's outputs are of high quality and comparable to GPT-4o. PathFinder is also the first AI-based system to surpass the average performance of pathologists in this challenging melanoma classification task by 9%, setting a new record for efficient, accurate, and interpretable AI-assisted diagnostics in pathology.

      <title>SkyRover: A Modular Simulator for Cross-Domain Pathfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) increasingly collaborate in logistics, surveillance, inspection tasks and etc. However, existing simulators often focus on a single domain, limiting cross-domain study. This paper presents the SkyRover, a modular simulator for UAV-AGV multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF). SkyRover supports realistic agent dynamics, configurable 3D environments, and convenient APIs for external solvers and learning methods. By unifying ground and aerial operations, it facilitates cross-domain algorithm design, testing, and benchmarking. Experiments highlight SkyRover's capacity for efficient pathfinding and high-fidelity simulations in UAV-AGV coordination.

      <title>Few is More: Task-Efficient Skill-Discovery for Multi-Task Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a data-driven approach, offline MARL learns superior policies solely from offline datasets, ideal for domains rich in historical data but with high interaction costs and risks. However, most existing methods are task-specific, requiring retraining for new tasks, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a task-efficient multi-task offline MARL algorithm, Skill-Discovery Conservative Q-Learning (SD-CQL). Unlike existing offline skill-discovery methods, SD-CQL discovers skills by reconstructing the next observation. It then evaluates fixed and variable actions separately and employs behavior-regularized conservative Q-learning to execute the optimal action for each skill. This approach eliminates the need for local-global alignment and enables strong multi-task generalization from limited small-scale source tasks. Substantial experiments on StarCraftII demonstrates the superior generalization performance and task-efficiency of SD-CQL. It achieves the best performance on $\textbf{10}$ out of $14$ task sets, with up to $\textbf{65%}$ improvement on individual task sets, and is within $4\%$ of the best baseline on the remaining four.</description>

      <title>AIDE: Agentically Improve Visual Language Model with Domain Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enhancement of Visual Language Models (VLMs) has traditionally relied on knowledge distillation from larger, more capable models. This dependence creates a fundamental bottleneck for improving state-of-the-art systems, particularly when no superior models exist. We introduce AIDE (Agentic Improvement through Domain Experts), a novel framework that enables VLMs to autonomously enhance their capabilities by leveraging specialized domain expert models. AIDE operates through a four-stage process: (1) identifying instances for refinement, (2) engaging domain experts for targeted analysis, (3) synthesizing expert outputs with existing data, and (4) integrating enhanced instances into the training pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MMMU, MME, MMBench, etc., demonstrate AIDE's ability to achieve notable performance gains without relying on larger VLMs nor human supervision. Our framework provides a scalable, resource-efficient approach to continuous VLM improvement, addressing critical limitations in current methodologies, particularly valuable when larger models are unavailable to access.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gaps: Logical English, Prolog, and Multi-agent Systems for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a modular system for representing and reasoning with legal aspects of traffic rules for autonomous vehicles. We focus on a subset of the United Kingdom's Highway Code (HC) related to junctions. As human drivers and automated vehicles (AVs) will interact on the roads, especially in urban environments, we claim that an accessible, unitary, high-level computational model should exist and be applicable to both users. Autonomous vehicles introduce a shift in liability that should not bring disadvantages or increased burden on human drivers. We develop a system "in silico" of the model.  The proposed system is built of three main components: a natural language interface, using Logical English, which encodes the rules; an internal representation of the rules in Prolog; and an multi-agent-based simulation environment, built in NetLogo. The three components interact: Logical English is translated into and out of Prolog (along with some support code); Prolog and NetLogo interface via predicates. Such a modular approach enables the different components to carry different "burdens" in the overall system; it also allows swapping of modules. Given NetLogo, we can visualize the effect of the modeled rules as well as validate the system with a simple dynamic running scenario. Designated agents monitor the behaviour of the vehicles for compliance and record potential violations where they occur. The information on potential violations is then utilized by Validators, to determine whether the violation is punishable, differentiating between exceptions and cases.</description>

      <title>Exact Leader Estimation: A New Approach for Distributed Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel strategy aimed at cooperatively differentiating a signal among multiple interacting agents is introduced, where none of the agents needs to know which agent is the leader, i.e. the one producing the signal to be differentiated. Every agent communicates only a scalar variable to its neighbors; except for the leader, all agents execute the same algorithm. The proposed strategy can effectively obtain derivatives up to arbitrary $m$-th order in a finite time under the assumption that the $(m+1)$-th derivative is bounded. The strategy borrows some of its structure from the celebrated homogeneous robust exact differentiator by A. Levant, inheriting its exact differentiation capability and robustness to measurement noise. Hence, the proposed strategy can be said to perform robust exact distributed differentiation. In addition, and for the first time in the distributed leader-observer literature, sampled-data communication and bounded measurement noise are considered, and corresponding steady-state worst-case accuracy bounds are derived. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified numerically for second- and fourth-order systems, i.e., for estimating derivatives of up to first and third order, respectively.</description>

      <title>KIMAs: A Configurable Knowledge Integrated Multi-Agent System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge-intensive conversations supported by large language models (LLMs) have become one of the most popular and helpful applications that can assist people in different aspects. Many current knowledge-intensive applications are centered on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. While many open-source RAG frameworks facilitate the development of RAG-based applications, they often fall short in handling practical scenarios complicated by heterogeneous data in topics and formats, conversational context management, and the requirement of low-latency response times. This technical report presents a configurable knowledge integrated multi-agent system, KIMAs, to address these challenges. KIMAs features a flexible and configurable system for integrating diverse knowledge sources with 1) context management and query rewrite mechanisms to improve retrieval accuracy and multi-turn conversational coherency, 2) efficient knowledge routing and retrieval, 3) simple but effective filter and reference generation mechanisms, and 4) optimized parallelizable multi-agent pipeline execution. Our work provides a scalable framework for advancing the deployment of LLMs in real-world settings. To show how KIMAs can help developers build knowledge-intensive applications with different scales and emphases, we demonstrate how we configure the system to three applications already running in practice with reliable performance.</description>

      <title>Rendering Wireless Environments Useful for Gradient Estimators: A Zero-Order Stochastic Federated Learning Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-device federated learning (FL) is a growing machine learning setting whereby multiple edge devices collaborate to train a model without disclosing their raw data. With the great number of mobile devices participating in more FL applications via the wireless environment, the practical implementation of these applications will be hindered due to the limited uplink capacity of devices, causing critical bottlenecks. In this work, we propose a novel doubly communication-efficient zero-order (ZO) method with a one-point gradient estimator that replaces communicating long vectors with scalar values and that harnesses the nature of the wireless communication channel, overcoming the need to know the channel state coefficient. It is the first method that includes the wireless channel in the learning algorithm itself instead of wasting resources to analyze it and remove its impact. We then offer a thorough analysis of the proposed zero-order federated learning (ZOFL) framework and prove that our method converges \textit{almost surely}, which is a novel result in nonconvex ZO optimization. We further prove a convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{K}})$ in the nonconvex setting. We finally demonstrate the potential of our algorithm with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Sable: a Performant, Efficient and Scalable Sequence Model for MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) progresses towards solving larger and more complex problems, it becomes increasingly important that algorithms exhibit the key properties of (1) strong performance, (2) memory efficiency and (3) scalability. In this work, we introduce Sable, a performant, memory efficient and scalable sequence modeling approach to MARL. Sable works by adapting the retention mechanism in Retentive Networks to achieve computationally efficient processing of multi-agent observations with long context memory for temporal reasoning. Through extensive evaluations across six diverse environments, we demonstrate how Sable is able to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in a large number of diverse tasks (34 out of 45 tested). Furthermore, Sable maintains performance as we scale the number of agents, handling environments with more than a thousand agents while exhibiting a linear increase in memory usage. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to isolate the source of Sable's performance gains and confirm its efficient computational memory usage.</description>
