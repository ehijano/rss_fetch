      <title>On generalisations of conciseness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the notions of conciseness and semiconciseness, we show that these properties are not equivalent by proving that a word originally presented by Ol'shanskii is semiconcise but not concise. We further establish that every $1/m$-concise word is semiconcise by proving that when the group word $w$ takes finitely many values in $G$, the iterated commutator subgroup $[w(G), G, \stackrel{(m)}{\dots}, G]$ is finite for some $m \in \mathbb{N}$ if and only if $[w(G), G]$ is finite.</description>

      <title>Finiteness properties of Subgroups of Houghton Groups of full Hirsch length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $n\in \{1,2,3, \ldots\}$, the $n$th Houghton group $H_n$ is the group of those permutations permutations $g$ of the ray set $\{1, \ldots, n\} \times \mathbb{N}$ that are eventually translations along each ray in the sense that there exists $j_0$ depending on $g$ and a vector $(t_1,...,t_n)\in\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ also depending on $g$, such that for all $1\le i\le n$, and all $j\ge j_0$, $$(i,j)g=(i,j+t_i)$$ For all $n\ge 1$, $H_n$ affords an epimorphism to $\mathbb{Z}^{n-1}$ whose kernel is the set of finitary permutations of the ray set. K. S. Brown showed that $H_n$ has type $\operatorname{F}_{n-1}$ but not type $\operatorname{FP}_n$, meaning that $H_n$ has an Eilenberg--MacLane space with finite $(n-1)$-skeleton but does not have an Eilenberg--MacLane with finite $n$-skeleton. We show that, provided $n\ge3$, the same conclusion holds for subgroups $G$ of $H_n$ that are large in the sense that there is an epimorphism $G\twoheadrightarrow\mathbb{Z}^{n-1}$.
  Our results depend on a generalised form of the Jordan--Wielandt theorem for intransitive permutation groups, as well as a structural analysis of permutational wreath products that allows for distinct chandelier groups associated with distinct orbits when the permutation representation is intransitive.</description>

      <title>On finitely generated left nilpotent braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A description of finitely generated left nilpotent braces of class at most two is presented in this paper. The description heavily depends on the fact that if $B$ is left nilpotent of class at most $2$, that is $B^3 = 0$, then $B$ is right nilpotent of class at most $3$, that is $B^{(4)} = 0$. In addition, we construct a free object in the category of finitely generated left nilpotent braces of class at most $2$.</description>

      <title>Lie type quotients of the maximal unipotent subgroup of Kac-Moody groups of type $\mathrm{HB}_{2}^{(2)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we construct infinite families $(G_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of finite simple groups $G_n$ of Lie type, such that the rank of $G_n$ strictly increases as $n$ tends to infinity, and such that each $G_n$ is a quotient of the maximal unipotent subgroup $U^+$ of the (minimal) Kac-Moody group $\mathfrak{G}_{A}(\mathbb{K})$ of type $\mathrm{HB}_{2}^{(2)}$ over a finite field $\mathbb{K}$. Moreover, we show that the quotient maps lead to the construction of an infinite family of bounded degree spectral high-dimensional expanders. These provide the first class of examples of infinite families of high-dimensional expanders constructed from Lie type groups of unbounded rank.</description>

      <title>A simultaneous Abels-Margulis-Soifer lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Abels-Margulis-Soifer lemma states that if a semigroup $\Gamma$ acts strongly irreducibly by linear transformations on a finite-dimensional real vector space, then any element of $\Gamma$ can be multiplied by an element of some fixed finite subset of $\Gamma$ so that it becomes proximal (i.e. it acts on the corresponding projective space with an attracting fixed point and a repelling projective hyperplane) and even uniformly proximal (i.e. the distance between the attracting fixed point and the repelling projective hyperplane is uniformly bounded from below and the contraction towards the attracting fixed point is uniformly strong). We prove a version of this lemma simultaneously for linear representations of a semigroup $\Gamma$, acting on the corresponding projective spaces, and for representations of $\Gamma$ to isometry groups of (not necessarily proper) Gromov hyperbolic metric spaces, acting on the corresponding Gromov boundaries.</description>

      <title>Geometric models and asymptotic dimension for infinite-type surface mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be an infinite-type surface and let $G \leq \operatorname{Map}(S)$ be a locally bounded Polish subgroup. We construct a metric graph $M$ of simple arcs and curves on $S$ preserved by the action of $G$ and for which the vertex orbit map $G \to V(M)$ is a coarse equivalence; if $G$ is boundedly generated, then $M$ is a Cayley--Abels--Rosendal graph for $G$ and the orbit map is a quasi-isometry. In particular, if $S$ contains a non-displaceable subsurface and $G \geq \operatorname{PMap}_c(S)$ is boundedly generated or $G \in \{\overline{\operatorname{PMap}_c(S)}, \operatorname{PMap}(S), \operatorname{Map}(S) \}$ and is locally bounded, then $\operatorname{asdim} M = \operatorname{asdim} G = \infty$. This result completes the classification of the asymptotic dimension of stable boundedly generated infinite-type surface mapping class groups begun by Grant--Rafi--Verberne.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A random rooted graph is said to be sofic if it is the Benjamini-Schramm limit of a sequence of finite graphs. Given any finite graph $H$, we prove that every one-ended, unimodular random rooted graph that does not have H as a minor must be sofic. The hypothesis regarding the number of ends can be dropped under the additional assumption that the graph is quasi-transitive.</description>

      <title>On the proportion of derangements in affine classical groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit formulas for the proportion of derangements and of derangements of $p$-power order in the affine unitary group $AU_m(q)$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ of characteristic $p$. Both formulas rely on a result of independent interest concerning integer partitions: we obtain a generating function for partitions $\lambda=(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_m)$ into $m$ parts, for which $\lambda_1=1$ or there exists $k \in \{2, \dots,m\}$ such that $\lambda_{k-1}&gt;\lambda_k=k$. Moreover, when $p$ is odd, we conjecture remarkably simple formulas for the proportions of derangements in the finite affine symplectic group $ASp_{2m}(q)$, and in the affine orthogonal groups $AO_{2m+1}(q)$ and $AO^{\pm}_{2m}(q)$, and we also propose conjectures for the proportions of derangements of $p$-power order. We further reduce the proofs of these conjectures to establishing three $q$-polynomial identities.</description>

      <title>The Euler characteristic of an endotrivial complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $k$ a field of prime characteristic $p$. We examine the Lefschetz homomorphism $\Lambda: \mathcal{E}_k(G) \to O(T(kG))$ from the group of endotrivial complexes, i.e. the Picard group of the bounded homotopy category of $p$-permutation modules $K^b({}_{kG}\mathbf{triv})$, to the orthogonal unit group of the Grothendieck group of $K^b({}_{kG}\mathbf{triv})$, i.e. the trivial source ring. When $p = 2$ and $k = \mathbb{F}_2$, $\Lambda$ is surjective when $G$ has a Sylow $2$-subgroup with fusion controlled by its normalizer, and when $G$ has dihedral Sylow $2$-subgroups. When $p$ is odd, $\Lambda$ is surjective if $G$ has a cyclic Sylow $p$-subgroup or is $p$-nilpotent, but we exhibit examples of groups of $p$-rank 2 or greater for which $\Lambda$ is not surjective. We also examine the kernel of the Lefschetz homomorphism, determining it for all groups when $p = 2$ and for groups with cyclic Sylow $p$-subgroups when $p$ is odd.</description>

      <title>Dilations of non-Markovian dynamical systems on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To generalise evolutions families we consider systems of contractions $\{\varphi(u, v)\}_{(u, v) \in E}$ defined on the edges of a graph $\mathcal{G} = (\Omega, E)$. In this setup the Markov property, or \emph{divisibility}, can be modelled via $\varphi(u, v)\varphi(v, w) = \varphi(u, w)$ for edges $(u, v), (v, w), (u, w) \in E$. We obtain results in three settings: 1) contractive Banach space operators; 2) positive unital maps on $C^{\ast}$-algebras}; and 3) CPTP-maps on trace class operators on a Hilbert space. In the discrete setting we are able to dilate possibly indivisible families of contractions to divisible families of operators with 'nice' properties (viz. surjective isometries resp. $C^{\ast}$-algebraic automorphisms resp. unitary representations). In the special case of linearly ordered graphs equipped with the order topology, we establish sufficient conditions for strongly continuous dilations of possibly indivisible families in the Banach space and $C^{\ast}$-algebra contexts. To achieve these results we work with string-rewriting systems, and make use of and extend dilation theorems of Stroescu [42], Kraus [23, 24], and vom Ende--Dirr [46].</description>

      <title>Counting Salem numbers arising from arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between Salem numbers and short geodesics has been fruitful in quantitative studies of arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds, particularly in dimensions 2 and 3. In this article, we push these connections even further. The primary goals are: (1) to bound the proportion of Salem numbers of degree up to $n+1$ in the commensurability class of classical arithmetic lattices in any odd dimension $n$; (2) to improve lower bounds for the strong exponential growth of averages of multiplicities in the geodesic length spectrum of non-compact arithmetic orbifolds. In order to accomplish these goals, we bound, for a fixed square-free integer $D$, the count of Salem numbers with minimal polynomial $f$ satisfying $f(1)f(-1)=-D$ in $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}/\mathbb{Q}^{\times 2}$. To do this, we make use of results on the distribution of Salem numbers, as well as classical methods for counting Pythagorean triples and Gauss' lattice-counting argument. To this end, we give a generalization of the count of Pythagorean triples and provide an elementary proof which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Weyl groups and rigidity of von Neumann algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a noncompact semisimple algebraic group with trivial center, $S &lt; G$ a maximal split torus, $H &lt; G$ the centralizer of $S$ in $G$ and $\Gamma &lt; G$ an irreducible lattice. Consider the group measure space von Neumann algebra $\mathscr M = \operatorname{L}(\Gamma \curvearrowright G/H)$ associated with the nonsingular action $\Gamma \curvearrowright G/H$ and regard the group von Neumann algebra $M = \operatorname{L}(\Gamma)$ as a von Neumann subalgebra $M \subset \mathscr M$. We show that the group $\operatorname{Aut}_M(\mathscr M)$ of all unital normal $\ast$-automorphisms of $\mathscr M$ acting identically on $M$ is isomorphic to the Weyl group $\mathscr W_G$ of the semisimple algebraic group $G$. Our main theorem is a noncommutative analogue of a rigidity result of Bader-Furman-Gorodnik-Weiss for group actions on algebraic homogeneous spaces and moreover gives new insight towards Connes' rigidity conjecture for higher rank lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if $G$ is a finitely generated RFRS group of cohomological dimension $2$, then $G$ is virtually free-by-cyclic if and only if $b_2^{(2)}(G) = 0$. This answers a question of Wise and generalises and gives a new proof of a recent theorem of Kielak and Linton, where the same result is obtained under the additional hypotheses that $G$ is virtually compact special and hyperbolic. More generally, we show that if $G$ is a RFRS group of cohomological dimension $n$ and of type $\mathrm{FP}_{n-1}$, then $G$ admits a virtual map to $\mathbb Z$ with kernel of rational cohomological dimension $n-1$ if and only if $b_n^{(2)}(G) = 0$.</description>

      <title>The maximal rank of a string group generated by involutions for alternating groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A string group generated by involutions, or SGGI, is a pair $\Gamma=(G, S)$, where $G$ is a group and $S=\{\rho_0,\ldots, \rho_{r-1}\}$ is an ordered set of involutions generating $G$ and satisfying the commuting property: $$\forall i,j\in\{0,\ldots, r-1\}, \;|i-j|\ne 1\Rightarrow (\rho_i\rho_j)^2=1.$$ When $S$ is an independent set, the rank of $\Gamma$ is the cardinality of $S$. We determine an upper bound for the rank of an SGGI over the alternating group of degree $n$. Our bound is tight when $n\equiv 0,1,4\pmod 5$.</description>

Abstract: We show that every automorphism of a free metabelian Lie algebra $M_n$ of rank $n\geq 4$ over an arbitrary field $K$ is almost tame, that is, it is a product of so-called Chein automorphisms (or one-row transformations). Moreover, we show that the group of all automorphisms $\mathrm{Aut}(M_n)$ of $M_n$ of rank $n\geq 4$ over a field $K$ of characteristic $\neq 3$ is generated by all linear automorphisms, as well as one quadratic and one cubic automorphism. The same result holds for fields of any characteristic if $n\geq 5$.
  We also show that all Chein automorphisms of lower degree $\geq 4$ and all exponential automorphisms of lower degree $\geq 5$ are tame, which contradicts the results of \cite{BN,OE}.</description>

      <title>On Minimal Generating Sets of Splitting Field and Cluster Towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of cluster towers was introduced by the second author and Krithika in [4] along with a question which was answered by the first author and Bhagwat in [1]. In this article we introduce the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting field and connect it to the concept of cluster towers. We establish that there exist infinitely many irreducible polynomials over rationals for which the splitting field has two extreme minimal generating sets (one of given cardinality and other of minimum cardinality) and for which we have two extreme minimal cluster towers (one of given length and other of minimum length). More generally, we establish that for a certain family of polynomials over the rationals, we have minimal generating sets of all cardinalities in a certain range and that these are the only possible cardinalities for minimal generating set for such a polynomial. We also establish an equivalent condition for a set to be minimum minimal generating set for this family of polynomials and count the total number of minimum minimal generating sets. We prove interesting properties of cluster tower associated with minimal generating set that we constructed in proof of the first theorem and as a consequence get that degree sequence depends on the ordering even when we work with minimal generating set.</description>

      <title>Associated groups of symmetric quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23507v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the structure of associated groups of symmetric quandles. Among other results, we explore the relationship between the associated group of a symmetric quandle and that of its underlying quandle. We provide a group-theoretic characterization of associated groups of symmetric quandles. Furthermore, we show that a symmetric quandle is embeddable if and only if its underlying quandle is embeddable, and we determine the abelianization of these associated groups.</description>
