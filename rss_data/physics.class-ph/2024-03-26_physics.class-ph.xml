      <title>Investigations on Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a novel approach to simulate complex physical systems on the basis of both data observations and physical models. In this work, we investigate the use of PINNs for various applications in aerodynamics and we explain how to leverage their specific formulation to perform some tasks effectively. In particular, we demonstrate the ability of PINNs to construct parametric surrogate models, to achieve multiphysic couplings and to infer turbulence characteristics via data assimilation. The robustness and accuracy of the PINNs approach are analysed, then current issues and challenges are discussed.</description>

      <title>Bayesian estimation of dissipation and sound speed in tube measurements using a transfer-function model</title>

Abstract: This study discusses acoustic dissipation, which contributes to inaccuracies in impedance tube measurements. To improve the accuracy of these measurements, this paper introduces a transfer function model that integrates diverse dissipation prediction models. Bayesian inference is used to estimate the important parameters included in these models, describing dissipation originating from various mechanisms, sound speed, and microphone positions. By using experimental measurements and considering a hypothetical air layer in front of a rigid termination as the material under test, Bayesian parameter estimation allows a substantial enhancement in characterization accuracy by incorporating the dissipation and sound speed estimates. This approach effectively minimizes residual absorption coefficients attributed to both boundary-layer effects and air medium relaxation. Incorporation of dissipation models leads to a substantial reduction (to 1%) in residual absorption coefficients. Moreover, the use of accurately estimated parameters further enhances the accuracy of actual tube measurements of materials using the two-microphone transfer function method.</description>

      <title>Toward Local Madelung Mechanics in Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that relativistic quantum theory leads to a local interpretation of quantum mechanics wherein the universal wavefunction in configuration space is entirely replaced with an ensemble of local fluid equations in spacetime. For want of a fully relativistic quantum fluid treatment, we develop a model using the nonrelativistic Madelung equations, and obtain conditions for them to be local in spacetime. Every particle in the Madelung fluid is equally real, and has a definite position, momentum, kinetic energy, and potential energy. These are obtained by defining quantum momentum and kinetic energy densities for the fluid and separating the momentum into average and symmetric parts, and kinetic energy into classical kinetic and quantum potential parts. The two types of momentum naturally give rise to a single classical kinetic energy density, which contains the expected kinetic energy, even for stationary states, and we define the reduced quantum potential as the remaining part of the quantum kinetic energy density. We treat the quantum potential as a novel mode of internal energy storage within the fluid particles, which explains most of the nonclassical behavior of the Madelung fluid. For example, we show that in tunneling phenomena the quantum potential negates the barrier so that nothing prevents the fluid from flowing through. We show how energy flows and transforms in this model, and that enabling local conservation of energy requires defining a quantum potential energy current that flows through the fluid rather than only flowing with it. The nonrelativistic treatment generally contains singularities in the velocity field, which undermines the goal of local dynamics, but we expect a proper relativistic treatment will bound the fluid particle velocities at $c$.</description>

      <title>The Nature of the Action Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that our recently developed theory of electric field wave propagation in anisotropic and inhomogeneous brain tissues, which has been shown to explain a broad range of observed coherent synchronous brain electrical processes, also explains the spiking behavior of single neurons, thus bridging the gap between the fundamental element of brain electrical activity (the neuron) and large-scale coherent synchronous electrical activity.
  Our analysis indicates that the membrane interface of the axonal cellular system can be mathematically described by a nonlinear system with several small parameters. This allows for the rigorous derivation of an accurate yet simpler nonlinear model following the formal small parameter expansion. The resulting action potential model exhibits a smooth, continuous transition from the linear wave oscillatory regime to the nonlinear spiking regime, as well as a critical transition to a non-oscillatory regime. These transitions occur with changes in the criticality parameter and include several different bifurcation types, representative of the various experimentally detected neuron types.
  This new theory overcomes the limitations of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, such as the inability to explain extracellular spiking, efficient brain synchronization, saltatory conduction along myelinated axons, and a variety of other observed coherent macroscopic brain electrical phenomena. We also show that the standard cable axon theory can be recovered by our approach, using the very crude assumptions of piece-wise homogeneity and isotropy. However, the diffusion process described by the cable equation is not capable of supporting action potential propagation across a wide range of experimentally reported axon parameters.</description>
