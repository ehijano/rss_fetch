      <title>Weak minimizing property on pairs of classical Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the minimum modulus analogue of the weak maximizing property, termed the \emph{weak minimizing property}. We establish that the pairs $(\ell_p, L^p[0, 1])$ for $2 \leq p &lt; \infty$ and $(\ell_s \oplus_q \ell_q, \ell_r \oplus_p \ell_p)$ for $1 &lt; p \leq r\leq s \leq q &lt; \infty$ satisfy the weak minimizing property. Conversely, we prove that the pairs $(\ell_1, \ell_p)$, $(\ell_1, c_0)$, $(\ell_1, \ell_1)$ and $(c_0, \ell_p)$ fail to satisfy the weak minimizing property.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff characterizations of first countable T1 spaces via fixed point theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two notions of a contractive orbit of a set-valued map defined in a first countable space. The first defines the contraction with respect to the topology of the underlying space while the second defines the contraction with respect to a generalized distance function. We characterize the Hausdorff property of first countable $T_1$ spaces via fixed point theorems for set-valued maps with a contractive orbit satisfying some additional assumptions. As an application, we derive a sufficient condition for a function to attain a strong minimum and generalize Cantor's intersection theorem for a sequence of closed nested sets with diameters converging to 0.</description>

      <title>Sampling in the Euclidean Motion Group and a Problem from Brain's Primary Visual Cortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a sampling problem for the abstract wavelet transform associated with the quasiregular representation of the $SE(2)$ group, for a modulated gaussian mother wavelet. This problem is motivated by the behavior of brain's primary visual cortex. We provide a characterization in terms of a dual Gramian matrix, and study numerically the relationships among the parameters defining the sampling and the mother wavelet.</description>

      <title>Spectral constants for the quantum annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find several new estimates for the spectral constants $K(\mathbb A_r)$ for which a closed annulus $\overline{\mathbb A}_r$ or closed polyannulus $\overline{\mathbb A}^n_r$ is a $K$-spectral set for operators in the quantum annulus $\mathbb Q \mathbb A_r$. We give two alternative proofs to an existing estimate of spectral constant. The first proof capitalizes a dilation theorem due to McCullough and Pascoe, while the second proof involves a certain variety in the Euclidean biball. For commuting and doubly commuting operators in $\mathbb Q \mathbb A_r$, we find upper and lower bounds for the smallest spectral constants.</description>

      <title>A variant of Tingley's problem for positive unit spheres of continuous functions that vanish at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S(C_0(X))^+$ and $S(C_0(Y))^+$ denote the positive parts of the unit spheres of $C_0(X)$ and $C_0(Y)$, where $X$ and $Y$ are locally compact Hausdorff spaces. We prove that every surjective isometry from $S(C_0(X))^+$ onto $S(C_0(Y))^+$ is a composition operator induced by a homeomorphism between $X$ and $Y$ . As a consequence, such a map extends to a surjective reallinear isometry from $C_0(X)$ onto $C_0(Y)$. We also characterize surjective phase-isometries on the positive unit sphere.</description>

      <title>Connes trace theorem for Carnot manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wodzicki residue is the unique trace on the algebra of classical pseudodifferential operators on a closed manifold, and Connes in 1988 proved that it coincides with the Dixmier trace. A Carnot manifold is a manifold $M$ whose tangent bundle $TM$ is equipped with a nested family $H$ of sub-bundles $H_0\leq H_1 \leq \cdots \leq TM$ which defines a filtration of the Lie algebra of vector fields on $M.$ Differential operators on Carnot manifolds have their order measured in terms of the filtration defined by $H,$ and the algebra of differential operators can be extended to an algebra of pseudodifferential operators. Recently, Dave-Haller and Couchet-Yuncken proposed definitions of a residue functional on the algebra of pseudodifferential operators adapted to a Carnot manifold. We prove that Connes' trace theorem holds in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain how to formulate Voiculescu's non-commutative Riemann sphere framework for fully matricial functions \cite{v10} within the theory of nc functions developed by Vinnikov and Kaliuzhnyi-Verbovetskyi \cite{kvv14}. We then extend this framework from the Riemann sphere to Grassmannians (and flag manifolds). Moreover, as an example of nc functions in this setting, we introduce a generalization of Voiculescu's non-commutative resolvent on the Riemann sphere, study a corresponding generalization of the resolvent equation, and discuss aspects of the spectral analysis of unbounded operators in Voiculescu's framework \cite{v10}.</description>

      <title>Large Coupling Convergence Beyond Definiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18055v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study convergence of operator families of the form $A_\beta = A + \beta B$ towards an effective operator defined on $\ker(B)$, as the coupling constant $\beta$ tends to infinity. Crucially, we focus on the setting where neither $A$ nor $B$ can be assumed to be positive- (or negative-) semi-definite. We are hence outside the classical form-theoretic framework, where results based on Kato's monotone convergence theorem would be applicable. Thus, instead of form methods, our approach builds on classical resolvent identities to study convergence of the family $\{A_\beta\}_{\beta}$. Our findings are that: (i) \emph{Strong} resolvent convergence holds (without further spectral assumptions) if $A + \beta B$ is self-adjoint and the compression of $A$ onto $\ker(B)$ is well behaved. (ii) Under the more detailed assumption that $0 \in \sigma(B)$ is isolated, \emph{norm} resolvent convergence can be established even if $A+\beta B$ is merely closed, provided the quasinilpotent part of $B$ at zero vanishes and certain conditions on the interplay of $A$ and $B$ are met. Importantly, if $B$ is not self-adjoint we find that the limit operator not only depends on $\ker(B)$ as a Hilbert space, but crucially also on the precise form of the Riesz projector at $0 \in \sigma(B)$ onto $\ker(B)$.</description>

      <title>Di-Graphs with tightly connected Clusters: Effective Graph Laplacians and Resolvent Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18057v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study Laplacians on graphs for which connectivity within certain subgraphs tends to infinity. Our main focus are graphs sharing a common node set on which edge weights within certain clusters grow to infinity. As intra-cluster connectivity increases, we show that the corresponding graph Laplacians converge -- in the resolvent sense -- to an effective graph Laplacian. This effective limit Laplacian is defined on a coarsened graph, where each highly connected cluster is collapsed into a single node. In the undirected setting, the effective Laplacian arises naturally from aggregating over tightly connected clusters. In the directed case, the limiting graph structure depends on the precise manner in which connectivity increases; with the corresponding effects mediated by the left and right kernel structure of the Laplacian restricted to high-connectivity clusters. Our results shed light on the emergence of coarse-grained dynamics in large-scale networks and contribute to spectral graph theory of directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Use of operator defect identities in multi-channel signal plus residual-analysis via iterated products and telescoping energy-residuals: Applications to kernels in machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new operator theoretic framework for analysis of complex systems with intrinsic subdivisions into components, taking the form of "residuals" in general, and "telescoping energy residuals" in particular. We prove new results which yield admissibility/effectiveness, and new a priori bounds on energy residuals. Applications include infinite-dimensional Kaczmarz theory for $\lambda_{n}$-relaxed variants, and $\lambda_{n}$-effectiveness. And we give applications of our framework to generalized machine learning algorithms, greedy Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), proving explicit convergence results, residual energy decomposition, and criteria for stability under noise.</description>

      <title>Discretization, sampling, and the Fourier ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive fundamental sampling bounds for smooth signals in continuous settings without sparsity assumptions. By introducing the Fourier ratio as a measure of spectral compressibility induced by smoothness, we obtain explicit, deterministic bounds linking signal regularity to recoverability from incomplete random samples. For functions in $C^{2}([0,1]^{2})$ sampled on an $N$ by $N$ grid, we show that a random subset of spatial samples of size $$ C\frac{r_{N}^{2}}{\eps^{2}}\log(r_{N}/\eps)^{2}\log(N^{2}) $$ suffices, with high probability, to recover the entire discretized signal via $\ell^{1}$ minimization with relative $L^{2}$ error $O(\eps)$. We develop a parallel theory for bandlimited functions on the unit sphere, obtaining analogous recovery guarantees with sample complexity scaling polylogarithmically in the bandwidth. Our results establish smoothness as a deterministic prior that enforces compressibility in the Fourier domain, bridging continuous harmonic analysis with discrete compressed sensing in a unified information-theoretic framework.</description>

      <title>A Mosco sufficient condition for intrinsic stability of non-unique convex Empirical Risk Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) stability is usually studied via single-valued outputs, while convex non-strict losses yield set-valued minimizers. We identify Painlev\'e-Kuratowski upper semicontinuity (PK-u.s.c.) as the intrinsic stability notion for the ERM solution correspondence (set-level Hadamard well-posedness) and a prerequisite to interpret stability of selections. We then characterize a minimal non-degenerate qualitative regime: Mosco-consistent perturbations and locally bounded minimizers imply PK-u.s.c., minimal-value continuity, and consistency of vanishing-gap near-minimizers. Quadratic growth yields explicit quantitative deviation bounds.</description>

      <title>The existence of solutions of Schr\"odinger equations with essence resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current paper investigates a class of asymptotically linear Schrodinger equations. The Palais-Smale condition fails to hold in this case. Especially under the hypothesis (V2), the lack of compactness occurs at the interaction between nonlinear term and continuum spectrum. For this reason, we introduce a bootstrap iteration approach for elliptic equation on RN. The iteration is self-contained and can be regarded as a generalization of Agmon-Douglis-Nirenberg theorem. The proof characterizes iteration steps independent of the choice of the parameter, which are indeed manipulated by intrinsic natures of potentials and nonlinear terms, and furthermore presents precise estimates for asymptotically linear functions or continuous nonlinear terms restricted on a bounded domain in RN. Additionally, a comparison theorem for the spectrum of Schrodinger operator is also established in this paper. With above preparations, we can get a nontrivial solution without mountain pass geometry, and more importantly make an explicit description of nondegeneracy of solutions with monotonicity hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue optimization in higher dimensions and $p$-harmonic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove existence results for optimization problems for the $k$th Laplace eigenvalue on closed Riemannian manifolds of dimension $m \geq 3$, depending on the choice of normalization. One such normalization leads to eigenvalue optimization within a conformal class, for which existence of maximizers was previously known only in dimension two. We also prove that all absolutely continuous maximizers of the normalized eigenvalue functionals are always induced by $p$-harmonic maps into spheres, where $p \in [2,m]$. For $p$ sufficiently close to $m$, the maximizers are smooth, whereas for $p&lt;m$ no bubbling occurs. A key tool in our analysis is the application of techniques from the theory of topological tensor products, which appear to be well suited for studying eigenvalue-related optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Delta_n$ and $Q_n$ denote the regular $n$-simplex of side length $\sqrt{2}$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and the volume one cube in $\mathbb{R}^n$, respectively. We derive a closed-form formula for the hyperplane volume projections of $\Delta_n$, which also yields the directions achieving the extremal volume. Moreover, we revisit the problem of extremal planar projections of $Q_n$. In addition, we present generalizations within the framework of $L_p$-projection bodies.</description>

      <title>Fractal functions defined in terms of number representations in systems with a redundant alphabet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For fixed natural numbers $r$ and $s$, where $2\leq s \leq r$, we consider a representation of numbers from the interval $[0;\frac{r}{s-1}]$ obtained by encoding numbers by means of the alphabet $A=\{0,1,...,r\}$ via the expansion $x=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}s^{-n}\alpha_n=\Delta^{r_s}_{\alpha_1\alpha_2...\alpha_n...}.$ The algorithm for expanding a number into such a series is justified in the paper. The geometry of this representation is studied, including the geometric meaning of digits, properties of cylinder sets -- particularly the specificity of their overlaps -- and metric relations, as well as the connection between the representation and partial sums of the corresponding series.
  The paper also presents results on the study of a function $f$ defined by $f(x=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\alpha_n}{(r+1)^n})=\Delta^{r_s}_{\alpha_1\alpha_2...\alpha_n...}, \alpha_n\in A.$ It is proved that the function $f$ is continuous at every point that has a unique representation in the classical numeration system with base $r+1$, and discontinuous at points having two representations. The function has unbounded variation and a self-affine graph. For $r&lt;2s-1$, the function possesses singleton, finite, countable, and continuum level sets, including fractal ones; for $r&gt;2s-2$, every level set is a continuum, and moreover it is fractal or anomalously fractal.</description>

      <title>Triangle functions generated by products of quantales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates triangle functions induced by tensor products of triangular norms and conorms. For any left continuous t-norm $T$ on $[0,1]$ and any right continuous t-conorm $L$ on $[0,\infty]$, the tensor product $L\otimes T$ induces a triangle function on $\Delp$, giving rise to a partially ordered monoid structure on $(\Delta^+, L \otimes T)$. The main results are as follows: (1) if $L$ is continuous, then $\tau_{T,L}$ is a triangle function on $\Delp$ if and only if $\tau_{T,L}=L\otimes T$, which in turn holds if and only if $L$ satisfies the property (LCS); (2) for $\CDp$, the set of all non-defective distance distribution functions, $(\CDp,L\otimes T)$ forms a submonoid of $(\Delp,L\otimes T)$ if and only if $L$ has no zero divisors; (3)for $\CDp_c$, the set of all continuous distance distribution functions, if the t-norm $T$ is continuous, then $(\CDp_c,L\otimes T)$ is a subsemigroup of $(\Delp,L\otimes T)$ if and only if $L$ satisfies the property (LS). Furthermore, $(\CDp_c,L\otimes T)$ is an ideal of $(\CDp, L\otimes T)$ if and only if $L$ adheres to the cancellation law.</description>

      <title>Rearrangement-invariant norms commuting with dilations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study rearrangement-invariant spaces $X$ over $[0,\infty)$ for which there exists a function $h:(0,\infty)\to (0,\infty)$ such that \[ \|D_rf\|_X = h(r)\|f\|_X \] for all $f\in X$ and all $r&gt;0$, where $D_r$ is the dilation operator. It is shown that this may hold only if $h(r)=r^{-\frac1p}$ for all $r&gt;0$, in which case the norm $\|\cdot\|_X$ is called $p$-homogeneous. We investigate which types of r.i. spaces satisfy this condition and show some important embedding properties.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Operators, Linear Functionals and RKHS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a commuting $n$-tuple of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space, together with a distinguished cyclic vector, Jim Agler defined a linear functional $\Lambda_{\mathbf{T},h}$ on the polynomial ring $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{z},\bar{\mathbf{z}}]$. ``Near subnormality properties'' of an operator $T$ are translated into positivity properties of $\Lambda_{T,h}$. In this paper, we approach ``near subnormality properties'' in a different way by answering the following question: when is $\Lambda_{\mathbf{T},h}$ given by a compactly supported distribution? The answer is in terms of the off-diagonal growth condition of a two-variable kernel function $F_{\mathbf{T},h}$ on $\mathbb{C}^n$. Using the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) defined by the kernel function $F_{\mathbf{T},h}$, we give a function model for all cyclic commuting $n$-tuples. This potentially gives a different approach to operator models. The reproducing kernels of the Fock space are used in the construction of $F_{\mathbf{T},h}$, but one may also replace the Fock space by other RKHS. We give many examples in the last section.</description>

      <title>Non-negative polynomials on generalized elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cone of non-negative polynomials on generalized elliptic curves. We show that the zero set of every extreme ray has dense real points. If a generalized elliptic curve is embedded via a complete linear system, then we show that the convex hull of its real points (taken inside any affine chart containing all real points) is a spectrahedron. On the way, we generalize a result by Geyer--Martens on 2-torsion points in the Picard group of smooth real curves (of arbitrary genus) to possibly singular and reducible ones.</description>

      <title>Extension of $p$-compact operators in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze various consequences in relation to the extension of operators $T:X\to Y$ that are $p$-compact, as well as the extension of operators $T:X\to Y$ whose adjoints $T^*:Y^*\to X^*$ are $p$-compact. In most cases, we discuss these extension properties when the underlying spaces, either domain or codomain, are $P_\lambda$ spaces. We also answer if these extensions are almost norm-preserving in such circumstances where the extension $\widetilde{T}$ of a $T$ exists. It is observed that an operator can often be extended to a larger domain when the codomain is appropriately extended as well. Specific assumptions might enable us to obtain an extension of an operator that maintains the same range. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for a Banach space to be $L_1$-predual.</description>

      <title>Spectral comparison of compound cocycles generated by delay equations in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02537v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study linear cocycles generated by nonautonomous delay equations in a suitable Hilbert space and their extensions, called compound cocycles, to exterior powers. Using a recent version of the frequency theorem, we develop analytical techniques for comparing spectral properties, such as uniform exponential dichotomies, between such cocycles and semigroups generated by stationary equations. These methods are based on properties related to regularity and structure in PDEs associated with delay equations. In particular, the developed machinery leads to effective robust criteria that guarantee the absence of closed invariant contours on global attractors arising in nonlinear problems and are expected to ensure global stability.</description>

      <title>Functional calculus and semilinear evolution equations for the Taibleson operator on non-Archimedean local fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10508v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any non-Archimedean local field $\mathbb{K}$ and any integer $n \geq 1$, we show that the Taibleson operator admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty(\Sigma_\theta)$ functional calculus on the Bochner space $\mathrm{L}^p(\mathbb{K}^n,Y)$ for any $\mathrm{UMD}$ Banach function space $Y$ and any angle $\theta &gt; 0$, where $\Sigma_\theta=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| &lt; \theta \}$ and $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. Moreover, we prove that it even admits a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus of order $\frac{3}{2}$. In our study, we explore harmonic analysis on locally compact Spector-Vilenkin groups establishing the $R$-boundedness of a family of convolution operators. Our results enhance the understanding of functional calculi of operators acting on vector-valued $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces associated with totally disconnected spaces. As an application, we obtain maximal regularity results and well-posedness for a class of evolution equations driven by the Taibleson operator.</description>

      <title>H\"older regularity of harmonic functions on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a H\"older regularity condition for harmonic functions on metric measure spaces and prove that, under a slow volume regular condition and an upper heat kernel estimate, the H\"older regularity condition, the weak Bakry-\'Emery non-negative curvature condition, H\"older continuity of the heat kernel (with or without exponential terms), and the near-diagonal lower bound for the heat kernel are equivalent. As applications, first, we establish the validity of the so-called generalized reverse H\"older inequality on the Sierpi\'nski carpet cable system, resolving an open problem left by Devyver, Russ, Yang (Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN (2023), no. 18, 15537-15583). Second, we prove that two-sided heat kernel estimates alone imply gradient estimates for the heat kernel on strongly recurrent fractal-like cable systems, improving the main results of the aforementioned paper. Third, we obtain H\"older (Lipschitz) estimates for the heat kernel on strongly recurrent metric measure spaces, extending the classical Li-Yau gradient estimate for the heat kernel on Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Almost sharp variational estimates for discrete truncated operators of Stein-Wainger type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish $r$-variational estimates for discrete truncated Stein-Wainger type operators on $\ell^p$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Notably, these estimates are sharp and enhance the results obtained by Krause and Roos (J. Eur. Math. Soc. 2022, J. Funct. Anal. 2023), up to a logarithmic loss related to the scale. On the other hand, as $r$ approaches infinity, the consequences align with the estimates proved by Krause and Roos. Moreover, for the case of quadratic phases, we remove this logarithmic loss with respect to the scale in two and higher dimensions, at the cost of increasing $p$ slightly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact second countable groupoid with a Haar system. In this article, we introduce the induced representation of $G$ from a continuous unitary representation of a closed wide subgroupoid $H$ with a Haarsystem provided there exists a full equivariant system of measures $\mu=\{\mu^{u}\}_{u\in G^{0}}$ on $G/H$. We prove some basic properties of induced representation and a theorem on induction in stages. A groupoid version of Mackey's tensor product theorem is also provided. We also prove a groupoid version of Frobenius Reciprocity theorem on compact transitive groupoids.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Wasserstein regularization, defective local concentration and a cutoff criterion beyond non-negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Notions of positive curvature have been shown to imply many remarkable properties for Markov processes, in terms, e.g., of regularization effects, functional inequalities, mixing time bounds and, more recently, the cutoff phenomenon. In this work, we are interested in a relaxed variant of Ollivier's coarse Ricci curvature, where a Markov kernel $P$ satisfies only a weaker Wasserstein bound $W_p(\mu P, \nu P) \leq K W_p(\mu,\nu)+M$ for constants $M\ge 0, K\in [0,1], p \ge 1$. Under appropriate additional assumptions on the one-step transition measures $\delta_x P$, we establish (i) a form of local concentration, given by a defective Talagrand inequality, and (ii) an entropy-transport regularization effect. We consider as illustrative examples the Langevin dynamics and the Proximal Sampler when the target measure is a log-Lipschitz perturbation of a log-concave measure. As an application of the above results, we derive criteria for the occurrence of the cutoff phenomenon in some negatively curved settings.</description>
