      <title>The Future of Food: How Artificial Intelligence is Transforming Food Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is accelerating a new era of food innovation, connecting data from farm to consumer to improve formulation, processing, and health outcomes. Recent advances in deep learning, natural language processing, and multi-omics integration make it possible to understand and optimize food systems with unprecedented depth. However, AI adoption across the food sector remains uneven due to heterogeneous datasets, limited model and system interoperability, and a persistent skills gap between data scientists and food domain experts. To address these challenges and advance responsible innovation, the AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems (AIFS) convened the inaugural AI for Food Product Development Symposium at University of California, Davis, in October 2025. This white paper synthesizes insights from the symposium, organized around five domains where AI can have the greatest near-term impact: supply chain; formulation and processing; consumer insights and sensory prediction; nutrition and health; and education and workforce development. Across the areas, participants emphasized the importance of interoperable data standards, transparent and interpretable models, and cross-sector collaboration to accelerate the translation of AI research into practice. The discussions further highlighted the need for robust digital infrastructure, privacy-preserving data-sharing mechanisms, and interdisciplinary training pathways that integrate AI literacy with domain expertise. Collectively, the priorities outline a roadmap for integrating AI into food manufacturing in ways that enhance innovation, sustainability, and human well-being while ensuring that technological progress remains grounded in ethics, scientific rigor, and societal benefit.</description>

      <title>Just Asking Questions: Doing Our Own Research on Conspiratorial Ideation by Generative AI Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive chat systems that build on artificial intelligence frameworks are increasingly ubiquitous and embedded into search engines, Web browsers, and operating systems, or are available on websites and apps. Researcher efforts have sought to understand the limitations and potential for harm of generative AI, which we contribute to here. Conducting a systematic review of six AI-powered chat systems (ChatGPT 3.5; ChatGPT 4 Mini; Microsoft Copilot in Bing; Google Search AI; Perplexity; and Grok in Twitter/X), this study examines how these leading products respond to questions related to conspiracy theories. This follows the platform policy implementation audit approach established by Glazunova et al. (2023). We select five well-known and comprehensively debunked conspiracy theories and four emerging conspiracy theories that relate to breaking news events at the time of data collection. Our findings demonstrate that the extent of safety guardrails against conspiratorial ideation in generative AI chatbots differs markedly, depending on chatbot model and conspiracy theory. Our observations indicate that safety guardrails in AI chatbots are often very selectively designed: generative AI companies appear to focus especially on ensuring that their products are not seen to be racist; they also appear to pay particular attention to conspiracy theories that address topics of substantial national trauma such as 9/11 or relate to well-established political issues. Future work should include an ongoing effort extended to further platforms, multiple languages, and a range of conspiracy theories extending well beyond the United States.</description>

      <title>Sovereign AI: Rethinking Autonomy in the Age of Global Interdependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a foundational general-purpose technology, raising new dilemmas of sovereignty in an interconnected world. While governments seek greater control over it, the very foundations of AI--global data pipelines, semiconductor supply chains, open-source ecosystems, and international standards--resist enclosure. This paper develops a conceptual and formal framework for understanding sovereign AI as a continuum rather than a binary condition, balancing autonomy with interdependence. Drawing on classical theories, historical analogies, and contemporary debates on networked autonomy, we present a planner's model that identifies two policy heuristics: equalizing marginal returns across the four sovereignty pillars and setting openness where global benefits equal exposure risks.
  We apply the model to India, highlighting sovereign footholds in data, compute, and norms but weaker model autonomy. The near-term challenge is integration via coupled Data x Compute investment, lifecycle governance (ModelOps), and safeguarded procurement. We then apply the model to the Middle East (Saudi Arabia and the UAE), where large public investment in Arabic-first models and sovereign cloud implies high sovereignty weights, lower effective fiscal constraints, and strong Data x Compute complementarities. An interior openness setting with guardrails emerges as optimal. Across contexts, the lesson is that sovereignty in AI needs managed interdependence, not isolation.</description>

      <title>It's Not the AI - It's Each of Us! Ten Commandments for the Wise &amp; Responsible Use of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer futuristic; it is a daily companion shaping our private and work lives. While AI simplifies our lives, its rise also invites us to rethink who we are - and who we wish to remain - as humans. Even if AI does not think, feel, or desire, it learns from our behavior, mirroring our collective values, biases, and aspirations. The question, then, is not what AI is, but what we are allowing it to become through data, computing power, and other parameters "teaching" it - and, even more importantly, who we are becoming through our relationship with AI.
  As the EU AI Act and the Vienna Manifesto on Digital Humanism emphasize, technology must serve human dignity,social well-being, and democratic accountability. In our opinion, responsible use of AI is not only a matter of code nor law, but also of conscientious practice: how each of us engages and teaches others to use AI at home and at work. We propose Ten Commandments for the Wise and Responsible Use of AI are meant as guideline for this very engagement. They closely align with Floridi and Cowls' five guiding principles for AI in society - beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability.</description>

      <title>Writing With Machines and Peers: Designing for Critical Engagement with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing integration of generative AI in higher education is transforming how students write, learn, and engage with knowledge. As AI tools become more integrated into classrooms, there is an urgent need for pedagogical approaches that help students use them critically and reflectively. This study proposes a pedagogical design that integrates AI and peer feedback in a graduate-level academic writing activity. Over eight weeks, students developed literature review projects through multiple writing and revision stages, receiving feedback from both a custom-built AI reviewer and human peers. We examine two questions: (1) How did students interact with and incorporate AI and peer feedback during the writing process? and (2) How did they reflect on and build relationships with both human and AI reviewers? Data sources include student writing artifacts, AI and peer feedback, AI chat logs, and student reflections. Findings show that students engaged differently with each feedback source-relying on AI for rubric alignment and surface-level edits, and on peer feedback for conceptual development and disciplinary relevance. Reflections revealed evolving relationships with AI, characterized by increasing confidence, strategic use, and critical awareness of its limitations. The pedagogical design supported writing development, AI literacy, and disciplinary understanding. This study offers a scalable pedagogical model for integrating AI into writing instruction and contributes insights for system-level approaches to fostering meaningful human-AI collaboration in higher education.</description>

      <title>A time for monsters: Organizational knowing after LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping organizational knowing by unsettling the epistemological foundations of representational and practice-based perspectives. We conceptualize LLMs as Haraway-ian monsters, that is, hybrid, boundary-crossing entities that destabilize established categories while opening new possibilities for inquiry. Focusing on analogizing as a fundamental driver of knowledge, we examine how LLMs generate connections through large-scale statistical inference. Analyzing their operation across the dimensions of surface/deep analogies and near/far domains, we highlight both their capacity to expand organizational knowing and the epistemic risks they introduce. Building on this, we identify three challenges of living with such epistemic monsters: the transformation of inquiry, the growing need for dialogical vetting, and the redistribution of agency. By foregrounding the entangled dynamics of knowing-with-LLMs, the paper extends organizational theory beyond human-centered epistemologies and invites renewed attention to how knowledge is created, validated, and acted upon in the age of intelligent technologies.</description>

      <title>Tracking financial crime through code and law: a review of regtech applications in anti-money laundering and terrorism financing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regulatory technology (RegTech) is transforming financial compliance by integrating advanced information technologies to strengthen anti money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML CFT) frameworks. Recent literature suggests that such technologies represent more than just an efficiency tool; they mark a paradigm shift in regulation and the evolution of financial oversight (Kurum, 2023). This paper aims to provide a narrative review of recent RegTech applications in financial crime prevention, with a focus on key compliance domains. A structured literature review was conducted to examine publications between 2020 and 2024 with a thematic synthesis of findings related to customer due diligence (CDD) and know your customer (KYC), transaction monitoring, regulatory reporting and compliance automation, information sharing and cross border cooperation, as well as cost efficiency. Findings reveal that RegTech solutions give financial institutions more responsibility for detecting and managing financial crime risks, making them more active players in compliance processes traditionally overseen by regulators. The combined use of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and big data also generates synergistic effects that improve compliance outcomes beyond what these technologies achieve individually. This demonstrates the strategic relevance of integrated RegTech approaches.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Ethical and Societal Impacts of Generative AI in Higher Computing Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) presents societal and ethical challenges related to equity, academic integrity, bias, and data provenance. In this paper, we outline the goals, methodology and deliverables of their collaborative research, considering the ethical and societal impacts of GenAI in higher computing education. A systematic literature review that addresses a wide set of issues and topics covering the rapidly emerging technology of GenAI from the perspective of its ethical and societal impacts is presented. This paper then presents an evaluation of a broad international review of a set of university adoption, guidelines, and policies related to the use of GenAI and the implications for computing education. The Ethical and Societal Impacts-Framework (ESI-Framework), derived from the literature and policy review and evaluation, outlines the ethical and societal impacts of GenAI in computing education. This work synthesizes existing research and considers the implications for computing higher education. Educators, computing professionals and policy makers facing dilemmas related to the integration of GenAI in their respective contexts may use this framework to guide decision-making in the age of GenAI.</description>

      <title>The Evolving Ethics of Medical Data Stewardship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healthcare stands at a critical crossroads. Artificial Intelligence and modern computing are unlocking opportunities, yet their value lies in the data that fuels them. The value of healthcare data is no longer limited to individual patients. However, data stewardship and governance has not kept pace, and privacy-centric policies are hindering both innovation and patient protections. As healthcare moves toward a data-driven future, we must define reformed data stewardship that prioritizes patients' interests by proactively managing modern risks and opportunities while addressing key challenges in cost, efficacy, and accessibility.
  Current healthcare data policies are rooted in 20th-century legislation shaped by outdated understandings of data-prioritizing perceived privacy over innovation and inclusion. While other industries thrive in a data-driven era, the evolution of medicine remains constrained by regulations that impose social rather than scientific boundaries. Large-scale aggregation is happening, but within opaque, closed systems. As we continue to uphold foundational ethical principles - autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice - there is a growing imperative to acknowledge they exist in evolving technological, social, and cultural realities.
  Ethical principles should facilitate, rather than obstruct, dialogue on adapting to meet opportunities and address constraints in medical practice and healthcare delivery. The new ethics of data stewardship places patients first by defining governance that adapts to changing landscapes. It also rejects the legacy of treating perceived privacy as an unquestionable, guiding principle. By proactively redefining data stewardship norms, we can drive an era of medicine that promotes innovation, protects patients, and advances equity - ensuring future generations advance medical discovery and care.</description>

      <title>Comparative Security Performance of Workday Cloud ERP Across Key Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Workday is a cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning-ERP system that brings HR, Finance, Supply Chain functions , Prism Analytics and Extend custom built in application together under an integrated software as a service SaaS environment. As every organization that undergoes digital transformation, the importance of securing sensitive enterprise data in cloud ERP systems has always been more challeging. To analyze Workday's security architecture, we present a Security analysis in both CIA Triad Enhanced Framework and Zero Trust Security Architecture. The study examines five key dimensions confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, and compliance with weighted sub metric analysis and qualitative document review. The results show Workday delivers a composite score of 0.86 with an overall score that closely matches international standards of best practices like GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.
  The platform uses encryption protocols, granular access controls, network safeguards, and continuous verification mechanisms to enable least-privilege access and adaptive defense. Security groups and business process access rules provide scalable governance across very large organizational structures.Workday's layered security to tackle everyday cloud security weaknesses. The work concludes that Workday's architecture demonstrates the best practices for secure, scalable, and compliant ERP application-oriented deployment, which can make this a standard for enterprise cloud security management. These insights provide important guidance for organizations that wish to bolster their cloud ERP defenses and stay ahead of changing regulatory expectations.</description>

      <title>The Loss of Control Playbook: Degrees, Dynamics, and Preparedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research report addresses the absence of an actionable definition for Loss of Control (LoC) in AI systems by developing a novel taxonomy and preparedness framework. Despite increasing policy and research attention, existing LoC definitions vary significantly in scope and timeline, hindering effective LoC assessment and mitigation. To address this issue, we draw from an extensive literature review and propose a graded LoC taxonomy, based on the metrics of severity and persistence, that distinguishes between Deviation, Bounded LoC, and Strict LoC. We model pathways toward a societal state of vulnerability in which sufficiently advanced AI systems have acquired or could acquire the means to cause Bounded or Strict LoC once a catalyst, either misalignment or pure malfunction, materializes. We argue that this state becomes increasingly likely over time, absent strategic intervention, and propose a strategy to avoid reaching a state of vulnerability. Rather than focusing solely on intervening on AI capabilities and propensities potentially relevant for LoC or on preventing potential catalysts, we introduce a complementary framework that emphasizes three extrinsic factors: Deployment context, Affordances, and Permissions (the DAP framework). Compared to work on intrinsic factors and catalysts, this framework has the unfair advantage of being actionable today. Finally, we put forward a plan to maintain preparedness and prevent the occurrence of LoC outcomes should a state of societal vulnerability be reached, focusing on governance measures (threat modeling, deployment policies, emergency response) and technical controls (pre-deployment testing, control measures, monitoring) that could maintain a condition of perennial suspension.</description>

      <title>Can Online GenAI Discussion Serve as Bellwether for Labor Market Shifts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has generated considerable speculation regarding their transformative potential for labor markets. However, existing approaches to measuring AI exposure in the workforce predominantly rely on concurrent market conditions, offering limited predictive capacity for anticipating future disruptions. This paper presents a predictive study examining whether online discussions about LLMs can function as early indicators of labor market shifts. We employ four distinct analytical approaches to identify the domains and timeframes in which public discourse serves as a leading signal for employment changes, thereby demonstrating its predictive validity for labor market dynamics. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset that integrates the REALM corpus of LLM discussions, LinkedIn job postings, Indeed employment indices, and over 4 million LinkedIn user profiles, we analyze the relationship between discussion intensity across news media and Reddit forums and subsequent variations in job posting volumes, occupational net change ratios, job tenure patterns, unemployment duration, and transitions to GenAI-related roles across thirteen occupational categories. Our findings reveal that discussion intensity predicts employment changes 1-7 months in advance across multiple indicators, including job postings, net hiring rates, tenure patterns, and unemployment duration. These findings suggest that monitoring online discourse can provide actionable intelligence for workers making reskilling decisions and organizations anticipating skill requirements, offering a real-time complement to traditional labor statistics in navigating technological disruption.</description>

      <title>An Agent-Based Simulation of Regularity-Driven Student Attrition: How Institutional Time-to-Live Constraints Create a Dropout Trap in Higher Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High dropout rates in engineering programmes are conventionally attributed to student deficits: lack of academic preparation or motivation. However, this view neglects the causal role of "normative friction": the complex system of administrative rules, exam validity windows, and prerequisite chains that constrain student progression. This paper introduces "The Regularity Trap," a phenomenon where rigid assessment timelines decouple learning from accreditation. We operationalize the CAPIRE framework into a calibrated Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulating 1,343 student trajectories across a 42-course Civil Engineering curriculum. The model integrates empirical course parameters and thirteen psycho-academic archetypes derived from a 15-year longitudinal dataset. By formalizing the "Regularity Regime" as a decaying validity function, we isolate the effect of administrative time limits on attrition. Results reveal that 86.4% of observed dropouts are driven by normative mechanisms (expiry cascades) rather than purely academic failure (5.3%). While the overall dropout rate stabilized at 32.4%, vulnerability was highly heterogeneous: archetypes with myopic planning horizons faced attrition rates up to 49.0%, compared to 13.2% for strategic agents, despite comparable academic ability. These findings challenge the neutrality of administrative structures, suggesting that rigid validity windows act as an invisible filter that disproportionately penalizes students with lower self-regulatory capital.</description>

Abstract: The growing adoption of algorithm-powered tools in journalism enables new possibilities and raises many concerns. One way of addressing these concerns is by integrating journalistic practices and values into the design of algorithms that facilitate different journalistic tasks, from automated content generation to news content distribution. In this chapter, we discuss how such integration can happen. To do this, we first introduce the concepts of algorithms and different perspectives on algorithm design and then scrutinize various journalistic viewpoints on the matter and methodological approaches for studying these perspectives and their translation into specific algorithm-powered journalistic tools. We conclude by discussing important directions for future research, ranging from contextualizing journalistic approaches to algorithm design to accounting for the transformative impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.</description>

      <title>Inclusive education via empathy propagation in schools of students with special education needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a theoretical model for identifying emergent scenarios of inclusiveness related to student with special education needs (SEN). Based on variations of the Shelling model of segregation, we explored the propagation of thinking about others as equals (empathy) in students with and without $SEN$ in school environments. We use the complex systems approach for modeling possible scenarios of inclusiveness in which patterns of empathy between students emerge instead of the well-known behavior of segregation. Based on simple transitional rules, which are evaluated by a set of null models, we show the emergence of empathy between students in school environments. Findings suggest that small variations in the incentive of students for being considered as $SEN$ generate the presence of inclusive patterns. In other situations, patterns of segregation are commonly presented.</description>

      <title>On the modular platoon-based vehicle-to-vehicle electric charging problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for a platoon-based vehicle-to-vehicle charging (PV2VC) technology designed for modular vehicles (MVs) and solve it with a genetic algorithm (GA). A set of numerical experiments with five scenarios are tested and the computational performance between the commercial software applied to the MILP model and the proposed GA are compared on a modified Sioux Falls network. By comparison with the optimal benchmark scenario, the results show that the PV2VC technology can save up to 11.07% in energy consumption, 11.65% in travel time, and 11.26% in total cost. For the PV2VC operational scenario, it would be more beneficial for long-distance vehicle routes with low initial state of charge, sparse charging facilities, and where travel time is perceived to be higher than energy consumption costs.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Complexities of Responsibly Sharing NSFW Content Online</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reddit is in the minority of mainstream social platforms that permit posting content that may be considered to be at the edge of what is permissible, including so-called Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content. However, NSFW is becoming more common on mainstream platforms, with X now allowing such material. We examine the top 15 NSFW-restricted subreddits by size to explore the complexities of responsibly sharing adult content, aiming to balance ethical and legal considerations with monetization opportunities. We find that users often use NSFW subreddits as a social springboard, redirecting readers to private or specialized adult social platforms such as Telegram, Kik or OnlyFans for further interactions. They also directly negotiate image "trades" through credit cards or payment platforms such as PayPal, Bitcoin or Venmo. Disturbingly, we also find linguistic cues linked to non-consensual content sharing. To help platforms moderate such behavior, we trained a RoBERTa-based classification model, which outperforms GPT-4 and traditional classifiers such as logistic regression and random forest in identifying non-consensual content sharing, demonstrating superior performance in this specific task. The source code and trained model weights are publicly available at https://github.com/socsys/15NSFW Subreddits.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Comparative Analysis of Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two dominant blockchain consensus mechanisms, Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), evaluated across seven critical metrics: energy use, security, transaction speed, scalability, centralization risk, environmental impact, and transaction fees. Utilizing recent academic research and real-world blockchain data, the study highlights that PoW offers robust, time-tested security but suffers from high energy consumption, slower throughput, and centralization through mining pools. In contrast, PoS demonstrates improved scalability and efficiency, significantly reduced environmental impact, and more stable transaction fees, however it raises concerns over validator centralization and long-term security maturity. The findings underscore the trade-offs inherent in each mechanism and suggest hybrid designs may combine PoW's security with PoS's efficiency and sustainability. The study aims to inform future blockchain infrastructure development by striking a balance between decentralization, performance, and ecological responsibility.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Writing Is Growing Fastest Among Non-English-Speaking and Less Established Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dominance of English in global science has long created significant barriers for non-native speakers. The recent emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) dramatically reduces drafting and revision costs, but, simultaneously, raises a critical question: how is the technology being adopted by the global scientific community, and is it mitigating existing inequities? This study provides first large-scale empirical evidence by analyzing over two million full-text biomedical publications from PubMed Central from 2021 to 2024, estimating the fraction of AI-generated content using a distribution-based framework. We observe a significant post-ChatGPT surge in AI-assisted writing, with adoption growing fastest in contexts where language barriers are most pronounced: approximately 400% in non-English-speaking countries compared to 183% in English-speaking countries. This adoption is highest among less-established scientists, including those with fewer publications and citations, as well as those in early career stages at lower-ranked institutions. Prior AI research experience also predicted higher adoption. Finally, increased AI usage was associated with a modest increase in productivity, narrowing the publication gap between scientists from English-speaking and non-English-speaking countries with higher levels of AI adoption. These findings provide large-scale evidence that generative AI is being adopted unevenly, reflecting existing structural disparities while also offering a potential opportunity to mitigate long-standing linguistic inequalities.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Multi-modal Medical Diagnosis with Demonstration Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.</description>

      <title>Digital Agriculture Sandbox for Collaborative Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital agriculture is transforming the way we grow food by utilizing technology to make farming more efficient, sustainable, and productive. This modern approach to agriculture generates a wealth of valuable data that could help address global food challenges, but farmers are hesitant to share it due to privacy concerns. This limits the extent to which researchers can learn from this data to inform improvements in farming. This paper presents the Digital Agriculture Sandbox, a secure online platform that solves this problem. The platform enables farmers (with limited technical resources) and researchers to collaborate on analyzing farm data without exposing private information. We employ specialized techniques such as federated learning, differential privacy, and data analysis methods to safeguard the data while maintaining its utility for research purposes. The system enables farmers to identify similar farmers in a simplified manner without needing extensive technical knowledge or access to computational resources. Similarly, it enables researchers to learn from the data and build helpful tools without the sensitive information ever leaving the farmer's system. This creates a safe space where farmers feel comfortable sharing data, allowing researchers to make important discoveries. Our platform helps bridge the gap between maintaining farm data privacy and utilizing that data to address critical food and farming challenges worldwide.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence and Accounting Research: A Framework and Agenda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), are fundamentally transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for scholars. This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.</description>

      <title>Future-Back Threat Modeling: A Foresight-Driven Security Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional threat modeling remains reactive-focused on known TTPs and past incident data, while threat prediction and forecasting frameworks are often disconnected from operational or architectural artifacts. This creates a fundamental weakness: the most serious cyber threats often do not arise from what is known, but from what is assumed, overlooked, or not yet conceived, and frequently originate from the future, such as artificial intelligence, information warfare, and supply chain attacks, where adversaries continuously develop new exploits that can bypass defenses built on current knowledge. To address this mental gap, this paper introduces the theory and methodology of Future-Back Threat Modeling (FBTM). This predictive approach begins with envisioned future threat states and works backward to identify assumptions, gaps, blind spots, and vulnerabilities in the current defense architecture, providing a clearer and more accurate view of impending threats so that we can anticipate their emergence and shape the future we want through actions taken now. The proposed methodology further aims to reveal known unknowns and unknown unknowns, including tactics, techniques, and procedures that are emerging, anticipated, and plausible. This enhances the predictability of adversary behavior, particularly under future uncertainty, helping security leaders make informed decisions today that shape more resilient security postures for the future.</description>

      <title>The Shawshank Redemption of Embodied AI: Understanding and Benchmarking Indirect Environmental Jailbreaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adoption of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in embodied AI agents, while being effective, brings safety concerns such as jailbreaking. Prior work have explored the possibility of directly jailbreaking the embodied agents through elaborated multi-modal prompts. However, no prior work has studied or even reported indirect jailbreaks in embodied AI, where a black-box attacker induces a jailbreak without issuing direct prompts to the embodied agent. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, indirect environmental jailbreak (IEJ), a novel attack to jailbreak embodied AI via indirect prompt injected into the environment, such as malicious instructions written on a wall. Our key insight is that embodied AI does not ''think twice'' about the instructions provided by the environment -- a blind trust that attackers can exploit to jailbreak the embodied agent. We further design and implement open-source prototypes of two fully-automated frameworks: SHAWSHANK, the first automatic attack generation framework for the proposed attack IEJ; and SHAWSHANK-FORGE, the first automatic benchmark generation framework for IEJ. Then, using SHAWSHANK-FORGE, we automatically construct SHAWSHANK-BENCH, the first benchmark for indirectly jailbreaking embodied agents. Together, our two frameworks and one benchmark answer the questions of what content can be used for malicious IEJ instructions, where they should be placed, and how IEJ can be systematically evaluated. Evaluation results show that SHAWSHANK outperforms eleven existing methods across 3,957 task-scene combinations and compromises all six tested VLMs. Furthermore, current defenses only partially mitigate our attack, and we have responsibly disclosed our findings to all affected VLM vendors.</description>

Abstract: Generative coding tools promise big productivity gains, but uneven uptake could widen skill and income gaps. We train a neural classifier to spot AI-generated Python functions in over 30 million GitHub commits by 170,000 developers, tracking how fast -- and where -- these tools take hold. Today, AI writes an estimated 29% of Python functions in the US, a modest and shrinking lead over other countries. We estimate that quarterly output, measured in online code contributions, has increased by 3.6% because of this. Our evidence suggests that programmers using AI may also more readily expand into new domains of software development. However, experienced programmers capture nearly all of these productivity and exploration gains, widening rather than closing the skill gap.</description>

      <title>Can Artificial Intelligence Accelerate Technological Progress? Researchers' Perspectives on AI in Manufacturing and Materials Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) raises expectations of substantial increases in rates of technological and scientific progress, but such anticipations are often not connected to detailed ground-level studies of AI use in innovation processes. Accordingly, it remains unclear how and to what extent AI can accelerate innovation. To help to fill this gap, we report results from 32 interviews with U.S.-based academic manufacturing and materials sciences researchers experienced with AI and machine learning (ML) techniques. Interviewees primarily used AI for modeling of materials and manufacturing processes, facilitating cheaper and more rapid search of design spaces for materials and manufacturing processes alike. They report benefits including cost, time, and computation savings in technology development. However, interviewees also report that AI/ML tools are unreliable outside design spaces for which dense data are already available; that they require skilled and judicious application in tandem with older research techniques; and that AI/ML tools may detrimentally circumvent opportunities for disruptive theoretical advancement. Based on these results, we suggest there is reason for optimism about acceleration in sustaining innovations through the use of to AI/ML; but that support for conventional empirical, computational, and theoretical research is required to maintain the likelihood of further major advances in manufacturing and materials science.</description>

      <title>Automatically Detecting Online Deceptive Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07441v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deceptive patterns in digital interfaces manipulate users into making unintended decisions, exploiting cognitive biases and psychological vulnerabilities. These patterns have become ubiquitous on various digital platforms. While efforts to mitigate deceptive patterns have emerged from legal and technical perspectives, a significant gap remains in creating usable and scalable solutions. We introduce our AutoBot framework to address this gap and help web stakeholders navigate and mitigate online deceptive patterns. AutoBot accurately identifies and localizes deceptive patterns from a screenshot of a website without relying on the underlying HTML code. AutoBot employs a two-stage pipeline that leverages the capabilities of specialized vision models to analyze website screenshots, identify interactive elements, and extract textual features. Next, using a large language model, AutoBot understands the context surrounding these elements to determine the presence of deceptive patterns. We also use AutoBot, to create a synthetic dataset to distill knowledge from 'teacher' LLMs to smaller language models. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate AutoBot's effectiveness in detecting deceptive patterns on the web, achieving an F1-score of 0.93 when detecting deceptive patterns, underscoring its potential as an essential tool for mitigating online deceptive patterns. We implement AutoBot, across three downstream applications targeting different web stakeholders: (1) a local browser extension providing users with real-time feedback, (2) a Lighthouse audit to inform developers of potential deceptive patterns on their sites, and (3) as a measurement tool designed for researchers and regulators.</description>

      <title>LightDefense: A Lightweight Uncertainty-Driven Defense against Jailbreaks via Shifted Token Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face threats from jailbreak prompts. Existing methods for defending against jailbreak attacks are primarily based on auxiliary models. These strategies, however, often require extensive data collection or training. We propose LightDefense, a lightweight defense mechanism targeted at white-box models, which utilizes a safety-oriented direction to adjust the probabilities of tokens in the vocabulary, making safety disclaimers appear among the top tokens after sorting tokens by probability in descending order. We further innovatively leverage LLM's uncertainty about prompts to measure their harmfulness and adaptively adjust defense strength, effectively balancing safety and helpfulness. The effectiveness of LightDefense in defending against 5 attack methods across 2 target LLMs, without compromising helpfulness to benign user queries, highlights its potential as a novel and lightweight defense mechanism, enhancing security of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Hallucination Risk in AI Surgical Decision-Support: A Sequential Framework for Sequential Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer transformative potential for clinical decision support in spine surgery but pose significant risks through hallucinations, which are factually inconsistent or contextually misaligned outputs that may compromise patient safety. This study introduces a clinician-centered framework to quantify hallucination risks by evaluating diagnostic precision, recommendation quality, reasoning robustness, output coherence, and knowledge alignment. We assessed six leading LLMs across 30 expert-validated spinal cases. DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated superior overall performance (total score: 86.03 $\pm$ 2.08), particularly in high-stakes domains such as trauma and infection. A critical finding reveals that reasoning-enhanced model variants did not uniformly outperform standard counterparts: Claude-3.7-Sonnet's extended thinking mode underperformed relative to its standard version (80.79 $\pm$ 1.83 vs. 81.56 $\pm$ 1.92), indicating extended chain-of-thought reasoning alone is insufficient for clinical reliability. Multidimensional stress-testing exposed model-specific vulnerabilities, with recommendation quality degrading by 7.4% under amplified complexity. This decline contrasted with marginal improvements in rationality (+2.0%), readability (+1.7%) and diagnosis (+4.7%), highlighting a concerning divergence between perceived coherence and actionable guidance. Our findings advocate integrating interpretability mechanisms (e.g., reasoning chain visualization) into clinical workflows and establish a safety-aware validation framework for surgical LLM deployment.</description>

      <title>MajinBook: An open catalogue of digital world literature with likes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This data paper introduces MajinBook, an open catalogue designed to facilitate the use of shadow libraries--such as Library Genesis and Z-Library--for computational social science and cultural analytics. By linking metadata from these vast, crowd-sourced archives with structured bibliographic data from Goodreads, we create a high-precision corpus of over 539,000 references to English-language books spanning three centuries, enriched with first publication dates, genres, and popularity metrics like ratings and reviews. Our methodology prioritizes natively digital EPUB files to ensure machine-readable quality, while addressing biases in traditional corpora like HathiTrust, and includes secondary datasets for French, German, and Spanish. We evaluate the linkage strategy for accuracy, release all underlying data openly, and discuss the project's legal permissibility under EU and US frameworks for text and data mining in research.</description>

      <title>Auditing Google's AI Overviews and Featured Snippets: A Case Study on Baby Care and Pregnancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Google Search increasingly surfaces AI-generated content through features like AI Overviews (AIO) and Featured Snippets (FS), which users frequently rely on despite having no control over their presentation. Through a systematic algorithm audit of 1,508 real baby care and pregnancy-related queries, we evaluate the quality and consistency of these information displays. Our robust evaluation framework assesses multiple quality dimensions, including answer consistency, relevance, presence of medical safeguards, source categories, and sentiment alignment. Our results reveal concerning gaps in information consistency, with information in AIO and FS displayed on the same search result page being inconsistent with each other in 33% of cases. Despite high relevance scores, both features critically lack medical safeguards (present in just 11% of AIO and 7% of FS responses). While health and wellness websites dominate source categories for both, AIO and FS, FS also often link to commercial sources. These findings have important implications for public health information access and demonstrate the need for stronger quality controls in AI-mediated health information. Our methodology provides a transferable framework for auditing AI systems across high-stakes domains where information quality directly impacts user well-being.</description>
