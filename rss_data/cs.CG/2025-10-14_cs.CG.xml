      <title>Rigid-Invariant Sliced Wasserstein via Independent Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparing probability measures when their supports are related by an unknown rigid transformation is an important challenge in geometric data analysis, arising in shape matching and machine learning. Classical optimal transport (OT) distances, including Wasserstein and sliced Wasserstein, are sensitive to rotations and reflections, while Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) is invariant to isometries but computationally prohibitive for large datasets. We introduce \emph{Rigid-Invariant Sliced Wasserstein via Independent Embeddings} (RISWIE), a scalable pseudometric that combines the invariance of NP-hard approaches with the efficiency of projection-based OT. RISWIE utilizes data-adaptive bases and matches optimal signed permutations along axes according to distributional similarity to achieve rigid invariance with near-linear complexity in the sample size. We prove bounds relating RISWIE to GW in special cases and empirically demonstrate dimension-independent statistical stability. Our experiments on cellular imaging and 3D human meshes demonstrate that RISWIE outperforms GW in clustering tasks and discriminative capability while significantly reducing runtime.</description>

      <title>A well-separated pair decomposition for low density graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low density graphs are considered to be a realistic graph class for modelling road networks. It has advantages over other popular graph classes for road networks, such as planar graphs, bounded highway dimension graphs, and spanners. We believe that low density graphs have the potential to be a useful graph class for road networks, but until now, its usefulness is limited by a lack of available tools.
  In this paper, we develop two fundamental tools for low density graphs, that is, a well-separated pair decomposition and an approximate distance oracle. We believe that by expanding the algorithmic toolbox for low density graphs, we can help provide a useful and realistic graph class for road networks, which in turn, may help explain the many efficient and practical heuristics available for road networks.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the Maximum Degree in Ordered Nearest Neighbor Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an ordered point set in a Euclidean space or, more generally, in an abstract metric space, the ordered Nearest Neighbor Graph is obtained by connecting each of the points to its closest predecessor by a directed edge. We show that for every set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists an order such that the corresponding ordered Nearest Neighbor Graph has maximum degree at least $\log{n}/(4d)$. Apart from the $1/(4d)$ factor, this bound is the best possible. As for the abstract setting, we show that for every $n$-element metric space, there exists an order such that the corresponding ordered Nearest Neighbor Graph has maximum degree $\Omega(\sqrt{\log{n}/\log\log{n}})$.</description>
