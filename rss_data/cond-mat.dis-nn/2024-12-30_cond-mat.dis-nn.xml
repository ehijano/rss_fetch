      <title>Localization transitions of correlated particles in nonreciprocal quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay among interaction, non-Hermiticity, and disorder opens a new avenue for engineering novel phase transitions. We here study the spectral and localization features of two interacting bosons in one-dimensional nonreciprocal quasicrystals. Specifically, by considering a quasiperiodic Hubbard lattice with nonreciprocal hoppings, we show that the interaction can lead to a mobility edge, which arises from the fact that the bound states display a much lower threshold for spectral and extended-localized transitions than scattering states. The localization transition of bound or scattering states is accompanied by a complex-real spectrum transition. Moreover, while the two-particle localized states are robust to the boundary conditions, the two-particle extended states turn into skin modes under open boundary condition. We also show the correlated dynamics to characterize these localization transitions. Finally, we reveal that the bound states can form mobility edge on their own by introducing a dimerized nonreciprocal quasicrystal. Our paper may pave the way for the study of non-Hermitian few-body physics.</description>

      <title>Microscopic imprints of learned solutions in adaptive resistor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In physical networks trained using supervised learning, physical parameters are adjusted to produce desired responses to inputs. An example is electrical contrastive local learning networks of nodes connected by edges that are resistors that adjust their conductances during training. When an edge conductance changes, it upsets the current balance of every node. In response, physics adjusts the node voltages to minimize the dissipated power. Learning in these systems is therefore a coupled double-optimization process, in which the network descends both a cost landscape in the high-dimensional space of edge conductances, and a physical landscape -- the power -- in the high-dimensional space of node voltages. Because of this coupling, the physical landscape of a trained network contains information about the learned task. Here we demonstrate that all the physical information relevant to the trained input-output relation can be captured by a susceptibility, an experimentally measurable quantity. We supplement our theoretical results with simulations to show that the susceptibility is positively correlated with functional importance and that we can extract physical insight into how the system performs the task from the conductances of highly susceptible edges.</description>

      <title>Periodically and aperiodically Thue-Morse driven long-range systems: from dynamical localization to slow dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electric-field driven power-law random banded matrix(PLRBM) model where a variation in the power-law exponent $\alpha$ yields a delocalization-to-localization phase transition. We examine the periodically driven PLRBM model with the help of the Floquet operator. The level spacing ratio and the generalized participation ratio of the Floquet Hamiltonian reveal a drive-induced fractal phase accompanied by diffusive transport on the delocalized side of the undriven PLRBM model. On the localized side, the time-periodic model remains localized - the average spacing ratio corresponds to Poisson statistics and logarithmic transport is observed in the dynamics. Extending our analysis to the aperiodic Thue-Morse (TM) driven system, we find that the aperiodically driven clean long-range hopping model (clean counterpart of the PLRBM model) exhibits the phenomenon of \textit{exact dynamical localization} (EDL) on tuning the drive-parameters at special points. The disordered time-aperiodic system shows diffusive transport followed by relaxation to the infinite-temperature state on the delocalized side, and a prethermal plateau with subdiffusion on the localized side. Additionally, we compare this with a quasi-periodically driven AAH model that also undergoes a localization-delocalization transition. Unlike the disordered long-range model, it features a prolonged prethermal plateau followed by subdiffusion to the infinite temperature state, even on the delocalized side.</description>

      <title>The moments of the spectral form factor in SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In chaotic quantum systems the spectral form factor exhibits a universal linear ramp and plateau structure with superimposed erratic oscillations. The mean signal and the statistics of the noise can be probed by the moments of the spectral form factor, also known as higher-point spectral form factors. We identify saddle points in the SYK model that describe the moments during the ramp region. Perturbative corrections around the saddle point indicate that SYK mimics random matrix statistics for the low order moments, while large deviations for the high order moments arise from fluctuations near the edge of the spectrum. The leading correction scales inversely with the number of random parameters in the SYK Hamiltonian and is amplified in a sparsified version of the SYK model, which we study numerically, even in regimes where a linear ramp persists. Finally, we study the $q=2$ SYK model, whose spectral form factor exhibits an exponential ramp with increased noise. These findings reveal how deviations from random matrix universality arise in disordered systems and motivate their interpretation from a bulk gravitational perspective.</description>

      <title>Deep ReLU networks -- injectivity capacity upper bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study deep ReLU feed forward neural networks (NN) and their injectivity abilities. The main focus is on \emph{precisely} determining the so-called injectivity capacity. For any given hidden layers architecture, it is defined as the minimal ratio between number of network's outputs and inputs which ensures unique recoverability of the input from a realizable output. A strong recent progress in precisely studying single ReLU layer injectivity properties is here moved to a deep network level. In particular, we develop a program that connects deep $l$-layer net injectivity to an $l$-extension of the $\ell_0$ spherical perceptrons, thereby massively generalizing an isomorphism between studying single layer injectivity and the capacity of the so-called (1-extension) $\ell_0$ spherical perceptrons discussed in [82]. \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) based machinery is then created and utilized to statistically handle properties of the extended $\ell_0$ spherical perceptrons and implicitly of the deep ReLU NNs. A sizeable set of numerical evaluations is conducted as well to put the entire RDT machinery in practical use. From these we observe a rapidly decreasing tendency in needed layers' expansions, i.e., we observe a rapid \emph{expansion saturation effect}. Only $4$ layers of depth are sufficient to closely approach level of no needed expansion -- a result that fairly closely resembles observations made in practical experiments and that has so far remained completely untouchable by any of the existing mathematical methodologies.</description>

      <title>Nature of spin glass order in physical dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the diluted Heisenberg spin glass model in a 3-component random field for the commonly-used one-dimensional long-range model where the probability that two spins separated by a distance $r$ interact with one another falls as $1/r^{2 \sigma}$, for two values of $\sigma$, $0.75$ and $0.85$. No de Almeida-Thouless line is expected at these $\sigma$ values. The spin glass correlation length $\xi_{\text{SG}}$ varies with the random field as expected from the Imry-Ma argument and the droplet scaling picture of spin glasses. However, when $\xi_{\text{SG}}$ becomes comparable to the system size $L$, there are departures which we attribute to the features deriving from the TNT picture of spin glasses. For the case $\sigma =0.85$ these features go away for system sizes with $L &gt;L^*$, where $L^*$ is large ($\approx 4000-8000$ lattice spacings). In the case of $\sigma = 0.75$ we have been unable to study large enough systems to determine its value of $L^*$. We sketch a renormalization group scenario to explain how these features could arise. On this scenario finite size effects on the droplet scaling picture in low-dimensional spin glasses produce TNT features and some aspects of Parisi's replica symmetry breaking theory of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model.</description>

      <title>Designing three-way entangled and nonlocal two-way entangled single particle states via alternate quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement with single-particle states is advantageous in quantum technology because of their ability to encode and process information more securely than their multi-particle analogs. Threeway and nonlocal two-way entangled single-particle states are desirable in this context. Herein, we generate genuine three-way entanglement from an initially separable state involving three degrees of freedom of a quantum particle, which evolves via a 2D alternate quantum walk employing a resource-saving single-qubit coin. We achieve maximum possible values for the three-way entanglement quantified by the {\pi}-tangle between the three degrees of freedom. We also generate optimal nonlocal two-way entanglement, quantified by the negativity between the nonlocal position degrees of freedom of the particle. This prepared architecture using quantum walks can be experimentally realized with a photon.</description>

      <title>Fidelity decay and error accumulation in random quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of fidelity decay and error accumulation in faulty quantum circuit models. Our work devises an analytical bound for the average fidelity between desired and faulty output states, accounting for errors that may arise during the implementation of two-qubit gates and multi-qubit permutations. It is shown that fidelity decays exponentially with both circuit depth and the number of qubits raised to an architecture-dependent power, and determine the decay rates as a function of the two types of errors. Furthermore, we establish a robust linear relationship between fidelity and the heavy output frequency used in Quantum Volume tests to benchmark quantum processors, under the considered errors protocol. These findings pave the way for predicting the behavior of fidelity in the presence of specific errors and offer insights into the best strategies for increasing Quantum Volume.</description>

      <title>State-dependent mobility edge in kinetically constrained models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the kinetically constrained quantum East model lies between a quantum scarred and a many-body localized system featuring an unconventional type of mobility edge in the spectrum. We name this scenario $\textit{state-dependent}$ mobility edge: while the system does not exhibit a sharp separation in energy between thermal and non-thermal eigenstates, the abundance of non-thermal eigenstates results in slow entanglement growth for $\textit{many}$ initial states, such as product states, below a finite energy density. We characterize the state-dependent mobility edge by looking at the complexity of classically simulating dynamics using tensor network for system sizes well beyond those accessible via exact diagonalization. Focusing on initial product states, we observe a qualitative change in the dynamics of the bond dimension needed as a function of their energy density. Specifically, the bond dimension typically grows $\textit{polynomially}$ in time up to a certain energy density, where we locate the state-dependent mobility edge, enabling simulations for long times. Above this energy density, the bond dimension typically grows $\textit{exponentially}$ making the simulation practically unfeasible beyond short times, as generally expected in interacting theories. We correlate the polynomial growth of the bond dimension to the presence of many non-thermal eigenstates around that energy density, a subset of which we compute via tensor network. The outreach of our findings encompasses quantum sampling problems and the efficient simulation of quantum circuits beyond Clifford families.</description>

      <title>Topological insulators on fractal lattices: A general principle of construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractal lattices, featuring the self-similarity symmetry, are often geometric descents of parent crystals, possessing all their discrete symmetries (such as rotations and reflections) except the translational ones. Here, we formulate three different general approaches to construct real space Hamiltonian on a fractal lattice starting from the Bloch Hamiltonian on the parent crystal, fostering for example strong and crystalline topological insulators resulting from the interplay between the nontrivial geometry of the underlying electronic wave functions and the crystal symmetries. As a demonstrative example, we consider a generalized square lattice Chern insulator model and within the framework of all three methods we successfully showcase incarnations of strong and crystalline Chern insulators on the Sierpi\'nski carpet fractal lattices. The proposed theoretical framework thus lays a generic foundation to build a tower of topological phases on the landscape of fractal lattices.</description>

      <title>Dynamical scaling behavior of the two-dimensional random singlet state in the random $Q$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the scaling relation of energy and length scales in the 2D random-singlet (RS) state of the random $Q$ model. To investigate the intrinsic energy scale of the spinon subsystem arising from the model, we develop a constrained subspace update algorithm within the framework of the stochastic series expansion method (SSE) to extract the singlet-triplet gap of the system. The 2D RS state exhibits scaling behavior similar to the infinite randomness fixed point (IRFP), at least within the length scales that we simulate. Furthermore, by rescaling the system size according to the strength of randomness, we observe that the data for the excitation gap and the width of the gap distribution collapse onto a single curve. This implies that the model with different strengths of randomness may correspond to the same fixed point.</description>
