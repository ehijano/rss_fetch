      <title>Assessing the impact of uniform rotation on the structure of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by recent laboratory experiments and astronomical observations, significant advances have deepened our understanding of neutron-star physics. NICER's Pulse Profile Modeling has refined our knowledge of neutron star masses and radii, while gravitational-wave detections have revealed key insights into the structure of neutron stars. Particularly relevant is the extraction of the tidal deformability by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration and the most recent determination of stellar radii by NICER, both suggesting a relatively soft equation of state (EOS) at intermediate densities. Additionally, measurements from the PREX collaboration and from pulsar timing suggest instead that the EOS is stiff in the vicinity of saturation density and at the highest densities accessible to date. But how stiff can the EOS be at these very high densities? Recent events featuring compact objects near the "lower mass gap" have raised questions about the existence of very massive neutron stars. Motivated by this finding and in light of new refinements to theoretical models, we explore the possibility that these massive objects may indeed be rapidly rotating neutron stars. We explore how rotation affects both the maximum neutron star mass and their associated radii, and discuss the implications they may have on the equation of state.</description>

      <title>A pathway to unveiling neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay nuclear matrix elements via $\gamma\gamma$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the experimental feasibility of detecting second-order double-magnetic dipole ($\gamma\gamma$-$M1M1$) decays from double isobaric analog states (DIAS), which have recently been found to be strongly correlated with the nuclear matrix elements of neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay. Using the nuclear shell model, we compute theoretical branching ratios for $\gamma\gamma$-$M1M1$ decays and compare them with other competing processes, such as single-$\gamma$ decay and proton emission, which represent the dominant decay channels. We also estimate the potential competition from internal conversion and internal pair creation, which can influence the decay dynamics. Additionally, we propose an experimental strategy based on using LaBr$_3$ scintillators to identify $\gamma\gamma$-$M1M1$ transitions from the DIAS amidst the background of the competing processes. Our approach emphasizes the challenges of isolating the rare $\gamma\gamma$-$M1M1$ decay and suggests ways to enhance the experimental detection sensitivity. Our simulations suggest that it may be possible to access experimentally $\gamma\gamma$-$M1M1$ decays from DIAS, shedding light on the neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay nuclear matrix elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this report we will cover in some details only our preliminary results for the induced fission of odd-mass and odd-odd nuclei within a time-dependent density functional (TDDFT) extended to superfluid systems. In the talk we have covered three topics; i) Scission neutrons, ii) Induced fission of odd-mass and odd-odd nuclei, and iii) Nontrivial aspects of fission dynamics, which we discuss here briefly.</description>

      <title>Triple-$\alpha$ reaction rates below $T_9=3$ by a non-adiabatic three-body model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The triple-$\alpha$ reaction from ternary continuum states at off-resonant energies, $\alpha+\alpha+\alpha \rightarrow ^{12}$C, still remains in unsolved problems. This direct process is estimated with a non-adiabatic Faddeev hyper-spherical harmonics and $R$-matrix expansion method. After reviewing this model, the resultant photo-disintegration of $^{12}$C($2^+_1 \rightarrow 0^+$) is shown to be in 10$^{-15}$--10$^{-3}$ pico-barn order for $0.15 \le E \le 0.35$ MeV. This is far below the values predicted by the recent adiabatic calculations. In spite of the large difference, the derived reaction rates are illustrated to be concordant with the current evaluated rates for $0.08 \le T_9 \le 3$ including helium burning temperatures. The difference below $E = 0.20$ MeV can be seen in the rates for $T_9 \le 0.07$. In comparison with the calculations, the triple-$\alpha$ reaction rates are found to be reduced by about 10$^{-4}$ at $T_9 = 0.05$, because of an accurate description for $^8$Be break-up. Uncertainties of the rates are also estimated by examining sensitivity to 3$\alpha$ potentials. With introducing three-body $S$-factors and a resonant term, the present rates are expressed in an analytic form, and they are provided in a tabular form for astrophysical applications. To update the evaluated rates, non-resonant sequential process between $\alpha+^8$Be may be eliminated by hand.</description>

      <title>RHIC $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV hadron yields and the isospin dependent equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical hadronization model has been successful in extracting information at chemical freeze-out in heavy-ion collisions. At RHIC, with a collision energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, many different ion species have been used for $A$+$A$ collisions. This allows for a scan across the charge fraction $Y_Q=Z/A$, where $Z$ is the proton number and $A$ is the baryon number. We first make predictions for $A$+$A$ collisions that do not yet have published experimental data on hadron yield ratios (O+O, Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr). We then use both the experimental and predicted yield ratios to perform thermal fits across $Y_Q$, enabling us to extract $s/n_B$ and other thermodynamic information at chemical freeze-out. Using the relation between $s/n_B$ and $Y_Q$, we can calculate a new constraint on the finite temperature equation of state at finite densities. We discuss implications of this constraint and propose future runs that can help connect to the equation of state relevant for neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Hyperon Production in Bi+Bi Collisions at NICA and Angular Dependence of Hyperon Spin Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strange baryon production in Bi+Bi collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=9.0$\,GeV is studied using the PHSD transport model. Hyperon and anti-hyperon yields, transverse momentum spectra, and rapidity spectra are calculated, their centrality dependence and the effect of rapidity and transverse momentum cuts are studied. The rapidity distributions for $\overline{Lambda}$, $\Xi$, $\overline{Xi}$ baryons are found to be systematically narrower than for $\Lambda$s. The $p_T$ slope parameters for anti-hyperons vary more with centrality than those for hyperons. Restricting the accepted rapidity range to $|y|&lt;1$ increases the slope parameters by 13--30\,MeV depending on the centrality class and the hyperon mass. Hydrodynamic velocity and vorticity fields are calculated and the formation of two oppositely rotating vortex rings moving in opposite directions along the collision axis is found. The hyperon spin polarization induced by the medium vorticity within the thermodynamic approach is calculated and the dependence of the polarization on the transverse momentum and rapidity cuts and on the centrality selection is analyzed. The cuts have stronger effect on the polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\Xi$ hyperons than on the corresponding anti-hyperons. The polarization signal is maximal for the centrality class 60-70\%. We show that for the considered hyperon polarization mechanism the structure of the vorticity field makes an imprint on the polarization signal as a function of the azimuthal angle in the transverse momentum plane, $\phi_H$, $\cos\phi_H=p_x/p_T$. For particles with positive longitudinal momentum, $p_z&gt;0$, the polarization increases with $\cos\phi_H$, while for particles with $p_z&lt;0$ it decreases.</description>

      <title>Helium as an Indicator of the Neutron-Star Merger Remnant Lifetime and its Potential for Equation of State Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time until black hole formation in a binary neutron-star (NS) merger contains invaluable information about the nuclear equation of state (EoS) but has thus far been difficult to measure. We propose a new way to constrain the merger remnant's NS lifetime, which is based on the tendency of the NS remnant neutrino-driven winds to enrich the ejected material with helium. Based on the He I $\lambda 1083.3$ nm line, we show that the feature around 800-1200 nm in AT2017gfo at 4.4 days seems inconsistent with a helium mass fraction of $X_{\mathrm{He}} \gtrsim 0.05$ in the polar ejecta. Recent neutrino-hydrodynamic simulations of merger remnants are only compatible with this limit if the NS remnant collapses within 20-30 ms. Such a short lifetime implies that the total binary mass of GW170817, $M_\mathrm{\rm tot}$, lay close to the threshold binary mass for direct gravitational collapse, $M_\mathrm{thres}$, for which we estimate $M_{\mathrm{thres}}\lesssim 2.93 M_\odot$. This upper bound on $M_\mathrm{thres}$ yields upper limits on the radii and maximum mass of cold, non-rotating NSs, which rule out simultaneously large values for both quantities. In combination with causality arguments, this result implies a maximum NS mass of $M_\mathrm{max}\lesssim2.3 M_\odot$. The combination of all limits constrains the radii of 1.6 M$_\odot$ NSs to about 12$\pm$1 km for $M_\mathrm{max}$ = 2.0 M$_\odot$ and 11.5$\pm$1 km for $M_\mathrm{max}$ = 2.15 M$_\odot$. This $\sim2$ km allowable range then tightens significantly for $M_\mathrm{max}$ above $\approx2.15$ M$_\odot$. This rules out a significant number of current EoS models. The short NS lifetime also implies that a black-hole torus, not a highly magnetized NS, was the central engine powering the relativistic jet of GRB170817A. Our work motivates future developments...

      <title>Phase transition on superfluid vortices in Higgs-Confinement crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to distinguish states of matter by identifying spontaneous symmetry breaking on extended objects, such as vortices, even in the absence of a bulk phase transition. As a specific example, we investigate the phase transition on superfluid vortices in the Higgs-confinement crossover using a $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{gauge} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ model. This model exhibits superfluidity of $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ symmetry and allows for a crossover between the Higgs and confinement regimes by varying the gauge coupling constant from weak to strong. We demonstrate that, on vortices, spontaneous breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flavor symmetry occurs in the weak coupling (Higgs) regime, while it does not in the strong coupling (confinement) regime. We also confirm that those regimes are separated by a second-order phase transition through Monte Carlo simulations, whose universality class corresponds to the two-dimensional Ising model.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound and trace anomaly in a unified treatment of the two-color diquark superfluid, the pion-condensed high-isospin matter, and the 2SC quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a unified perturbative treatment from the high-density side, we compute the speed of sound and the trace anomaly as functions of the chemical potential $\mu$ for the two-color diquark superfluid, the pion-condensed high-isospin matter, and the 2SC quark matter. We find that the corrections induced by the gap energy $\Delta$ involve nontrivial interplay between the dimensionless magnitude $|\Delta/\mu|$ and the derivative $|\partial\Delta/\partial\mu|$. Even though the gap equation has a common structure for these phases of our interest, different numerical constants cause drastic changes in the speed of sound corrections. As long as $|\Delta/\mu|$ is dominant over the derivative, the gap effects increase the speed of sound, which is consistent with the expected behavior of exhibiting a peak at intermediate density. We then discuss the trace anomaly which is pushed down generally by the gap effects and turns out to be negative widely in the high density regime. For demonstration of non-perturbative enhancement, we take account of the instanton-induced interaction. We confirm a further increase in the speed of sound for the two-color diquark superfluid and the pion-condensed high-isospin matter, while the speed of sound for the 2SC quark matter deviates far below the conformal limit due to the derivative contribution.</description>

Abstract: We study point impurities in non-relativistic quantum field theories, with a focus on scale-invariant fixed points. We establish the framework of conformal defects in Schr\"{o}dinger field theories and their correspondence to many-body states in a harmonic trap. We discuss a multi-critical quantization of the one-body wave function induced by an impurity, with examples of free and unitary Fermi gases. Our results can potentially be tested in experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical constraints on color-superconducting phases in compact stars within the RG-consistent NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine parameters of the renormalization group-consistent (RG-consistent) three-flavor color-superconducting Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model that are suited to investigate possible compact-star configurations. Our goal is to provide viable quark-matter equation of state (EoS) that can generally be used for hybrid-star constructions. To that end, we mainly focus on quark-star properties in this work. By varying the vector and diquark coupling constants, we analyze their impact on the EoS, speed of sound (SoS), the maximum diquark gap, and the mass-radius relation. In almost all configurations, a stable color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase appears in the core of the maximum-mass configurations, typically spanning several kms in radius. In other cases, the star's two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) branch of the EoS becomes unstable before reaching the CFL transition density. At neutron-star densities, the SoS squared reaches up to 0.6 and the CFL diquark gap up to 250 MeV. We argue that adding a hadronic EoS at lower densities by performing a Maxwell construction, does not increase the maximum mass substantially, thus we use the 2 solar mass constraint to constrain the NJL model parameters that are suited for the construction of hybrid-star EoS. We construct three examples of the hybrid star model, demonstrating that there is room for different CSC compositions. The hybrid EoS obtained in this way can have no 2SC matter or different ratios of 2SC and CFL quark matter in the core. We show that early hadron-quark transitions are possible that can modify the tidal deformability at 1.4 solar mass. We will provide tabulated EoS of the RG-consistent NJL model for these three parameter sets. We find that these EoS are consistent with the imposed constraints from astrophysics and perturbative QCD. They allow for different hybrid-star scenarios with a hadronic EoS that is soft at low densities.</description>

      <title>The Quenched $g_A$ in Nuclei and Infrared Fixed-Point in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07339v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possible consequence of an IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f=2, 3$ in nuclear matter is discussed. It is shown in terms of d(ilaton)-$\chi$ effective field theory (d$\chi$EFT) incorporated in a generalized effective field theory (G$n$EFT) implemented with hidden local symmetry and hidden scale symmetry that the recently measured superallowed Gamow-Teller transition in the doubly-magic-shell nucleus $^{100}$Sn indicates a surprisingly large anomaly-induced quenching (AIQ) of $g_A$ from the free-space value of 1.276 to $\approx 0.8 $. Combined with the quenching expected from strong nuclear correlations, the effective coupling in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}$ would come to $\sim 1/2$. If this result were reconfirmed, it would impact not only nuclear structure and dense compact-star matter -- where $g_A$ figures in $\pi$-N coupling via the Goldberger-Treiman relation -- but also in search for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), e.g. $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, where 4th power of $g_A$ figures.</description>

Abstract: Shell quenching phenomena in nuclear charge radii are typically observed at the well-established neutron magic numbers. However, the recent discovery of potential new magic numbers at the neutron numbers $N = 32$ and $N = 34$ has sparked renewed interest in this mass region. This work further inspects into the charge radii of nuclei around the $N = 28$ shell closure using the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov model. We incorporate meson exchange and point-coupling effective nucleon-nucleon interactions alongside the Bogoliubov transformation for pairing corrections. To accurately capture the odd-even staggering and shell closure effects observed in charge radii, neutron-proton correlations around Fermi surface are explicitly considered. The charge radii of Ca and Ni isotopes are used to test the theoretical model and show an improvement with neutron-proton pairing corrections, in particular for neutron-rich isotopes. Our calculations reveal a inverted parabolic-like trend in the charge radii along the $N = 28$ isotones for proton numbers $Z$ between 20 and 28. Additionally, the shell closure effect of $Z = 28$ persists across the $N = 28$, 30, 32, and 34 isotonic chains, albeit with a gradual weakening trend. Notably, the significantly abrupt changes in charge radii are observed across $Z = 22$ along both the $N = 32$ and $N = 34$ isotonic chains. This kink at $Z = 22$ comes from the sudden decrease of the neuron-proton correlation around Fermi surfaces across $Z = 22$ for $N = 30$, 32, and 34 isotones, and might provide a signature for identifying the emergence of neutron magic numbers $N = 32$ and 34. Furthermore, the calculated charge radii for these isotonic chains ($N = 28$, 30, 32, and 34) can serve as reliable guidelines for future experimental measurements.</description>

Abstract: The cost and the error of the adiabatic theorem for preparing the final eigenstate are discussed in terms of path length. Previous studies in terms of the norm of the Hamiltonian and its derivatives with the spectral gap are limited in their ability to describe the cost of adiabatic state preparation for certain physically large systems. We argue that total time is not a good measure for determining the computational difficulty of adiabatic quantum computation by developing a no-go theorem. From the result of time-periodic Hamiltonian cases, we suggest that there are proxies for computational cost which typically grow as path length increases when the error is kept fixed and small and consider possible conjectures on how general the behavior is.</description>

      <title>Off-shell pion properties: electromagnetic form factors and light-front wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07743</link>

Abstract: The off-shell pion electromagnetic form factors are explored with corresponding off-shell light-front wave functions modeled by constituent quark and anti-quark. We apply the Mandelstam approach for the microscopic computation of the form factors relating the model parameters with the pion decay constant and charge radius. Analyzing the existing data on the cross-sections for the Sullivan process, H(e,e',pi)n, we extract the off-shell pion form factor using the relation derived from the generalized Ward-Takahashi identity for the pion electromagnetic current. They are compared with our previous results from exactly solvable manifestly covariant model of a (3+1)-dimensional fermion field theory. We find that the adopted constituent quark model reproduces the extracted off-shell form factor $F_1(Q^2,t)$ from the experimental data within a few percent difference and matches well with our previous theoretical simulation which exhibits a variation of about 10\% for the extracted off-shell pion form factor $g(Q^2,t)$. We also identify the pion valence parton distribution function (PDF) and transverse momentum distribution (TMD) in terms of the light-front wave function and discuss their off-shell properties.</description>
