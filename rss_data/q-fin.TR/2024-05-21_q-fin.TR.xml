      <title>Adaptive Optimal Market Making Strategies with Inventory Liquidation Cos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel high-frequency market-making approach in discrete time is proposed that admits closed-form solutions. By taking advantage of demand functions that are linear in the quoted bid and ask spreads with random coefficients, we model the variability of the partial filling of limit orders posted in a limit order book (LOB). As a result, we uncover new patterns as to how the demand's randomness affects the optimal placement strategy. We also allow the price process to follow general dynamics without any Brownian or martingale assumption as is commonly adopted in the literature. The most important feature of our optimal placement strategy is that it can react or adapt to the behavior of market orders online. Using LOB data, we train our model and reproduce the anticipated final profit and loss of the optimal strategy on a given testing date using the actual flow of orders in the LOB. Our adaptive optimal strategies outperform the non-adaptive strategy and those that quote limit orders at a fixed distance from the midprice.</description>

      <title>Automated Market Makers for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.01676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper compares mathematical models for automated market makers including logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR), liquidity sensitive LMSR (LS-LMSR), constant product/mean/sum, and others. It is shown that though LMSR may not be a good model for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications, LS-LMSR has several advantages over constant product/mean based automated market makers. However, LS-LMSR requires complicated computation (i.e., logarithm and exponentiation) and the cost function curve is concave. In certain DeFi applications, it is preferred to have computationally efficient cost functions with convex curves to conform with the principle of supply and demand. This paper proposes and analyzes constant circle/ellipse based cost functions for automated market makers. The proposed cost functions are computationally efficient (only requires multiplication and square root calculation) and have several advantages over widely deployed constant product cost functions. For example, the proposed market makers are more robust against front-runner (slippage) attacks.</description>

      <title>Price-Aware Automated Market Makers: Models Beyond Brownian Prices and Static Liquidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a suite of models for price-aware automated market making platforms willing to optimize their quotes. These models incorporate advanced price dynamics, including stochastic volatility, jumps, and microstructural price models based on Hawkes processes. Additionally, we address the variability in demand from liquidity takers through models that employ either Hawkes or Markov-modulated Poisson processes. Each model is analyzed with particular emphasis placed on the complexity of the numerical methods required to compute optimal quotes.</description>
