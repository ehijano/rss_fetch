      <title>Refractory carbon depletion by photolysis through dust collisions and vertical mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner Solar System is depleted in refractory carbon in comparison to the interstellar medium and the depletion likely took place in the protoplanetary disk phase of the Solar System. We study the effect of photolysis of refractory carbon in the upper layers of the protosolar disk and its interplay with dust collisional growth and vertical mixing. We make use of a 1D Monte Carlo model to simulate dust coagulation and vertical mixing. To model the FUV flux of the disk, we use a simple analytical prescription and benchmark it with data from a radiative transfer simulation. We study the effects of fragmentation and bouncing on dust distribution and the propagation of carbon depletion. We find that when bouncing is included, the size distribution is truncated at smaller sizes than fragmentation-limited size distributions but there is a loss of small grains as well. The population of small grains is reduced due to fewer fragmentation events and this reduces the effectiveness of photolysis. We find that dust collisional growth and vertical mixing increase the effectiveness of carbon depletion by efficiently replenishing carbon to the upper regions of the disk with higher FUV flux. It takes around 100-300 kyr to reach the measured carbon abundances at 1 au, depending on the strength of the turbulence in the disk. These timescales are faster than reported by previous studies. Collisional redistribution and turbulent mixing are important aspects of dust evolution that should be included when modeling dust chemistry as they can influence the efficiency of chemical processes. Photolysis, along with another process such as sublimation, most likely played a key role in refractory carbon depletion that we see around us in the inner Solar System.</description>

      <title>Optical and Near-Infrared Contemporaneous Polarimetry of C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted contemporaneous optical and near-infrared polarimetric and spectroscopic observations of C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, hereafter T-A) from 2024 October 16 to December 17, covering a wide range of phase angles (20-123 deg) and wavelength (0.5-2.3 um). We paid special attention to gas contamination in the dust polarization using these data. As a result, we find the maximum polarization degree $P_max=31.21 +- 0.05 %, 33.52 +- 0.06 %, 35.12 +- 0.01 %, 37.57 +- 0.01 %, and 35.35 +- 0.01 % in the Rc-, Ic-, J-, H-, and Ks-bands, respectively. Although dust polarization shows a red slope at shorter wavelengths and can peak around 1.6 um, the phase angle at which maximum polarization occurs exhibits less dependence on wavelength (alpha_max ~ 90 deg - 95 deg). Although only a few historically bright comets, such as West, Halley, and Hale-Bopp, have undergone such extensive dust-polarization observations, our measurements are generally consistent with those of two comets that possibly originated from the Oort Cloud (West and Halley). From these results, we conjecture that the optical properties and growth processes of dust in the presolar nebula, which formed these cometary nuclei, were likely uniform.</description>

      <title>Orbits of very distant asteroid satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The very wide binary asteroid (VWBA) population is a small subset of the population of known binary and multiple asteroids made of systems with very widely orbiting satellites and long orbital periods, on the order of tens to hundreds of days. The origin of these systems is debatable, and most members of this population are poorly characterized. We have compiled all available high-angular resolution imaging archival data of VWBA systems from large ground- and space-based telescopes. We measure the astrometric positions of the satellite relative to the primary and analyze the dynamics of the satellites using the Genoid genetic algorithm. Additionally, we use a NEATM thermal model to estimate the diameters of two systems, and we model the orbit of Litva's inner satellite using photometric lightcurve observations. We determine the effective diameters of binary systems Christophedumas and Alconrad to be 4.7 + 0.4km and 5.2 + 0.3km respectively. We determine new orbital solutions for five systems, Huenna, Litva, (3548) Eurybates, Pauling, and Alconrad. We find a significantly eccentric best-fit orbital solution for the outer satellite of Litva, a moderately eccentric solution for Alconrad, and a nearly circular solution for Pauling. We also confirm previously reported orbital solutions for (379) Huenna and Eurybates. It is unlikely that BYORP expansion could be solely responsible for the formation of VWBAs. It is possible that the satellites of these systems were formed through YORP spin-up and then later scattered onto very wide orbits. Additionally, we find that some members of the population are unlikely to have formed satellites through YORP spin-up, and a collisional formation history is favored. In particular, this applies to VWBAs within large dynamical families, or large VWBA systems such as Huenna and NASA's Lucy mission target Eurybates.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the earliest NC and CC planetesimals: Evidence from ungrouped iron meteorites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isotope anomalies in meteorites reveal a fundamental dichotomy between non-carbonaceous- (NC) and carbonaceous-type (CC) planetary bodies. Until now, this dichotomy is established for the major meteorite groups, representing about 36 distinct parent bodies. Ungrouped meteorites represent an even larger number of additional and so far mostly unexplored parent bodies. Here, the genetics and chronology of 26 ungrouped iron meteorites are investigated. The ungrouped irons confirm the NC-CC dichotomy for Mo, where NC and CC meteorites define two distinct, subparallel s-process mixing lines. All ungrouped NC irons fall on the NC-line, which is now precisely defined for 41 distinct parent bodies. The ungrouped CC irons show scatter around the CC-line indicative of small r-process Mo heterogeneities among these samples. These r-process Mo isotope variations correlate with O isotope anomalies, most likely reflecting mixing of CI chondrite-like matrix, chondrule precursors and Ca-Al-rich inclusions. This implies that CC iron meteorite parent bodies accreted the same nebular components as the later-formed carbonaceous chondrites. The Hf-W model ages of core formation for the ungrouped irons reveal a narrow age peak at ~3.3 Ma after Ca-Al-rich inclusions for the CC irons. By contrast, the NC irons display more variable ages, including younger ages indicative of impact-induced melting events, which seem absent among the CC irons. This is attributed to the more fragile and porous nature of the CC bodies, making impact-induced melting on their surfaces difficult. The chemical characteristics of all iron meteorites together reveal slightly more oxidizing conditions during core formation for CC compared to NC irons. More strikingly, strong depletions in moderately volatile elements, typical of many iron meteorite parent bodies, predominantly occur among CC irons.</description>

      <title>Detectability of oxygen fugacity regimes in the magma ocean world 55 Cancri e at high spectral resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-short Period exoplanets (USPs) like 55 Cnc e, hosting dayside magma oceans, present unique opportunities to study surface-atmosphere interactions. The composition of a vaporised mineral atmosphere enveloping the dayside is dictated by that of the surface magma ocean, which in turn is sensitive to its oxygen fugacity ($f$O$_2$). Observability estimations and characterisation of the atmospheric emission of 55 Cnc e have mostly remained limited to low spectral resolution space-based studies. Here, we aim to examine ground-based high-resolution observabilities of a diverse set of mineral atmospheres produced across a grid of mantle $f$O$_2$s varying over 12 orders of magnitude. We assume a Bulk Silicate Earth mantle composition and a substellar dayside temperature of T = 2500K in the near infrared wavelength (NIR) region. This spectral range is often featureless for this class of atmospheres at low-resolution. Coupling our newly developed simulator for synthesising realistic observations from high-resolution ground-based spectrographs (Ratri) to a pre-developed high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) analysis pipeline (Upamana), we find that this array of mineral atmospheres would all be detectable with 11 hours of observing time of the dayside of 55 Cnc e with CARMENES and each individual scenario can be correctly differentiated within 1$\sigma$. Our analysis is readily able to distinguish between a planet with an Earth-like redox state (with $f$O$_2$ $\sim$3.5 log$_{10}$ units above the iron-w\"ustite, IW buffer) from a Mercury-like planet ($f$O$_2$ $\sim$5 log$_{10}$ units below IW). We thus conclude that the HRCCS technique holds promise for cataloguing the diversity of redox states among the rocky exoplanetary population.</description>

      <title>Radio Science Investigations for the Heavy Metal Mission to Asteroid (216) Kleopatra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the simulation results of the radio science experiment onboard the proposed Heavy Metal mission to the M-type asteroid (216) Kleopatra. Earth-based radiometric measurements (range and range-rate), complemented by images from the onboard optical camera and by measurements from the inter-satellite link between the maincraft and a secondary subcraft, are used in an orbit determination process to assess the attainable accuracy for the mass of Kleopatra and its extended gravity field. Preliminary results indicate that the asteroid mass can be retrieved with a relative accuracy up to $10^{-7}$, while the extended gravity field can be estimated up to degree 10 with sufficient accuracy to discriminate between internal structure models, satisfying the scientific goals of the mission.</description>

      <title>Ionized envelopes around protoplanets and the role of radiative feedback in gas accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary growth within protoplanetary disks involves accreting material from their surroundings, yet the underlying mechanisms and physical conditions of the accreting gas remain debated. This study aims to investigate the dynamics and thermodynamic properties of accreting gas giants, and to characterize the envelope that forms near the planet during accretion. We employ three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a Jupiter-mass planet embedded in a viscous gaseous disk. Our models incorporate a non-isothermal energy equation to compute gas and radiation energy diffusion and include radiative feedback from the planet. Results indicate that gas accretion occurs supersonically towards the planet, forming an ionized envelope that extends from the planetary surface up to 0.2 times the Hill radius in the no-feedback model, and up to 0.4 times the Hill radius in the feedback model. The envelope's radius, or ionization radius, acts as a boundary halting supersonic gas inflow and is pivotal for estimating accretion rates and H$\alpha$ emission luminosities. Including radiative feedback increases accretion rates, especially within the ionization radius and from areas to the right of the planet when the star is positioned to the left. The accretion luminosities calculated at the ionization radius are substantially lower than those calculated at the Hill radius, highlighting potential misinterpretations in the non-detection of H$\alpha$ emissions as indicators of ongoing planet formation.</description>

      <title>On the linear structure of the interlaced Alfv\'en vortices in the tail of Uranus at solstice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incompressible vortex flow are observed in a large variety of astrophysical plasmas such as the convection zone and the atmosphere of stars, in astrophysical jets in stellar winds and in planetary magnetospheres. More specifically, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations have shown that two large scale interlaced Alfv\'enic vortices structure the magnetic tail of Uranus at solstice time. Assuming identical vortices, we compute the general linear structure of the flow near their centers within the frame of ideal MHD. We then use the analytic results to interpret and qualify the vortices observed in a 3D MHD simulation of a fast rotating Uranus-type planet.</description>

      <title>Bright Sungrazing Comets in a Great Historical Controversy and Prospects for Their Appearance in the Near Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15467v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Until the second half of the 19th century, two or more brief appearances of bright comets, such as the ones in 1668 and 1702, alike in aspect and motion, seen with a tail near the Sun, were almost universally believed to be periodic returns of a single object. It is likely that the exceptional story of Halley's comet was the compelling precedent for this school of thought. Application to sungrazers was discredited by the observed fragmentation of the nucleus of the giant sungrazer of 1882 shortly after perihelion. Generally, separations and orbital periods of the Kreutz comets are known to be governed in such events by the solar tidal force, while the range in the longitude of the nodal line is linked to the pyramidal architecture caused by nontidal, cascading fragmentation along the entire orbit and described by an updated contact-binary model. Perception of the sungrazer system was changed dramatically by coronagraphic imaging from space, which led to discovery of up to ten populations of dwarf comets. Past fragmentation patterns have been used to tentatively predict the arrivals of two bright Kreutz sungrazers -- a Population II member around 2027 (and before 2040) and a Population I member around 2050.</description>

      <title>Refractory and Volatile Species in the UV-to-IR Transmission Spectrum of Ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-178b with HST and JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters are unique compared to other planets because of the presence of both refractory and volatile gaseous species, enabling a new lens to constrain a planet's composition, chemistry, and formation. WASP-178b is one such ultra-hot Jupiter that was recently found to exhibit enormous NUV absorption between 0.2 and 0.4 $\mu$m from some combination of Fe+, Mg, and SiO. Here, we present new infrared observations of WASP-178b with HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRSpec/G395H, providing novel measurements of the volatile species H$_2$O and CO in WASP-178b's atmosphere. Atmospheric retrievals find a range of compositional interpretations depending on which dataset is retrieved, the type of chemistry assumed, and the temperature structure parametrization used due to the combined effects of thermal dissociation, the lack of volatile spectral features besides H$_2$O and CO, and the relative weakness of H$_2$O and CO themselves. Taken together with a new state-of-the-art characterization of the host star, our retrieval analyses suggests a solar to super-solar [O/H] and [Si/H], but sub-solar [C/H], perhaps suggesting rock-laden atmospheric enrichment near the H$_2$O iceline. To obtain meaningful abundance constraints for this planet, it was essential to combine the JWST IR data with short-wavelength HST observations, highlighting the ongoing synergy between the two facilities.</description>

      <title>Deep Mantle-Atmosphere Coupling and Carbonaceous Bombardment: Options for Biomolecule Formation on an Oxidized Early Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding what environmental conditions prevailed on early Earth during the Hadean eon, and how this set the stage for the origins of life, remains a challenge. Geologic processes such as serpentinization and bombardment by chondritic material during the late veneer might have been very active, shaping an atmospheric composition reducing enough to allow efficient photochemical synthesis of HCN, one of the key precursors of prebiotic molecules. HCN can rain out and accumulate in warm little ponds (WLPs), forming prebiotic molecules such as nucleobases and the sugar ribose. These molecules could condense to nucleotides, the building blocks of RNA molecules, one of the ingredients of life. Here, we perform a systematic study of potential sources of reducing gases on Hadean Earth and calculate the concentrations of prebiotic molecules in WLPs based on a comprehensive geophysical and atmospheric model. We find that in a reduced H$_2$-dominated atmosphere, carbonaceous bombardment can produce enough HCN to reach maximum WLP concentrations of $\sim 1-10\,\mathrm{mM}$ for nucleobases and, in the absence of seepage, $\sim 10-100\,\mathrm{\mu M}$ for ribose. If the Hadean atmosphere was initially oxidized and CO$_2$-rich ($90\,\%$), we find serpentinization alone can reduce the atmosphere, resulting in WLP concentrations of an order of magnitude lower than the reducing carbonaceous bombardment case. In both cases, concentrations are sufficient for nucleotide synthesis, as shown in experimental studies. RNA could have appeared on Earth immediately after it became habitable (about $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ after the Moon-forming impact), or it could have (re)appeared later at any time up to the beginning of the Archean.</description>

      <title>The Exoplanet Citizen Science Pipeline: Human Factors and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the progress of work to streamline and simplify the process of exoplanet observation by citizen scientists. International collaborations such as ExoClock and Exoplanet Watch enable citizen scientists to use small telescopes to carry out transit observations. These studies provide essential supports for space missions such as JWST and ARIEL. Contributions include maintenance or recovery of ephemerides, follow up confirmation and transit time variations. Ongoing observation programs benefit from a large pool of observers, with a wide variety of experience levels. Our projects work closely with these communities to streamline their observation pipelines and enable wider participation. Two complementary approaches are taken: Star Guide applies human-centric design and community consultation to identify points of friction within existing systems and provide complementary online tools and resources to reduce barriers to entry to the observing community. Machine Learning is used to accelerate data processing and automate steps which are currently manual, providing a streamlined tool for citizen science and a scalable solution for large-scale archival research.</description>

      <title>A 7-Day Multi-Wavelength Flare Campaign on AU Mic. II: Electron Densities and Kinetic Energies from High-Frequency Radio Flares</title>

Abstract: M dwarfs are the most common type of star in the solar neighborhood, and many exhibit frequent and highly energetic flares. To better understand these events across the electromagnetic spectrum, a campaign observed AU Mic (dM1e) over 7 days from the X-ray to radio regimes. Here, we present high-time-resolution light curves from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) Ku band (12--18 GHz) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) K band (16--25 GHz), which observe gyrosynchrotron radiation and directly probe the action of accelerated electrons within flaring loops. Observations reveal 16 VLA and 3 ATCA flares of varying shapes and sizes, from a short (30 sec) spiky burst to a long-duration ($\sim$5 hr) decaying exponential. The Ku-band spectral index is found to often evolve during flares. Both rising and falling spectra are observed in the Ku-band, indicating optically thick and thin flares, respectively. Estimations from optically thick radiation indicate higher loop-top magnetic field strengths ($\sim$1 kG) and sustained electron densities ($\sim$10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) than previous observations of large M-dwarf flares. We estimate the total kinetic energies of gyrating electrons in optically thin flares to be between 10$^{32}$ and 10$^{34}$ erg when the local magnetic field strength is between 500 and 700 G. These energies are able to explain the combined radiated energies from multi-wavelength observations. Overall, values are more aligned with modern radiative-hydrodynamic simulations of M-dwarf flares, and future modeling efforts will better constrain findings.</description>

      <title>Probing interplanetary scintillation using broadband VLBI</title>

Abstract: Advancements in VLBI instrumentation, driven by the geodetic community's goal of achieving positioning accuracy of 1 mm and stability of 0.1 mm/y, have led to the development of new broadband systems. Here, we assess the potential of these new capabilities for space weather monitoring. These enhanced VLBI capabilities were used to investigate interplanetary scintillation (IPS), a phenomenon caused by the scattering of radio waves due to density irregularities in the solar wind. Compact radio sources near the Sun were observed using the AuScope VLBI array in Australia, which consists of 12-meter telescopes at Hobart, Katherine, and Yarragadee. The baseline lengths between these telescopes are approximately 3400 km (Hobart-Katherine), 3200 km (Hobart-Yarragadee), and 2400 km (Katherine-Yarragadee). The observations covered solar elongations from 6.5$^\circ$ to 11.3$^\circ$ and frequencies between 3 and 13 GHz. The study focused on phase scintillation as an indicator of turbulence in the solar wind. As the solar elongation decreased, we observed an increase in the phase scintillation index, consistent with theoretical models. Importantly, the broadband system also detected IPS using relatively weak radio sources. Additionally, the phase scintillation increased with baseline length, in agreement with Kolmogorov turbulence with an index of 11/3. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of geodetic broadband VLBI in capturing detailed features of the solar wind. This capability enables continuous space weather monitoring and advances our understanding of solar and interplanetary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Analyses of anomalous lensing events detected from the UKIRT microlensing survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) microlensing survey was conducted over four years, from 2016 to 2019, with the goal of serving as a precursor to future near-infrared microlensing surveys (Shvartzvald et al. 2017). Focusing on stars in the Galactic center and utilizing near-infrared passbands, the survey identified approximately one thousand microlensing events, 27 of which displayed anomalies in their light curves (Wen et al. 2023). This paper presents an analysis of these anomalous events, aiming to uncover the underlying causes of the observed anomalies. The events were analyzed under various configurations, considering the potential binarity of both the lens and the source. For 11 events that were additionally observed by other optical microlensing surveys, including those conducted by the OGLE, KMTNet, and MOA collaborations, we incorporated their data into our analysis. Among the reported anomalous events, we revealed the nature of 24 events except for three events, in which one was likely to be a transient variable, and two were were difficult to accurately characterize their nature due to the limitations of the available data. We confirmed the binary lens nature of the anomalies in 22 events. Among these, we verified the earlier discovery that the companion in the binary lens system UKIRT11L is a planetary object. Accurately describing the anomaly in UKIRT21 required a model that accounted for the binarity of both the lens and the source. For two events UKIRT01 and UKIRT17, the anomalies could be interpreted using either a binary-source or a binary-lens model.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Hall Effect Implementations in Hall-Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is no standard numerical implementation of the Hall effect, which is one of the non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects. Numerical instability arises when a simple implementation is used, in which the Hall electric field is added to the electric field to update magnetic fields without further modifications to the numerical scheme. In this paper, several implementations proposed in the literature are compared to identify an approach that provides stable and accurate results. We consider two types of implementations of the Hall effect. One is a modified version of the Harten-Lax-van Leer method (Hall-HLL) in which the phase speeds of whistler waves are adopted as the signal speeds; the other involves adding a fourth-order hyper-resistivity to a Hall-MHD code. Based on an extensive series of test calculations, we found that hyper-resistivity yields more accurate results than the Hall-HLL, particularly in problems where the whisler-wave timescale is shorter than the the timescale of physical processes of interest. Through both von Neumann stability analysis and numerical experiments, an appropriate coefficient for the hyper-resistivity is determined.</description>

      <title>Connecting a Magnetized Disk to a Convective Low-mass Protostar: A Global Three-dimensional Model of Boundary Layer Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the early stages of star formation, boundary layer accretion, where protostars accrete material from disks extending down to their surfaces, plays a crucial role. Understanding how a magneto-rotational-instability (MRI)-active disk connects to a protostar's surface remains a significant challenge. To investigate the mechanisms of mass and angular momentum transfer, we develop a global, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model of boundary layer accretion around a magnetized, convective low-mass protostar. Our results reveal that angular momentum transport mechanisms transition significantly from the outer MRI-active disk to the protostellar surface. Various mechanisms--MRI, spiral shocks, coronal accretion, jets, and disk winds--contribute to angular momentum transfer, resulting in three distinct disk structures: (1) the MRI-active disk, (2) the transition layer, and (3) the boundary layer. The simulated protostar is strongly magnetized due to the accumulation of the disk fields, wrapping by disk toroidal fields, and stellar dynamo activity. Magnetic concentrations analogous to starspots form on the protostar and interact with the rotating disk gas to generate spiral shocks. These shocks play a key role in driving accretion. These findings demonstrate the necessity of global MHD models for a comprehensive understanding of angular momentum transport. Additionally, we identify explosive events triggered by magnetic reconnection in both the protostar and the disk atmosphere. We also find decretion flows in the disk midplane, which may be important for the radial transport of refractory materials, such as Calcium-Aluminium-rich Inclusions (CAIs) precursor gas, to the outer disk.</description>

      <title>Giant Outer Transiting Exoplanet Mass (GOT `EM) Survey. V. Two Giant Planets in Kepler-511 but Only One Ran Away</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems hosting multiple giant planets are important laboratories for understanding planetary formation and migration processes. We present a nearly decade-long Doppler spectroscopy campaign from the HIRES instrument on the Keck-I telescope to characterize the two transiting giant planets orbiting Kepler-511 on orbits of 27 days and 297 days. The radial velocity measurements yield precise masses for both planets: $0.100^{+0.036}_{-0.039}$ ($2.6 \sigma$) and $0.44^{+0.11}_{-0.12}$ (4$\sigma$) Jupiter masses respectively. We use these masses to infer their bulk metallicities (i.e., metal mass fraction $0.87 \pm 0.03$ and $0.22 \pm 0.04$ respectively). Strikingly, both planets contain approximately $25-30$ Earth masses of heavy elements but have very different amounts of hydrogen and helium. Envelope mass loss cannot account for this difference due to the relatively large orbital distance and mass of the inner planet. We conclude that the outer planet underwent runaway gas accretion while the inner planet did not. This bifurcation in accretion histories is likely a result of the accretion of gas with very different metallicities by the two planets or the late formation of the inner planet from a merger of sub-Neptunes. Kepler-511 uniquely demonstrates how giant planet formation can produce dramatically different outcomes even for planets in the same system.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Observing Strategy for Solar System Science: Incremental Templates in Year 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is due to commence the 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the end of 2025. To detect transient/variable sources and identify solar system objects (SSOs), the processing pipelines require templates of the static sky to perform difference imaging. During the first year of the LSST, templates must be generated as the survey progresses, otherwise SSOs cannot be discovered nightly. The incremental template generation strategy has not been finalized; therefore, we use the Metric Analysis Framework (MAF) and a simulation of the survey cadence (one_snap_v4.0_10yrs}) to explore template generation in Year 1. We have assessed the effects of generating templates over timescales of days-weeks, when at least four images of sufficient quality are available for $\geq90\%$ of the visit. We predict that SSO discoveries will begin $\sim$2-3 months after the start of the survey. We find that the ability of the LSST to discover SSOs in real-time is reduced in Year 1. This is especially true for detections in areas of the sky that receive fewer visits, such as the North Ecliptic Spur (NES), and in less commonly used filters, such as the $u$ and $g$-bands. The lack of templates in the NES dominates the loss of real-time SSO discoveries; across the whole sky the MAF Main-Belt asteroid (MBA) discovery metric decreases by up to $63\%$ compared to the baseline observing strategy, whereas the metric decreases by up to $79\%$ for MBAs in the NES alone.</description>

      <title>Seven decades of exploring planetary interiors with rotating convection experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interiors of many planets consist mostly of fluid layers. When these layers are subject to superadiabatic temperature or compositional gradients, turbulent convection transports heat and momentum. In addition, planets are fast rotators. Thus, the key process that underpins planetary evolution, the dynamo action, flow patterns and more, is rotating convection. Because planetary interiors are inaccessible to direct observation, experiments offer physically consistent models that are crucial to guide our understanding. If we can fully understand the laboratory model, we may eventually fully understand the original. Experimentally reproducing rotating thermal convection relevant to planetary interiors comes with specific challenges, e.g. modelling the central gravity field of a planet that is parallel to the temperature gradient. Three classes of experiments tackle this challenge. One approach consists of using an alternative central force field, such as the electric force. These are, however, weaker than gravity and require going to space. Another method entails rotating the device fast enough so that the centrifugal force supersedes Earth's gravity. This mimics the equatorial regions of a planet. Lastly, by using the actual lab gravity aligned with the rotation axis, insight into the polar regions is gained. These experiments have been continuously refined during the past seven decades. We review their evolution, from the early days of visualising the onset patterns of convection, over central force field experiments in spacecrafts, liquid metal experiments, to the latest optical velocity mapping of rotating magnetoconvection in sulfuric acid inside high-field magnets. We show how innovative experimental design and emerging experimental techniques advanced our understanding and painted a more realistic picture of planetary interiors, including Earth's liquid metal outer core.</description>

      <title>Free-floating planetary mass objects in LDN 1495 from Euclid Early Release Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Substellar objects, including brown dwarfs and free-floating planetary-mass objects, are a significant product of star formation. Their sensitivity to initial conditions and early dynamical evolution makes them especially valuable for studying planetary and stellar formation processes. Aims. We search for brown dwarfs and isolated planetary mass objects in a young star-forming region to better constrain their formation mechanisms. Methods. We took advantage of the Euclid unprecedented sensitivity, spatial resolution and wide field of view to search for brown dwarfs and free-floating planetary mass objects in the LDN 1495 region of the Taurus molecular clouds. We combined the recent Euclid Early Release Observations with older very deep ground-based images obtained over more than 20 yr to derive proper motions and multiwavelength photometry and to select members based on their morphology and their position in a proper motion diagram and in nine color-magnitude diagrams. Results. We identified 15 point sources whose proper motions, colors, and luminosity are consistent with being members of LDN 1495. Six of these objects were already known M9-L1 members. The remaining nine are newly identified sources whose spectral types might range from late-M to early-T types, with masses potentially as low as 1~2 MJup based on their luminosity and according to evolutionary models. However, follow-up observations are needed to confirm their nature, spectral type, and membership. When it is extrapolated to the entire Taurus star-forming region, this result suggests the potential presence of several dozen free-floating planetary mass objects.</description>
