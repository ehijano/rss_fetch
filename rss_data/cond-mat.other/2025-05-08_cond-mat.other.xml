      <title>Phase Retrieval via Gain-Based Photonic XY-Hamiltonian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-retrieval from coded diffraction patterns (CDP) is important to X-ray crystallography, diffraction tomography and astronomical imaging, yet remains a hard, non-convex inverse problem. We show that CDP recovery can be reformulated exactly as the minimisation of a continuous-variable XY Hamiltonian and solved by gain-based photonic networks. The coupled-mode equations we exploit are the natural mean-field dynamics of exciton-polariton condensate lattices, coupled-laser arrays and driven photon Bose-Einstein condensates, while other hardware such as the spatial photonic Ising machine can implement the same update rule through high-speed digital feedback, preserving full optical parallelism. Numerical experiments on images, two- and three-dimensional vortices and unstructured complex data demonstrate that the gain-based solver consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Relaxed-Reflect-Reflect (RRR) algorithm in the medium-noise regime (signal-to-noise ratios 10--40 dB) and retains this advantage as problem size scales. Because the physical platform performs the continuous optimisation, our approach promises fast, energy-efficient phase retrieval on readily available photonic hardware. uch as two- and three-dimensional vortices, and unstructured random data. Moreover, the solver's accuracy remains high as problem sizes increase, underscoring its scalability.</description>

      <title>Internal and External Field Effects upon Crystal Field Excitations in REFeO$_3$ (RE = Nd$^{3+}$, Er$^{3+}$, Yb$^{3+}$, Pr$^{3+}$, and Ho$^{3+}$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crystal field (CF) excitations of Kramers (Nd$^{3+}$, Er$^{3+}$, and Yb$^{3+}$) and non-Kramers (Pr$^{3+}$ and Ho$^{3+}$) rare earth ions in rare earth orthoferrites REFeO$_{3}$ were systematically studied by simulations. The optimised CF models were used to study the internal and external field impacts to the CF excitation peaks of these Kramers and non-Kramers ions. The Kramers ions excitations consist of doublets due to the Kramers degeneracy theorem while the non-Kramers ions excitations are non-degenerated singlets. The ground-state doublets of all Kramers ions undergo peak splitting and generate low energy excitation peaks ~ 1 meV under the internal magnetic fields from the Fe$^{3+}$ and RE$^{3+}$ sublattices. The ground-states of non-Kramers ions may form pseudo doublets due to the accidental degeneracy of two singlet states, as the case of Ho$^{3+}$ in HoFeO$_3$. Such pseudo-doublet ground states can split and produce low energy excitations just like the Kramers ions. However, singlet ground states of non-Kramers ions without accidental degeneracy, like Pr$^{3+}$, has no ground state excitation and splitting at zero fields. A ground-state singlet excitation shows up under non-zero magnetic fields due to the symmetry breaking induced by the magnetic fields. The internal/external magnetic field effects on CF excitations in REFeO$_3$ demonstrate strong anisotropies. The local symmetry was confirmed to play the critical role in the CF excitation splitting and anisotropic responses to magnetic fields in REFeO$_{3}$. This study provides a consistent in-depth understanding to the abnormal Zeeman splitting effect of the CF ground states in REFeO$_{3}$.</description>

      <title>Steady-state heat engines driven by finite reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a consistent thermodynamic analysis of stochastic thermal engines driven by finite-size reservoirs, which are in turn coupled to infinite-size reservoirs. We consider a cyclic operation mode, where the working medium couples sequentially to hot and cold reservoirs, and a continuous mode with both reservoirs coupled simultaneously. We derive an effective temperature for the finite-size reservoirs determining the entropy production for two-state engines in the sequential coupling scenario, and show that finite-size reservoirs can meaningfully affect the power when compared to infinite-size reservoirs in both sequential and simultaneous coupling scenarios. We also investigate a three-state engine comprising two interacting units and optimize its performance in the presence of a finite reservoir. Notably, we show that the efficiency at maximum power can exceed the Curzon-Ahlborn bound with finite reservoirs. Our work introduces tools to optimize the performance of nanoscale engines under realistic conditions of finite reservoir heat capacity and imperfect thermal isolation.</description>

      <title>Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.</description>

      <title>General Hamiltonian description of nonreciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active colloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in general nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.</description>

      <title>Unconventional magnetoresistance and spin gapless semiconductor like behavior across the Martensitic transformation in off-stoichiometric Co-Fe-Ti-Si Heusler alloy thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the effect of anti-site disorder on magnetic, electrical resistivity, transverse magnetoresistance MR, and anomalous Hall resistivity of off-stoichiometric CFTS Heusler alloy thin films, with a particular focus on martensitic phase transformation and spin gapless semiconductor SGS-like behavior, is investigated. These thin films were grown on Si (100) substrate at different substrate temperatures, TS, ranging from 200 C to 550 C using magnetron sputtering, enabling control over the degree of anti-site atomic ordering from disordered A2 to ordered L21. All the films, irrespective of their disorder, exhibit a distinct thermal hysteresis and significant drop in resistivity, crossover from asymmetric to symmetric magnetoresistance, and a sharp increase in MR around 300 K, confirming the occurrence of a thermo-elastic martensitic phase transformation. Detailed analysis of resistivity data indicates that for TS200 and TS350 films, a SGS based two channel model describes the conductivity in the martensite phase, whereas TS450, TS500, and TS550 films, exhibit a usual metallic behavior with a resistivity minimum at low temperatures. All the CFTS films show soft ferromagnetic nature and follow the spin-wave equation up to 390 K. The saturation magnetization and Hall conductivity increase with increasing crystalline order. The scaling relation between the longitudinal resistivity and the anomalous Hall resistivity in the martensite phase revels that skew scattering is the dominating contribution in disordered films, and a change in charge carrier type from hole to electron around the martensitic transformation temperature. The asymmetric MR, persistent up to room temperature, highlights the potential of these films for spintronic applications such as spin valves.</description>

      <title>Flux enhanced localization and reentrant delocalization in the quench dynamics of two interacting bosons on a Bose-Hubbard ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quench dynamics of two bosons possessing onsite repulsive interaction on a two-leg ladder and show that the presence of uniform flux piercing through the plaquettes of the ladder favors the localization of the bound states in the dynamics. We find that when the two bosons are symmetrically initialized on the edge rung of the ladder, they tend to edge-localize in their quantum walk - a phenomenon which is not possible in the absence of flux. On the other hand, when the bosons are initialized on the bulk rung they never localize and exhibit linear spreading in their quantum walk. Interestingly, however, we find that in the later case a finite flux favours localization of the bulk bound states in the presence of sufficiently weak quasiperiodic disorder which is otherwise insufficient to localize the particles in the absence of flux. In both the cases, we obtain that the localization in the dynamics strongly depends on the combined effect of the flux and interaction strengths, as a result which we obtain a signature of re-entrant delocalization as a function of flux (interaction) for fixed interaction (flux) strengths.</description>

      <title>Electrical Control of the Exchange Bias Effect at Model Ferromagnet-Altermagnet Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work analyzes the behavior of the interface between a ferromagnetic material and an alter-magnet. We use a well-established line of arguments based on electronic mean-field calculations to show that new surface phenomena that lead to altermagnetic materials induce an exchange bias effect on the nearby ferromagnet. We reveal the physical mechanisms behind this phenomenon that lead to quantitative control over its strength. Interestingly, we predict exotic electric-field-induced phenomena. This is an analogy to the relationship between exchange bias and the injection of spin currents in spin-transfer-dominated scenarios, which has been reported earlier in the traditional antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic junction.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Electric Model of a Macrospin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20811v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamics of a ferromagnetic macrospin (e.g., a free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)) can be described in terms of equivalent capacitor charge $Q$ and inductor flux $\Phi$, in a manner similar to a standard electric LC circuit, but with strongly nonlinear and coupled capacitance and inductance. This description allows for the inclusion of Gilbert damping and spin transfer torques and yields a relatively simple equivalent electric circuit, which can be easily modeled in LTspice or other electrical engineering software. It allows one to easily simulate advanced electrical circuits containing MTJs and conventional electronic components in standard simulation software.</description>

      <title>Quantum precursors to Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem in Floquet spin-$J$ systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem proves that the resonant tori of classical integrable Hamiltonians are broken when a non-integrable perturbation is introduced, whereas non-resonant tori only get deformed for up to a finite value of the perturbative parameter. In this letter, we identify quantum precursors to the KAM theorem in one-degree-of-freedom spin Hamiltonians periodically perturbed by instantaneous kicks. After recognizing quantum signatures of resonances in the Floquet eigenstates of the perturbed Hamiltonian, we reveal a differentiated sensitivity to the perturbation of the eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, depending on whether the states satisfy a resonant condition or not. It is also shown that this differentiated sensitivity becomes more pronounced as the system size increases, leading to the KAM theorem in the classical limit $J\rightarrow\infty$. Numerical and analytical results obtained from unitary perturbation theory strongly support these findings. Although specific to kicked models, our results can be easily extended to more general scenarios, allowing the identification of the quantum mechanism that corresponds to the KAM theorem in the classical limit.</description>
