      <title>Cohomological boundedness of twisted coherent Springer sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the coherent Springer sheaf and its parabolic analogues are concentrated in cohomological degree $0$, as predicted by Ben-Zvi-Chen-Helm-Nadler, Zhu, Emerton-Gee-Hellmann, Hansen, and others. More generally, we show that the universal trace functor for a mixed partial affine Hecke category is right t-exact with respect to the exotic t-structure given by Bezrukavnikov-Mirkovi\'c's noncommutative Springer resolution, and left t-exact with respect to the monoidally dual t-structure. To this end, we construct an explicit complex computing the universal trace functor for certain monoidal categories over quotient stacks.</description>

      <title>Degenerations of CoHAs of 2-Calabi-Yau categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By work of Davison and Meinhardt, the cohomological Hall algebra of a symmetric quiver with potential admits a geometrically defined filtration (the perverse filtration) whose associated graded is a supercommutative algebra. In the case of the triple quiver of a quiver with the canonical cubic potential, which corresponds to the preprojective algebra of the quiver via dimensional reduction, there is an additional filtration (the less perverse filtration), which is defined more generally for cohomological Hall algebras of suitably geometric 2-Calabi-Yau categories in work of Davison. In this paper, we show that the degenerations of the cohomological Hall algebras of preprojective algebras and more generally 2-Calabi-Yau categories with respect to the less perverse filtration is isomorphic to the enveloping algebra of the current Lie algebra of the BPS Lie algebra. This result applies in particular to CoHAs of local systems on Riemann surfaces and Higgs bundles on smooth projective curves. We extend this description to deformations of the cohomological Hall algebra obtained via torus actions on the arrows of the quiver and deformed canonical cubic potentials via the deformed dimensional reduction of Davison-P\u{a}durariu. Last, we use our results to compare the less perverse filtration on CoHAs of preprojective algebras with the order filtration on the Maulik-Okounkov Yangian, via the comparison isomorphism of Botta-Davison and Schiffmann-Vasserot.</description>

      <title>Torsion pairs via cosilting mutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a left artinian ring A, we study the lattice torsA of torsion pairs in the category of finitely generated A-modules by considering an isomorphic lattice formed by certain closed sets in a topological space associated to A, the Ziegler spectrum of the unbounded derived category of ModA. Torsion pairs in torsA turn out to be adjacent if and only if the associated closed sets are related by an operation which is induced by mutation of cosilting complexes. We describe this operation from several perspectives and present a number of applications in the case when A is a finite dimensional algebra.</description>

      <title>Highest weight categories and stability conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highest weight categories are an abstraction of the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras introduced by Cline, Parshall and Scott in the late 1980s. There are by now many characterisations of when an abelian category is highest weight, but most are hard to verify in practice. We present two new criteria - one numerical in terms of the Grothendieck group, and one in terms of Bridegland stability conditions - which are easier to verify. The stability criterion naturally generalises to a characterisation of properly stratified categories. The numerical criterion implies a criterion of Green and Schroll for when modules over a monomial algebra are highest weight.</description>

      <title>Tropical symmetries of cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms of cluster algebras and show that their induced action on the g-vectors can be realized by tropicalising their action on the homogeneous $\hat{y}$ (or $\mathcal{X}$) variables of a chosen initial cluster. This perspective allows us to interpret the action on g-vectors as a change of coordinates in the tropical setting. Focusing on Grassmannian cluster algebras, we analyse tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms in detail. We derive tropical analogues of the braid group action and the twist map on both g-vectors and tableaux. We introduce the notions of unstable and stable fixed points for quasi-automorphisms, which prove useful for constructing cluster monomials and non-real modules, respectively.
  As an application, we demonstrate that the counts of prime non-real tableaux with a fixed number of columns in $\mathrm{SSYT}(3, [9])$ and $\mathrm{SSYT}(4, [8])$, arising from the braid group action on stable fixed points, are governed by Euler's totient function. Furthermore, we apply our findings to scattering amplitudes in physics, providing a novel interpretation of the square root associated with the four-mass box integral via stable fixed points of quasi-automorphisms of the Grassmannian cluster algebra $\CC[\Gr(4,8)]$.</description>

      <title>On endomorphism algebras of silting complexes over hereditary abelian categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{E}$ be the class of finite-dimensional algebras isomorphic to endomorphism algebras of silting complexes over hereditary abelian categories. It is proved that the class $\mathcal{E}$ is closed under taking idempotent quotients, idempotent subalgebras and $\tau$-reduction. We also show that the proper class consisting of shod algebras is also closed under these operations. In addition, several classic classes of algebras -- including laura, glued, weakly shod algebras -- are proved to be closed under idempotent quotients, thereby generalizing a known result originally established for specific idempotents.</description>

      <title>Differential Galois groups of $G$-connections with Coxeter singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental theorem of Katz \cite{Katz87} determines the differential Galois groups of rank $n$ connections on algebraic curves with slope $r/n$ at a singularity, where $\gcd(r,n)=1$. We extend this result to $G$-connections, where $G$ is a simple algebraic group and the slope is $r/h$, with $h$ the Coxeter number of $G$ and $\gcd(r,h)=1$. This allows us to compute the differential Galois groups of a broad class of $G$-connections that have been central to recent advances in the geometric Langlands program and the Deligne--Simpson problem -- namely, Coxeter connections, generalised Frenkel--Gross connections, and Airy connections. We apply our results to inverse differential Galois theory by giving uniform and explicit constructions of $G$-connections whose differential Galois groups realise all reductive subgroups of maximal degree.</description>

      <title>Generalized finite and affine $W$-algebras in type $A$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new family of affine $W$-algebras $W^k(\lambda,\mu)$ parameterized by partitions $\lambda$ and $\mu$ associated with the centralizers of nilpotent elements in $\mathfrak{gl}_N$. The new family unifies a few known classes of $W$-algebras. In particular, for the column-partition $\lambda$ we recover the affine $W$-algebras $W^k(\mathfrak{gl}_N,f)$ of Kac, Roan and Wakimoto, associated with nilpotent elements $f\in\mathfrak{gl}_N$ of type $\mu$. Our construction is based on a version of the BRST complex of the quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction. We show that the application of the Zhu functor to the vertex algebras $W^k(\lambda,\mu)$ yields a family of generalized finite $W$-algebras $U(\lambda,\mu)$ which we also describe independently as associative algebras.</description>

      <title>Character tables are ideal Perron similarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An invertible matrix is called a Perron similarity if it diagonalizes an irreducible, nonnegative matrix. Each Perron similarity gives a nontrivial polyhedral cone, called the spectracone, and polytope, called the spectratope, of realizable spectra (thought of as vectors in complex Euclidean space). A Perron similarity is called ideal if its spectratope coincides with the conical hulls of its rows. Identifying ideal Perron similarities is of great interest in the pursuit of the longstanding nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem.
  In this work, it is shown that the character table of a finite group is an ideal Perron similarity. In addition to expanding ideal Perron similarities to include a broad class of matrices, the results unify previous works into a single, theoretical framework.
  It is demonstrated that the spectracone can be described by finitely-many group-theoretic inequalities. When the character table is real, we derive a group-theoretic formula for the volume of the projected Perron spectratope, which is a simplex. Finally, an implication for further research is given.</description>
