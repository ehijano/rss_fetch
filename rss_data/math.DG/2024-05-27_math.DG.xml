      <title>Metabelian distributions and sub-Riemannian geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We begin by characterizing metabelian distributions in terms of principal bundle structures. Then, we prove that in sub-Riemannian manifolds with metabelian distributions of rank $r$, the projection of strictly singular trajectories to some $r$-dimensional manifold must remain within an analytic variety. As a consequence, for rank-2 metabelian distributions, geodesics are of class $C^1$.</description>

      <title>Projective Geometry and PDE Prolongation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this dissertation we study basic local differential geometry, projective differential geometry, and prolongations of overdetermined geometric partial differential equations. It is simple to prolong an n-th order linear ordinary differential equation into n first order equations. For partial differential equations there is a related process but it is far more subtle and complex. Considerable work has been done in this area but much of this is very abstract and there are many open problems even at a relatively elementary level. We introduce the reader to differential geometry and tractor calculus before recovering the projective tractor and cotractor connections via the prolongation of appropriate partial differential equations. Following this, we study prolongation of other projectively invariant equations, a particular focus is an equation known as the projective metrisability equation.</description>

      <title>Inverse mean curvature flow with outer obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new boundary condition for the weak inverse mean curvature flow, which gives canonical and non-trivial solutions in bounded domains. Roughly speaking, the boundary of the domain serves as an outer obstacle, and the evolving hypersurfaces are assumed to stick tangentially to the boundary upon contact. In smooth bounded domains, we prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for weak solutions, and establish $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity of the level sets up to the obstacle. The proof combines various techniques, including elliptic regularization, blow-up analysis, and certain parabolic estimates. As an analytic application, we address the well-posedness problem for the usual weak inverse mean curvature flow, showing in a broad generality that the initial value problem always admits a unique maximal (or innermost) weak solution.</description>

      <title>SU(2) structures in four dimensions and Plebanski formalism for GR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An SU(2) structure in four dimensions can be described as a triple of 2-forms Sigma^i in Lambda^2(M), i=1,2,3 satisfying Sigma^i wedge Sigma^j ~ delta^{ij}. Such a triple defines a Riemannian signature metric on M. An SU(2) structure is said to be integrable if the holonomy of this Riemannian metric is contained in SU(2). It is well-known that this is the case if and only if the 2-forms are closed dSigma^i=0. The main purpose of the paper is to analyse the second order in derivatives diffeomorphism invariant action functionals that can be constructed for an SU(2) structure. The main result is that there is a unique such action functional if one imposes an additional requirement that the action is also SU(2) invariant, with SU(2) acting on the triple Sigma^i as in its vector representation. This action functional has a very simple expression in terms of the intrinsic torsion of the SU(2) structure. We show that its critical points are SU(2) structures whose associated metric is Einstein. The action we describe has also a first order in derivatives version, and we show how this is related to what in the physics literature is known as Plebanski formalism for GR.</description>

      <title>Closed mean curvature flows with asymptotically conical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that for any asymptotically conical self-shrinker, there exists a closed hypersurface such that the mean curvature flow starting from it develops a singularity modeled on the given shrinker. The main technique is the Wa\.zewski box argument, used by Stolarski \cite{Sto} in the proof of the corresponding theorem in the Ricci flow case.</description>

      <title>Improved generic regularity of codimension-1 minimizing integral currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a smooth, closed, oriented, $(n-1)$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. We show that there exist arbitrarily small perturbations $\Gamma'$ of $\Gamma$ with the property that minimizing integral $n$-currents with boundary $\Gamma'$ are smooth away from a set of Hausdorff dimension $\leq n-9-\varepsilon_n$, where $\varepsilon_n \in (0, 1]$ is a dimensional constant.
  This improves on our previous result (where we proved generic smoothness of minimizers in $9$ and $10$ ambient dimensions). The key ingredients developed here are a new method to estimate the full singular set of the foliation by minimizers and a proof of superlinear decay of closeness (near singular points) that holds even across non-conical scales.</description>

      <title>About generalized complex structures on $\mathbb S^6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of generalized complex structures on the six-dimensional sphere $\mathbb S^6$. We work with the generalized tangent bundle $\mathbb T\mathbb S^6\to \mathbb S^6$ and define the integrability of generalized geometric structures in terms of the Dorfman bracket. Specifically, we prove that there is not a direct way to induce a generalized complex structure on $\mathbb S^6$ from its usual nearly K\"ahler structure inherited from the octonions product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish fundamental properties satisfied by Parametrized Hamiltonian Stationary Legendrian Varifolds into the Heisenberg Group. Among other properties we prove the sequential weak closure of this space under local area control, finite topology control and conformal class control. This work is the second part of a project launched in [13] about the realisation by Hamiltonian stationary surfaces of any arbitrary non trivial minmax operations on the area among Legendrian surfaces in every closed Sasaki-Einstein 5 dimensional manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A direct reformulation of the Hamiltonian formalism in terms of the intrinsic geometry of infinitely prolonged differential equations is obtained. Concepts of spatial equation and spatial-gauge symmetry of a Lagrangian system of equations are introduced. A non-covariant canonical variational principle is proposed and demonstrated using the Maxwell equations as an example. A covariant canonical variational principle is formulated. The results obtained are applicable to any variational equations, including those that do not originate in physics.</description>

      <title>$N=(2,2)$ superfields and geometry revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take a fresh look at the relation between generalised K\"ahler geometry and $N=(2,2)$ supersymmetric sigma models in two dimensions formulated in terms of $(2,2)$ superfields. Dual formulations in terms of different kinds of superfield are combined to give a formulation with a doubled target space and both the original superfield and the dual superfield. For K\"ahler geometry, we show that this doubled geometry is Donaldson's deformation of the holomorphic cotangent bundle of the original K\"ahler manifold. This doubled formulation gives an elegant geometric reformulation of the equations of motion. We interpret the equations of motion as the intersection of two Lagrangian submanifolds (or of a Lagrangian submanifold with an isotropic one) in the infinite dimensional symplectic supermanifold which is the analogue of phase space. We then consider further extensions of this formalism, including one in which the geometry is quadrupled, and discuss their geometry.</description>
