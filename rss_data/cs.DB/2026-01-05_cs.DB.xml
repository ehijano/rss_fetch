      <title>From Metadata to Meaning: A Semantic Units Knowledge Graph for the Biodiversity Exploratories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) bear great potential for ecology and biodiversity researchers in their ability to support synthesis and integration efforts, meta-analyses, reasoning tasks, and overall machine interoperability of research data. However, this potential is yet to be realized as KGs are notoriously difficult to interact with via their query language SPARQL for many user groups alike. Additionally, a further hindrance for user-KG interaction is the fundamental disconnect between user requirements and requirements KGs have to fulfill regarding machine-interoperability, reasoning tasks, querying, and further technical requirements. Thus, many statements in a KG are of no semantic significance for end users. In this work, we investigate a potential remedy for this challenge: Semantic Units (SUs) are semantically significant, named subgraphs in a KG with the goal to enhance cognitive interoperability for users, and to provide responses to common KG modelling challenges. We model and construct a KG from publication and dataset metadata of the Biodiversity Exploratories (BE), a research platform for functional biodiversity research across research plots in Germany to contribute to biodiversity research from the perspective of computer science. We contribute further by delivering the first implementation of semantic units on a knowledge graph and investigate how SUs impact KG querying. Finally, we present two implementations of tasks that show how large language models (LLMs) can be used to extract structured metadata categories from publication and dataset titles and abstracts, and how embedding models can be used to enrich metadata with latent information, in an effort to support the creation of structured and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) metadata.</description>

      <title>Database Theory in Action: Yannakakis' Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yannakakis' seminal algorithm is optimal for acyclic joins, yet it has not been widely adopted due to its poor performance in practice. This paper briefly surveys recent advancements in making Yannakakis' algorithm more practical, in terms of both efficiency and ease of implementation, and points out several avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Avoiding Thread Stalls and Switches in Key-Value Stores: New Latch-Free Techniques and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant impediment to high performance in key-value stores is the high cost of thread switching or stalls. While there are many sources for this, a major one is the contention for resources. And this cost increases with load as conflicting operations more frequently try to access data concurrently. Traditional latch-based approaches usually handle these situations by blocking one or more contending threads. Latch-free techniques can avoid this behavior. But the payoff may be limited if latch-free techniques require executing wasted work. In this paper, we show how latch-free techniques exploit delta record updating and can significantly reduce wasted work by using notices, a new latch-free approach. This paper explains how notices work and can solve B-tree index maintenance problems, while avoiding thread switches or stalls. Other opportunities for avoiding thread switches or stalls are also discussed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive overview of current approaches and systems for combining graphs and time series data. We categorize existing systems into four architectural categories and analyze how these systems meet different requirements and exhibit distinct implementation characteristics to support both data types in a unified manner. Our overview aims to help readers understand and evaluate current options and trade-offs, such as the degree of cross-model integration, maturity, and openness.</description>

      <title>KELP: Robust Online Log Parsing Through Evolutionary Grouping Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time log analysis is the cornerstone of observability for modern infrastructure. However, existing online parsers are architecturally unsuited for the dynamism of production environments. Built on fundamentally static template models, they are dangerously brittle: minor schema drifts silently break parsing pipelines, leading to lost alerts and operational toil. We propose \textbf{KELP} (\textbf{K}elp \textbf{E}volutionary \textbf{L}og \textbf{P}arser), a high-throughput parser built on a novel data structure: the Evolutionary Grouping Tree. Unlike heuristic approaches that rely on fixed rules, KELP treats template discovery as a continuous online clustering process. As logs arrive, the tree structure evolves, nodes split, merge, and re-evaluate roots based on changing frequency distributions. Validating this adaptability requires a dataset that models realistic production complexity, yet we identify that standard benchmarks rely on static, regex-based ground truths that fail to reflect this. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce a new benchmark designed to reflect the structural ambiguity of modern production systems. Our evaluation demonstrates that KELP maintains high accuracy on this rigorous dataset where traditional heuristic methods fail, without compromising throughput. Our code and dataset can be found at codeberg.org/stonebucklabs/kelp</description>

      <title>DeXOR: Enabling XOR in Decimal Space for Streaming Lossless Compression of Floating-point Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With streaming floating-point numbers being increasingly prevalent, effective and efficient compression of such data is critical. Compression schemes must be able to exploit the similarity, or smoothness, of consecutive numbers and must be able to contend with extreme conditions, such as high-precision values or the absence of smoothness. We present DeXOR, a novel framework that enables decimal XOR procedure to encode decimal-space longest common prefixes and suffixes, achieving optimal prefix reuse and effective redundancy elimination. To ensure accurate and low-cost decompression even with binary-decimal conversion errors, DeXOR incorporates 1) scaled truncation with error-tolerant rounding and 2) different bit management strategies optimized for decimal XOR. Additionally, a robust exception handler enhances stability by managing floating-point exponents, maintaining high compression ratios under extreme conditions. In evaluations across 22 datasets, DeXOR surpasses state-of-the-art schemes, achieving a 15% higher compression ratio and a 20% faster decompression speed while maintaining a competitive compression speed. DeXOR also offers scalability under varying conditions and exhibits robustness in extreme scenarios where other schemes fail.</description>

      <title>QUITE: A Query Rewrite System Beyond Rules with LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Query rewrite transforms SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms that run more efficiently. Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite rules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance regressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query rewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite rules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques cannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts exhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and reasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL queries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly applying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address this issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and feedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based methods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite state machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and enhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we develop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate optimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection technique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive experiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over state-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior methods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.</description>

      <title>Database Theory in Action: From Inexpressibility to Efficiency in GQL's Order-Constrained Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pattern matching of core GQL, the new ISO standard for querying property graphs, cannot check whether edge values are increasing along a path, as established in recent work. We present a constructive translation that overcomes this limitation by compiling the increasing-edges condition into the input graph. Remarkably, the benefit of this construction goes beyond restoring expressiveness. In our proof-of-concept implementation in Neo4j's Cypher, where such path constraints are expressible but costly, our compiled version runs faster and avoids timeouts. This illustrates how a theoretically motivated translation can not only close an expressiveness gap but also bring practical performance gains.</description>

      <title>SPER: Accelerating Progressive Entity Resolution via Stochastic Bipartite Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entity Resolution (ER) is a critical data cleaning task for identifying records that refer to the same real-world entity. In the era of Big Data, traditional batch ER is often infeasible due to volume and velocity constraints, necessitating Progressive ER methods that maximize recall within a limited computational budget. However, existing progressive approaches fail to scale to high-velocity streams because they rely on deterministic sorting to prioritize candidate pairs, a process that incurs prohibitive super-linear complexity and heavy initialization costs. To address this scalability wall, we introduce SPER (Stochastic Progressive ER), a novel framework that redefines prioritization as a sampling problem rather than a ranking problem. By replacing global sorting with a continuous stochastic bipartite maximization strategy, SPER acts as a probabilistic high-pass filter that selects high-utility pairs in strictly linear time. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that SPER achieves significant speedups (3x to &gt;6x) over state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining comparable recall and precision.</description>

      <title>Enthuse: Efficient Adaptable High-throughput Streaming Aggregation Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18168v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aggregation queries are a series of computationally-demanding analytics operations on counted, grouped or time series data. They include tasks such as summation or finding the median among the items of the same group, and within a specified number of the last observed tuples for sliding window aggregation (SWAG). They have a wide range of applications including database analytics, operating systems, bank security and medical sensors. Existing challenges include the hardware complexity that comes with efficiently handling per-group states using hash-based approaches. This paper presents Enthuse, an adaptable pipeline for calculating a wide range of aggregation queries with high throughput. It is then adapted for SWAG and achieves up to 476x speedup over the CPU core of the same platform. It achieves unparalleled levels of performance and functionality such as a throughput of 1 GT/s on our setup for SWAG without groups, and more advanced operators with up to 4x the window sizes than the state-of-the-art with groups as an approximation for SWAG featuring per-group windows using a fraction of the resources and no DRAM.</description>

      <title>MTSQL-R1: Towards Long-Horizon Multi-Turn Text-to-SQL via Agentic Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-turn Text-to-SQL aims to translate a user's conversational utterances into executable SQL while preserving dialogue coherence and grounding to the target schema. However, most existing systems only regard this task as a simple text translation task and follow a short-horizon paradigm, generating a query per turn without execution, explicit verification, and refinement, which leads to non-executable or incoherent outputs. We present MTSQL-R1, an agentic training framework for long-horizon multi-turn Text-to-SQL. We cast the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database for execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence verification, performing an iterative propose to execute -&gt; verify -&gt; refine cycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that MTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance of environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for conversational semantic parsing. Full recipes (including code, trained models, logs, reasoning trajectories, etc.) will be released after the internal review to contribute to community research.</description>
