      <title>Out-of-plane Parallel Current in the Diffusion Regions: The Interaction Between Diffusion Region Systems and their Impact on the Outer EDR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dayside magnetic reconnection allows for the transfer of the solar wind's energy into Earth's magnetosphere. This process takes place in electron diffusion regions (EDRs) embedded in ion diffusion regions (IDRs), which form in the magnetopause boundary's current sheet. A significant out-of-plane parallel current contribution in the diffusion regions was reported in Beedle et al. 2023. In order to understand the underlying structure of this parallel current, we compared EDR statistical results with a 2.5D Particle-In Cell (PIC) simulation. From this comparison, we identified out-of-plane parallel current signatures as defining features of the outer EDR and IDR. This significant out-of-plane parallel current indicates the interaction of the IDR and EDR systems, and provides implications for not only understanding energy dissipation in the diffusion regions, but also determining the location of the outer EDR.</description>

      <title>Combined Classical and Quantum Accelerometers For the Next Generation of Satellite Gravity Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold atom interferometry (CAI)-based quantum accelerometers are very promising for future satellite gravity missions thanks to their strength in providing long-term stable and precise measurements of non-gravitational accelerations. However, their limitations due to the low measurement rate and the existence of ambiguities in the raw sensor measurements call for hybridization of the quantum accelerometer (Q-ACC) with a classical one (e.g., electrostatic) with higher bandwidth. While previous hybridization studies have so far considered simple noise models for the Q-ACC and neglected the impact of satellite rotation on the phase shift of the accelerometer, we perform here a more advanced hybridization simulation by implementing a comprehensive noise model for the satellite-based quantum accelerometers and considering the full impact of rotation, gravity gradient, and self-gravity on the instrument. We perform simulation studies for scenarios with different assumptions about quantum and classical sensors and satellite missions. The performance benefits of the hybrid solutions, taking the synergy of both classical and quantum accelerometers into account, will be quantified. We found that implementing a hybrid accelerometer onboard a future gravity mission improves the gravity solution by one to two orders in lower and higher degrees. In particular, the produced global gravity field maps show a drastic reduction in the instrumental contribution to the striping effect after introducing measurements from the hybrid accelerometers.</description>
