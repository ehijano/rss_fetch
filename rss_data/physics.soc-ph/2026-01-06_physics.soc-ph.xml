      <title>ESG Beliefs of Large Language Models: Evidence and Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine whether large language models (LLMs) hold systematic beliefs about environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues and how these beliefs compare with-and potentially influence-those of human market participants. Based on established surveys originally administered to professional and retail investors, we show that major LLMs exhibit a strong pro-ESG orientation. Compared with human investors, LLMs assign greater financial relevance for ESG performance, expect larger return premia for high-ESG firms, and display a stronger willingness to sacrifice financial returns for ESG improvements. These preferences are highly uniform and values-driven, in contrast to heterogeneous human views. Using a large dataset of analyst reports, we further show that sell-side analysts become significantly more optimistic about high-ESG firms after adopting LLMs for research. Our findings reveal that LLMs embed distinct, coherent ESG beliefs and that these beliefs can shape human judgments, highlighting a new channel through which AI adoption may influence financial markets.</description>

      <title>School Transport Electrification -- Adoption, Strategies, Methods and Policy: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The move towards electric school buses (ESBs) marks a critical step in creating a healthier and more sustainable future for students. To meet the ambitious goal of zero-emission school buses by 2035,this review focuses on the need assessment, practices, gaps, challenges, and way forward. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of more than 100 relevant sources, resulting in a final investigation. In-depth, systematic, and qualitative content analysis with SWOT analysis produced critical insights into school transport electrification. The results showed that 1.8% of the total buses in the US have already been converted to electric, where California alone owning 29% of the buses. Subsidies from various agencies and programs have contributed to the rapid growth of electrification. However, challenges in cost, technology, and policies must be mitigated through innovation and stakeholder partnerships. Policy support is boosting subsidies, industry investment and market readiness. Equitable policy is important to support underserved and disadvantaged populations, which can be addressed through four key dimensions of equity: procedural, recognition, distributive, and reparative equity. Furthermore, the traditional bus deployment model is still the most common, whereas Transportation-as-a-Service (TaaS) is an innovative ESB deployment model with the potential to accelerate ESB adoption by integrating vehicle-to-grid. SWOT analysis indicated that the achievement of the zero-emission goal, autonomous driving, and repowered vehicle technology are the greatest opportunities. Dynamic electrification strategies, V2G technology and system resiliency are yet to be discovered, which could be crucial for mass electrification.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss whether science is in the process of being transformed from a quest for causality to a quest for correlation in light of the recent development in artificial intelligence. We observe that while a blind trust in the most seductive promises of AI is surely to be avoided, a judicious combination of computer simulation based on physical insight and the machine learning ability to explore ultra-dimensional spaces, holds potential for transformative progress in the way science is going to be pursued in the years to come.</description>

      <title>The hidden sustainability bottleneck in high-entropy alloy design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of the enormous number of possible compositions, comparable to the number of stars in the universe, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) constitute a virtually inexhaustible materials space with highly versatile properties. Among these systems, HEAs are often proposed as potential substitutes for critical elements such as rare earths or platinum group metals. However, random or incremental exploration strategies are neither practical nor efficient at this scale. Targeted materials selection guided by sustainability considerations is therefore essential, yet identifying sustainable HEA compositions remains highly challenging. Here, we perform a comprehensive sustainability assessment of 30,201 equimolar HEA compositions and identify a resilient shortlist (approximately 5\%) that consistently exhibits favorable sustainability profiles across multiple evaluation schemes. Our analysis integrates complementary criteria including carbon footprint, environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, production compatibility, and resource availability. The resulting sustainability-based ranking provides a strategic roadmap for HEA research, enabling experimental efforts to be focused on compositions that are not only functionally promising but also scalable and resource-responsible. By aligning materials discovery with sustainability and supply constraints, this framework supports more efficient use of experimental resources while contributing to long-term industrial sustainability goals.</description>

      <title>Deep versus Broad Technology Search and the Timing of Innovation Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study offers a new perspective on the depth-versus-breadth debate in innovation strategy, by modeling inventive search within dynamic collective knowledge systems, and underscoring the importance of timing for technological impact. Using frontier machine learning to project patent citation networks in hyperbolic space, we analyze 4.9 million U.S. patents to examine how search strategies give rise to distinct temporal patterns in impact accumulation. We find that inventions based on deep search, which relies on a specialized understanding of complex recombination structures, drive higher short-term impact through early adoption within specialized communities, but face diminishing returns as innovations become "locked-in" with limited diffusion potential. Conversely, when inventions are grounded in broad search that spans disparate domains, they encounter initial resistance but achieve wider diffusion and greater long-term impact by reaching cognitively diverse audiences. Individual inventions require both depth and breadth for stable impact. Organizations can strategically balance approaches across multiple inventions: using depth to build reliable technological infrastructure while pursuing breadth to expand applications. We advance innovation theory by demonstrating how deep and broad search strategies distinctly shape the timing and trajectory of technological impact, and how individual inventors and organizations can leverage these mechanisms to balance exploitation and exploration.</description>

      <title>Prediction of airport on-time performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the factors contributing to departure and arrival delays at a major international airport and develop predictive models to estimate both the likelihood and duration of delays. Using logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting methods, we identify key predictors of flight punctuality, including historical delay rates of flight numbers and airlines, weather conditions, runway traffic, walk time from security to gate, and overall airport congestion. Our models achieve strong inference and predictive performance in both classification and regression tasks, demonstrating the potential for targeted operational interventions to improve on-time performance and providing actionable insights for airport management and airline operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Heraclitean Dialectical Concept Spaces (HDCS), a topological framework for modelling how concepts evolve. Concepts are represented as open regions generated by neighbourhoods in a feasible family, and their relationships are organised through overlaps and channel ideals. New concepts emerge from remainders where existing structures fail to fit together, and inherit their topology from these parent regions. HDCS extends across developmental stages using carry maps and a colimit topology, giving a global picture of conceptual change. Short case studies from economic exchange, biology, and the history of the zero symbol illustrate the scope of the framework.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model to Capture Urbanization Trajectory Induced by Economic Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of the urban population fraction data for sixteen populous countries over the last fifty years reveals a universal increase in urbanization, exhibiting four qualitatively distinct temporal patterns: (i) continuously accelerating growth, (ii) continuously decelerating growth, (iii) two-phase growth transitioning from acceleration to deceleration, and (iv) two-phase growth transitioning from deceleration to acceleration. To understand the origin of these diverse urbanization trajectories, we develop a simple coarse-grained model in which a country is segregated into two regions, a rural and an urban region. Population in each region evolves due to natural (sexual) growth and migration from rural to urban areas, with the migration rate governed by economic inequality, quantified through the difference in GDP per capita between the two regions. The GDP per capita of both regions is assumed to grow exponentially with distinct rates. We demonstrate that this minimal model, involving four dynamical variables and a small number of demographic and economic parameters, is capable of reproducing all four empirically observed urbanization patterns. Assuming demographic and economic parameters remain approximately constant over a 50-year timescale, we estimate coarse-grained parameters for the United States using empirical data and obtain optimized values that accurately reproduce its observed urbanization trajectory. Our results highlight how simple demographic-economic interactions can generate rich and diverse urbanization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Disruption Resilience in Intermodal Transport Networks: Integrating Flow Weighting and Centrality Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resilient intermodal freight networks are vital for sustaining supply chains amid increasing threats from natural hazards and cyberattacks. While transportation resilience has been widely studied, understanding how random and targeted disruptions affect both structural connectivity and functional performance remains a key challenge. To address this, our study evaluates the robustness of the U.S. intermodal freight network, comprising rail and water modes, using a simulation-based framework that integrates graph-theoretic metrics with flow-weighted centrality measures. We examine disruption scenarios including random failures as well as targeted node and edge removals based on static and dynamically updated degree and betweenness centrality. To reflect more realistic conditions, we also consider flow-weighted degree centralities and partial node degradation. Two resilience indicators are used: the size of the giant connected component (GCC) to measure structural connectivity, and flow-weighted network efficiency (NE) to assess freight mobility under disruption. Results show that progressively degrading nodes ranked by Weighted Degree Centrality to 60% of their original functionality causes a sharper decline in normalized NE, for up to approximately 45 affected nodes, than complete failure (100% loss of functionality) applied to nodes targeted by weighted betweenness centrality or selected at random. This highlights how partial degradation of high-tonnage hubs can produce disproportionately large functional losses. The findings emphasize the need for resilience strategies that go beyond network topology to incorporate freight flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Heavy tails in dynamic flow networks: Universal explanation of their emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overload-induced cascading failures can cause extreme disruptions in a wide range of networked systems, such as power grids, transportation networks, or financial systems. Empirical studies across domains report that the size of such disruptions often follows a Pareto- or heavy-tailed distribution. While many models reproduce this scaling behavior, they are either tailored to specific domains or based on simplified mechanisms that overlook key aspects of overload cascading behavior. Hence, a general understanding of the mechanisms driving scale-free behavior in these settings remains incomplete. In this paper, we develop a universal and analytically tractable model of overload cascading failures on flow networks, offering a new perspective on how Pareto-tailed disruptions emerge across networks. Our framework shows, under mild assumptions, that heavy-tailed disruptions can arise naturally from Pareto-tailed external inputs, and it establishes a transformation law linking the input and output tail exponents. We further identify broad conditions under which the resulting cascade cost exhibits a heavy-tailed distribution and show that the mechanism is robust across several domains, including power transmission, traffic networks, and processing systems. Our results provide a unified explanation for the emergence of scale-free failures in overload-driven systems and connect previously disparate, application-specific models under a unified framework.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Stabilization in Power Grids through Controlling Line Admittances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global transition from traditional power plants to renewable energy sources introduces new challenges in grid stability, primarily because inverter-based technologies provide insufficient inertia. To address this, we introduce an artificial intelligence algorithm that autonomously stabilizes power grids by adaptively tuning admittance regulators in response to disturbances. This Adaptive Admittance Controller (AAC) algorithm not only stabilizes the system in real time but also identifies the best regulator locations, thereby unifying grid planning and real time control within a single framework. When tested on a real UK power grid, the AAC markedly reduces frequency deviations and rapidly restores nominal operation. In addition, the algorithm isolates a small number of key regulators and intervenes only on these, lowering both system complexity and cost. The AAC algorithm further reduces the nonlinearity effect, quickly stabilizing the frequency and power flow. This intelligent control scheme enables power grids to reliably return to stable operating conditions under a broad spectrum of fault scenarios. The proposed framework can also be used to mitigate cascading failures by adaptively controlling critical links in a variety of networked infrastructures, such as cascades of traffic congestion on road networks or fuse failures in energy-saving systems.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Size Dynamic Scale-Free Networks: Modeling, Stationarity, and Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world scale-free networks, such as neural networks and online communication networks, consist of a fixed number of nodes but exhibit dynamic edge fluctuations. However, traditional models frequently overlook scenarios where the node count remains constant, instead prioritizing node growth. In this work, we depart from the assumptions of node number variation and preferential attachment to present an innovative model that conceptualizes node degree fluctuations as a state-dependent random walk process with stasis and variable diffusion coefficient. We show that this model yields stochastic dynamic networks with stable scale-free properties. Through comprehensive theoretical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the degree distribution converges to a power-law distribution, provided that the lowest degree state within the network is not an absorbing state. Furthermore, we investigate the resilience of the fraction of the largest component and the average shortest path length following deliberate attacks on the network. By using three real-world networks, we confirm that the proposed model accurately replicates actual data. The proposed model thus elucidates mechanisms by which networks, devoid of growth and preferential attachment features, can still exhibit power-law distributions and be used to simulate and study the resilience of attacked fixed-size scale-free networks.</description>

      <title>How far can a rumor travel without shortcuts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a rumor model in which the network is divided into three classes of agents: ignorant, spreader, and stifler. A spreader transmits the rumor to each of its ignorant neighbors at rate one, and at the same rate, it becomes a stifler after interacting with other spreaders or stiflers. The overall process is described by a continuous-time Markov chain that represents the state of each node at any given time. The underlying network is a ring lattice with $n$ nodes, where each node is connected to its $2k$ nearest neighbors. This structure has often been used as the foundation for small-world network models, which are typically generated by rewiring or adding edges to introduce shortcuts. It is well known that when a rumor process takes place on such modified networks, the system undergoes a transition between localization and propagation at a finite mean degree. This transition illustrates the strong influence of shortcuts on the spreading of information. In this work, we adopt a complementary perspective by focusing on the rumor process within the pure ring lattice, without adding any shortcuts. Our aim is to show that even in this simplified setting, the model can exhibit behavior regarding the proportion of nodes reached by the rumor that is comparable to what is observed in homogeneously mixed populations. To this end, we identify the value of $k$ as a function of $n$ for which this behavior emerges and demonstrate that it scales as $\log n$. Our conclusions are drawn from the analysis of contrasting examples and from a broader examination of the general case through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Mapping Responsibility Attribution in the Grenfell Tower Inquiry: A Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After major disasters, formal inquiries become arenas where responsibility is publicly contested. While extensive research has examined blame attribution through qualitative and actor-centred approaches, the relational structure of blame within formal accountability processes remains poorly understood. Using evidence from the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, this study analyses the web of blame presented during the Phase 2 closing proceedings, in which Counsel to the Inquiry synthesised how core participants publicly attributed responsibility to one another.
  We represent this synthesis as a directed network and examine its structural properties using standard tools from network analysis. The resulting configuration is interconnected, with pronounced reciprocity and local clustering, indicating that responsibility claims were articulated within a dense institutional environment rather than as isolated, one-to-one accusations. Comparisons with neutral benchmark models show that several observed features depart from expectations based on simple structural constraints alone, revealing patterned organisation in the public articulation of blame within the Inquiry.
  By applying network-analytic methods to an institutionalised representation of blame attribution, this study provides a systematic structural account of responsibility relations in a major public inquiry. The findings contribute to research on crisis governance and blame avoidance by demonstrating how accountability processes generate patterned distributions of responsibility that reflect institutional arrangements and governance contexts.</description>
