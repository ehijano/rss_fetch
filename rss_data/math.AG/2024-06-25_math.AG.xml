      <title>Infinitesimal invariants of mixed Hodge structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of infinitesimal variations of mixed Hodge structures and invariants associated to them. We describe these invariants in the case of a pair $(X,Y)$ with $X$ a Fano 3-fold and $Y$ a smooth anticanonical K3 surface and in more detail in the case when $X$ is a cubic threefold. In this last setting, we obtain a generic global Torelli theorem for pairs.</description>

      <title>A New Algorithm for Whitney Stratification of Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a new algorithm to compute Whitney stratifications of real and complex algebraic varieties. This algorithm is a modification of the algorithm of Helmer and Nanda (HN), but is made more efficient by using techniques for equidimensional decomposition rather than computing the set of associated primes of a polynomial ideal at a key step in the HN algorithm. We note that this modified algorithm may fail to produce a minimal Whitney stratification even when the HN algorithm would produce a minimal stratification. We, additionally, present an algorithm to coarsen any Whitney stratification of a complex variety to a minimal Whitney stratification; the theoretical basis for our approach is a classical result of Teissier.</description>

      <title>Algebras Associated to Inverse Systems of Projective Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artin, Tate and Van den Bergh initiated the field of noncommutative projective algebraic geometry by fruitfully studying geometric data associated to noncommutative graded algebras. More specifically, given a field $\mathbb K$ and a graded $\mathbb K$-algebra $A$, they defined an inverse system of projective schemes $\Upsilon_A = \{{\Upsilon_d(A)}\}$. This system affords an algebra, $\mathbf B(\Upsilon_A)$, built out of global sections, and a $\mathbb K$-algebra morphism $\tau: A \to \mathbf B(\Upsilon_A)$. We study and extend this construction. We define, for any natural number $n$, a category ${\tt PSys}^n$ of projective systems of schemes and a contravariant functor $\mathbf B$ from ${\tt PSys}^n$ to the category of associative $\mathbb K$-algebras. We realize the schemes ${\Upsilon_d(A)}$ as ${\rm Proj \ } {\mathbf U}_d(A)$, where ${\mathbf U}_d$ is a functor from associative algebras to commutative algebras. We characterize when the morphism $\tau: A \to \mathbf B(\Upsilon_A)$ is injective or surjective in terms of local cohomology modules of the ${\mathbf U}_d(A)$. Motivated by work of Walton, when $\Upsilon_A$ consists of well-behaved schemes, we prove a geometric result that computes the Hilbert series of $\mathbf B(\Upsilon_A)$. We provide many detailed examples that illustrate our results. For example, we prove that for some non-AS-regular algebras constructed as twisted tensor products of polynomial rings, $\tau$ is surjective or an isomorphism.</description>

      <title>On the exponential algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The set of roots of any finite system of exponential sums in the space $\mathbb{C}^n$ is called an exponential variety. We define the intersection index of varieties of complementary dimensions, and the ring of classes of numerical equivalence of exponential varieties with operations "addition-union" and "multiplication-intersection". This ring is analogous to the ring of conditions of the torus $(\mathbb{C}\setminus 0)^n$ and is called the ring of conditions of $\mathbb{C}^n$. We provide its description in terms of convex geometry. Namely we associate an exponential variety with an element of a certain ring generated by convex polyhedra in $\mathbb{C}^n$. We call this element the Newtonization of the exponential variety. For example, the Newtonization of an exponential hypersurface is its Newton polyhedron. The Newtonization map defines an isomorphism of the ring of conditions to the ring generated by convex polyhedra in $\mathbb{C}^n$. It follows, in particular, that the intersection index of $n$ exponential hypersurfaces is equal to the mixed pseudo-volume of their Newton polyhedra.</description>

      <title>Spinor-Helicity Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spinor-helicity formalism in particle physics gives rise to natural subvarieties in the product of two Grassmannians. These include two-step flag varieties for subspaces of complementary dimension. Taking Hadamard products leads to Mandelstam varieties. We study these varieties through the lens of combinatorics and commutative algebra, and we explore their tropicalization, positive geometry, and scattering correspondence.</description>

      <title>Tropical curves of unibranch points and hypertangency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study integral plane curves meeting at a single unibranch point and show that such curves must satisfy two equivalent conditions. A numeric condition: the local invariants of the curves at the contact point must be arithmetically related. A geometric condition: the tropical curves that we associate to the contact point must be isomorphic. Moreover, we prove closed formulas for the delta-invariant of a unibranch singularity, and for the dimension of the loci of curves with an assigned unibranch point. Our work is motivated by interest in the Lang exceptional set.</description>

      <title>Higher Gaussian maps on the hyperelliptic locus and second fundamental form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study higher even Gaussian maps of the canonical bundle on hyperelliptic curves and we determine their rank, giving explicit descriptions of their kernels. Then we use this descriptions to investigate the hyperelliptic Torelli map $j_h$ and its second fundamental form. We study isotropic subspaces of the tangent space $T_{{\mathcal H}_g, [C]}$ to the moduli space ${\mathcal H}_g$ of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ at a point $[C]$, with respect to the second fundamental form $\rho_{HE}$ of $j_h$. In particular, for any Weierstrass point $p \in C$, we construct a subspace $V_p$ of dimension $\lfloor\frac{g}{2} \rfloor$ of $T_{{\mathcal H}_g, [C]}$ generated by higher Schiffer variations at $p$, such that the only isotropic tangent direction $\zeta \in V_p$ for the image of $\rho_{HE}$ is the standard Schiffer variation $\xi_p$ at the Weierstrass point $p \in C$.</description>

      <title>Semiorthogonal decompositions of projective spaces from small quantum cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent article Halpern-Leistner defines the notion of quasi--convergent path in the space of Bridgeland stability conditions. Such a path induces a semiorthogonal decomposition of the derived category. We investigate quasi-convergent paths in the stability manifold of projective spaces and answer positively to two questions posed by Halpern-Leistner. We construct quasi-convergent paths that start from the geometric region of the stability space and whose central charge is given by a fundamental solution of the quantum differential equation. We also construct quasi-convergent paths whose central charges are the quantum cohomology central charges defined by Iritani.</description>

      <title>The Laplace Transform and Quantum Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Laplace transform that maps the topological recursion (TR) wavefunction to its $x$-$y$ swap dual is defined. This transform is then applied to the construction of quantum curves. General results are obtained, including a formula for the quantisation of many spectral curves of the form $e^xP_2(e^y) - P_1(e^y) = 0$ where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are coprime polynomials; an important class that contains interesting spectral curves related to mirror symmetry and knot theory that have, heretofore, evaded the general TR-based methods previously used to derive quantum curves. As an application, the quantum spectral curve for the Gromov-Witten theory of the complex projective line is derived directly from the theory of TR. The results seem to suggest a link between the topological recursion and the Gromov-Witten invariants of the weighted complex projective line $\mathbb{P}[r]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Albanese varieties provide a standard tool in algebraic geometry for converting questions about varieties in general, to questions about Abelian varieties. A result of Serre provides the existence of an Albanese variety for any geometrically connected and geometrically reduced scheme of finite type over a field, and a result of Grothendieck--Conrad establishes that Albanese varieties are stable under base change of field provided the scheme is, in addition, proper. A result of Raynaud shows that base change can fail for Albanese varieties without this properness hypothesis. In this paper we show that Albanese varieties of geometrically connected and geometrically reduced schemes of finite type over a field are stable under separable field extensions. We also show that the failure of base change in general is explained by the L/K-image for purely inseparable extensions L/K.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we generalize the theory of multiplicative $G$-Higgs bundles over a curve to pairs $(G,\theta)$, where $G$ is a reductive algebraic group and $\theta$ is an involution of $G$. This generalization involves the notion of a multiplicative Higgs bundle taking values in a symmetric variety associated to $\theta$, or in an equivariant embedding of it. We also study how these objects appear as fixed points of involutions of the moduli space of multiplicative $G$-Higgs bundles, induced by the involution $\theta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01715v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wonderful compactifications of adjoint reductive groups over an algebraically closed field play an important role in algebraic geometry and representation theory. In this paper, we construct an equivariant compactification for adjoint reductive groups over arbitrary base schemes. Our compactifications parameterize classical wonderful compactifications of De Concini and Procesi as geometric fibers. Our construction is based on a variant of the Artin-Weil method of birational group laws. In particular, our construction gives a new intrinsic construction of wonderful compactifications. The Picard group scheme of our compactifications is computed. We also discuss several applications of our compactification in the study of torsors under reductive group schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the relative Lipschitz saturation of complex algebraic varieties. More precisely, we investigate the concept of Lipschitz saturation of a variety in another, and we focus on the case where the dominant morphism between the two varieties is not necessarily finite. In particular, we answer, in the case of algebraic varieties, an open question of Pham and Teissier concerning the finiteness of the Lipschitz saturation of general algebras. Finally, we use the Lipschitz saturation to provide algebraic criteria for two algebraic varieties to be linked by an algebraic morphism, which is a locally biLipschitz homeomorphism on the closed points of the variety.</description>

Abstract: Famous work of Bridgeland and Smith shows that certain moduli spaces of quadratic differentials are isomorphic to spaces of stability conditions on particular 3-Calabi-Yau triangulated categories. This result has subsequently been generalised and extended by several authors. One facet of this correspondence is that finite-length trajectories of the quadratic differential are related to categories of semistable objects of the corresponding stability condition, which have associated Donaldson-Thomas invariants. On the other hand, computations in the physics literature suggest certain values of these invariants according to the type of trajectory. In this paper, we show that the category recently constructed by Christ, Haiden, and Qiu gives Donaldson-Thomas invariants which agree with the predictions from physics; in particular, degenerate ring domains of the quadratic differential give rise to non-zero Donaldson-Thomas invariants. In calculating all of the invariants, we obtain a novel application of string and band techniques from representation theory.</description>

      <title>Leading terms of generalized Pl\"ucker formulas</title>

Abstract: Generalized Pl\"ucker numbers are defined to count certain types of tangent lines of generic degree $d$ complex projective hypersurfaces. They can be computed by identifying them as coefficients of GL(2)-equivariant cohomology classes of certain invariant subspaces, the so-called coincident root strata, of the vector space of homogeneous degree $d$ complex polynomials in two variables. In an earlier paper L\'aszl\'o M. Feh\'er and the author gave a new, recursive method for calculating these classes. Using this method, we showed that -- similarly to the classical Pl\"ucker formulas counting the bitangents and flex lines of a degree $d$ plane curve -- generalized Pl\"ucker numbers are polynomials in the degree $d$.
  In this paper, by further analyzing our recursive formula, we determine the leading terms of all the generalized Pl\"ucker formulas.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a smooth projective surface of degree $d$ in $\mathbb P^3$ contains at most $d^2(d^2-3d+3)$ lines. We characterize the surfaces containing exactly $d^2(d^2-3d+3)$ lines: these occur only in prime characterize $p$ and, up to choice of projective coordinates, are cut out by equations of the form $x^{p^{e}+1}+y^{p^{e}+1}+z^{p^{e}+1}+ w^{p^{e}+1} = 0.$</description>

Abstract: We develop a unified approach for identifying spaces of stability conditions of triangulated categories arising from weighted marked surfaces with moduli spaces of quadratic differentials. This approach is based on the notion of a perverse schober (perverse sheaf of triangulated categories) and their triangulated categories of global sections. Under suitable conditions on the perverse schober, we identify mixed-angulations and their flips with finite-length hearts and their tilts, which then leads to the identification of moduli spaces. As an application we obtain a generalization of the results of Bridgeland--Smith to quadratic differentials with arbitrary singularity type (zero/pole/exponential).</description>

      <title>On symmetry adapted bases in trigonometric optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of computing the global minimum of a trigonometric polynomial is computationally hard. We address this problem for the case, where the polynomial is invariant under the exponential action of a finite group. The strategy is to follow an established relaxation strategy in order to obtain a converging hierarchy of lower bounds. Those bounds are obtained by numerically solving semi-definite programs (SDPs) on the cone of positive semi-definite Hermitian Toeplitz matrices, which is outlined in the book of Dumitrescu [Dum07]. To exploit the invariance, we show that the group has an induced action on the Toeplitz matrices and prove that the feasible region of the SDP can be restricted to the invariant matrices, whilst retaining the same solution. Then we construct a symmetry adapted basis tailored to this group action, which allows us to block-diagonalize invariant matrices and thus reduce the computational complexity to solve the SDP.
  The approach is in its generality novel for trigonometric optimization and complements the one that was proposed as a poster at the ISSAC 2022 conference [HMMR22] and later extended to [HMMR24]. In the previous work, we first used the invariance of the trigonometric polynomial to obtain a classical polynomial optimization problem on the orbit space and subsequently relaxed the problem to an SDP. Now, we first make the relaxation and then exploit invariance.
  Partial results of this article have been presented as a poster at the ISSAC 2023 conference [Met23].</description>

      <title>Tetrahedron Instantons on Orbifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a homomorphism $\tau$ from a suitable finite group $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ to $\mathsf{SU}(4)$ with image $\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$, we construct a cohomological gauge theory on a noncommutative resolution of the quotient singularity $\mathbb{C}^4/\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$ whose BRST fixed points are $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-invariant tetrahedron instantons on a generally non-effective orbifold. The partition function computes the expectation values of complex codimension one defect operators in rank $r$ cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory on a flat gerbe over the quotient stack $[\mathbb{C}^4/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau]$. We describe the generalized ADHM parametrization of the tetrahedron instanton moduli space, and evaluate the orbifold partition functions through virtual torus localization. If $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is an abelian group the partition function is expressed as a combinatorial series over arrays of $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-coloured plane partitions, while if $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is non-abelian the partition function localizes onto a sum over torus-invariant connected components of the moduli space labelled by lower-dimensional partitions. When $\mathsf{\Gamma}=\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a finite abelian subgroup of $\mathsf{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, we exhibit the reduction of Donaldson-Thomas theory on the toric Calabi-Yau four-orbifold $\mathbb{C}^2/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}\times\mathbb{C}^2$ to the cohomological field theory of tetrahedron instantons, from which we express the partition function as a closed infinite product formula. We also use the crepant resolution correpondence to derive a closed formula for the partition function on any polyhedral singularity.</description>

      <title>Deformation Families of Quasi-Projective Varieties and Symmetric Projective K3 Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to construct a deformation family of symmetric projective K3 surfaces through a deformation family of quasi-projective varieties together with construction of symmetric Kahler metrics on symmetric projective K3 surfaces. Firstly, if the normal bundle satisfies the Diophantine condition, the tubular neighborhood of an elliptic curve embedded in $\text{CP}^2 \text{$\#$9} \overline{\text{CP}}^2$ can be identified through the toroidal group. Secondly, with ample line bundles fixed on $\text{CP}^2 \text{$\#$9} \overline{\text{CP}}^2$, complete Kahler metrics are constructed on the quasi-projective variety from $\text{CP}^2 \text{$\#$9} \overline{\text{CP}}^2$. Finally, a deformation family of symmetric projective K3 surfaces over a 10-dimensional complex manifold is constructed through a smooth compactifiable deformation of complete quasi-projective varieties from $\text{CP}^2 \text{$\#$9} \overline{\text{CP}}^2$ over a 9-dimensional complex manifold and an analogue deformation family.</description>
