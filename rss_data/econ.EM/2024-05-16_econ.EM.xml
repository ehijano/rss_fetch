      <title>Comprehensive Causal Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncovering causal effects at various levels of granularity provides substantial value to decision makers. Comprehensive machine learning approaches to causal effect estimation allow to use a single causal machine learning approach for estimation and inference of causal mean effects for all levels of granularity. Focusing on selection-on-observables, this paper compares three such approaches, the modified causal forest (mcf), the generalized random forest (grf), and double machine learning (dml). It also provides proven theoretical guarantees for the mcf and compares the theoretical properties of the approaches. The findings indicate that dml-based methods excel for average treatment effects at the population level (ATE) and group level (GATE) with few groups, when selection into treatment is not too strong. However, for finer causal heterogeneity, explicitly outcome-centred forest-based approaches are superior. The mcf has three additional benefits: (i) It is the most robust estimator in cases when dml-based approaches underperform because of substantial selectivity; (ii) it is the best estimator for GATEs when the number of groups gets larger; and (iii), it is the only estimator that is internally consistent, in the sense that low-dimensional causal ATEs and GATEs are obtained as aggregates of finer-grained causal parameters.</description>

      <title>A Consistent ICM-based $\chi^2$ Specification Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spite of the omnibus property of Integrated Conditional Moment (ICM) specification tests, they are not commonly used in empirical practice owing to, e.g., the non-pivotality of the test and the high computational cost of available bootstrap schemes especially in large samples. This paper proposes specification and mean independence tests based on a class of ICM metrics termed the generalized martingale difference divergence (GMDD). The proposed tests exhibit consistency, asymptotic $\chi^2$-distribution under the null hypothesis, and computational efficiency. Moreover, they demonstrate robustness to heteroskedasticity of unknown form and can be adapted to enhance power towards specific alternatives. A power comparison with classical bootstrap-based ICM tests using Bahadur slopes is also provided. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to showcase the proposed tests' excellent size control and competitive power.</description>

      <title>The Role of Carbon Pricing in Food Inflation: Evidence from Canadian Provinces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09467v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the search for political-economic tools for greenhouse has mitigation, carbon pricing, which includes carbon tax and cap-and-trade, is praised by many governments. However, the inflating food prices in carbon-pricing countries, such as Canada, have led many to believe such policies harm food affordability. This study aims to identify changes in food prices induced by carbon pricing using the case of Canadian provinces. Using the staggered difference-in-difference (DiD) approach, we find an overall small and deflationary effect of carbon pricing on food (measured by monthly provincial food CPI). The average reductions in food CPI compared to before carbon pricing are 2% and 4% within and beyond two years of implementation. Our subsequent analyses find that the deflationary effects are partially driven by lower consumption, while farm input costs show no significant changes. Evidence from this paper suggests that the growing food prices in Canada attribute little to carbon pricing, and the food inflation argument gives little support to the growing voice against carbon pricing policies.</description>
