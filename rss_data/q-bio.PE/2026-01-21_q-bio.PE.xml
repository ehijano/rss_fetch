      <title>Integrating Household Dynamics in Stochastic Epidemic Modeling: An SDE Approach to the SIR Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding infectious disease spread remains a critical public health challenge, particularly given the interplay between household dynamics and community transmission patterns. Traditional epidemiological models often oversimplify these dynamics by treating populations as homogeneous, failing to capture crucial household-level interactions that can significantly impact disease spread. This paper introduces a new stochastic differential equation model extending the SIR framework by capturing the randomness in disease spread and incorporating household structure and heterogeneous mixing patterns. The model divides the population into groups based on age and household size, includes subpopulation-targeted lockdown parameters and constructs detailed contact matrices accounting for both public and within-household interactions.
  Through the approximation of Markov jump processes by branching processes near the disease free equilibrium, we derive the basic reproduction number of our model and conduct global sensitivity analysis using Sobol indices to identify influential factors. Our simulations reveal that incorporating household structure leads to substantially different predictions compared to traditional models, particularly in epidemic timing and peak intensity. The stochastic framework captures important variations in outbreak trajectories overlooked by deterministic approaches, especially during early and peak phases. This work contributes to both mathematical epidemiology and practical public health planning by providing a sophisticated mathematical understanding of how population structure and randomness influence disease dynamics, offering insights for intervention strategies where household transmission plays a significant role.</description>

      <title>The challenge of scale in molecular adaptation: Local searches in astronomical genotype networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of vast genotype spaces poses fundamental challenges for evolving populations. As the number of genotypes encoding viable phenotypes grows exponentially with genome length, populations can only explore a tiny fraction of these immense spaces, a fact consistently supported by empirical and theoretical evidence. Paradoxically, local, mutation-driven searches near abundant sequences allow populations to generate phenotypic improvements and functional innovations despite this immense search space. In this contribution, we integrate insights from viral evolution with theoretical expectations derived from genotype-phenotype maps to re-examine how high-dimensional sequence spaces shape evolutionary dynamics. In resolving the paradox, abundant phenotypes play a crucial role because their combinatorial weight biases evolutionary trajectories. We discuss how this bias, together with limited accessibility of fitness peaks, modifies traditional metaphors -- such as fitness landscapes -- and challenges standard notions of evolutionary optimality. Our results underscore that adaptation is predominantly local yet remarkably efficient, providing a unifying perspective on the coexistence of robustness, innovation, and constrained exploration in molecular evolution.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Modelling of Birth-Death Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological systems exhibit multiscale dynamics, where some species occur in high copy numbers while others remain rare. This heterogeneity necessitates hybrid modelling approaches: deterministic models are computationally efficient but inaccurate for low-count species, while fully stochastic simulations are accurate but prohibitively expensive. Hybrid methods like the Jump-Switch-Flow (JSF) algorithm address this by simulating low-count species stochastically and high-count species deterministically. However, selecting regime-switching thresholds to control errors for specific observables remains an open challenge. We develop a principled framework for threshold selection targeting extinction probability. We formalise JSF as a piecewise-deterministic Markov process and derive backward equations for extinction under exact and hybrid dynamics. Near extinction boundaries, complex nonlinear dynamics reduce to tractable time-inhomogeneous linear birth-death processes. This structure yields a rigorous error decomposition based on early and late excursions. Isolating the dominant error term motivates a fast, actionable heuristic. We demonstrate via Monte Carlo studies on a stochastic Lotka-Volterra model that our heuristic reliably upper-bounds empirical errors in extinction probability. This enables users to select the smallest threshold that satisfies a target error tolerance. This work paves the way for principled, efficient multiscale modelling and simulation in stochastic biological systems.</description>

      <title>Energy flow controls the stability of multitrophic ecosystems with stratified nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems with nonreciprocal interactions are often stratified into layers. Ecosystems are a prime example, where species at one trophic level grow by consuming those at another. Yet the dynamical consequences of such stratified nonreciprocity -- where the correlation between growth and consumption differs across trophic levels -- remain unexplored. Here, using an ecological model with three trophic levels, we reveal an emergent asymmetry: nonreciprocal interactions between consumers and predators (top and middle level) destabilize ecosystems far more readily than nonreciprocity between consumers and resources (middle and bottom level). We analytically derive the phase diagram for the model and show that its stability boundary is controlled by energy flow across trophic levels. Because energy flows upward -- from resources to predators -- diversity is progressively lower at higher trophic levels, which we show explains the asymmetry. Lowering energy flow efficiency flips the asymmetry toward resources and remarkably expands the stable region of the phase diagram, suggesting that the famous "10% energy transfer" seen in natural ecosystems might promote stability. More broadly, our findings show that the location of nonreciprocity within a complex network, not merely its magnitude, determines stability.</description>

      <title>Extracting useful information about reversible evolutionary processes from irreversible evolutionary accumulation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary accumulation models (EvAMs) are an emerging class of machine learning methods designed to infer the evolutionary pathways by which features are acquired. Applications include cancer evolution (accumulation of mutations), anti-microbial resistance (accumulation of drug resistances), genome evolution (organelle gene transfers), and more diverse themes in biology and beyond. Following these themes, many EvAMs assume that features are gained irreversibly -- no loss of features can occur. Reversible approaches do exist but are often computationally (much) more demanding and statistically less stable. Our goal here is to explore whether useful information about evolutionary dynamics which are in reality reversible can be obtained from modelling approaches with an assumption of irreversibility. We identify, and use simulation studies to quantify, errors involved in neglecting reversible dynamics, and show the situations in which approximate results from tractable models can be informative and reliable. In particular, EvAM inferences about the relative orderings of acquisitions, and the core dynamic structure of evolutionary pathways, are robust to reversibility in many cases, while estimations of uncertainty and feature interactions are more error-prone.</description>

      <title>Conservation priorities to prevent the next pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diseases originating from wildlife pose a significant threat to global health, causing human and economic losses each year. The transmission of disease from animals to humans occurs at the interface between humans, livestock, and wildlife reservoirs, influenced by abiotic factors and ecological mechanisms. Although evidence suggests that intact ecosystems can reduce transmission, disease prevention has largely been neglected in conservation efforts and remains underfunded compared to mitigation. A major constraint is the lack of reliable, spatially explicit information to guide efforts effectively. Given the increasing rate of new disease emergence, accelerated by climate change and biodiversity loss, identifying priority areas for mitigating the risk of disease transmission is more crucial than ever. We present new high-resolution (1 km) maps of priority areas for targeted ecological countermeasures aimed at reducing the likelihood of zoonotic spillover, along with a methodology adaptable to local contexts. Our study compiles data on well-documented risk factors, protection status, forest restoration potential, and opportunity cost of the land to map areas with high potential for cost-effective interventions. We identify low-cost priority areas across 50 countries, including 277,000 km2 where environmental restoration could mitigate the risk of zoonotic spillover and 198,000 km2 where preventing deforestation could do the same, 95% of which are not currently under protection. The resulting layers, covering tropical regions globally, are freely available alongside an interactive no-code platform that allows users to adjust parameters and identify priority areas at multiple scales. Ecological countermeasures can be a cost-effective strategy for reducing the emergence of new pathogens; however, our study highlights the extent to which current conservation efforts fall short of this goal.</description>

      <title>Menopause averted a midlife energetic crisis with help from older children and parents: A simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The grandmother hypothesis is the most influential account of the evolution of menopause in humans, but other theories warrant investigation. Here I use simulations to investigate two theories that ground the evolution of menopause in biparental care. Kaplan et al. (2010) proposed a "two-sex" learning and skill-based account, termed the Embodied Capital Model (ECM), in which the high energetic burden of caring for multiple, slow-developing offspring was met with biparental investment. Menopause evolved because the physiological costs of pregnancy and childbirth increased with age yet productivity also increased with age, and the benefits of transferring resources to adult children and their offspring eventually outweigh the benefits of continued reproduction. Kuhle (2007) proposed the "father absent" hypothesis in which the higher mortality rate of husbands would often have left wives without the resources to raise young children, selecting for early reproductive cessation in monogamous couples. Simulations of hunter-gatherer energy consumption and production across the lifespan, taking account of age- and sex-specific survivorship, interbirth intervals, and varying rates of strength and foraging skill acquisition typical of contemporary foragers, reveal a pronounced midlife energy deficit that could be averted by ceasing reproduction midlife and receiving energy transfers from both younger couples (e.g., brideservice) and from older parents (the grandmother hypothesis). Menopause emerges as an integral and strictly necessary component of the unique human pattern of relatively short interbirth intervals and a long period of juvenile dependency, supporting and extending the ECM.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effectiveness of Adult Hepatitis A Vaccination Strategies in Korea Under an Aging Susceptibility Profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hepatitis A severity increases sharply with age, while Korea is experiencing a cohort shift in which low seroprevalence adult cohorts are aging into older, higher fatality age groups. This demographic and immunological transition creates an urgent policy question regarding how adult vaccination should be prioritized under resource constraints. We evaluated three adult vaccination scenarios targeting low seroprevalence age groups (S1) 20 to 39 years, (S2) 40 to 59 years, and (S3) 20 to 59 years. Using an age structured dynamic transmission model calibrated to Korean data, we derived dynamically feasible vaccination allocation trajectories under realistic capacity constraints using an optimal control framework and linked these trajectories to long term transmission model simulations. We conducted DALY based cost effectiveness analyses over a lifetime horizon from both healthcare system and societal perspectives, and characterized uncertainty using probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and cost effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). Robustness was examined using one way sensitivity analyses. In the base case, S2 consistently yields the most favorable and robust cost effectiveness profile under both perspectives, with the lowest ICER. S3 achieved the largest reduction in DALYs but requires substantially higher incremental costs, resulting in a higher ICER than S2. S1 produces the smallest DALY reduction and is the least efficient strategy. PSA and CEACs confirm that S2 remains the preferred option across most willingness to pay ranges. S2 offers the most balanced and robustly cost effective strategy in Korea, capturing substantial mortality reduction while limiting additional program costs. S3 may be justified when higher budgets or willingness to pay thresholds are acceptable, but S2 provides the clearest value for money under epidemiological and economic conditions.</description>

      <title>Outbreak dynamics and population vulnerability in stochastic epidemic models on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During infectious disease epidemics, pathogen transmission occurs in host populations made up of interacting subpopulations. Using stochastic simulation and analytical approximations, we examine how outbreak sizes in networked populations depend on network architecture, subpopulation sizes and the strength of coupling between subpopulations. We find, as expected, that mean outbreak sizes are frequently lower in networked populations than in homogeneous populations with the same basic reproduction number. However, after an outbreak ends, a networked population is often vulnerable to further outbreaks, and the ending of an outbreak may not imply herd immunity in any sense. Another key finding is that a relatively small amount of randomly distributed prior immunity can be more protective in a networked population than a homogeneous population, a phenomenon which can be reproduced analytically in certain cases. We also find that in networked populations, randomly distributed prior immunity is often more protective than infection-acquired immunity; but this conclusion can be reversed in populations with highly variable susceptibility. All of these conclusions have implications for designing outbreak control strategies that aim to reduce pathogen transmission during epidemics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear competition avoidance favors coexistence in microbial populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteria regulate their motility through a variety of mechanisms, including quorum sensing (QS) and other density-dependent responses mediated by diffusible signals. While nonlinear density-dependent motility is well known in active-matter theory to generate nonequilibrium spatial patterns, its consequences for the coexistence of growing, interacting species remain less explored. Here we develop a minimal spatially structured model for two strongly competing species in which local demographic interactions are coupled to an escape response: each species increases its motility nonlinearly (sigmoidal) with the local abundance of its competitor. We show that this sigmoidal motility regulation promotes optimal spatial self-organization and can sustain long term coexistence via segregation, even in parameter regimes that yield competitive exclusion in well-mixed Lotka-Volterra dynamics. On two-dimensional lattices, the interplay between demographic competition and density-dependent motility generates a range of emergent patterns, including regimes in which the weaker competitor counterintuitively has higher total abundance. Overall, our results identify nonlinear, competitor-induced motility as a fundamental mechanism capable of sustaining coexistence in competing microbial populations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maintenance of diversity in complex ecological communities despite unpredictable dynamics and competitive exclusion is thought to require continual influx of new species or competitive advantages that accrue as species become rare. We examine isolated planktonic microbial communities under permanent ice cover in Antarctic lakes, recording prokaryotic abundance across 9 communities, 11 years, 30~m of depth, and thousands of species in the McMurdo LTER. We quantify rare species advantage by modeling community dynamics under frequency-dependent selection. We find persistent diversity and pervasive negative frequency dependence with limited immigration and turnover. While ecology and evolutionary sciences have long debated whether diversity is maintained selectively, we measure selection over a $10^4$-fold range of abundance in naturally coevolving communities and implicate rare species advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epidemic models play a crucial role in population dynamics, offering valuable insights into disease transmission while aiding in epidemic prediction and control. In this paper, we analyze the mathematical model of the time-fractional Zika virus transmission for human and mosquito populations. The fractional derivative is considered in the Caputo sense of order $\alpha\in(0,1).$ We begin by conducting a qualitative analysis using the stability theory of differential equations. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are established, and the model's stability is examined through Hyers-Ulam stability analysis. Furthermore, an efficient difference scheme utilizing the standard L1 technique is developed to simulate the model and analyze the solution's behavior under key parameters. The resulting nonlinear algebraic system is solved using the Newton-Raphson method. Finally, illustrative examples are presented to validate the theoretical findings. Graphical results indicate that the fractional model provides deeper insights and a better understanding of disease dynamics. These findings aid in controlling the virus through contact precautions and recommended therapies while also helping to predict its future spread.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice-based random walk models are widely used to study populations of migrating cells with motility bias and proliferation. Crowding is typically represented by volume exclusion, where each lattice site can be occupied by at most one agent and conflicting moves are aborted. This framework enables simulations that yield both population-level spatiotemporal agent density profiles and individual agent trajectories, comparable to experimental cell-tracking data. Previous continuum models for tagged-agent trajectories captured trajectory information only, and overlooked any measure of variability. This is an important limitation since trajectory data is inherently variable. To address this limitation, here we derive partial differential equations for the probability density function of tagged-agent trajectories. This continuum description has a clear physical interpretation, agrees well with distributional data from stochastic simulations, reveals the role of stochasticity in different contexts, and generalises to multiple subpopulations of distinct agents.</description>

      <title>Eco-evolutionary dynamics of a trait-structured predator-prey model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupling between evolutionary and ecological changes (eco-evolutionary dynamics) has been shown to be relevant among diverse species, and is also of interest outside of ecology, i.e. in cancer evolution. These dynamics play an important role in determining survival in response to climate change, motivating the need for mathematical models to capture this often complex interplay. Models incorporating eco-evolutionary dynamics often sacrifice analytical tractability to capture the complexity of real systems, do not explicitly consider the effect of population heterogeneity, or focus on long-term behaviour. In order to capture population heterogeneity, both transient, and long-term dynamics, while retaining tractability, we generalise a moment-based method applicable in the regime of small segregational variance to the case of time-dependent mortality and birth. These results are applied to a predator-prey model, where ecological parameters such as the contact rate between species are trait-structured. The trait-distribution of the prey species is shown to be approximately Gaussian with constant variance centered on the mean trait, which is asymptotically governed by an autonomous ODE. In this way, we make explicit the impact of eco-evolutionary dynamics on the transient behaviour and long-term fate of the prey species.</description>

Abstract: This article introduces a computational method, called "Recapture of Diffusive Agents &amp; Particle Swarm Optimization" (RDA-PSO), designed to estimate the dispersal parameter of diffusive insects in mark-release-recapture (MRR) field experiments. In addition to describing the method, its properties are discussed, with particular focus on robustness in estimating the observed diffusion coefficient in the presence of uncertainty. It is shown that RDA-PSO provides a simple and reliable approach to quantify insect dispersal that can handle low recapture rates and uneven capture site distributions without the need for area corrections. Tests on synthetic data, for which the actual diffusion coefficient is known, show the method outperforms three techniques based on the solution of the diffusion equation, which are also introduced in this work. Examples of application to real field data for the yellow fever mosquito are provided.</description>
